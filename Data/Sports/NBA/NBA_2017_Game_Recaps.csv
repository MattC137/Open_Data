"SHANGHAI -- James Harden had 26 points and 15 assists and Eric Gordon went 5 for 10 from three-point range to help lead the Houston Rockets to a 123-117 win over the New Orleans Pelicans in a preseason exhibition game in Shanghai, China on Sunday night. E'Twaun Moore led the scoring for the Pelicans with 25 and netted all four of his three point attempts, while Anthony Davis added another 23 points. The score was close for much of the game, with Houston leading 68-65 at halftime. Harden, who is developing a devoted following in China, also went 11 for 12 from the free throw line and racked up seven rebounds. Gordon added another 24 points, while the Pelicans' center Omer Asik led both teams in rebounds with 14. — Donovan Mitchell had 23 points, seven rebounds and six assists as the Utah Jazz routed the Golden State Warriors 127-108 on Saturday night for their eighth straight victory. Jae Crowder gets the ball in the final seconds of overtime and connects on a 3-pointer to extend the game.","400899171"
"BEIJING --  James Harden is quickly getting comfortable running his new coach's offense. Harden had 14 points and 8 assists in 24 minutes, leading the Houston Rockets to a 116-104 win over the New Orleans Pelicans in a preseason game Wednesday. The Rockets beat the Pelicans twice in China behind Harden's passing. He collected 15 assists in Sunday's game in Shanghai. In Beijing, Harden greeted the crowd before the game with ""Nin hao!"" -- Chinese for ""hello!"" -- and looked at ease the rest of the game as the focal point of new coach Mike D'Antoni's system. ""Very comfortable,"" he told reporters afterward. ""My role really doesn't change. Just got the ball in my hands a little bit more."" Houston built a 17-point lead after the first quarter and never relinquished it, though the Pelicans closed to within eight points in the fourth quarter. The Pelicans played most of the game without star Anthony Davis, who suffered what the team called a right ankle sprain in the first quarter. Davis fell to the court holding his ankle after appearing to trip while attempting to drive to the basket against Houston's Nene. After a timeout, he returned to the game briefly before heading to the locker room. Pelicans guard E'Twaun Moore also left the game in the first half with a right heel contusion. Ryan Anderson had 11 points and 7 rebounds and Sam Dekker came off the bench to score 14 points for the Rockets. Montrezl Harrell scored 11 points, blocked two shots and made a 3-pointer from the corner in front of the Pelicans' bench, after which he turned backward and smiled as he jogged back. Harrell missed his only three-point attempt during his rookie season but shot more threes during Summer League play this year. The Pelicans, meanwhile, missed several shots near the basket and made just 7 of 24 three-pointers. Four players scored in double figures off the bench: Quinn Cook had 20, Langston Galloway had 16 and Dante Cunningham and Cheick Diallo each had 12. Cook added eight assists in 21 minutes. ""You could see it in practice,"" Lance Stephenson said of Cook, who went undrafted last year out of Duke. ""He took what he was doing in practice and turned it into the game."" TIP-INS Two of China's basketball luminaries got loud ovations: retired Rockets center Yao Ming, recently inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, and Stephon Marbury, the ex-NBA player who has gone onto stardom in the Chinese Basketball Association. Also sitting courtside were Hall of Famers Gary Payton, whose son Gary II had 1 point in 18 minutes for the Rockets, and Dikembe Mutombo, who was shown on the arena screens shaking his head and performing his signature finger wag. SILVER SPEAKS NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said before the game that he will resume discussions on the collective bargaining agreement soon after he returns from China, with two months left before a crucial deadline. Silver said he planned to hold meetings next week in an ongoing process that will eventually include several team owners, National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts and Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul, the players' association president. Silver described all sides as ""very engaged and eager to get a deal done.""","400899172"

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  There is no question Kristaps Porzingis is more comfortable playing power forward, where he can take advantage of his superior shooting ability. But the Knicks' skilled 7-foot-3 big man has no problem playing in the post. He certainly looked fine there Wednesday night, scoring 20 points and grabbing nine rebounds to lead New York to a 101-90 victory over the Orlando Magic. Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek elected to go with a smaller unit that included Porzingis at center and four wing players around him to match Orlando's quicker lineup. It allowed Porzingis to take advantage of mismatches all night. ""Playing at the (center), a lot of times I have more space,"" said Porzingis, who was just 2 for 7 from 3-point range but created issues for Orlando in the post. ""When I shoot 3-pointers, bigs have a tendency to come and try to protect the rim and that's when I can get my 3s. Tonight they weren't falling, but that's something that is going to be there."" Porzingis, who missed the previous two games with a sprained ankle, made it a long night for the Magic. They couldn't stop him with 7-foot Nikola Vucevic attempting to step out on the perimeter, and 6-9 Jeff Green had no chance when Porzingis rolled to the basket. ""His length, his ability to shoot the ball (was a key),"" said Hornacek, whose team improved to 25-36. ""I thought we were able to spread it out a little bit more."" That opened up opportunities for Derrick Rose to slash to the basket, reminiscent of his old self. Rose finished with 19 points, while Carmelo Anthony added 17 and Justin Holiday came off the bench to contribute 14. But as efficient as the Knicks were on offense, their defense was even better. Playing their smaller lineup, they were able match up well against Orlando all night. The Magic's offense had little rhythm as they often hurried shots instead of passing the ball to find an open man. Orlando had just 11 assists and scored only 39 points in the second half as a nine-point game at halftime turned into a blowout. Evan Fournier finished with 22 points to lead five players in double figures for Orlando. Terrence Ross scored just six while shooting 3 of 10 from the field, including 0 for 5 from 3-point range. ""I don't think we played hard enough offensively,"" said Orlando coach Frank Vogel, whose team dropped to 22-39. ""I thought we played harder on the defensive end. We're trying to be a running team and we didn't really commit to that."" A big reason the Magic couldn't commit to running is because they were slowed by the Knicks. Orlando shot just 41 percent from the field. ""We only shot 42 percent and we were still able to win the game,"" Hornacek said. ""Our defense against Toronto was good, but it was a ton better tonight. We're really picking up defensively."" TIP-INS Knicks: C Willy Hernangomez did not play after injuring his ankle Monday against Toronto. ... New York outrebounded Orlando 50-43. Magic: Vucevic left late in the fourth quarter with an apparent right knee injury. ... Point guard C.J. Watson missed his third straight game with a sore Achilles. He last played Feb. 15 against San Antonio. ... The Magic fell to 10-20 at home. ... Orlando has not won back-to-back games since defeating the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 23 and Memphis on Dec. 26. GUARDS ON THE BOARDS A big reason for the Knicks' advantage on the glass was their guards. Courtney Lee had four rebounds and Rose grabbed seven. ""We want our guards to get four or five rebounds every game,"" Hornacek said. ""There are a lot of balls you don't have to go sky and get them.""","400899364"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker had no nice way to describe the Charlotte Hornets' 97-87 victory over the Dallas Mavericks. ""That was pretty ugly,"" Walker said, before quickly adding that the Hornets will take the wins any way they can get them. Walker scored 18 points, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added 14 and the Hornets got their third win in the last four games Thursday night to remain in first place in the Southeast Division. The Mavericks slowed the tempo of the game, but the Hornets didn't get frustrated and never trailed. ""At the end of the day, it shows toughness,"" Walker said. ""It shows that we can withstand games. They really slowed it down tonight. But we really stayed with the game and won. ... That's what you have to do on some nights."" Walker was just 7 of 19 from the field and Charlotte again struggled from the foul line at home. However, the Hornets got a big boost from their bench, which combined for 46 points on 25 shots, led by Jeremy Lamb, who had 12 points. ""That was a hard game to play,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""It wasn't a conventional tempo for a NBA game to be played. It was slower. They really execute and they really changed their defenses. The tempo of a NBA game usually lets you get into a rhythm. But there was no way they would let us get into a rhythm. Bottom line is that's a game that good teams win."" Harrison Barnes scored 17 points and Justin Anderson added 15 for the Mavericks (3-15), who have lost 10 of their last 11 games. The Hornets led by two when Walker drained a long 3-pointer to beat the shot clock with 3:51 to give his team the spark it needed. Lamb followed with a driving layup that resulted in a three-point play to push the lead to 86-78. The Mavs would battle back behind Barnes to cut the lead to three, but Lamb hit two free throws and Walker buried a 3-pointer from the right wing with 41 seconds left to put the game out of reach. TIP-INS Mavericks: Deron Williams did not play down the stretch in the fourth quarter because he was on a minutes restriction on the second night of a back-to-back. ... Dwight Powell fouled out with 1:18 left. Hornets: Nic Batum, who received a $120 million contract this offseason, has struggled some with turnovers this season. He entered averaging 2.3 per game and had three in the first half. ... The Hornets were 22 of 31 from the foul line and shot 28 percent from 3-point range. GIANTS WRESTLING For the most part it was a subdued, lackluster game until the middle of the fourth quarter, when Mavericks center Salah Mejri grabbed the ball after it went out of bounds and cradled it in his arms until Charlotte's Roy Hibbert inexplicably attempted to rip it out. In a bizarre sight, the two 7-footers started wrestling for the ball well after the whistle had blown ending the play. They finally tumbled to the floor together, sending long arms and legs flying in every direction. Several players were seen trying to keep themselves from laughing at the spectacle after the play, which resulted in Hibbert getting a technical foul. STRUGGLING FROM 3 Dallas' Wesley Matthews was upset with himself after the game for making just 1 of 11 3-point shots. ""If I shoot halfway decent, you give me those looks, and it's a different game,"" Matthews said. ECLECTIC SITUATION Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said his team is in an ""eclectic situation"" right now. ""We've got to get these guys healthy,"" Carlisle said. ""We've got to do it the right way. In the meantime, other guys are getting valuable experience. We're playing some guys in some different positions and finding out some different things. We just have to keep up the fight. If we do that, things will come around."" DEFENSE WINS The Hornets improved to 8-0 in games in which they've limited their opponent to fewer than 100 points.","400899365"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  C.J. Miles is still growing into his role as a member of the Indiana Pacers' starting unit. Each possession, each game is a step in the process. The shooting guard took a major leap Wednesday night when he bounced back from a rough start to score 14 of his team-high 16 points after halftime and lead the Pacers over Orlando 98-88. Plagued by foul trouble in the first half, Miles converted 4 of 5 3-pointers during the final two quarters to help the Pacers extend their winning streak to four. Miles was inserted into the starting lineup ahead of Glenn Robinson III five games ago. ""I wouldn't say more comfortable,"" Miles said. ""I just feel like I've been able to add to that group what the coaching staff moved me for. They needed more space, not that (Robinson) isn't a threat."" Miles knocked down timely 3-pointers in the second half to keep the Magic from making a comeback after several threats. His 3-pointer with 1:37 to play effectively sealed the win for the Pacers after Orlando had moved within 93-88 on two free throws by Nikola Vucevic. His ability to knock down 3-pointers opened up the floor for power forward Thaddeus Young to do damage with mid-range jumpers and for point guard Jeff Teague to cause problems on the interior driving the ball to the basket. ""C.J. got in some foul trouble early, didn't drop his head, missed most of the first half,"" said Pacers coach Nate McMillan, whose team won consecutive road games for the first time this season. ""He was able to knock down some shots and get a rhythm coming in in the second half."" The win was significant because it came on a night when star player Paul George was off his game. After scoring 30 or more points in each of the Pacers last four games, George had just eight points (one point in the second half), while shooting just 3 of 14 from field and committing five turnovers. The Pacers got big contributions from a variety of places to offset George's off night. Robinson came off the bench to score 14 points, while Young had 12 points and Teague added 13 points and nine assists. ""It's great for them to have my back, for them to take the load of me,"" George said. The Magic dropped their fifth game in their last six outing and fell to 8-16 at home. Orlando was led by Serge Ibaka's 20 points. It shot just 40 percent from the field while Indiana converted 48 percent from the floor and 45 percent from 3-point range. ""We don't have a large margin for error,"" said Magic coach Frank Vogel, who has now lost to his former Indiana team by double digits three-straight times this season. ""Sometimes it's turnovers, sometimes it's poor defense, sometimes it's moving the basketball, getting a lot of good looks that we're not able to knock down."" TIP-INS Pacers: Rodney Stuckey returned to the lineup Wednesday after missing the previous 15 games with a hamstring injury. ... Indiana finished the month of January with a 9-4 record, which was the fifth highest in the NBA during the month. Magic: Starting guard Evan Fournier returned to the starting lineup for the first time in nine games. He missed eight games with a foot injury and returned to the floor during Monday night's loss at Minnesota. Watson returned to coming off the bench. ... Orlando went 4-12 during January.","400899366"
"NEW YORK --  The Greek Freak put on a show in Brooklyn. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 23 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, Jabari Parker scored 22 points and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Nets 111-93 on Thursday night. ""You have special players that we come across, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""You've got different players that are rare and I think Giannis is one of those rare birds that we'll be able to enjoy for a long time."" Malcolm Brogdon and Tony Snell each added 13 points for the Bucks, who followed their impressive victory over Cleveland with their third straight win. Brook Lopez scored 15 points, Sean Kilpatrick had 14 and Bojan Bogdanovic added 13 for the Nets, who outlasted the Los Angeles Clippers in overtime on Tuesday and were trying to win consecutive games for the first time this season. ""If you're going to come out flat, that's how it's going to happen, especially in the NBA,"" Kilpatrick said. ""That's all the stuff that happens, especially if you come out flat and you're not playing with no type of energy. Once a team sees that, it's like being in the ocean and you're bleeding. A whole bunch of sharks keep jumping on you if they see that."" The Bucks continued their dominance of the Nets since Kidd left Brooklyn for the Milwaukee coaching job. Milwaukee led by one in the third quarter when the Bucks went on a 14-2 run to go up 77-64. Milwaukee took a 90-78 lead into the fourth quarter, led by Antetokounmpo's 11 points in the third, and never looked back. ""I think we got the ball moving, but it all starts with our defense,"" Kidd said. ""We got stops and got out into the open court. We started to share the ball. I thought the ball moved a lot better in that second half."" Antetokounmpo sat out the entire fourth quarter and missed a chance at a triple-double with Milwaukee hosting Brooklyn on Saturday. ""It's a long season,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It doesn't matter for me. The only thing that matters to me is getting the win. We play them in two days so I think (Kidd) made a good decision sitting me in the fourth quarter because we've got to get the win in two days. It's a must-win game again."" For Brooklyn, the third quarter woes continue. ""At the end of the day it's going to continue being that way if we don't play hard enough and if guys don't come out with the right energy,"" Kilpatrick said. TIP-INS Bucks: Kidd believes Antetokounmpo is just beginning to show his potential. ""He's only 21 years old,"" Kidd said. ""That's the most underrated thing about him. He's 21 years old doing a lot of things that a lot of us can't do. I think that's special and I think that is overlooked a lot of times."" ... Steve Novak and Khris Middleton were inactive. Nets: Coach Kenny Atkinson said the team is going to ""build up"" Rondae Hollis-Jefferson's minutes after an ankle injury. ... Jeremy Lin (strained left hamstring) and Caris LeVert (left foot rehab) were inactive. SPEAKING THE TRUTH Two days after Paul Pierce played his final game in Brooklyn, Kidd was asked how would remember a long-time adversary and later a player he coached. ""I think he's a true pro, a true warrior and a champion,"" Kidd said. ""Being able to coach him, to see his work ethic at a very high level. (He) respects the game and is a true vet. As a player who's played against him, he is not afraid of having the ball late in the game. He always wanted to deliver that winning shot."" COURTSIDE CELEBRITIES Former President Bill Clinton was courtside with Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry. New York Giants safety Landon Collins and running back Bobby Rainey were also on hand at Barclays Center.","400899367"
"LOS ANGELES --  Comfortable leads have been shrinking lately for the Los Angeles Clippers. It happened again Saturday against the lowly Lakers. Only after the Clippers inserted all of their starters in the fourth quarter did they finish off a 115-104 victory, the 800th of Doc Rivers' coaching career. Rivers sees the problem, yet professes no concern with the playoffs looming. ""I like this team and I'm going to keep saying that,"" he said. ""I think we have proven, especially in the big games, when we're healthy, we play very well."" Blake Griffin scored 36 points, Chris Paul added 29 and J.J. Redick had 19 for the Clippers, who moved within a game of the idle Jazz for the No. 4 playoff seed in the West. The Clippers have won three in a row and seven of nine. ""Our key is going to be in the last six minutes of the game,"" Rivers said. ""We're going to have to execute offensively. We're going to have to be a team that when we need a stop, we can get a stop. There's times that we can do that and then there's times I'm not sure we can."" The Clippers have had little trouble stopping the Lakers, taking three of four in the season series. They've won 18 of 20 from their Staples Center co-tenant since the start of the 2012-13 season. ""The last few years have been the worst in the Lakers' history and that's not OK,"" rookie coach Luke Walton said before the game. Rookie David Nwaba scored 19 points and Brandon Ingram had 10 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter for the Lakers. They have lost 18 of 20 since the All-Star break. D'Angelo Russell, the team's leading scorer at 15.7 points, had two points on 1-of-9 shooting while missing six 3-point attempts. ""They definitely came out with energy. They were hot and our defense wasn't clicking,"" Russell said. ""I tried to stay effective despite my shots not falling."" The Clippers' bench allowed the Lakers to hang around in the fourth when they trailed by 21 at the start. Tarik Black's dunk cut the Lakers' deficit to eight with 2:52 to play. But Griffin and Paul combined to score the Clippers' final seven points. The duo notched its third straight game with at least 26 points apiece. ""It's not about the second unit, it is about us as a team figuring it out,"" Paul said. ""We still have time, not much time, but we have time to figure it out and we have to do it."" The Clippers dominated the third, turning a five-point lead into a 21-point advantage. They opened on a 24-9 run, including 10 by Paul that extended their lead to 79-59. Griffin and Redick added back-to-back 3-pointers and Paul scored four in a row to send the Clippers into the fourth leading 93-72. Paul had 12 assists and made all 10 of his free throws, and DeAndre Jordan grabbed 12 rebounds. Griffin made a career-high four 3-pointers. The Clippers opened the game by scoring 17 straight points, making 7 of 9 field goals. The Lakers missed their first nine shots before going on an 18-2 run to close within one. TIP-INS Lakers: They have used 23 different starting lineups this season with no player starting every game. ... G Jordan Clarkson is the only player to appear in every game. ... Ingram returned after missing three games with right patellar tendinitis. ""I thought I was going to feel it after the game, but it still felt good,"" he said. ... C Ivica Zubac is out for the rest of the season with a high right ankle sprain. Clippers: Backup G Austin Rivers is likely out for the rest of the regular season with a strained left hamstring. GRIFFIN'S 10K Griffin scored the game's first basket on a jumper, giving him 10,000 points in his career. He is the second player in franchise history to reach that mark. Randy Smith scored 10,467 of his club-record 12,735 points when the team was known as the Buffalo Braves. DOC'S MILESTONE Rivers became the 15th coach in NBA history with 800 victories. Only Gregg Popovich of San Antonio (1,146) has more among active coaches. ""What I've learned most as a coach is persistence and patience,"" Rivers said before the game. ""Patience with the players and myself. As a young coach you have a tendency to overreact to everything and change everything. I've learned not to sweat everything.""","400899368"
"CLEVELAND -- The calendar turned and the Cleveland Cavaliers looked like the defending NBA champions again. LeBron James scored 27 points, Kyrie Irving had 14 and a career-high 14 assists and Cleveland, coming off a losing record in January, defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 125-97 on Wednesday night. Cleveland, which went 7-8 last month, began February with a dominating performance in the second half. The Cavaliers recorded a season-high 37 assists and displayed ball movement that was missing for most of January. ""It's just one game,"" James said. ""We've got to continue to do it. We're not going to have 37 assists every game."" Added coach Tyronn Lue: ""It becomes contagious when you're moving the basketball. When we're doing that with the shooters we have we're pretty dangerous."" The Cavaliers held a three-point halftime lead and took control midway through the third quarter. James' three-point play, which started with a reverse scoop layup, gave the Cavaliers a 90-70 lead. Cleveland All-Star forward Kevin Love missed his second straight game because of back spasms, but the Cavaliers had five players in double figures in scoring. James was 11 of 14 from the field. Kyle Korver, who has struggled since being acquired from Atlanta last month, scored 20 points, going 8 of 11 from the field and hitting four 3-pointers. Korver gave most of the credit to James, who had 12 assists, for his highest-scoring night with Cleveland. ""He's an incredible passer and he sees the court so well,"" Korver said. ""I feel like I've missed a bunch of those shots."" Tristan Thompson had 18 points and 14 rebounds. Karl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 26 points and Andrew Wiggins added 23 for the Timberwolves, who won five of six to finish January. Cleveland went on a 27-10 run to begin the third quarter, forcing Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau to call timeout twice in the first six minutes. The Cavaliers' momentum couldn't be stopped and the lead reached 29 points in the final period. Thibodeau doesn't believe Cleveland's problems last month should be any cause for concern. ""After you win it all, the challenge is everyone around the league is ready for you,"" he said. ""LeBron has been through this before, and they still have a great team."" The loss was Minnesota's most lopsided of the season. The Timberwolves were defeated 117-90 by Detroit on Dec. 9. ""We didn't play well,"" Towns said. ""We let them play to their strengths, not to their weaknesses. You can't give the defending champs a jump like that, especially in their home."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota is 13-12 following a 6-18 start. ... Thibodeau said the team is in no hurry to add a player even though Minnesota has had an open roster spot since Jan. 7 when it waived G John Lucas III. ""If something makes sense, we'll look at it,"" he said. Cavaliers: Lue hopes Love, who took part in shooting drills Wednesday, will return Saturday when the Cavaliers play in New York. ... Lue will have his jersey retired at Nebraska, where he played from 1995-98, on Thursday during the Cornhuskers' game against Michigan State. ... Cleveland selected Wiggins with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2014 draft, but packaged him in a trade to Minnesota for Love. ... The Cavaliers had workouts for several veteran free agents at their training facility Wednesday, including Kirk Hinrich, Mario Chalmers, Lance Stephenson and Jordan Farmar. ANOTHER HONOR James was given the NAACP Jackie Robinson Sports Award before the game. The award is presented for high achievement in athletics and contributions in the pursuit of social justice, civil rights and community involvement. ""It just puts a lot of things in perspective,"" James said. ""So appreciative that they would even want me to be a recipient of the award.""","400899369"
"ATLANTA -- Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer finally has his first win over Gregg Popovich, his longtime former boss in San Antonio. It took career and season-high points from Tim Hardaway Jr. and Paul Millsap, respectively, to make it happen. Hardaway matched his career high with 29 points, including a tying 3-pointer with 3.3 seconds remaining in regulation, and the Hawks beat the Spurs 114-112 in overtime on Sunday night.

Millsap scored a season-high 32 points and had 13 rebounds for the Hawks, who snapped a string of 11 straight losses to San Antonio since 2010. ""It's great to get this win against a really good team and it's good to get it for Bud,"" Millsap said. ""He's happy to have it under his belt."" Budenholzer spent 19 years with the Spurs, the last 17 as an assistant. He downplayed his personal motivation. ""You know, I was there for a long time,"" Budenholzer said. ""A lot of things we've tried to bring here ... but at the end of the day it's a game for our players."" Popovich knew the win meant more than Budenholzer revealed. ""If we're going to lose, it's good to feel somebody on the other end was made happy,"" Popovich said. It was only San Antonio's third loss in 19 road games. Hardaway scored nine points in overtime, including the go-ahead free throw with 10.8 seconds remaining. He missed the second free throw but Millsap grabbed the rebound. Dennis Schroder also made only one of two attempts with 3.9 seconds remaining. Kawhi Leonard missed a last-second layup for San Antonio in overtime. Leonard also had a potential winning short jumper spin around the rim before falling out to end regulation. LaMarcus Aldridge had 27 points and 13 rebounds to lead San Antonio.

FEELING BETTER Leonard had 13 points in his return to the starting lineup after missing two games with a stomach virus. He made only 3 of 12 shots from the field. Leonard leads the Spurs with his average of 24.4 points per game but said he was ""just trying to work my way back in"" against Atlanta. ""Taking all that medicine and stuff made me a little weary out there,"" he said. ROAD KINGS The Spurs' 16-2 mark through 18 road games before the loss was tied for the second-best in NBA history, trailing only a 17-1 mark by the 1971-72 Lakers.

"Derrick Rose comments on the Knicks' loss to the Cavaliers by expressing thanks it was just the first game. (0:17) CLEVELAND -- LeBron James took time to reflect as the Cleveland Cavaliers raised their championship banner. Then it was business as usual. James had his 43rd career triple-double, Kyrie Irving scored 29 points and the Cavaliers beat the New York Knicks 117-88 on Tuesday night in the NBA season opener. James scored 19 points and added 11 rebounds and 14 assists in front of a raucous home crowd that was on its feet from the pregame ceremony until late in the game, celebrating the city's first championship in 52 years. ""It was great to have a moment like that,"" he said. ""It was difficult to focus on the game but we did a great job, especially in the second half."" James, who got choked up while speaking to the crowd before the game, continued his perfect record on ring nights. He was 2-0 when the Miami Heat players were presented with their championship rings. ""There were so many emotions,"" he said. ""To see us win the finals and tonight being that last exclamation point to receive your ring in front of your fans was a great moment."" Irving scored 19 points in the third quarter, when Cleveland used a 20-4 run to take a 74-53 lead. Kevin Love scored 23 for the Cavaliers. Carmelo Anthony led New York with 19 points and Derrick Rose had 17. Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert was taken to the locker room late in the third quarter with concussion-like symptoms after colliding with Kristaps Porzingis. Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said Shumpert was undergoing tests to determine the extent of the injury. Cleveland's players, coaching staff and front office personnel also received their championship rings in the pregame ceremony, and the sellout crowd chanted Lue's last name. ""That was a really good feeling,"" he said. ""It was great to be a part of it."" The basketball game was only part of a big night in town. The Cleveland Indians played Game 1 of the World Series against the Chicago Cubs across the street at Progressive Field. The Knicks, who missed the playoffs the last three seasons, are expecting major improvement after acquiring Rose from Chicago to run the offense and signing center Joakim Noah, who was scoreless in 21 minutes. ""We will improve, I guarantee it,"" Anthony said. ""There are just so many moving parts right now. We need to get better, but we're not running from that fact."" New York, playing its first game under new coach Jeff Hornacek, trailed by 13 in the second quarter but rallied to cut the lead to 45-43 at halftime. A pair of dunks by James and 3-pointers from Irving and Love pushed the lead to 61-49. Cleveland's spurt continued as Irving hit three 3-pointers for a 74-53 lead.

""If the Indians win the World Series, he has to wear an Indians uniform when he comes here and if the Cubs win it, I have wear a Cubs uniform when we play in the United Center,"" James said. James said he and most of the Cavaliers planned to attend Game 2 on Wednesday night. NOT THIS TIME The Knicks spoiled James' return to Cleveland on opening night two years ago with a 95-90 win. Anthony was the game's high scorer with 25 points. Irving led Cleveland with 22 while James scored 17. MAKING FRIENDS, SORT OF Noah, who has never been a favorite of Quicken Loans Arena fans, had a few kind words for the city Tuesday. ""Congratulations to Cleveland,"" he said. ""Even though it's not a vacation spot you guys got a championship. It's well-deserved.""","400899375"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Portland's NBA-record streak of home-opening wins provided the inspiration against the Utah Jazz. The Trail Blazers rallied in the fourth quarter for a 113-104 victory on Tuesday night, extending their record to 16 straight wins in home openers. ""With a streak that long, longest in the NBA, we wanted to keep it going,"" said Damian Lillard, who had 39 points. ""I was proud that we were able to do that tonight."" CJ McCollum added 25 points for the Blazers, who trailed 83-77 at the start of the fourth quarter. They were still down 102-99 with under 5 minutes left before McCollum made a pull-up jumper and 3-pointer to give Portland a 104-102 lead. Lillard made a pair of free throws before nailing a 3-pointer that put Portland up 109-102 with 1:02 left and the Jazz couldn't catch up. ""I wasn't surprised. Were you surprised?"" McCollum said about Lillard's 3. ""I saw the look in his eyes and I knew what time it was."" Joe Johnson scored 29 points in his debut with the Jazz and Rodney Hood added 26, including a rim-rattling dunk in the third quarter. The Jazz were without several key players. Gordon Hayward is out with a broken finger on his left hand, while Derrick Favors played in just one preseason game because of a sore knee. Alec Burks continues to rehab from arthroscopic surgery to his knee and ankle. ""Where we're at now, everybody just needs to come together and do what's needed,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said before the game. Johnson signed a two-year deal with the team in the offseason. Boris Diaw, acquired in a trade with San Antonio, also started in his Jazz debut. ""I want to do what I can to help this team win,"" Johnson said. ""This loss hurts, because we were in a position to win, on the road, against a tough team. This was a tough loss but there are positives in this. We have got to grind and get better."" Noah Vonleh gave the Blazers a spark off the bench and his 3-pointer put them ahead 34-28. Portland stretched the lead to as many as 13 points in the first half, paced by Lillard with 16 points. Johnson's short jumper tied the game at 68 midway through the third quarter. Hood hit consecutive jumpers to give the Jazz a 77-71 lead.

Allen Crabbe's 3-pointer tied the game at 85, but the Blazers couldn't take the lead until Lillard's 3 made it 97-96 with 5:50 left. Johnson answered with a 3-pointer on the other end to put the Jazz back in front. ""There were moments tonight where they had the momentum but I could hear the crowd just itching to get involved, just getting loud and cheering, and that's what we needed,"" Lillard said. ""We needed that to pick us up."" TIP-INS Jazz: Hayward and Favors accounted for an average of 36 points per game for the Jazz last season. ...

"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Kawhi Leonard and the San Antonio Spurs put on such a basketball show they sent the loyal Golden State fans to a rare early exit. What a strange sight at Oracle Arena for opening night and Kevin Durant's long-awaited Warriors debut. Leonard scored a career-high 35 points and the Spurs emphatically spoiled KD's first game for Golden State in a 129-100 rout Tuesday that the Warriors could hardly believe had just happened. ""We got punched in the mouth,"" Draymond Green said. ""I don't know if it was quite a bad thing for us."" Durant had 27 points and 10 rebounds, but little looked in sync for MVP Stephen Curry and the reigning Western Conference champions in a forgettable first game -- and quite a different one after the Warriors dominated at home and came out of the blocks last season with a record 24-0 start. Leonard scored 31 points by the end of the third, LaMarcus Aldridge added 26 points and 14 rebounds and Gregg Popovich thoroughly outdid a couple of his close friends on the opposite bench in reigning NBA Coach of the Year Steve Kerr and top assistant Mike Brown. Yes, San Antonio sent quite a message to the West. ""If there was an outcome I wasn't expecting, it was this one,"" San Antonio's Manu Ginobili said. ""A 29-point lead against a team like them? I truly didn't expect it."" Curry, last season's first unanimous MVP, scored 26 points but was just 3 for 10 from 3-point range. Green had 18 points, 12 rebounds and six assists, while Klay Thompson was limited to 11 points on 5-of-13 shooting. The star-studded Warriors were sloppy, committing 16 turnovers, and got outrebounded 55-35. They are clearly still finding themselves just as Kerr expected -- though maybe not quite like this while. ""No, I didn't see losing by 29 points,"" Kerr said. ""It's going to be an ugly tape to watch. ... I think our guys were embarrassed tonight. I know I was."" San Antonio exhibited smooth, crisp ball movement and looked polished in a game that had a playoff feel on Day 1. Two-time Defensive Player of the Year Leonard shot 10 for 21 and made all 15 of his free throws. Jonathon Simmons came off the bench to score a career-high 20 points, including a 3 to beat the halftime buzzer for a 64-46 advantage. His status had been in doubt for the opener because of a calf injury. Green dunked off a pass from Curry early in the third to get Golden State within 10, only to pound his chest and yell before being hit with a technical. The Warriors had flurries of greatness trying to get back in it. San Antonio answered each time -- like when Golden State pulled within 50-42 in the second quarter before the Spurs closed the half on a 14-4 run. ""It's a nice little slap in the face,"" Curry said. ""First game you want to come out and protect your home court and have the energy of the home opener live throughout the game. We didn't do anything to let that happen."" Durant made a 14-footer 65 seconds into the game and hit his first four shots. But he didn't have much help early. San Antonio led 31-20 after the first, when the Warriors shot 7 for 20 with four baskets by Durant. Golden State's other players were 3 for 15, and the Warriors got outrebounded 17-9. Durant, whose former Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Spurs in the Western Conference semifinals, wants to make sure this result doesn't start a trend. ""What we can't do is let these games pile up,"" he said. ""We can't panic. It's Game 1 of 82."" TIP-INS Spurs: Pau Gasol had two points in 18-plus minutes of his debut for San Antonio. ... The Spurs won at Oracle Arena for the first time since a 113-110 victory on Nov. 11, 2014. ... Leonard's previous career high was 33 on April 2 at Toronto. Warriors: Durant has scored 20 or more points in 65 straight games. ... C Zaza Pachulia scored two points in his Warriors debut. ... Golden State's three-game home winning streak against the Spurs was snapped along with its run of four straight victories in season openers. NO DUNCAN You bet it was strange for Popovich to play the first real game without Duncan. It's the first time since Popovich's initial season as head coach of the Spurs in 1996-97 to be exact. ""He was like a security blanket for everybody. Even if things went awry,"" Popovich said. ""He was like the center of the universe and everybody knew how to act around that. With that pivotal guy gone, we'll have to wait and see who accepts that role."" SAGER STRONG A special giveaway T-shirt with Craig Sager's likeness hung on every seat for the sellout crowd to honor the eccentric, beloved TNT sideline reporter as he fights leukemia. Warriors coach Steve Kerr wore a different colorful version earlier, then a wild tie for the game. Popovich offered a caring thought after Curry sent his best over the mic. ""He's just an iconic and weird and wonderful guy all at the same time, and I mean that lovingly,"" he said.","400899377"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Retaining fifth-year center Hassan Whiteside was a major priority for the Miami Heat last summer. Whiteside, an emerging star, showed why it was so important for the Heat keep him as the cornerstone of their rebuilding during Wednesday night's season opener. The 7-footer dominated the paint in helping deliver a 108-96 win in Miami's first game without perennial All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. He led the Heat with 18 points, 14 rebounds and four blocked shots. It was a statement night even if that wasn't Whiteside's intention. ""It's not about trying to make a statement,"" Whiteside said. ""It's just that I'm coming out here and playing. My teammates made it easier for me and we just played as a team. I'm coming out there with a chip on my shoulder, a lot of guys are counting us out. These guys have an edge to them so I'm excited."" Whiteside showed some flashes in the first half, but it was in the second that his athleticism and strength became too much for the Magic, who were without center Bismack Biyombo for Wednesday night's game. Whiteside scored 10 points, grabbed six rebounds and blocked two shots in the final two quarters to help the Heat blow open a back-and-forth game. Miami never relinquished the lead again after a 7-0 run midway through the third quarter that was sparked by a big block by Whiteside and one of his several slam dunks. ""He was enjoying the game and competition, even when he was on the bench and that is important,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We need him to be great and he was that in the third quarter. He really anchored our defense and ignited everyone else."" His prowess on the inside started a dunk-fest as the Heat owned the paint the second half. Goran Dragic scored 16 points and Justise Winslow added 15, while Tyler Johnson's 15 points led three players off the bench in double figures for Miami. Miami scored outscored Orlando 74-36 in the paint. Orlando guard Evan Fournier led all five starters in double figures with 20 points while Nikola Vucevic turned in a double-double with 17 points and 14 rebounds. But none of it was enough to prevent Frank Vogel from suffering a loss in his coaching debut with the Magic. TIP INS Heat: Second-year guard Josh Richardson did not play Wednesday night due to a sprained MCL in his right knee. ... Both Tyler Johnson and James Johnson came off the bench to give the Heat a boost, scoring eight points each in the first half. ... The Heat have won six straight openers, the longest such current streak in the NBA. Magic: Point guard Elfrid Payton had an up and down night, scoring 16 points, but he only had four in the second half and committed four costly turnovers. ... Serge Ibaka managed 14 points but shot just 6 of 17 from the field in his debut with the Magic. MILESTONE WIN It was Spoelstra's career win No. 400. ""I was talking to Pat (Riley) about that and he said `Oh, 400. When I was with the Lakers that many years, I had about 700,"" Spoelstra said. ""That's puts it in perspective.  I'm just glad I had an opportunity to coach this many games. I should have been fired three or four times."" HEATED RIVALRY Fournier says there is no better opponent for the Magic to start the season with than their in-state rival Miami. ""Playing Miami the first game is special,"" Fournier said. ""We don't like them and they don't like us. It's no secret."" MIDDLE MAN With Biyombo serving an NBA-mandated one-game suspension for exceeding the flagrant foul limit in last season's playoffs, the Magic had to shift some things around. Ibaka had to slide over and play center quite a bit when Orlando went to its smaller lineup and Vucevic went to the bench.","400899378"
"Three minutes into the first quarter of the Mavericks-Pacers game, the two teams put on a display of sloppy passing and turnovers. (0:27) INDIANAPOLIS --  Myles Turner walked onto center stage Wednesday night -- and looked as comfortable in his starring role. The Indiana Pacers second-year center scored 30 points, tied his career high with 16 rebounds, blocked four shots and made a 3-pointer in overtime that started the decisive 8-0 run in his first opening night start. If Turner keeps this up, the Pacers could be celebrating a lot more than just a 130-121 season-opening victory over the Dallas Mavericks. ""I was talking to some of my friends about and they were saying `Take it easy on Dallas tonight,"" Turner said. ""It was cool to go out like that against my hometown team. After the final buzzer sounded, everything hit me. It was just like, `Wow, I just did that."" Before the game, new coach Nate McMillan told reporters he expected NBA teams to defend Turner differently this season and said his budding 20-year-old star would have to adapt. He looked just fine against the Mavs. In a game that was supposed to be all about the Pacers' revamped roster and new up-tempo style, Turner stole the show by making 13 of 19 shots, coming up with big play after big play and overshadowing All-Stars Paul George and Dirk Nowitzki. George added 25 points, including another 3 with 55 seconds left to seal Indiana's fifth season-opening win in six years. ""I loved the fight our guys showed in that overtime,"" McMillan said. Deron Williams led Dallas with 25 points. J.J. Barea and Nowitzki each had 22 as the Mavs lost their fifth in a row in the series. Dallas only led twice all night but managed to force overtime when Harrison Barnes' open 3 tied the score at 115 with 2.3 seconds left. Turner could have won it in regulation with a long buzzer-beating 3, but the shot bounced off the back of the rim. ""He did a little bit of everything to hurt us,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said of Turner. ""It was not just one thing he did. He was active and he got the ball in the basket."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Barnes and Andrew Bogut, the two former Golden State Warriors, finished with 19 points and six points, respectively, in their Dallas debuts. ... Nowitzki didn't make his first basket until almost two minutes into the second quarter. ... Barea played despite being listed as questionable with a sprained left elbow. ... Team owner Mark Cuban attended the game. Pacers: All five Indiana starters scored in double figures, including Jeff Teague, who had 20 points and eight assists in his first game with his hometown team. ... Indiana had 10 assists in the first quarter and finished with 30. ... The Pacers also had a 52-49 rebounding advantage despite going with their new, up-tempo style. ... The Oak Ridge Boys sang the national anthem. 1, 2, 3, REPEAT Dallas finished the game 18 of 48 from 3-point range, one short of its own franchise and NBA single-game record set in March 1996 against the New Jersey Nets. Six different players attempted at least six 3s for the Mavs. Indiana, in contrast, was 10 of 19 on 3s and no player attempted more than five. WELCOME BACK, COACH McMillan was just as anxious as his new players to get started. McMillan had been the head coach previously in Seattle and Portland, but spent the previous three seasons as Frank Vogel's top assistant in Indiana.  ""I was surprised he was away from that position as long as he was,"" Carlisle said. ""He's a great coach, and I know him well, personally, too. He'll do a great job.""","400899379"
"BOSTON --  With 2:31 left to play, Brooklyn's Trevor Booker made a layup to cut the Celtics' lead to 10 points and Boston coach Brad Stevens pointed at his resting starters and told them to get back on the floor. The Nets had erased most of a 23-point deficit against the Boston backups, and they would make it an eight-point game before Stevens got his first team back in. ""It's a reminder of how quickly things can turn in this league,"" Stevens said after his starters preserved a 122-117 victory in the season opener on Wednesday night. ""I probably will be less likely to leave them in that long if we're in a similar scenario. Hopefully we learn from it, and we're not."" Isaiah Thomas had 25 points and nine assists, Jae Crowder added 21 points and Al Horford pitched in 11 in his Boston debut for the Celtics. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 21 for Brooklyn, including a 3-pointer to make it 120-117 with 47 seconds left. But he missed another 3 with a chance to tie it after Joe Harris intercepted Thomas' cross-court pass, and the Celtics were able to hold on. Justin Hamilton came off the bench to score a career-high 19 points and grab 10 rebounds for the Nets. ""Very pleased that we didn't give up and we kept on fighting,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said after his debut. The Celtics led 112-89 with 8 minutes to play, and they led by 19 with 5:28 left when Avery Bradley went to the bench to join the rest of the first teamers, who started the quarter there. Brooklyn scored 11 straight points before Stevens decided he'd seen enough. Thomas, Crowder, Horford, Bradley and Amir Johnson re-entered the game with an eight-point lead and 2:07 left and did just enough to protect it. Bradley had nine rebounds, the biggest after Hamilton's missed 3-point shot with 15 seconds left on another attempt to tie it. Hamilton gave the credit to the Nets bench for closing the gap. ""They came in with the energy that we needed to have the whole game,"" he said. MONEY WELL SPENT Horford added five rebounds and six assists for the Celtics, who signed him during the NBA's offseason spending spree to a four-year, $113 million deal. The Celtics are hoping he will help lead them to an Atlantic Division title this season, one year after they finished eight games behind Toronto with the No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. ""He's the same the same old Al,"" Atkinson said, ""doing the stuff and hitting the big shots."" NEWCOMERS Celtics No. 3 overall draft pick Jaylen Brown was pleased to hear that he didn't seem to have any nerves in his NBA debut. Brown scored nine points on 3-for-4 shooting, and he added two blocked shots in 19-plus minutes. How nervous was he? ""On a scale of 1-10, I was a seven or eight,"" he said with a smile. ""You want to have a lot of energy, and it's hard to suppress your energy."" FIRING AWAY The Nets shot 44 3-point attempts, making 15. Atkinson said he wanted them to shoot more this season, but that number may be a little more than he planned. ""Yeah, 44 is a lot, but we'll look at them,"" he said. ""We said we want to take them, but they have to be open 3s."" TIP-INS Nets: Earlier in the day, Jeremy Lin donated $1 million to Harvard, where he graduated in 2010. The money will be used for undergraduate financial aid and to help renovate the school's basketball arena.

"MIAMI --  When Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy was told pregame how many Miami players were missing because of injuries, he immediately figured that his team would be tested. He was right. Fortunately for him, the Pistons responded. Reggie Jackson scored 27 points, Andre Drummond finished with 25 points and 18 rebounds and the Pistons wore down the depleted Heat for a 107-98 victory Sunday night. Miami was without five players, all of whom have started this season -- and had more than 70 percent of its payroll unable to play for a variety of reasons. ""When other guys get opportunities to have the ball in their hands, it's a dangerous thing,"" Van Gundy said. And it was, for a while. The Heat made their first eight shots and scored 66 points in the first half. But after that sizzling beginning, Miami shot 39 percent the rest of the way and managed only 32 points after halftime. The Heat were without what could have been a starting lineup -- Goran Dragic (back), Dion Waiters (groin), Justise Winslow (shoulder), Josh McRoberts (foot) and Hassan Whiteside (eye). ""They played better,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said, after his team dropped its fifth straight. ""I think to be fair, we probably ran out of gas a little bit. Not as an excuse, but we were playing guys big minutes. ... I told the guys there was nothing to be ashamed of in this game."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 23 for Detroit. James Johnson scored 20 points and Wayne Ellington had 18 for Miami, which got 14 from Josh Richardson and led by as many as 14. ""We really woke up at halftime,"" Drummond said. ""We talked about it. We came out with great intensity."" Miami scored 15 points in the third quarter and zero points in the first 5 minutes of the fourth. Detroit took command with a 27-8 run over a stretch of a little more than 8 minutes. ""I thought we played a lot harder in the second half,"" Van Gundy said. TIP-INS Pistons: Marcus Morris returned after missing Friday's game in Atlanta with a sore left knee. ... The Pistons committed five fouls in the first 1:45 of the second quarter, but the Heat only got one trip to the line while in the bonus. ... Detroit lost Aron Baynes to a sprained left ankle in the fourth quarter. Heat: Whiteside was the only Miami player to been in every game this season. Miami has now used 14 different starting lineups in the last 29 games. ... Miami plans to have its injured players, except McRoberts, travel with them when they leave on Monday for a six-game trip that starts in Phoenix on Tuesday. ... Dragic, Winslow and Whiteside could all be back as early as Tuesday. PAIR OF FIRSTS A pair of streaks ended in this game. Miami was 6-0 all-time on New Year's Day.

"TORONTO -- DeMar DeRozan had clearly been itching for the start of the regular season. Like so many other veterans, he had to grind his way through exhibition games in training camp, gradually moving from 11 points in his first preseason game, to 15, to 20 and finally to 34 in the final warm-up game last week. His patience was rewarded Wednesday night as the Olympic gold medalist had 40 points in the Toronto Raptors' 109-91 season-opening victory over the Detroit Pistons, his third career 40-point outing and just two off his career high. ""Preseason (stunk),"" he said. ""But you've got to do it and now the real deal is here and you're just trying to catch a rhythm."" DeRozan made a career-high 17 field goals on 27 shots and was a perfect 6 for 6 from the free throw line, while Jonas Valanciunas was 10 for 15 from the field to go along with 11 rebounds. Valanciunas' previous career high was 31, also against the Pistons, on Jan. 12, 2015. According to Elias Sports Bureau, the duo became the first teammates in NBA history with a 40-point game and a 30-point game in a season opener. DeRozan also broke Vince Carter's opening-night franchise record of 39 points, set against the-then New Jersey Nets in 2003. ""I never keep track,"" DeRozan said of his record-breaking exploits. ""Somebody always informs me after the game."" Valanciunas also played down his accomplishment, despite registering his second career 30-point game, as the Raptors led from the 5:13 mark of the first quarter and never looked back. ""Eighty-one games to go,"" he said. ""We should not get too excited; this is just the start."" Tobias Harris had 22 points and Marcus Morris had 17 points and nine rebounds for the Pistons, who lost for the eighth time in their last 11 games against Toronto. Coach Stan Van Gundy was particularly irked with his team's defensive play in losing their season opener for the fifth time in seven years, especially the fact that Detroit was outrebounded 51-40. It didn't help that center Andre Drummond left the court after getting elbowed in the jaw by Valanciunas early in the first quarter, though he later returned. ""The rebounding was a major concern,"" he said. ""(Giving up) 54 points in the paint was a major concern and 29 free throw attempts, so that just means the team took it right at you."" TIP-INS Pistons: Henry Ellenson, Detroit's first-round draft pick last June (18th overall) went scoreless in 2:10 of play, while second-round selection Michael Gbinije (49th overall), had two points in 2:10. Raptors: C Lucas Nogueira (ankle) sat out. . DeRozan started his franchise-record eighth straight season opener, breaking a tie with Carter. . First-round draft pick Jakob Poeltl became the first Austrian to play in the NBA. He finished with two points in 12:47 of court time. . Oct. 26 is the earliest date that Toronto has ever had a home opener. . The Raptors are 13-9 on opening night and have won four straight. HE SAID IT ""It's one thing to watch somebody on TV and see what he does every single night and actually being there and seeing how effortless it was. It was amazing, he was just getting to his spots, shooting over people and it's like, `How does he do that?"" Rookie Pascal Siakam, drafted 27th overall in June, on the play of DeRozan. Siakam became the first Toronto rookie to start a season opener since Valanciunas in 2012, and rose to the occasion, hauling in nine rebounds to go along with four points in 21 minutes. UNITED NATIONS With the draft-day additions of Poeltl (Austria) and Siakam (Cameroon), Toronto's roster has players representing five countries other than the United States. Valanciunas (Lithuania), Cory Joseph (Canada), Nogueira and Bruno Caboclo (Brazil) round out the group. In their 21 seasons, the Raptors have had players representing 16 countries. ANOTHER DIMENSION Every fan at the Air Canada Centre was given a pair of 3D glasses. As the Raptors opened their season some of the players were jumping out of the Jumbotron to highlight some of the more spectacular plays from last season.","400899382"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Myles Turner is rolling right into the New Year. The second-year center had 23 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Indiana Pacers to a 117-104 victory over the Orlando Magic on Sunday. ""I've just been a recipient of great passes,"" Turner said. ""I'm playing off my teammates right now and that's been big for us."" Turner has scored double-figures in 14 straight games and blocked at least one shot in 23 straight. He blocked Aaron Gordon's shot during a 6-0 spurt in the fourth quarter when Indiana pulled away. Monta Ellis capped off the run with back-to-back baskets to put the Pacers ahead 101-82. Later, Paul George made a 3-pointer to give Indiana a 108-88 lead with 4:48 to go. George finished with 19 points for the Pacers (17-18), who have won two straight after a season-worst four-game losing streak last month. ""Right now it's fun,"" George said. ""We're beyond the stage of figuring it out. Now we're sustaining it and we know what level we need to play at."" Nikola Vucevic had 18 points and 11 rebounds while Jeff Green and Serge Ibaka each scored 17 points for the Magic (15-20). Indiana went on a 6-0 spurt midway through the fourth to pull away. After a rough ending to December, the Pacers were looking to get the New Year off to a good start. Sunday's win is the second against Orlando this season. Indiana will travel to Orlando in a month and again in April to complete the four-game regular season series. The Magic were searching for a way to bounce back after spending four days mulling over a 120-101 loss to Charlotte. Orlando never found a way to do it against the Pacers. ""They made it difficult for us,"" Vucevic said. ""The way to fix (the defensive struggles) is simple. It is having a will to do it. Basketball is a simple game. We have to play the right way every night."" Green scored early in the fourth quarter to put the Magic within nine. But the Pacers answered with baskets by Aaron Brooks and Al Jefferson, and then Jefferson dunked to give Indiana a 95-80 lead with 8:51 to go. Jeff Teague limped to the locker room late in the second quarter and was listed as questionable with a sprained left ankle, but then created a spark early in the second half. Teague scored on lay-ups off missed 3-pointers by George and Glenn Robinson III, and then drove to the basket for another basket before tossing a pass to Turner for an alley-oop dunk to put the Pacers ahead 74-56 with 8:30 remaining in the third quarter. After Ibaka scored and Jodie Meeks made a 3-pointer to put the Magic within six with 36 seconds remaining in the first half, Brooks scored a basket and threw up a 3 at the buzzer to give the Pacers a 62-51 halftime lead. VOGEL'S HOMECOMING Frank Vogel had less anxiety going into Sunday's game, he said, compared to when he returned to Indianapolis to face the Pacers for the first time since he became Orlando's head coach. Vogel's first head coaching job was with the Pacers from 2011-16 and he still has a home in the Indy area. The Pacers beat the Magic 88-69 in a meeting on Nov. 14. CREDIT TO TEAGUE Teague is getting the nod from teammates for helping the Pacers get things going lately. He had a career-high 17 assists in a 111-101 win over Chicago on Friday and 11 in a loss at Washington last Wednesday. Against the Magic, Teague finished with nine assists. ""Credit our last three games to Jeff,"" George said. ""He's almost throwing the ball blindly knowing where we're at."" TIP-INS Magic: Gordon had 13 points and six rebounds. ... Orlando shot 20 percent (3-of-15) from 3-point range in the first half. . PG Evan Fournier missed his fourth straight game with a bruised right heal. . F Damjan Rudez was out with a strained right calf. Pacers: Indiana is 13-5 at home this season. . PG Rodney Stuckey was out with a sore left hamstring.","400899383"
"MILWAUKEE -- The Charlotte Hornets turned up the pressure on the Milwaukee Bucks from the outset of their season opener. Nicholas Batum disrupted the Bucks on the perimeter. Center Roy Hibbert had his teammates' backs in the paint. The defense helped Charlotte build a big early lead, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had 23 points and 14 rebounds in his return from a shoulder injury in the 107-96 victory over Milwaukee on Wednesday night. ""Early, they didn't get things easy,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. They led by as many as 24 points in the third quarter before fending off a late charge from Milwaukee. The Bucks, who looked lackluster for much of the game, drew energy from Greg Monroe's hustle in the paint and Jason Terry's floater that cut the lead to 93-85 with 5:08 left. But the Hornets held on down the stretch, getting a straightaway 3 from Marvin Williams for a 12-point lead with 3:21 left. ""They definitely outplayed us. We just can't let that happen (any) more,"" Bucks forward Jabari Parker said. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 31 points, nine rebounds and five assists. The 6-foot-11 forward, now serving as Milwaukee's primary ball-handler, showed he was worth the four-year $100 million contract extension he signed before training camp. ""I'm not happy, we all wanted to start this season with a win ... so that's all I can think about,"" Antetokounmpo said. The Hornets pressed early, and tried to force the Bucks to find other ways to start the offense. The Hornets also had an effective wing defender in the 6-foot-8 Batum. ""Nic set the tone with his ball pressure, trying to disrupt the offense, which not many guys his size could do,"" Clifford said. Williams finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds for Charlotte, a playoff team a year ago following a 48-win season. TIP INS Hornets: C Cody Zeller, who did not play the entire preseason because of a right knee injury, was 5 of 6 from the field for 15 points in 14 minutes. ... C-F Frank Kaminsky missed the game with a strained right foot. Kaminsky was a star in college at Wisconsin, where he helped lead the Badgers to two Final Four appearances. Bucks: Malcolm Brogdon played well in his NBA debut, serving as the point guard when Antetokounmpo and Matthew Dellavedova were off the court. Brogdon, a second-round draft pick, finished with eight points and five assists in 21 minutes. MOVIN' IT The Bucks couldn't keep up with Charlotte's crisp ball movement in the first half, when the Hornets had 17 assists on 22 field goals to build a 15-point lead. Kemba Walker finished with eight assists, six coming in the first half. ""We just stuck to our game plan. We made all the right plays. We didn't turn the ball over too much,"" Walker said. ""We got a lot of stops, pushed the tempo, we made shots."" MOVING ON Charlotte lost Jeremy Lin, Courtney Lee and Al Jefferson to free agency in the offseason, bringing in Marco Belinelli, Ramon Sessions and Hibbert. The new Hornets are fitting in quite nicely. Kidd-Gilchrist is back after playing just seven games last season. The 7-foot-2 Hibbert had a couple of rim-rocking dunks in the third quarter that helped build the 20-point lead. With Hibbert anchoring the middle defensively, Clifford likes the length and versatility provided by Batum and the 6-7 Kidd-Gilchrist. LONG SHOTS The Bucks were haunted by familiar problems that carried over from last year's 33-win squad. Milwaukee was just 1 of 9 from behind the 3-point arc in the first half. Interior defense was also an issue and the Hornets took advantage of the scrambling Bucks by moving the ball quickly around the court. Milwaukee finished 3 of 16 from behind the arc. Charlotte was 7 of 23 from 3-point range, but their baskets came in clutch situations. ""The timely 3s hurt. For us they shot 30 percent from the 3-point line. We'll take that, but when you're behind, your margin of error, it's very slim,"" coach Jason Kidd said.","400899384"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  When the Minnesota Timberwolves jumped out to a 12-point lead over Portland at halftime, the struggling Trail Blazers looked to be on their way to yet another loss. Turns out C.J. McCollum had the young Wolves right where he wanted them. McCollum scored a career-high 43 points to carry the Trail Blazers to a 95-89 victory Sunday night. Mason Plumlee had 18 points and eight rebounds, and Evan Turner added 11 points for the Blazers. They were without star point guard Damian Lillard for the fourth straight game. McCollum made 16 of 25 shots, including a 30-foot 3-pointer with just over 2:30 to play to put the game out of reach. ""We were being soft as a team and I think it showed in our performance,"" McCollum said. ""We knew that we needed to come out and compete."" Andrew Wiggins scored 24 points for the Timberwolves. But Karl-Anthony Towns had just 11 points on 3-for-15 shooting and missed all six of his 3-pointers. Zach LaVine also was quiet with 13 points on 5-for-12 shooting and the Wolves fell to 9-11 in games in which they lead by double digits. ""I shot good shots, put them up with the same form and they just weren't going in,"" Towns said. ""I tried to do other things, try to make free throws when you got them, get rebounds, make assists. I don't know. I shot good shots, they just didn't fall."" Portland had lost seven of its last eight and was floundering with its star on the bench with ankle problems. Lillard was listed as doubtful for the game with that sprained left ankle. He worked out hard before the game and showed no noticeable limp, but the Blazers started McCollum at point guard again with two days off before their next scheduled game. McCollum, who was averaging 26 points per game with Lillard out, scored 13 points in a ragged first quarter and put up 16 in a 32-15 third quarter that helped the Blazers turn a 14-point deficit into a five-point lead going into the fourth. ""Without Damian, that's 28 points and a lot of defensive attention,"" McCollum said. ""Seven assists, six rebounds, so a lot more energy has to be utilized on my end. I have to try to keep guys involved and take over as a decision maker."" The Wolves came back to tie it with 7:23 to play, but Shabazz Napier hit a big 3, Turner hit a soft jumper and Allen Crabbe knocked down another 3 to put the Blazers in front for good. Before the game, Portland coach Terry Stotts said it was important for his players not to try to do too much with Lillard out. ""I just said there might be a guy who scores 10 more than you expect,"" Stotts said. ""He scored 20 more than I expected."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Crabbe had 10 points and a career-high eight rebounds. ... McCollum topped 30 for the seventh time this season. His previous career high was 37. ... Napier scored three points, the only bench player besides Turner to score. Timberwolves: PG Ricky Rubio had a rough night, going 0 for 5 from the field and getting torched by McCollum on defense. He did not play in the fourth quarter. ... Minnesota entered the game 10th in the NBA in free throw shooting, but missed six of them on Sunday night. ... Towns did have 13 rebounds and six assists, all in the first quarter. MISSING MOTIEJUNAS The Timberwolves had a workout scheduled with free agent forward Donatas Motiejunas as they considered adding him to help them bolster a bench that has struggled mightily this season. After working out with New Orleans, Motiejunas took a flight to Minneapolis on Sunday. But by the time he got off the plane, he had an offer from the Pelicans on the table and canceled his workout with the Timberwolves. ""We never got a chance to sit down with him,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said.","400899385"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The David Fizdale era as Memphis coach didn't get off to a glowing start. The end of his opening night was much more enjoyable. The Grizzlies climbed out of a 16-1 hole, put together 16 straight points early in the second half and beat Minnesota 102-98 on Wednesday night, spoiling Tom Thibodeau's debut as Timberwolves coach. Memphis, which still trailed with 1:45 remaining, closed the game on an 11-5 run to seal the win for Fizdale, the former Miami Heat assistant who was hired to replace Dave Joerger in the offseason. ""You noticed I kept my poise,"" Fizdale said of the anemic start that caused him to call a pair of early timeouts. ""I was squirming on the inside, but I just knew our team just had some big-time jitters."" Mike Conley scored 24 points and Marc Gasol added 18 to lead the Grizzlies in the season opener for both teams. Zach Randolph, in his new role as a reserve, had 19 points and 11 rebounds. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with 25 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 21. Zach LaVine added 19 points. Thibodeau found some good things for his team, particularly the fast start, but noted his young players need to finish. ""When we go back and we look into it, we're going to see that the defense wasn't good enough,"" Thibodeau said. ""The rebounding wasn't good enough. The turnovers weren't bad, but, you know, some of the mental mistakes got us down the stretch."" TIP-INS: Timberwolves: Minnesota connected on eight of its first 10 shots. ... Rookie Kris Dunn, the fifth overall pick, made his NBA debut near the 4-minute mark of the first quarter. He finished with eight points after hitting all three of his shots in the first half. ""I think I'm starting to get comfortable,"" he said, ""so I wasn't really nervous. But, you know, playing in a crowd like that, it was great."" Grizzlies: G Vince Carter is the oldest player currently in the NBA at 39 years and 274 days. He entered the game in the first quarter, moving him into 26th place on the career games played list with 1,275. He passed Terry Porter. ... Memphis is 2-14 in home openers. The only win before Wednesday was in 2014 over Minnesota. SUCCESSFUL OPENING Fizdale became the first Memphis coach to win his debut since Tony Barone Jr. won his first game in the middle of the 2006-07 season, serving as interim coach after Mike Fratello was fired. FAST START After the 16-1 start, Minnesota would eventually lead 20-3, its largest lead of the night. ""We were playing the exact game plan we wanted coming in,"" Towns said. "".We were playing defense at a high level. We were playing quick, the way we wanted to play."" FIRST-AID LIST Memphis played without F Brandan Wright (left ankle) and Chandler Parsons (right knee rehab), who were inactive. G Tony Allen (right knee) dressed, but was ruled out before the game.","400899386"
"LOS ANGELES -- Kyle Lowry relishes any chance to raise his offensive game in the fourth quarter. The Toronto Raptors needed just about every one of his big baskets to hold off the Los Angeles Lakers. Lowry scored 20 of his season-high 41 points in the fourth, and the Raptors stopped a two-game skid with a 123-114 victory Sunday night. He went 5 for 6 and hit three of his six 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. With one high-difficulty shot after another, the diminutive guard kept the Raptors on top in the face of the Lakers' persistent rally. ""It was my time to go out there and be more aggressive,"" said Lowry, who finished two points shy of his career high. ""If it's taking the extra shot or making more shots or creating more shots, it's just a chance to go out there and play basketball. Playing in the fourth quarter is really fun."" Lowry also had nine rebounds and seven assists, while DeMar DeRozan scored 31 points in another big game in his hometown. The Atlantic Division-leading Raptors' two scoring stars got them back in winning form on the fifth stop of their six-game road trip. ""He could have had more,"" DeRozan said of Lowry's fourth-quarter dominance. ""The fourth quarter has got to be ours on both ends. We've got to put our mark on it."" Toronto got its fourth straight win over the Lakers, sweeping the season series for the second straight year. Nick Young hit seven 3-pointers and scored 26 points for the Lakers, who emerged from a miserable December with their 15th loss in 17 games despite a stirring late surge. ""That's a good team,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said of the Raptors. ""They have some All-Star Olympians that really carried the load for them. (Lowry) had it cooking."" D'Angelo Russell hit four of his six 3-pointers and scored 14 of his 28 points in the final period. The Lakers trimmed a 19-point deficit to six, but Lowry and Terrence Ross hit big shots down the stretch to keep Toronto comfortably ahead. ""I think the effort is there,"" Young said. ""We're showing it. We have to limit the six-minute breakdowns we go through."" FIGHT ON DeRozan and Young are both Los Angeles natives who played at Southern California. They dueled for long stretches on the eve of the Trojans' return to the Rose Bowl to face Penn State. DeRozan only spent one year at USC before going pro, while Young played three years for the Trojans, leaving in 2007 -- one year before DeRozan arrived. DOWN THE STRETCH The Raptors blew it open by hitting their first eight shots of the final period, turning a two-point lead into a 19-point margin in six minutes. Los Angeles rallied behind Russell, whose fifth 3-pointer trimmed the lead to 112-106 with 3:10 left. Los Angeles never got closer as Lowry scored on the next two possessions. SWAGGY 3 Young's latest burst from long range gave him 36 3-pointers in the last eight games -- the most in an eight-game stretch in Lakers franchise history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. STILL SLUMPING Los Angeles took its third straight home loss since a Christmas victory over the Clippers. The Lakers showed signs of their early-season selves after that miserable December, but weren't rewarded with a win. Los Angeles struggled under the weight of injuries and a packed schedule last month after a 10-10 start to their first season following the worst three years in franchise history. TIP-INS Raptors: Patrick Patterson didn't play. He strained his left knee at Phoenix on Thursday. ... Jonas Valanciunas had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Lakers: Former Toronto G Jose Calderon is in uniform, but still struggling with a strained hamstring. He didn't play for the 15th straight game. ... Former Raptors G Lou Williams also struggled, going 3 of 11 for eight points.","400899387"
"NEW ORLEANS -- Denver coach Mike Malone decided the Nuggets should not, in fact, do whatever it takes to stop Anthony Davis. Instead, the Nuggets stuck to their usual defensive principles against the Pelicans, and it paid off -- barely. Jusuf Nurkic scored 23 points, Will Barton added 22 and the Nuggets survived a dominant performance by Davis to defeat the Pelicans 107-102 in both teams' regular-season opener on Wednesday night. ""When you play against a great player, you have a problem you need to answer: Are you going to shut him down and create problems elsewhere or are you going to let him get his and hope nobody else goes off?"" Malone said. Denver did the latter, and Davis wound up with 50 points, 16 rebounds, seven steals, five assists and four blocks. His prolific play helped New Orleans trim a deficit as large as 14 late in the second quarter down to two points in the waning minutes. ""We gave them too many easy looks in the beginning of the game,'' Davis said. ""We gave ourselves a chance. We've just got to play like we played in the third and fourth quarter in the beginning of the game."" Davis became the first player to post at least 45 points, 15 rebounds, five assists and five steals in a game since steals were recorded in 1973-74. He didn't get much help offensively. Davis shot 17-of-34; the rest of the Pelicans combined to shoot 21-of-58. Tim Frazier scored 15 for the Pelicans. E'Twaun Moore added 10 points but missed a 3-point attempt that could have tied the contest with 24 seconds left. Danilo Gallinari scored 15 for Denver, Wilson Chandler added 12 points and Kenneth Faried finished with 14 rebounds -- six on the offensive end to help the Nuggets end with a 14-3 advantage in second-chance points. Denver built its largest lead when Barton hit a 3 and a layup to spark a 9-2 run that made 60-46 in the final minute of the second quarter. ""I was just trying to be aggressive, staying in attack mode, whether I'm scoring for myself of making plays for others,"" Barton said. Denver still led by 10, at 87-77, when Faried's 5-foot hook shot opened the scoring in the fourth quarter, but New Orleans managed to keep its deficit within single digits most of the final period. Davis pulled the Pelicans as close as 100-98 when he cut into the lane for a layup with 2:32 to go. Davis didn't fault his teammates for the loss, saying their shot selection was decent but that they missed shots they often make. He was more inclined to criticize himself for a few missed shots from close range and his late turnover. ""I'm going to have to -- probably not 50 every night -- but try to get somewhere along those lines every game to give ourselves a chance,"" Davis said. ROOKIE DEBUTS Nuggets rookie guard Jamal Murray, taken seventh overall in the NBA draft -- one spot behind Pelicans rookie Buddy Hield -- played 13 minutes and was 0 of 2 shooting, finishing with a point on a free throw. Hield missed the first three shots of his NBA career before scoring his first points on a driving layup. He finished with four points on 2 of 8 shooting in nearly 17 minutes off the bench. OFF THE MARK Both teams let fly frequently from 3-point range but often inaccurately. Denver missed 16 shots of 24 from deep. The Pelicans made only 3-of-19. TIP-INS Nuggets: Between Gallinari, Nikola Jokic and the 7-foot Nurkic, Denver opened the game with three players 6-foot-10 or taller on the floor at a time, when a number of teams are favoring smaller lineups that feature the quicker, more versatile players on their rosters. ""Obviously, the trend is going away from what we do, but we're not worried about what the trends are,"" Malone said. ""We're going to do what we think is best for us, but within our game, you'll see a lot of different lineups."" Pelicans: Before the game, the Pelicans wore black T-shirts during warm-ups to honor former teammate Bryce Dejean-Jones, who was fatally shot in May, when he forced his way into an apartment that he had mistaken for that of his girlfriend. The shirts had the letters ""BDJ"" on the chest, with Dejean-Jones' No. 31 underneath. ""It's unfortunate what happened, the fact that he's not with us any longer, but he was part of our family, and we just wanted to do something to pay tribute to him,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said.","400899388"
"PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia 76ers told a national anthem singer and a middle finger-flipping fan to hit the road. Russell Westbrook then sent the Sixers packing with a loss and showed life without Kevin Durant might not be so bad for Oklahoma City. Westbrook stared down a double bird and spoiled Joel Embiid's debut with 32 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Thunder to a 103-97 victory on Wednesday night. Westbrook's surge down the stretch capped a peculiar night in Philly. The 76ers had a tripleheader of image faux pas on opening night: The scheduled anthem singer says she was booted because she wanted to wear a ""We Matter"" jersey; a fan was kicked out for extending two middle fingers at Westbrook; and halftime singer Desiigner was booed off the court for a shirtless performance where he dropped his pants past his rear. ""Crazy, right?"" Westbrook said. ""I turned a new leaf though because that cost me $25,000 last time. I guess the fan, he'll be all right. I guess they can say whatever they want to the players and do what they want."" Westbrook was fined by the league for ""directing inappropriate language toward a fan"" in a playoff game last year. He took the high road toward the Sixers fan and stuck around to score the decisive points on opening night for the Thunder in their first game since Durant left in free agency and signed with the Golden State Warriors. Embiid nearly matched Westbrook down the stretch and showed a needed spark for the Sixers. Embiid scored 20 points in 22 minutes in his first game since the Sixers made him the No. 3 overall pick in the 2014 draft. Embiid had sat out the last two seasons with foot injuries. He received a roaring ovation when he was introduced and fans went wild on every shot. Fans chanted ""Trust The Process"" when Embiid was at the free-throw line. The catchphrase became a rallying cry under former team president Sam Hinkie. ""Having the fans chant that, it was special and I loved it,"" Embiid said. Westbrook and Embiid swapped jumpers that tied the game 97-all. Westbrook sank two free throws with 35 seconds left for a 99-97 lead in front of a raucous crowd. Enes Kanter silenced them for good and sent them toward the exits with a putback layup after the Sixers missed a shot on the other end. Yes, it was another loss for the Sixers, but one that came with a 7-foot-2 asterisk. Embiid's performance largely stole the show from the opening-night shenanigans that otherwise tarnished the night. Sixers fans who had been waiting to cheer for Embiid for more than two years went wild every time he touched the ball. A group of fans held a sign that read, ""In Embiid We Trust."" The Sixers just might prove they made the right decision to trust in Embiid. The sellout crowd of 20,487 fans erupted when the ""7-foot-2 center from Kansas, Joooooel, Embiiiiid"" was introduced during game introductions. They stood and gasped when Embiid attempted his first shot of the game -- a missed 3-pointer. He had a nifty spin in the post and a bucket for a quick 10-2 lead. The Sixers, yes, the 10-72 Sixers, at last had a dose of good news. Embiid starred on a nationally televised performance and gave a teasing glimpse that he just may be the franchise cornerstone player that can help shift the franchise toward respectability. ""I love this city and I just want to appreciate the moment,"" he said. Westbrook, now The Man in OKC, refused to cede the spotlight entirely to Embiid. He scored 12 points in the first quarter and 22 through three to keep the Thunder within striking distance entering the fourth. TIP-INS Thunder: Coach Billy Donovan said the Thunder will win without Durant, just ""do it in a different way."" ""It will be a constant process throughout the season to get everyone to understand,"" he said. 76ers: Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard rang the ceremonial opening bell. ... UFC lightweight champion Eddie Alvarez was at the game. ANTHEM CONTROVERSY Philadelphia 76ers national anthem singer Sevyn Streeter says she was told by the team she could not perform because of her ""We Matter"" jersey. Streeter wrote on Twitter, ""Was suppose to sing the anthem at (at)sixers &amp; (at)okcthunder game but mins b4 (at)sixers said I couldn't because I was wearing a ""We Matter"" jersey. FAN TOSSED The Sixers ejected a portly fan in an Allen Iverson jersey who directed both middle fingers toward Westbrook from his courtside seat. The fan raised his arms in triumph and high-fived fans as he was escorted out of the arena. DESIIGNER FLAW: Rapper Desiigner was booed off the court for a halftime performance where he performed shirtless and left with his jeans down almost to his ankles and his boxers exposed. SIMMONS UPDATE No. 1 overall draft pick Ben Simmons says there is no timetable for his return to the Sixers from a broken bone in his right foot. He said he has not discussed the possibility of sitting out the season. ""I'll come back when I'm ready,"" Simmons said.","400899389"
"CHICAGO --  Jimmy Butler saw confidence and swagger, a team embracing the moment. No one welcomed it more with open arms than he did. Butler scored 33 points and hit two free throws with 2.1 seconds left to lift the Chicago Bulls to a 106-104 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday. ""I see guys doing what they're supposed to be doing -- playing hard, shooting the ball when they're open, not trying to do too much,"" Butler said. ""That's what we need."" Butler scored the Bulls' final nine points. His free throws gave them a two-point lead and capped a 15-4 run. Tim Hardaway Jr. then missed a 3-pointer for Atlanta as time expired, giving the Bulls their third straight win. Chicago also moved into seventh place in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls are tied with Miami and Indiana at 37-39 but own tiebreakers over the Heat and Pacers. Sixth-place Atlanta (39-37) -- which had won two straight after dropping seven in a row -- trails Milwaukee by a game. Rajon Rondo had a season-high 25 points and added 11 rebounds. Denzel Valentine scored 13 points, hitting two 3-pointers down the stretch to help the Bulls stop a seven-game losing streak to Atlanta. The win comes on the heels of a victory over LeBron James and the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers. ""We had a great win a couple of days ago, but it means nothing if we came out and laid an egg tonight,"" Rondo said. ""Also, these guys have beaten us seven straight times."" Dennis Schroder led the Hawks with 29 points. Hardaway scored 20, and Dwight Howard finished with 13 points and 12 rebounds. ""They responded well and you have to give them credit,"" Schroder said. ""We've got to execute better in crunch time and just do a better job, screening, rolling to the basket and taking care of the ball."" TIP-INS Hawks: All-Star F Paul Millsap missed his eighth consecutive game because of a left knee ailment. Coach Mike Budenholzer said Millsap is ""making positive progress,"" though the Hawks are being ""aggressively cautious"" with him. If Millsap misses Sunday's game at Brooklyn, he will have three more days before the Hawks host Boston on Thursday. ... F Mike Dunleavy Jr. played 12 minutes but did not score after missing a game because of a sore right ankle, while F Thabo Sefolosha (strained right groin) sat out his fourth in a row. G Malcolm Delaney sat out with back spasms. Bulls: Butler was 10 of 10 at the foul line. ... The Bulls hit 12 3-pointers, their sixth straight game with at least 10. FINAL PUSH The Bulls trailed by 10 in the fourth quarter and were down 100-91 with less than five minutes to go. Valentine hit a pair of 3-pointers to start the game-ending run, and Butler took over from there. He tied it at 102-all when he connected from long range with 1:59 left. Schroder pulled up for the go-ahead jumper after Butler's baseline shot hit the front of the rim to give the Hawks a 104-102 lead with 35 seconds left. Butler immediately answered with a driving layup to tie it again. After a timeout, Schroder lost his dribble out of bounds with 25 seconds left. Butler then got fouled by Kent Bazemore as he attempted a jumper with 2.1 seconds remaining and hit both free throws as the crowd chanted ""MVP! MVP!"" Hardaway's 3 after a timeout then hit the back of the rim as time expired. ""I should have pump-faked,"" Hardaway said. ""Two seconds left, I think that's an easy pump-fake, one-dribble shot. I think I had time. But it felt great coming off my hands. It felt great. It was in line. It just was a little bit long.""","400899390"
"BOSTON --  Isaiah Thomas has started a new trend that's growing with each fantastic fourth quarter. Thomas scored 19 of his 44 points in the final quarter to lift the Boston Celtics over the Toronto Raptors 109-104 on Wednesday night in a showdown for first place in the Atlantic Division. When Thomas hits a shot in the fourth now, his teammates and many in the stands look down at their wrists, simulating looking at a watch to signal that it's Thomas' time. ""I just did it one game and it kept going,"" he said. ""I've got teammates, the fans, signs, everybody in social media is saying: `You know what time it is."" In his last game, Thomas had 24 in the fourth in a victory over Detroit. He's had four games with 20 or more in the fourth. No other player in the league entered Wednesday with more than one. ""You have to trap him and get the ball out of his hands,"" Toronto guard Kyle Lowry said. ""He got three wide-open looks in the fourth. That can't happen."" It was the fifth straight win for Boston, which moved 1  1/2 games ahead of the Raptors in the division and holds the Eastern Conference's No. 2 seed. Jae Crowder scored 14 points for the Celtics and Al Horford had 11. Thomas had 18 of Boston's final 23 points. ""He's playing at a really high level,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said of his 5-foot-9 point guard. Lowry led Toronto with 32 points, former Celtic Jared Sullinger had 13 and Norman Powell added 12. The Raptors have lost seven of nine. ""He's more patient than ever,"" Sullinger said. ""He runs through the offense slowly and finds a way to score."" In a final quarter that rivaled playoff intensity, Celtics forward Jaylen Brown was fouled on a breakaway attempt and walked over and had words with Lowry before a few others player joined in and had to be separated by the officials. Boston's Terry Rozier and the Raptors' DeMarre Carroll were each given a technical foul. TIP-INS Raptors: G DeMar DeRozan was out for the fifth time in six games with a right ankle injury. Celtics: G Avery Bradley missed his eighth straight game with a right Achilles tendon injury. Stevens said he's practiced the last two days, but the team wants ""to make sure that when we get him back, he's back on the court and limit the chance that it'll happen again."" ... F Kelly Olynyk was out with a strained left shoulder. ON SECOND THOUGHT Thomas had planned on changing his number at some point, but with a nickname ""IT4"" and fans buying his jersey, he's had a change of heart. ""I probably won't change it. I wanted to, but it's getting tougher and tougher,"" he said. ""You see a lot of people with No. 4 jerseys, and I would feel bad for those that pay their hard-earned money to buy a No. 4 jersey."" IMPRESSED Stevens talked about the play of Lowry before the game, admiring both the overall guard play in the league and that of Toronto's star. ""There are so many guards right now that can make exceptional plays off the dribble,"" he said. ""Maybe more so and a higher efficiency than I've seen before, and Lowry's one of the best of them."" NICE ENDING Thomas hit a 36-foot 3-pointer with 2.5 seconds left to cap off his 16-point first quarter.","400899391"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Marc Gasol made the winning free throws, but Tony Allen's defense made the difference down the stretch. ""That's his job,"" Gasol said. ""That's what he does, and he's really good at it."" Gasol scored 25 points, including a pair of free throws with 12.2 seconds remaining to give the Memphis Grizzlies a 95-94 victory over the Orlando Magic on Thursday night. Gasol's free throws completed a 14-point comeback in the fourth quarter as the short-handed Grizzlies snapped a two-game losing streak. Though Gasol carried the offense, both coaches pointed to Allen's defense as the reason for a 13-0 Memphis run that brought the Grizzlies back into the game. ""He just took over that game defensively,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. Added Magic coach Frank Vogel: ""Credit his energy. He just made a lot of hustle plays that turned the game around."" After Gasol's free throws gave Memphis its first lead since early in the second half, Orlando still had a chance to win the game. But JaMychal Green stole the ball from Elfrid Payton near the top of the key. The ball ended up in Gasol's hands as time ran out. Troy Daniels finished with 19 points for the short-handed Grizzlies, who dressed nine players due to injuries. Andrew Harrison had 11 points and eight assists. Evan Fournier led the Magic with 28 points, while Nikola Vucevic had 18 points and 11 rebounds. Jeff Green scored 12 of his 14 points early in the fourth as Orlando built its lead. JaMychal Green's steal from Payton was his second in the fourth quarter. Allen also had a pair and disrupted the Orlando offense. ""That one hurts. Hurts bad,"" Fournier said. ""They just played more aggressive than us in the final 5 minutes."" And Fournier didn't leave out Allen as the reason either. ""Tony Allen changed the game by just being more aggressive, getting in the passing lane and getting more deflections,"" the Magic guard said. TIP-INS Magic: Payton, listed as questionable with a right ankle sprain, came off the bench in the first quarter. ... Jodie Meeks remained out recovering from a right foot injury. ... Fournier hit all seven of his shots in the first half before ending the night 11 of 14, including 3 of 5 from outside the arc. Grizzlies: The game was the final one of a seven-game stretch against Eastern Conference teams. ... Gasol had a steal in the second quarter and flipped the ball backward over his head the length of the court for an assist on Troy Williams' breakaway dunk. ... Memphis has won nine straight home games against Orlando. The Magic have not won at FedExForum since a 112-85 defeat on Jan. 23, 2008. ... Memphis is now 5-0 on the second night of back-to-backs. TRIAGE UNIT The Grizzlies remained short-handed based on injuries and personal leave. Memphis dressed only nine players as it did in Wednesday night's loss in Toronto. Among the injured: G Mike Conley, F Vince Carter, F James Ennis, F Chandler Parsons and F/C Brandan Wright. Also, F Zach Randolph is not with the team due to the death of his mother last week. Fizdale has begun calling the healthy group ""The Nasty Nine."" STREAK STILL ALIVE Fournier connected on a 3-pointer in the first quarter, making 757 straight games Orlando has made a shot from outside the arc. The last game without a 3-pointer was March 14, 2007. DOUBLE-DOUBLE, BUT NOT ENOUGH Vucevic recorded his 10th double-double of the season and almost put a dagger in the Grizzlies comeback hopes. After JaMychal Green's 3-pointer cut the Magic lead to 94-93, Vucevic fired a 26-footer with 24 seconds left. The ball rattled in the rim before popping out, setting the stage for Gasol's final free throws.","400899392"
"TORONTO --  Bojan Bogdanovic is already fitting in better than he could possibly have imagined with his new teammates. The Bosnian guard who was acquired from Brooklyn on Feb. 22 had 27 points off the bench in leading the Washington Wizards to a 105-96 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night, snapping an eight-game losing streak to their Eastern Conference rival in the process. The victory also moved the third-placed Wizards one game clear of the fourth-placed Raptors in the standings, ahead of their third and final matchup of the season on Friday in Washington. Toronto won the first game on Nov. 2. ""When you play with such great guys, first of all, and then great players, it is pretty easy and quick for me to adjust to all the changes that I have been facing in the past three or four days,"" Bogdanovic said after his second-highest point total of the season. In his fourth game with the Wizards, Bogdanovic keyed Washington's decisive run in the second quarter when it erased a two-point deficit at the end of the first with a 26-1 run over the first 5:25 of the period to lead by 23 points. Bogdanovic had 16 points during that run on 5-for-5 shooting from the floor, including 3-for-3 from 3-point range. His contributions didn't go unnoticed, although coach Scott Brooks was equally effusive in his praise for general manager Ernie Grunfeld and the front office for the trade. ""Ernie and his staff did a good job of putting us in the position to get a guy like Bojan,"" he said. ""It solidifies our bench. . I thought the guys did a good job of just taking care of business."" Bradley Beal chipped in with 23 points, while John Wall had his 39th double-double of the season with 12 points and 13 assists. Coming off Tuesday's 112-108 win over the Golden State Warriors, who hold the NBA's best record, the Wizards are riding high, with an Eastern Conference-leading 20-7 record since New Year's Day. ""It is all mental toughness at the end of the day,"" he said. ""Everybody is playing back-to-backs, everybody is tired. At this point of the year, it is just all about being mentally tough."" DeMar DeRozan led the Raptors in the absence of fellow All-Star Kyle Lowry, out following wrist surgery. DeRozan had 24 points, while Serge Ibaka added 20. But given the way the second quarter turned out, the emphasis after the game was very much on the defensive side of the ball. ""We could have played better defense and not got down 20-something points and that's all effort on the defensive end,"" DeRozan said. ""We're going to miss shots and that, but we've got to (be able) to rely on our defense."" Patrick Patterson, who was part of the second unit that was on the court for much of the 26-1 Washington run, said his teammates need to forget it and focus on Friday's rematch. ""The best thing we can do is flush the second quarter down the toilet and completely forget it,"" he said. ""Absolutely anything that we could have done wrong we did."" TIP-INS Wizards: G Brandon Jennings was signed on Wednesday after being released by New York on Monday, but he wasn't with the team in Toronto. Rookie F Daniel House was waived to free a roster spot. G Trey Burke also missed the game for personal reasons. ... Washington has not won a season series against Toronto since the 2007-08 season. This season, the series is tied 1-1. ... Wizards G John Wall and Raptors F Patrick Patterson both played at Kentucky together before becoming first-round picks in the 2010 draft. ... Wednesday's game was the first of 12 on the road in March for the Wizards. They play just six home games during the month. ... Washington improved to 16-1 when holding its opponent under 100 points. Raptors: Toronto's eight-game winning streak over Washington was the longest for either team in the rivalry, bettering the Wizards' run of six from Nov. 7, 2003-Jan. 21, 2005. DOWN BUT NOT OUT Midway through the third quarter, Wall rifled a one-handed pass past Toronto's Cory Joseph and hit teammate Martin Gortat flush in the face, knocking him to the floor. The big center took it in stride though, quickly getting up and playing on. ""He tried to break my little nose,"" Gortat said jokingly.","400899393"
"NEW YORK -- Kristaps Porzingis was trying to lead a fourth-quarter turnaround and just needed a couple Knicks teammates to join him. Carmelo Anthony? Nope. Ineffective and on the bench. Derrick Rose? Nope. Injured and on the bench. Try Willy Hernangomez and Sasha Vujacic. Porzingis had 19 points and 12 rebounds and New York rallied for a 95-90 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. ""I think we just willed ourselves,"" guard Brandon Jennings said. Anthony had 15 points, but sat the final 12 minutes after shooting 6 for 22 from the field, possibly worn down from playing 46 minutes Sunday in a quadruple-overtime loss in Atlanta and 32 more Tuesday in a loss at Washington, when Porzingis sat out while sick. Instead, the Knicks rallied behind Hernangomez, who had 16 points and 16 rebounds, and Vujacic, who made team history by converting a pair of four-point plays in the game. ""It was a huge game for us,"" Porzingis said. ""Last night, obviously, we didn't have a great game, so tonight we felt like this was a must-win for us and somehow we did it."" The only other starter on the floor for the comeback was Jennings -- and he was only starting because point guard Rose remained out with a sprained ankle. ""We know that second unit. They did a similar thing to us in the Garden,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""They were kind of the difference maker in our game at the Garden. They got us again tonight."" The Knicks never led through three quarters and were down 10 when Porzingis and Hernangomez -- former teammates in Spain for Seville -- helped spark a 16-2 run to open an 82-78 advantage on Justin Holiday's 3-pointer with 5:11 to play. ""I looked up one time, there was like five minutes, I was like, `Ain't no way I'm going back in there,"" Anthony said. ""These guys had it rolling, there wasn't no need for us to go back in there and kind of break up what they had going on."" They put it away when Porzingis had his 3-pointer bounce in for a 92-86 lead with 30 seconds left. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 16 for the Nets, who lost their seventh straight and fell to 0-9 against Atlantic Division opponents this season. The Knicks had lost the first two games of this road trip to finish January at 5-12 and appeared to have no energy for most of this one. But now they have five straight at home as they hope to get back into the Eastern Conference playoff race. Vujacic finished with 12 points, and Jennings had 10 assists. TIP-INS Knicks: New York improved to just 2-9 on the second night of back-to-back games. ... The Knicks snapped a four-game losing streak in Brooklyn. Nets: The Nets have lost 10 in a row at home. ... The 38 points the Nets allowed in the first half were the fewest they've given up in any half this season. ... Brooklyn shook up the starting lineup, with Hollis-Jefferson replacing Trevor Booker and Isaiah Whitehead in for Spencer Dinwiddie. ROSE REPORT Rose said he was out of the walking boot he had been wearing and had started shooting. He hopes to begin running Thursday or Friday with the possibility of returning Saturday against Cleveland. BIG APPLE BASKETBALL Atkinson grew up in New York and was an assistant for four years with the Knicks, and understands the Nets are fighting to win fans since moving to Brooklyn in 2012. ""I would say we are off-Broadway right now and we're trying to get on and we know it's a long road and difficult road,"" he said. ""But we're trying to get in that conversation, in the New York conversation.""","400899394"
"CLEVELAND -- Upon arriving at Quicken Loans Arena, the Cavaliers received commemorative watches, the latest gifts to celebrate their NBA championship. The Los Angeles Clippers then handed them a second straight loss. J.J. Redick scored 23 points, Blake Griffin matched a career high with 11 assists and the Clippers bounced back from a brutal loss with a 113-94 victory on Thursday night over the Cavs, who have lost two straight for the first time since winning their title. Afterward, there was no panic inside Cleveland's locker room, but rather a measured response to the first real adversity this season. The Cavs also lost in Milwaukee on Tuesday, but LeBron James isn't worried -- yet. ""Two pretty poor games for sure,"" said James, who scored 16 but had five turnovers. ""You're hoping they're not back-to-back, but it happens. Now, three games in a row? That's something to talk about. We need to figure it out. It's different from football where you have to wait a whole week to redeem yourself. ""We get right back at it tomorrow night so we'll be all right."" Chris Paul shook off some early foul trouble and scored 16 and DeAndre Jordan had 15 rebounds for the Clippers, who came in hungry after blowing an 18-point lead and falling in double overtime at Brooklyn on Tuesday. ""It's who we are, I really believe that,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. ""We actually played to our potential. We had some adversity, which is great. Chris got in foul trouble and we extend the lead. It was a team win."" Los Angeles took control with a 13-2 run to open the third quarter. Kyrie Irving scored 28 and Kevin Love 16 for the Cavs, who were outplayed for the second game in a row. During Tuesday's loss, coach Tyronn Lue pulled his starters in the second half and J.R. Smith wandered off the floor during play and gave up an easy basket. This wasn't much better as Lue pulled James, Irving, Smith, Love and Tristan Thompson with seven minutes left as it became very clear there would be no comeback for the Cavs, who are in their first true slump since winning the title in June. ""They were motivated and they came out and played like a desperate team,"" Lue said. Cleveland failed to make 10 3-pointers for the first time this season, ending its league record to start a season at 16 games. The Clippers outscored the Cavs 27-15 in the third, when James and Co. showed frustration and briefly lost their focus. Irving and Thompson argued on the floor during a timeout, and James was later called for a technical when he pushed the Clippers' Alan Anderson to the floor while being fouled on a layup. The Clippers, who opened the season 14-2, took advantage of Cleveland's sloppiness at the start of the third quarter and scored eight quick points before Paul's 3-pointer gave them a 71-52 lead. ""We played the right way,"" Paul said. ""It was important for us to see what it felt like to win a game, when you're running them off like we were and you lose three in a row, you need to get that feeling back just to get your locker room back right."" MR. CUB James isn't happy about having to wear a Cubs uniform -- minus the cleats -- to Friday's game in Chicago after he lost a bet on the World Series to Dwyane Wade. James wagered on the Cleveland Indians, who were beaten in seven games. ""I fill my bet,"" he said. ""Don't make fun of me guys."" TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles had a season-high 33 assists. .. Rivers was fined $15,000 by the NBA for his outburst in Tuesday's loss. He was assessed two technicals and ejected by referee Ken Mauer. ""Not shocked at all,"" Rivers said of the penalty given ""for verbally abusing a game official and failing to leaving the court in a timely manner after his ejection."" Rivers added, ""It was low, so I'm good with it."" ... Redick has made a 3-pointer in 76 straight games, the longest active streak in the league. Cavaliers: James moved past Bob Cousy (6,955) for 16th place on the career assists list. ... G/F Mike Dunleavy was a late scratch because of a concussion. Dunleavy was hit in the head during Tuesday's loss at Milwaukee, but didn't begin showing symptoms until Thursday, according to a team spokesman. ...

"NEW YORK --  The Brooklyn Nets dominated inside the paint and off the bench to beat the Orlando Magic. Brook Lopez scored 30 points and Trevor Booker had a season-high 23 in a reserve role to lead the Nets to a 121-111 victory on Saturday. ""That must have been Booker's best game of the year, probably,"" Jeremy Lin said. ""He was incredible with the energy."" Sean Kilpatrick added 15 points for the Nets, who snapped a two-game losing streak. Booker and Kilpatrick helped Brooklyn's bench outscore Orlando's 72-16. Brooklyn also had a season-high 72 points in the paint. ""Brook is really hard to guard down there,"" Lin said. ""We keep trying to find ways to exploit the defense with his size and his touch. I think he's finding a great balance inside and outside. I felt like he really made his presence known tonight."" Elfrid Payton had 20 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds for his fifth triple-double of the season for Orlando, which has lost four straight games. Nikola Vucevic had 27 points and 11 rebounds, while Aaron Gordon finished with 22 points and 15 boards. ""I think we were just a little step slow today,"" Payton said. ""They were really driving the paint. Just hard drive after hard drive and kick out until they got something they liked."" Brooklyn opened the fourth quarter on an 11-0 run to take a 100-89 lead and never looked back. ""I think Brooklyn's bench came in and took over the game during that stretch to start the fourth quarter to build a big lead,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""I credit their bench."" Orlando rallied from a seven-point deficit at halftime to tie the score at 89 heading into the fourth quarter. Vucevic scored 12 points in the third. Brooklyn took a 60-53 lead into halftime. Lopez led Brooklyn with 18 points while Gordon and Vucevic led Orlando with 13 points apiece at the half. Orlando opened the game with a 15-5 run before Brooklyn rallied to tie the score at 33 apiece after the first quarter. TIP-INS Magic: Vogel has been impressed with Terrence Ross since arriving from Toronto in a midseason trade. ""He's exceeded our expectations,"" Vogel said. ""We knew he was a good scorer off the bench. We're using him as a starter and with heavy minutes. He's a dynamic offensive player with his 3-point shooting and you can put the ball in his hands and he makes good decisions. He can attack long closeouts and get to the rim too with athleticism. He's multidimensional offensively and one of our better perimeter defenders as well."" . Jeff Green (sore lower back) was out. Nets: Brooklyn doesn't plan on resting veteran players. ""We're not going to rest,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I've been saying how important I think it is for us to finish this season strong and I do think seeing more of Jeremy together with the group is helpful. Our mentality is to have positive momentum heading into this important offseason."" ... Quincy Acy (sore left ankle) and Joe Harris (sprained left shoulder) were out. BENCH BUNCH Brooklyn's bench came in averaging 45.5 points, second in the league to the Lakers' 48.0. The 72 points Saturday was the Nets' third-highest total this season. They had 81 points on March 23 at Phoenix and 73 on Jan. 20 at New Orleans.","400899396"
"MIAMI --  Ask anyone in the Miami Heat locker room how this is happening, and the answers will all be largely the same. They can't explain. That doesn't bother them, either. The NBA's hottest team stayed that way Wednesday night, as Goran Dragic scored 27 points, Dion Waiters added 20 and the Heat had no trouble with the Atlanta Hawks on the way to a 116-93 win. It was the ninth straight win for the Heat, the longest current run in the league and Miami's best streak since winning 10 in a row from Nov. 12-Dec. 1, 2013. ""We're just having fun,"" Waiters said. It matched the largest victory margin of the season for Miami (20-30), which plays its next six games against opponents with losing records. A team that was on the cusp of having the NBA's worst record just a couple weeks ago is now in the thick of a playoff race, and dominated a Hawks team that beat Miami in the first two matchups between the clubs this season. ""A lot of credit to Miami. They're playing really, really good basketball,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""You can see why they've won nine games in a row now. Both ends of the court, their activity, their aggressiveness, just really impressed with their players, their coaching staff, everything they're doing."" Hassan Whiteside scored 18 points and grabbed 18 rebounds for the Heat. James Johnson scored 16 points before getting ejected in the fourth quarter for Miami (20-30). Kent Bazemore scored 14 and Dennis Schroder scored 12 for the Hawks (28-21). ""They're doing a great job,"" Schroder said after complimenting Waiters, Dragic, Johnson and Whiteside. ""And we didn't."" Atlanta's Taurean Prince was ejected midway through the fourth quarter for pulling Whiteside down from behind and being assessed a flagrant two. James Johnson retaliated in Whiteside's defense and was ejected after getting a technical. That was about the only moment in which the game was competitive after halftime. Miami tied San Antonio for the third-best streak in the NBA this season, with only Golden State (12) and Houston (10) having more consecutive wins. ""It hasn't been about the result for us,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We felt like our team was getting better. And throughout all of it, you do have to maintain perspective.""

Waiters has at least 17 points in each of his last seven games. HOUSTON, HELLO With the Hawks going to Houston on Thursday, it should mark Howard's first time playing there as an opponent since Dec. 4, 2012. Howard spent the last three seasons with the Rockets, averaging 16 points and 11.7 rebounds. He signed a three-year, $70.5 million deal with the Hawks last summer.

"ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Hawks could feel another game slipping away, a common theme in this most inconsistent of seasons. Paul Millsap bailed them out. Millsap banked in a shot off a spinning drive with 30.5 seconds remaining, and the Hawks held off the rallying Dallas Mavericks for a 100-95 victory Wednesday night. Millsap took a pass from Dennis Schroder at the top edge of the lane, dribbled to his left, twirled back to his right and knocked down the shot over Dorian Finney-Smith, giving the Hawks a 96-95 lead after they squandered a 12-point edge. ""Coach drew up a play, and I just had to make the shot,"" Millsap said. ""It's that simple. You get the opportunity, you've got to make it."" Harrison Barnes missed a chance to put the Mavericks back in front, his jumper off the mark with Kent Bazemore right in his face. Ersan Ilyasova was fouled by Finney-Smith going for the rebound and knocked down both free throws to extend Atlanta's lead with 11.1 seconds left. Dallas still had a chance to force overtime, but Seth Curry slipped on the inbounds pass and Bazemore scooped up the loose ball, taking off the other way for a dunk that clinched the victory. ""That's not the critical play,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""The critical play is the loose-ball foul call on Finney-Smith. When that referee sees it, he's going to have a sleepless night. That's all I can tell you."" Millsap had 18 points and just missed a triple-double, dishing out 10 assists to go with eight rebounds. Ilyasova also finished with 18 points. Barnes led the Mavericks with 25 points. The Hawks were up nearly the entire game, but the Mavericks fought back in the final quarter. Barnes knocked down a 3-pointer with 4:05 remaining to put Dallas ahead 90-87 -- its first lead since the opening minutes. Seth Curry, who finished with 21 points, extended the margin to 93-89 with another 3 -- his fifth of the game. But the Hawks finished with an 11-2 spurt of their own in a sloppy game that the home team just couldn't put away, despite shooting a season-best 56.3 percent from the field. Atlanta had 23 turnovers, while the Mavericks gave it up 22 times -- nearly double their NBA-low average of 11.8 turnovers coming into the game. At one point in the fourth quarter, the teams combined to turn it over on five straight possessions. ""They threw a lot at us,"" Bazemore said, especially a 2/3 zone that seemed to throw off the Hawks after what had been a hot-shooting night until the final period. ""We still tried to run our stuff. We've got to do a better job of executing."" GHANA IN THE HOUSE Ben Bentil made his NBA debut for the Mavericks. The Ghana native was a second-round pick by the Boston Celtics, but didn't make the team. He had played in the D-League and even did a stint in China before signing a 10-day contract with the Mavericks. Bentil entered the game in the second quarter. He failed to score in 4 1/2 minutes of playing time. DOUBLING UP After being ejected from Atlanta's last game, Dwight Howard made it all the way through this time. He had 14 points and 12 rebounds, his 39th double-double of the season. Howard entered the night tied for sixth in the league in double-doubles. NOWITZKI WATCH Dirk Nowitzki moved a step closer to becoming just the sixth player in NBA history to score 30,000 points. He had 11 points to push his career total to 29,952, leaving him just 48 shy of joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain in the exclusive club.","400899398"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- The Sacramento Kings were ending a grueling stretch of five games in seven nights with a long back-to-back from New Orleans to Minnesota. Getting 66 points from the bench helps overcome tough travel. Buddy Hield tied a career high with 22 points, going 4 of 6 from 3-point range, and the Kings' reserves dominated Minnesota's in a 123-117 victory on Saturday night. Reserve point guard Ty Lawson had 21 points and 11 assists. Langston Galloway added 17 points and Aaron Afflalo scored 16 to lead the Kings' 66-26 advantage in bench points. ""I commend our second group coming in and giving us that energy because we really needed, especially on a back-to-back and the stretch that we're on,"" center Willie Cauley-Stein said. ""That was much-needed for us because it could have easily went the other way and got real ugly."" The Kings recovered after losing by 28 points a night earlier at New Orleans against former Kings star DeMarcus Cousins. Sacramento shot a season-high 56.4 percent to win for the sixth time in 15 games since trading Cousins on Feb. 21. ""It's a struggle playing five games in seven nights,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""This was tough. It was a good test for our young guys to mentally fight through."" Andrew Wiggins scored 32 points for Minnesota, which had won five of its previous six homes games. A game after scoring a career-high 33 points, Ricky Rubio had 11 points on just 1-of-10 shooting, and added 13 assists. Karl-Anthony Towns had 26 points and 11 rebounds for the Timberwolves. ""We didn't do what we needed to do,"" Towns said. ""It's as simple as that. We didn't keep them out of the paint. We also let them hit too many 3s. That comes from ball pressure and doing the little things in our defensive scheme."" The Kings looked like weary road travelers early, as Minnesota had another quick start with 31 points in the first quarter. Sacramento had nine turnovers in the first and shot 43.8 percent. The bench got the Kings back in the game and then Sacramento took control with a 26-9 run at the end of the third and start of the fourth. Lawson scored 12 points in the second half and was 11 of 14 from the free-throw line in the game. TIP-INS Kings: Tyreke Evans, Kosta Koufos and Garrett Temple were ruled out for planned rest. ... Cauley-Stein had 15 points and 10 rebounds for his fifth double-double of the season -- all since the All-Star break. ... Sacramento is 15-25 on the road, including two wins in Minnesota. Timberwolves: G Zach LaVine was chosen the Flip Saunders Legacy Award recipient. The award, named after Minnesota's former coach, recognizes excellence in community service and is voted on by the team's players. ... Rubio had his third straight double-double and 22nd of the season. ... The Wolves are 19-20 at home this season. HIELD HITTING Given a chance for more minutes since being traded for Cousins, Hield has responded. The rookie entered the game averaging 13.9 points and shooting 48.5 percent from the field and 41.0 percent from 3 in his 19 games with Sacramento. Saturday was his fifth 20-point performance and third with the Kings. ""I think that's Buddy Hield's best game as a pro,"" Joerger said. ""Whether he made shots or not, he's learning to do the other things; when we help, when we don't. Some of it is just learning to be a pro and some of it is learning how we do it in Sacramento. I thought he did a really nice job."" DEFENSIVE SLIDE Minnesota won nine of 13 games in February and early March and seemed to be adjusting to coach Tom Thibodeau's defensive approach. The Wolves held opponents under 100 points in seven of the 13 games. The 123 points scored by Sacramento was the fourth time an opponent reached that mark in the past eight games. ""We've got to keep working at it,"" Thibodeau said. ""I thought our starters got us off to a good start and our bench came in and we had reckless fouls. We had some tough shots. ... We've got to straighten that out.""","400899399"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  Stan Van Gundy has spent the last six weeks searching for a group among his Detroit Pistons that could shut down opposing offenses at the end of games. The coach might have found one Wednesday night. Led by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and four reserves, the Pistons overcame an eight-point third-quarter deficit and beat the New Orleans Hornets 118-98. In the final 17 minutes of the game, Detroit outscored the Pelicans 52-24. ""That group turned the game around,"" Van Gundy said. ""Our bench played well against their bench in the first half, but they did it in the second half against the New Orleans starters. That was impressive."" Caldwell-Pope has always been Detroit's top perimeter defender, but he dominated the game on both ends Wednesday night. He scored 38 points, easily surpassing his previous career best of 31, and only fell short of a 40-point game by missing two free throws with 1:01 to play. ""Once I got past my career high, I was going for 40,"" he said. ""I was having a lot of fun out there, and my teammates did a great job of giving me the ball."" Caldwell-Pope made a career-high eight 3-pointers on 11 attempts. ""When he's doing that, all we do is feed him the ball,"" said Ish Smith, who replaced Reggie Jackson at point guard for Detroit's winning surge. ""It's not complicated."" Clippers coach Alvin Gentry, always willing to compliment an opposing player, said he wasn't surprised by Caldwell-Pope's scoring. ""They've got a guy who is one of the most explosive players in the NBA, and he went off on us,"" he said. Tobias Harris added 19 points and Andre Drummond 17 for the Pistons, who ended an eight-game losing streak to New Orleans. Detroit had lost three in a row overall. ""It has always been about getting stops for us,"" Aron Baynes said. ""It has been like that all year, and that's what we were doing tonight."" Anthony Davis, who scored a career-high 59 points last February at Detroit, had 31 points and 12 rebounds, while Jrue Holliday added 22 points and 11 assists. The Pelicans shot 50 percent from the floor, but their 15 turnovers led to 26 Detroit points. ""When they get 26 points on 15 turnovers, that means they are scoring almost every time we turn it over,"" Gentry said. ""That's a great defensive team, but those weren't forced turnovers. We were making mistakes and giving them easy baskets."" The first quarter started the scoring duel between Davis and Caldwell-Pope. Caldwell-Pope had 17 points to Davis' 16 as the Pistons built a 34-30 lead. Davis kept going in the second quarter, but his 23 points in the half weren't enough to keep the Pistons from taking a 60-54 lead. Detroit shot 57.8 percent, while the Pelicans were at 57.9 percent, but made five 3-pointers to one for New Orleans. The Pelicans regained the lead midway through the third period, using a 12-0 run to go up 74-66. Solomon Hill provided the final six points with back-to-back 3-pointers. That's when Van Gundy went with Caldwell-Pope, Baynes, Smith, Tobias Harris and Stanley Johnson. ""Our first group was just walking around,"" he said. ""I called one timeout and nothing changed, so it was time to try something else."" Detroit's reserves got the Pistons back into the game, and Caldwell-Pope's buzzer-beating 3-pointer gave them an 83-81 lead at the end of the quarter. Van Gundy stayed with his backups at the start of the fourth, only keeping one starter on the floor, and the Pistons built a 98-87 lead with 7:32 to play. ""We had some bad possessions and we didn't hit shots,"" Dante Cunningham said. ""Everything we did wrong, they capitalized."" TIP INS Pelicans: Davis' 59-point game last February also set The Palace single-game scoring record -- a mark likely to survive the last months of the arena's history. He has scored at least 30 points in his last three games against Detroit. Pistons: Caldwell-Pope's 17 first-quarter points were the most in a quarter by a Pistons player this season. ... Detroit's last win over New Orleans came on Feb. 4, 2012. No one in Wednesday's game played in that one. Celtics rookie Payton Pritchard is out at least two weeks after suffering a grade one MCL sprain in his right knee. Clippers coach Ty Lue says he is still working to get over the death of his former teammate and friend Kobe Bryant.","400899400"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard joked that no team goes into the season hoping to play at .500. Yet the Trail Blazers were happy to pull to 38-38 on the season Saturday night with a 130-117 victory over the Phoenix Suns. Lillard had 31 points as Portland continued its late-season push for the playoffs with a sixth straight victory. ""We feel like we're the team right now that we should have been all along, the way we're playing. And all that matters is getting that playoff spot,"" Lillard said. ""I guess it's good to be .500, but nobody comes into the season saying, `Let's play .500 basketball.' We wish we were in a better position."" CJ McCollum added 29 points for Portland, which holds the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Blazers (38-38) led by as many as 25 points and got back to .500 for the first time since they were 12-12 on Dec. 9. Devin Booker had 31 for the Suns, who lost their 11th straight for the fifth-longest losing streak in franchise history. Phoenix was just ahead of the Lakers at the bottom of the Western Conference. ""We're here to get better by not making the same mistakes,"" Booker said.  ""We're getting a chance to play, but we need to treat it like it's do-or-die time. It's not often that rookies get this many minutes so as a young group we need to come together and play like we're trying to do something here."" The Blazers played their first game without Jusuf Nurkic since announcing that he had a fractured right leg and will miss the rest of the regular season. The 7-foot center was credited with boosting Portland's late-season surge. In 20 games since coming to the Blazers in a trade with Denver, Nurkic was averaging 15.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 1.9 blocks. Nurkic, who has a non-displaced right leg fibular fracture, will be re-evaluated in two weeks. It was unclear when the injury occurred. ""The goal is still to make the playoffs and everybody will have to do more,"" coach Terry Stotts said. Grateful that the injury wasn't more serious, Nurkic said he will follow what the team doctors say so that he can return quicker. ""It's part of the life, part of the job. I'm not going to be negative,"" he said before the game. Meyers Leonard started in Nurkic's place. The Suns pulled within four at 99-95 on Alan Williams' layup early in the fourth quarter. But after a pair of free throws, Al-Farouq Aminu dunked to extend Portland's lead to 103-95. The Blazers jumped out to an early 20-6 lead after McCollum's 3-pointer. Aminu pushed the lead to 32-15 with another 3. The Suns had no spark and Portland extended its lead to 48-25 on Maurice Harkless' reverse layup and Evan Turner's 3-pointer in the second quarter. Phoenix closed the gap to 61-53 on a follow dunk from Marquese Chriss and T.J. Warren's fast-break dunk late in the half, and the Blazers went into the break with a 63-53 lead. McCollum led all scorers with 14 points. Booker's layup got the Suns within 63-55, but McCollum and Lillard made consecutive 3-pointers to pull away again. Lillard hit a 3-pointer from about 30 feet out to give Portland an 84-69 lead, then raised his arms as the crowd erupted in cheers. ""Our guys are young, they're still fighting,"" Phoenix coach Earl Watson said. ""They're still trying to create an identity."" TIP INS Suns: Phoenix was without Leandro Barbosa for the fourth straight game because of right hamstring spasms. ... The Suns won only the first of the four-game season series with the Blazers. Trail Blazers: The Blazers recalled guard Tim Quarterman from the Long Island Nets of the NBA Development League. ... Stotts wore a University of Oregon pullover in his pregame chat with the media. The Blazers' game started at about halftime of the Ducks' Final Four game against North Carolina. LILLARD'S NEW MILESTONES: Lillard keeps adding to his legacy as a Trail Blazer. With his 31 points Saturday night, he reached 1,902 for the season, a new career high. He also had his 26th game of the season with 30 or more points, tying the franchise record reached by Kiki Vandeweghe and Clyde Drexler.","400899401"
"DALLAS --  Salah Mejri combined to play only nine minutes in Dallas' recent victories over San Antonio and Cleveland. The Mavericks got another nice victory Wednesday night, and Mejri wasn't left out of this one. The Tunisian center had 16 points and a career-high 17 rebounds, Seth Curry scored 22 points and Dallas beat the Philadelphia 76ers 113-95 for its third win in a row and fifth in six games. The 7-foot-1 Mejri played 21 minutes with Andrew Bogut out of action and helped Dallas -- the NBA's worst-rebounding team -- set a season high for boards and outrebound the Sixers 51-39. He scored 10 points, all on dunks, early in the fourth quarter to help the Mavericks lead by 22. Mejri's point total was one shy of his career high. ""They've been looking for me now that I'm a `hot player,"" said Mejri, laughing as he made air quotes to highlight his sudden scoring prowess. ""When it's there, it's there. I felt like I needed to join the party with everybody else because we had two big wins on back to backs."" Harrison Barnes added 16 points for Dallas, and Devin Harris had 14. Jahlil Okafor led the 76ers with 16 points, and Ersan Ilyasova added 13 points and 10 boards. Philadelphia played without starters Robert Covington (bruised right hand) and Joel Embiid (left knee contusion). The Mavericks led by just four points with three minutes left in the third quarter, but Harris hit back-to-back 3s to start a 13-5 run that gave the Mavericks an 81-69 lead. ""It happened so fast,"" Okafor said. ""We didn't get stops, they hit a bunch of 3s. We turned the ball over. We also missed shots that we always make or usually make."" Mejri then scored 10 of Dallas' first 12 points in the fourth, opening the lead to 93-74. TIP-INS 76ers: Rookie Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot made the first start of his career in place of Covington and scored seven points. Mavericks: Mejri reached his season high in rebounds in the first half alone, with 12 boards in just 11 minutes. ... Guards J.J. Barea (left calf strain) and Deron Williams (left big toe sprain) and Bogut (right hamstring strain) missed another game. YOGI BEARS DOWN Yogi Ferrell, who scored a career-high 19 points against Cleveland on Monday, had 11 points and five assists in 38 minutes Wednesday in just his third game with the team. He even blocked a shot by Okafor, who is 11 inches taller. Ferrell also brought the crowd to its feet late in the third quarter when he knocked the ball away from Philadelphia's Sergio Rodriguez on a fast break and his momentum carried him headfirst into the first row of spectators. ""I'm going to get out there and communicate with my guys defensively, and offensively I'm going to run the team,"" Ferrell said. ""Make the smart pass, knock down the shot if it's open and just be a catalyst."" RIGHT ON THE BUTTON The Mavericks used a 26-8 run to turn a nine-point second-quarter deficit into a 50-41 lead before the Sixers scored the last six points of the half. The run started after a Dallas timeout in which coach Rick Carlisle drew a picture of a reset button on his clipboard and had Curry push it after the guard had three first-quarter turnovers. Curry and Barnes combined to score the last 13 points of the run. ""I had to get my mind right and get into the game,"" Curry said. ""That was just a fun thing he did in the timeout that got me going.""","400899402"
"MIAMI --  For the first time all season, the Miami Heat are over .500 at home. And they got there with a wire-to-wire win. Tyler Johnson scored 24 points off the bench, the Heat had six players in double figures and they rolled past the Philadelphia 76ers 125-98 on Wednesday night. Wayne Ellington made six 3-pointers for 18 points for Miami, which has won 10 of its past 11 at home. Hassan Whiteside, Dion Waiters and Goran Dragic all scored 15 for the Heat, and Whiteside also grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds. ""Our guys understand our strength is in numbers,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. James Johnson scored 14 for Miami. The Heat shot 54 percent and topped 120 points for the third time this season, with two of those coming against Philadelphia. The Heat also made 13 3-pointers, giving them 65 in their past five games -- a first in franchise history. ""I felt like was in rhythm,"" Tyler Johnson said. Robert Covington scored 19 for the 76ers, who learned earlier Wednesday that center Joel Embiid will miss the remainder of the season with a left knee injury. ""I give Miami a lot of credit. They exposed us individually, our inability to guard them,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""But that type of result has not been us. It's part of the NBA landscape -- we win together, we lose together and we move on."" Richaun Holmes scored 15 and T.J. McConnell added 14 for Philadelphia, which lost its third straight. ""They got layups,"" Holmes said, ""and when you get layups, the rim gets bigger."" Ellington was 5 for 7 from 3-point range in the fourth quarter, while Spoelstra kept his starters off the floor. It was the first time Miami faced Philadelphia since the 76ers snapped a 13-game winning streak by the Heat last month -- and Ellington said the memories of how the 76ers celebrated that night lingered into Wednesday. ""We didn't forget,"" Ellington said. ""We didn't forget. They were pretty excited when they snapped our streak. ... We wanted to come out and give our energy and our best effort, and it turned out to be a great win for us.""

Gerald Henderson (left hip soreness) missed the second half. ... McConnell shot 5 for 7, with five rebounds and five assists. Heat: Miami paid tribute to the cast of ""Moonlight"" -- the Miami-based film that won Best Picture at this year's Oscars -- during a timeout in the second quarter. Some of the children involved with the film met with Heat forward Udonis Haslem pregame. ""Just an amazing experience,"" cast member Alex Hibbert said. ... The Heat play 10 times at home in March, with the next one being a visit from LeBron James and Cleveland on Saturday. ""SPO"" HONORED Spoelstra was the Eastern Conference coach of the month for February, his seventh time winning the monthly honor.

""I think it's a John Wooden quote: It's amazing what you can accomplish when nobody cares who gets the credit. That's the way this staff is,"" Spoelstra said. REVOLVING DOOR Because of injuries and trades, the 76ers used four starting lineups in four games against Miami this season. In all, 10 different 76ers started at some point against Miami -- with only Henderson starting all four times.

"DENVER --  Marc Gasol is a big fan of Denver big man Nikola Jokic. That said, he sure didn't mind taking advantage of his absence Wednesday night. Gasol scored 24 points, Mike Conley had 18 and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the short-handed Nuggets 119-99. Memphis led for most of the game and won its third in a row, all on the road, and fourth in five games. ""It feels like we've finally got a good little stride going,"" Conley said. ""I definitely think this is one of the best stretches we've played."" Emmanuel Mudiay had 14 points, seven assists and six rebounds in his return to the Nuggets' lineup. Denver came in without Jokic (left hip flexor strain) and Will Barton (left ankle soreness). Jokic averaged 23 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in January before getting hurt. The injury deprived Gasol the chance to play against the 21-year-old Serb. ""I love Jokic. I love him,"" Gasol said. ""That's one of the reasons I watch Denver is because of Nikola. I love his game."" The Nuggets were trying to overcome his absence when two more players went down. Point guard Jameer Nelson was ejected just 4:07 into the game, leaving the Nuggets with three guards, and leading scorer Danilo Gallinari exited late in the third quarter with a left groin strain. Nuggets coach Michael Malone said Nelson was hit with two quick technicals after he went to the bench with two fouls. ""J.T. Orr made the decision to give him a tech, Jameer had something to add and he gave him another tech,"" Malone said. ""That's where the referee can walk away, give a warning. J.T. felt it warranted a second tech and that's his prerogative as an official."" That compromised Malone's ability to match up with Memphis. ""This was one of the harder games I've had to coach all year. We're already thin because of injuries and then Jameer gets thrown out (four) minutes into the game,"" he said. ""So trying to juggle all that and Gallo goes down, it was a very tough game from every facet."" The Grizzlies took advantage of a tired Nuggets team that lost on the road to the Lakers on Tuesday. They led by 16 in the first half and increased it to 19 in the third when Gasol had 10 points. Memphis stretched the lead to 25 midway through the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Grizzlies: The last time Memphis won three in a row was when it reeled off five straight from Dec. 1-10. The last of those was a 21-point win over Golden State. ... G Wade Baldwin IV was assigned to the Iowa Energy of the D League on Tuesday. Nuggets: Malone said Gallinari will get an MRI on Thursday morning. He said it appeared the groin bothered him throughout the first half before giving way in the third quarter. ... Barton had an MRI done on his injured left ankle, but the results weren't announced. He missed 11 games during two different stretches earlier this season with a left ankle injury. ... The Nuggets were held below 100 points for the first time in 12 games. BRIGHT FUTURE Memphis coach David Fizdale was around Nuggets forward Mike Miller for three seasons when they were both with the Miami Heat, and even back then he saw the makings of a coach -- or more. ""Mike is a super-high IQ player and guys always like him,"" Fizdale said. ""Mike can do anything he wanted to in basketball. If Mike wanted to be a GM, he can be a GM; if he wanted to coach, he can coach."" Miller has played sparingly in his one-plus season with Denver, but he still is a commanding presence in the locker room. Fizdale said that's because he can relate to anyone. ""Mike Miller just has a brotherly quality about him,"" Fizdale said. ""He relates to everyone; that's the thing that makes him special. No matter what color you are, what year you are in the league, it doesn't matter. He finds a way to connect with his guys.""","400899404"
"MILWAUKEE --  The way Nikola Jokic is playing, even his teammates are astonished. With his second triple-double in two nights, Jokic led the Denver Nuggets to a 110-98 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday. The 22-year-old center finished with 13 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists for his fourth career triple-double -- all in his last 13 games. ""Amazing, amazing,"" Nuggets forward Danilo Gallinari said. ""That is all I can tell you. (Jokic) is playing great for us."" Gallinari scored 22 points for Denver, which built a 31-point lead despite playing without point guard Jameer Nelson (illness) for the first time this season. The Nuggets, coming off a victory Tuesday at Chicago, have won back-to-back road games for the first time this season. They've also won consecutive games for the first time since taking three straight Jan. 24-28. Milwaukee's Khris Middleton finished with a season-high 21 points to go with five rebounds and five assists. The Bucks also got 15 points and nine rebounds from Giannis Antetokounmpo, but failed in their attempt to win back-to-back home games for the first time since Jan. 2. ""In our locker room right now, we don't understand the urgency -- we're young -- of what we're fighting for and that's a playoff spot,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""This is growing pains. This is something we have to go through, the process of understanding we don't have that many games left. And our energy and effort has to be high."" Once Denver's 31-point cushion was significantly trimmed, the Nuggets could no longer rest their starters. After Matthew Dellavedova's basket cut Denver's lead to 90-77 with 8:41 left, Gallinari and Jokic walked to the scorer's table. And after Greg Monroe's offensive rebound and layup got Milwaukee to 94-82 with 6:57 remaining, Wilson Chandler and rookie Jamal Murray, starting in place of Nelson, got up off the bench. ""When we put our guys back in, obviously Nikola has that kind of impact where he is a calming influence,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""You put the ball in his hands, keep on cutting, keep on moving and something good is going to happen."" That was as close as the Bucks got, but their rally did give Jokic a chance to get another triple-double. He needed three more points when he re-entered the game and surpassed it on his jumper with 4:22 left. Jokic totaled 19 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists against the Bulls. Denver led 84-53 after Murray stole the ball from Middleton, which led to a layup by Gary Harris with 3:50 left in the third. TIP-INS Nuggets: Malone earned the 100th win of his three-year coaching career. . Nelson remained at the team hotel. Bucks: Milwaukee honored Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at halftime for the Presidential Medal of Freedom he recently received from President Barack Obama. . The Bucks have lost 12 of their last 14 against Denver. LINEUP CHANGES Milwaukee second-year guard Rashad Vaughn made his first start of the season. He played five minutes and missed his only shot after playing 15 minutes Monday, one day after not even playing against Phoenix. Dellavedova came off the bench after starting the previous 16 games. He was 7 of 9 for 15 points after shooting a combined 3 for 22 for a total of just seven points in his last three games. ... Murray started for the third time this season and ended up with 10 points and five assists. BEASLEY SITS Milwaukee forward Michael Beasley did not play and will miss at least the next two games because of a left knee injury sustained Monday at Cleveland. He will then be re-evaluated.","400899405"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Desperately needing a victory to stay in the Eastern Conference playoff race, the Charlotte Hornets picked up one in a place they'd never won before. Kemba Walker scored 29 points to help Charlotte overcome Russell Westbrook's sixth straight triple-double to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 113-101 on Sunday. It was the Hornets' first win in Oklahoma City, a place where they'd been 0-8. Westbrook finished with 40 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. It was Westbrook's 40th triple-double of the season, putting him one behind Oscar Robertson's NBA record of 41, set during the 1961-62 season. It was Westbrook's first career triple-double against Charlotte. Frank Kaminsky had 18 points and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added 16 for Charlotte, which entered the day in 10th place in the East, two games behind Chicago, Indiana and Miami, who were tied for seventh. Charlotte has six games remaining. ""The readiness, one through 10 -- every guy that played contributed,"" Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. ""The starters got off to a great start, which is important against a good team on the road and then the guys off the bench got the cushion there in the fourth quarter, Jeremy Lamb especially, so we got contributions from everybody."" Walker went 6 of 12 from 3-point range. It was the 14th time this season Walker hit five or more 3-pointers in a game. Charlotte had 18 steals against Oklahoma City, the most in a regular-season game for the Hornets since Nov. 23, 2012, against Atlanta. The Hornets scored 35 points off 24 Oklahoma City turnovers. The Hornets ""want to play in the playoffs,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""They're laying it on the line their last five or six games. I like playing against desperate teams, because what it does is it exposes what you have to do to really compete at that extraordinary high level. ""Give Charlotte a lot of credit. They played an exceptional game. They played really, really well all the way around. They had a lot to do with how we played."" Charlotte seized control with a 13-0 run to open the second half, as the Thunder missed their first seven shots after halftime, allowing the Hornets to build a 72-54 lead. Westbrook ended Oklahoma City's scoring drought at the 6:24 mark and the Thunder closed within 12 points twice early in the fourth quarter, but Lamb, a former Thunder guard, scored nine points in a 13-4 run by Charlotte that made it 101-80 with 7:21 left. ""Coach ran a couple of plays for me and (Brian Roberts) just hit me and I was able to knock some shots down,"" Lamb said. ""That was a big point in the game and I was just happy to be able to knock something down and help the team."" An 8-0 spurt by Oklahoma City, capped by a layup by Andre Roberson, got the Thunder within 102-91 with 4:37 left but a three-point play by Cody Zeller keyed Charlotte. Oklahoma City shot out to a 13-6 lead, but the Hornets used a 28-9 run to go up 34-22 early in the second quarter. The Thunder pulled within 39-38, but Charlotte answered with a 16-4 run to build a 55-42 lead before Westbrook almost single-handedly cut the gap to 59-54 by halftime. TIP-INS: Hornets: Walker had four steals, moving him past 600 for his career. He's the fourth Hornets player to reach that number, joining Muggsy Bogues, Gerald Wallace and Dell Curry. ... Walker's 229 3-pointers this season are the second-most in a single season in Charlotte franchise history. Jason Richardson had 243 in 2007-08. ... Charlotte, which entered the game averaging the fewest turnovers in the NBA (11.5 per game), had 18 on Sunday. ... Lamb scored 13 points against his former team. Thunder: Taj Gibson returned to the starting lineup after missing Friday's game against San Antonio due to illness, but scored only four points in 13 minutes. ... Westbrook has 77 career triple-doubles -- fifth on the NBA's all-time list, one behind Wilt Chamberlain. ... To clinch a season triple-double, Westbrook needs 11 rebounds and 29 assists over the Thunder's final six games. ... Chicago is the only team against which Westbrook hasn't recorded a triple-double during his career. 15K FOR WESTBROOK Westbrook passed the 15,000-point career scoring mark during the game, but shook his head when asked about that milestone afterward. ""It's definitely something that I don't take for granted, to be able to play this game long enough to do that is a blessing in itself,"" he said. Asked about being one triple-double away from tying Robertson, Westbrook was even more succinct: ""We've got to win. That's my thoughts."" QUOTABLE: Clifford, on defending Westbrook: ""This was one of the best defensive games we've played in a while. I know he had 40 and we didn't make a lot of mistakes on him. He's just so good. ... We didn't have a lot of dumb fouls. He's such a great shot maker. He had 40, but I felt our defense on him was good.""","400899406"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Jazz coach Quin Snyder was extremely unhappy after the Milwaukee Bucks dropped 27 points on Utah in the first quarter Wednesday night. A stern reminder that the Jazz are a defense-first team, and things got back on track for the home team. Rudy Gobert scored 26 points and grabbed 15 rebounds, leading the Jazz to an easy 104-88 victory over the Bucks. The double-double was Gobert's 33rd of the season for the Jazz, who also got 27 points from Gordon Hayward. ""Our focus just has to be on defending,"" Snyder said. ""I was upset at the beginning of the game, because we came out and we were lackluster defensively. Then guys got focused and got energized and guarded. ""We've just got to be more consistent defensively."" Utah took a 61-43 lead into halftime after dominating the second quarter. The Jazz allowed the Bucks to score consecutive baskets just once in the second 12 minutes and their 31 points tied for the third-most they have scored in the second quarter this season. Gobert scored 15 of those 31. ""Just better communication, we let them go in pretty easy in the first quarter,"" Gobert said. ""We had to get locked in and make sure we do what we do. ""(Offensively), just tried to keep rolling and keep setting good screens. My teammates did a good job of finding me and passing me the ball in good position."" The Bucks shot well from 3-point range in the first quarter, going 5 for 8, but were just 4 for 15 the rest of the night. Milwaukee never led after the first quarter, and only led by two in that short time. Jabari Parker paced the Bucks with 17 points. TIP-INS Bucks: Rashad Vaughn was inactive with an illness. ... Giannis Antetokounmpo was held to nine points, the second time he hasn't scored double figures all season. He was sick and played under 10 minutes the only other time it happened. Jazz: Boris Diaw started in place of Derrick Favors (rest). ... Jeff Withey played 13 minutes and scored six points after playing one minute out of the previous five games. ... Rodney Hood suffered a right knee hyperextension in the first half and did not return. He missed five games with a hyperextension and bone contusion in the same knee in the middle of January. WORRISOME? Favors missed his second consecutive game due to rest, however the two games were separated by three days. Favors participated in practice twice in those three days, but only in the non-contact portions. He missed 13 games due to a left knee bone contusion between November and December. THIEVES The Bucks entered Wednesday ranked No. 8 in the league with 8.2 steals per game. ""Deflections and steals is something we've taken pride in,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""That's helped us when we do play defense and have success on the defensive end, it comes with our length ... which then turns to the next part of our game that we're pretty good at, and that's in the open-court transition. ... We've got to get our hands on balls and come up with steals."" QUOTABLE ""It takes the coaching staff to be able to come up with the game plan and then the players have to execute it,"" Kidd said. ""For us tonight, we didn't execute. We didn't rebound the ball. ""In that second quarter, you can look back and say that didn't rebound. We gave them second and third opportunities, and when you do that against teams in this league, it's going to put you in a position of playing catch up and that's what happened tonight.""","400899407"
"LOS ANGELES --  There were many times when Los Angeles Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell would have let early struggles ruin his entire game. Maturity can be a slow evolving game, but against the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday he was able to shrug off his first-quarter troubles and rebound to score 28 points in a 108-103 victory. Russell, 21, had four turnovers in the first quarter, but the second-year guard had only one more the rest of the game. ""I've seen more consistency in his professionalism and in his affecting the outcome of games, whether he's struggling or hitting shots,"" said Lakers coach Luke Walton. ""He had those early turnovers and before those games would kind of snowball and he would struggle the rest of the night."" Three Lakers joined Russell's effort by adding double-doubles, handing the Grizzlies a difficult loss. They fell to 42-35 on the season, 1 1/2 games back of Oklahoma City for the sixth spot in the Western Conference with five games to play. ""These are games that could have seeding impact for us,"" said Memphis guard Mike Conley. Conley overcame his own early struggles, scoring 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter, but missed a 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds to play that could have tied the game. Julius Randle had 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Lakers, while Larry Nance Jr. added 12 points and 14 boards. Thomas Robinson finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds, the first time the Lakers had three double-doubles in a game since Dec. 16, 2014 (Wesley Johnson, Jordan Hill and Ed Davis). The Lakers outrebounded the Grizzlies 51-33 and forced six turnovers in the fourth quarter. ""I just thought they caught us by surprise,"" Memphis guard Tony Allen said. ""Their speed, their second-chance points, pick-and-roll coverages, 50-50 balls. It was a little bit of everything."" Memphis picked up another 20 points from Troy Daniels off the bench, but no Grizzlies player ended up in double figures in rebounds. ""Our guys are tired of losing,"" Walton said. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Vince Carter, 40, was rested. He had appeared in 50 of the Grizzlies' last 51 games. ""He's running on fumes right now and giving me everything he has. I had to find a way to get him a break,"" coach David Fizdale said. ... C Marc Gasol missed his fourth consecutive game with a left foot strain. Lakers: The Lakers continue to lead the league in scoring (48.1 points per game) off the bench. That could have something to do with having used 23 different lineups. ... After having started 10 consecutive games, rookie center Ivica Zubac missed his second consecutive game with a sore right knee. OHIO STATE Both Conley and Russell were point guards for the Buckeyes. Conley is in his ninth NBA season. Said Russell: ""That's my guy. He's one of the vets I've looked up to for a long time. He's really paved the way for a guy like me."" PAINFUL WIN The victory could actually prove costly to the Lakers. They are now tied with Phoenix for the league's second-worst record (22-55). If the teams finish tied, they would combine the number of pingpong balls for second and third and then split them evenly in determining lottery picks.","400899408"
"NEW ORLEANS --  For all of power forward Anthony Davis' usual dominance, a feisty play by point guard Tim Frazier seemed to turn a tight game into a fourth-quarter romp for the previously slumping Pelicans. Davis had 33 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, Frazier's hustle play in the paint led to the ejection of Detroit center Andre Drummond, and New Orleans snapped a three-game skid with a 109-86 victory over the Pistons on Wednesday night. The 6-foot-11 Drummond was sent to the locker room for swatting at the back of Frazier's head after Frazier, who is 6-1, had ripped away a rebound late in the third quarter. Drummond had 13 points and 17 rebounds to that point, but also missed nine of 10 free throws. ""That turned the game around,"" Davis said, noting that Drummond was ""killing us on the boards."" ""That was just a good effort play by Tim to go and steal that rebound from him and get him a foul, and also what happened after that,"" Davis continued. ""It gave us a little momentum boost."" Drummond initially didn't seem inclined to discuss the play in the locker room, tersely answering the first three questions about it by saying, ""We lost the game."" ""One thing led to another, I was in the locker room. They won the game. Simple as that,"" Drummond then added. Asked if he was disappointed in his reaction to Frazier's feistiness, Drummond said he was ""disappointed our team lost. I wish I could have been out there to help out. We've got to shake this one off."" Jrue Holiday had 22 points for the Pelicans, who were without newly acquired All-Star DeMarcus Cousins because of Cousins' one-game suspension that was triggered when he received his 18th technical foul of this season Sunday night. Dante Cunningham added 16 for New Orleans, hitting four 3-pointers. Jon Leuer scored 22 points and Tobias Harris added 15 points for Detroit. But the Pistons had few answers for Davis, even when Drummond was in the game. ""You try to double AD and he's shooting over a double team, shooting floaters over everybody,"" Drummond said. ""He's obviously one of the best bigs in the league. And it's going to be tough to stop a player like that."" TURNING POINT Drummond's 10 offensive rebounds helped Detroit to a 21-13 advantage in second-chance points. His ejection made it tough for the Pistons, who'd played a night earlier, to keep pace down the stretch. Detroit trailed by only six at the time of the brief scuffle. Tensions rose when Drummond initially tried to seize his lost rebound back from Frazier and was slow to release his grip after officials had whistled him for a common foul. Frazier then ripped the ball away again and appeared to utter something angrily, at which point Drummond took his swat at a player he towered over, inciting a torrent of boos. ""I'm not going to back down from anybody,"" said Frazier, who was undrafted out of Penn State in 2014 and worked his way up from the NBA Development league. ""That's how I was raised and I had to fight for a lot to get where I am."" Officials reviewed the exchange on replay before increasing the severity of the call on Drummond to a flagrant-2 foul, triggering an ejection. Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said he felt Drummond lost his composure, describing his player's reaction as ""ridiculous."" The Pelicans then started to pull away when Holiday's 3 made it 88-78. Cunningham and E'Twaun Moore each added 3s soon after, and when Davis hit a short fade as he was fouled, New Orleans went up by 22. OFF THE MARK Detroit did itself in by going 3 for 17 from the foul line and 3 of 23 from beyond the 3-point line. The Pistons missed their first 11 free throws. ""I don't even know what to say. It's pretty hard to play like that,"" Van Gundy said. ""On top of that, it's incredibly disheartening when you make a good offensive play and you draw the foul and it amounts to zero. It's the same thing as a turnover. Yeah it was a really, really rough night."" TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond recorded his 100th steal of the season. He leads all NBA centers in that category. ... The Pistons finished with 23 offensive rebounds, the most New Orleans has allowed this season. Pelicans: Alexis Ajinca, seeing more playing time than usual because of Cousins' absence, had 10 points, eight rebounds and three blocks. ... Coach Alvin Gentry said 7-foot center Omer Asik of Turkey has not been with the team since it returned from the All-Star break because of an undisclosed illness that has lasted more than a week and has caused him to lose ""significant weight."" Asik was playing only sparingly before his illness.","400899409"
"MILWAUKEE --  Milwaukee's Tony Snell didn't score a point Monday night. He still made the biggest play of the game for the Milwaukee Bucks. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 26 points and 10 rebounds and rookie Malcolm Brogdon hit two free throws with eight seconds left, lifting the Bucks over the Oklahoma City Thunder 98-94. With Milwaukee leading 96-94, Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook sprinted down the lane, but Snell deflected the ball off the Thunder guard's leg, knocking it out of bounds with 8.8 seconds left. ""He blew right past me, but I had a little tip of the basketball, it got his knee and I got lucky on that one,"" Snell said. Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan didn't call a timeout before Westbrook's sprint down the lane. ""Russell had a good head of steam and he could get in the lane, especially with where Snell was picking him up because he was backpedaling,"" Donovan said. ""He got around him. I guess Snell got a piece of the ball."" Brogdon then was fouled and made both free throws to seal it. Snell for much of the game drew the defensive assignment on Westbrook, who led Oklahoma City with 30 points and six assists but made only 3 of 17 shots in the second half. He was 9 of 28 overall, including 2 of 10 on 3-point shots. Snell began the preseason with Chicago, but Milwaukee sent guard Michael Carter-Williams to the Bulls in a trade for the shooting guard after Khris Middleton went down with an injury. Snell can't match Middleton's scoring -- he led the Bucks with 18.2 points per game last year -- but is a strong defender. ""We've got to give our props to Tony,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Great job. He's doing the little things. I hope people see that, too. He's a winner."" Antetokounmpo had five assists, including when he drove the lane and passed to John Henson for a layup, giving Milwaukee a 96-94 lead with 54 seconds to go. ""When I'm aggressive and I'm going to the paint, I draw a lot of crowd,"" Antetokounmpo said. Twice late in the fourth quarter, Antetokounmpo attacked the rim and was double-teamed. ""Then I realized John was going to be open,"" he said. Steven Adams scored 20 points and Victor Oladipo added 18 for Oklahoma City, which had won five of six coming into the game. ""We've been in positions like that and come up on the other end with a win, so we just need to continue to keep growing and keep getting better,"" Oladipo said. Parker scored 19 points and Greg Monroe added 15 off the bench. Brogdon, making his third start, had 12 points but only made 3 of 12 shots. TIP-INS Thunder: The team assigned G Cameron Payne to the Oklahoma City Blue of the Development League. Payne fractured the fifth metatarsal in his right foot during the preseason and hasn't played in an NBA game this season. ... The team plays 12 of 15 games on the road this month. ... The team made 11 consecutive shots to open the game, but missed 11 consecutive shots in the third quarter. Bucks: Starting G Matthew Dellavedova missed his third consecutive game with a strained right hamstring. ... The Milwaukee crowd booed when Westbrook hit a 3-pointer and did Aaron Rodgers' ""Discount Double check"" on the court with a big smile. REPLAY GETS IT RIGHT When Westbrook drove down the lane and lost the ball off his leg, the referees initially signaled the ball went off Snell. After a video review, they reversed the call and gave Milwaukee possession. KIDD ON TRIPLE-DOUBLES Bucks coach Jason Kidd is third on the career list with 107 triple-doubles, about twice the 53 that Westbrook has in his career. ""Russ isn't going out there looking for a triple-double, he's just playing the game,"" Kidd said. ""That's the best thing about it. When you start worrying about how many assists or rebounds you need, that's when the ball starts bouncing the other way.""","400899410"
"CLEVELAND --  Injuries and illnesses aren't slowing down the Cleveland Cavaliers. LeBron James scored 26 points while playing with a case of the flu that's been going around the team, and the short-handed Cleveland Cavaliers rallied for a 90-82 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday night. Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving missed his second straight game because of tightness in his right hamstring as Cleveland dressed only 10 players. Kevin Love scored 12 points with 11 rebounds despite playing only 24 minutes because of food poisoning. Coach Tyronn Lue said Love, who spent the final minutes in the locker room, lost 10 pounds in the last few days. The defending NBA champions, who have won 13 of 15, managed to persevere despite the obstacles. ""As ugly as it was tonight, you have to find a way to get through it,"" said James, who scored six straight points and blocked a shot over a late 1:47 stretch to seal the Cavaliers' eight win in nine games. After Buddy Hield hit two free throws to pull the Pelicans to 84-82 with 2:56 remaining, James went to work, hitting four foul shots and a jumper. Anthony Davis scored 20 points with 17 rebounds for the Pelicans, whose four-game winning streak came to an end. Cleveland erased a 10-point deficit late in the third quarter and took a 73-71 lead on a basket by rookie Kay Felder, who scored eight points in the fourth. Felder and Iman Shumpert each finished with 12 points while Channing Frye -- another flu victim -- scored 14. ""No excuses, no matter what's going on with the team,"" James said. ""Has to be next man up. When a guy's number is called he has to be ready to go."" The Cavaliers were also without Mike Dunleavy (sprained right ankle), J.R. Smith (fractured right thumb) and Chris Andersen (torn ACL in right knee). The injuries and assortment of bugs caused Lue to cancel the team's morning shoot-around. James and Davis, who was scoreless in the fourth quarter, tumbled into the courtside seats chasing a loose ball late in the hotly-contested game. The Pelicans' star blamed himself for the loss. ""When we need buckets, the team relies on me -- and I didn't deliver,"" said Davis, who was 10 of 27 from the field. ""We just have to make open shots, mainly myself. It's on me. I've got to play better."" James moved past Dominique Wilkins for 14th place on the all-time field goals made list (9,972). NOT QUITE New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry knew his team missed out on a chance to come away with a win against a league power. ""We had the opportunity to come in and steal the game, but to beat the NBA champions, you've got to play 48 minutes,"" he said. ""You've got to seize the moment when you're playing the NBA champions on the road."" BIG NIGHT FOR THE ROOKIE Felder was 6 of 11 in 22 minutes off the bench after scoring 13 points against Charlotte on Saturday. ""My confidence keeps rising the more minutes I play,"" he said. ""I like to go fast and we like to run so playing at that pace helps me out a lot."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Omer Asik and Alexis Ajinca have seen their playing time cut with Davis moving to center. Asik hasn't played in five straight games while Ajinca hasn't seen action in the last four. ... New Orleans plays five of its next six on the road. Cavaliers: Dunleavy also missed his second straight game. ... James' late flurry helped the Cavs avoid their season low in points (85), set against Memphis last month when James, Irving and Love all sat out.","400899411"
"PHOENIX --  Dave Joerger is off to a winning start with the Sacramento Kings. The Kings gave the former Memphis coach a 113-94 season-opening victory over the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night, led by 24 points from DeMarcus Cousins and 22 from Rudy Gay. The Kings won an opener for the first time in three years and gave Joerger a victory in his Sacramento debut. The Kings used an 18-1 run from its second unit to take control in the first half and was up by as many as 26 points in the third quarter. ""First we kind of came out a little rusty,."" Cousins said. ""The second group came in with incredible energy and really opened the game up and really got energy going. Basically, there was no looking back from there."" Joerger brings a defensive mindset to the Kings. ""They got after it on defense,"" Joerger said of his second unit in the big run. ""The key for our defense is to set it. We executed offensively and didn't turn it over. When we did that, we were able to set our defense. `' Gay said the Kings are buying in. ""We're helping each other,"" Gay said. ""That was one of the things at camp we worked on. We have to help each other and play as a team."" Devin Booker, plagued by foul trouble, scored 18 points for the Suns. Eric Bledsoe added 16 and T.J. Warren had 14. Dragan Bender, the 18-year-old fourth overall pick in this year's draft, scored 10 points for Phoenix, all in the second half. ""We've got some adjustments to do,"" said Bledsoe, in his first game since injuring his knee last December. ""They went on a run, we could never bounce back from it. It's the first game."" A lineup featuring all three Phoenix draft picks -- first-rounders Bender and Marquese Chriss and second-rounder Tyler Ulis -- got the Suns back within 10. Bender hit his second 3-pointer of the quarter and Chriss scored inside to slice it to 86-76 with 9:07 to play. ""It was fun to watch,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""Dragan came in and gave us great minutes. Marquese is Marquese. I think the biggest surprise out of the second unit was Tyler. His defense on the ball was aggressive and we need that energy."" But Gay scored seven points and Matt Barnes had five in a 12-1 outburst to put the Kings back firmly in control 98-77. Sacramento's reserves dominated their Phoenix counterparts to give the Kings their big first-half lead. Ben McLemore scored six points and Garrett Temple and Willie Cauley Stein added four apiece in a 16-1 run to end the first quarter, with the Kings leading 30-19. Anthony Tolliver made a 6-foot floater to open the second quarter to make it an 18-1 run and a 32-19 lead. Temple's 17-footer with 2.8 seconds left in the half gave Sacramento its biggest lead of the game thus far, 57-39. KIDS CORPS When Bender entered the game in the third quarter, Phoenix became the first team to have three teenagers appear in a game. Chriss is 19 and Booker barely made it. He turns 20 on Sunday. McCOY HONORED Suns owner Robert Sarver took the microphone and told Suns longtime broadcaster Al McCoy that he would be added to the Ring of Honor on March 3. The 83-year-old McCoy has been the Suns radio announcer for 40 seasons. TIP-INS Kings: Cousins scored 10 straight Sacramento points in the third quarter. ... Sacramento last won a season opener in 2013, beating the Denver Nuggets. Suns: The Suns won 23 games last season, second-worst record in the team's 48-year history. ...

"NEW YORK --  The Utah Jazz lead the Northwest Division and the Brooklyn Nets have the worst record in the NBA. The fourth quarter of Monday night's game highlighted the disparity. Gordon Hayward scored 30 points, Rudy Gobert had 15 points and 16 rebounds and the Jazz pulled away in the final quarter to beat the Nets 101-89. Rodney Hood and Shelvin Mack scored 15 points each for the Jazz. Trevor Booker led the Nets with 17 points and 15 rebounds. Brook Lopez scored 14 points. ""When you think of closing, you think offense,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""I think of defense, like in baseball with shutting people down and not letting them get on base. Just getting outs, and that is what we have to be."" The game was tied 70-70 after three quarters, but Utah's Joe Ingles and Raul Neto opened the fourth with consecutive buckets and the Jazz never trailed again. They extended their lead to 89-78 on Hood's layup with 6:11 left, but the Nets pulled to 91-86 on Lopez's dunk with 3:11 remaining. Utah countered with a 9-1 run and took a game-high 13 point lead on Mack's jumper with 1:09 left. ""The start of the fourth turned it around for us as a team,"" Hayward said. ""We got a little bit of a lead and by the time I got back in there we were up eight or ten. Makes it a lot easier."" The Jazz went on a 12-3 run and tied the game at 65 on Hayward's two free throws with 1:17 left in the third. He followed that with another two free throws and a 3-pointer to give Utah a 70-67 edge. Joe Harris then hit a jumper and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson made a free throw to knot it at 70. Isaiah Whitehead scored 12 points and Hollis-Jefferson finished with 11 for the Nets. ""Mistakes. We let them get the best of us,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. ""It's kind of hard for us to bounce back sometimes, especially later in games."" TIP-INS: Jazz: At 22-13, Utah has posted its best record after 35 games since the 2010-11 team went 24-11. The Jazz finished 39-43 that season and failed to make the playoffs. Nets: Only Lopez or Booker scored a point for the Nets until Hollis-Jefferson made a field goal with 2:28 remaining in the first quarter. JOHNSON RETURNS Joe Johnson, who was waived by the Nets on Feb. 25 last season, made his first appearance against his former team in Brooklyn. In four seasons as a Net, Johnson played in 288 games, averaging 14.7 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game. He was an All-Star in 2014 and ranks fourth on the team's 3-point field goal list with 516.

""There's no timetable because it's hard to predict,"" Lin said before the game. ""It's in a different area, completely the other side. Hurt a lot less when it happened, so I'm definitely encouraged."" Lin has only played in 12 games this season.","400899413"
"NEW YORK -- For the Orlando Magic, playing better started with playing harder. Frank Vogel was disgusted by the Magic's effort in a loss at Indiana a night earlier, and the coach let them know about it Monday. ""Well it's no fun going into a game and having your opponent play decidedly harder than you,"" Vogel said. ""That's no fun and that's what we saw last night and I believe we reversed it tonight."" Jodie Meeks scored a season-high 23 points, Serge Ibaka and Aaron Gordon each had 22 and the Magic rolled to a 115-103 victory over the New York Knicks, who lost their fifth straight game. Nikola Vucevic had 14 points and 13 rebounds and fellow reserve Elfrid Payton added 13 points and 14 assists for the Magic, who were routed in their previous two games but totally turned things around against a Knicks team that played without Kristaps Porzingis or much defensive intensity. Carmelo Anthony scored 19 points for the Knicks, who have dropped eight of 10 to fall to 16-18. He said he didn't have the answers for their defensive struggles. ""Only thing I can say is we've got to get back to the drawing board and get back and try to get some practice time and get back to competing at the top level,"" he said. Two nights after yielding a season-worst 69 points in the first half to James Harden and Houston, the Knicks surrendered 67 to the Magic. Orlando opened a 17-point cushion late in the third quarter on a basket by Ibaka, who had 11 points in the period. The Knicks got Anthony back after he sat out the second half of the Houston game with knee soreness, and Courtney Lee rejoined the lineup after he missed the three-game road trip with a sore right wrist. New York opted to rest Porzingis a second straight game because of a sore left Achilles tendon. The Knicks badly missed their 7-foot-3 forward against Ibaka and the Magic's big frontcourt, but they couldn't defend the perimeter, either. Orlando tied its season high with 15 3-pointers and had 35 assists on its 45 baskets. ""The ball was moving and when we play like that we can beat anybody,"" Meeks said. TIP-INS Magic: Leading scorer Evan Fournier missed his fifth straight game with a bruised right heel. ... Meeks, who came in averaging 8.4 points, had 14 in the first quarter. Knicks: Derrick Rose scored 18 points and Lee had 14. ... The Knicks had won the last two meetings, including a 106-95 victory here on Dec. 22. PORZINGIS' PAIN Porzingis said he began feeling pain about a week ago and it worsened in the last couple of games, but he felt better Monday and hoped to play. Team doctors checked him out and found nothing serious but decided on another game of rest. ""I was pretty close today, but just they kept me out,"" Porzingis said, ""so it's nothing serious, but I can't wait to get back."" LOATHES LOSING Vogel said Gordon might take losses harder than any Magic player, and the forward said he would never learn to accept them. ""I never get used to losing. Never,"" he said. ""So it feels good to win."" STILL ON TOP The Magic kept a slim advantage in the all-time series, improving to 53-51 against the Knicks in the regular season.","400899414"
"LOS ANGELES --  Before his official head coaching debut, Luke Walton cautioned the Los Angeles Lakers about the long, difficult road from the start of this rebuilding season to sustained success. ""The outcome is less of a concern than how we play, and how we get after it,"" Walton said. Although these young Lakers won't be judged by wins and losses, their first victory together still felt awfully sweet. Jordan Clarkson scored 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, and the Lakers held off the Houston Rockets 120-114 on Wednesday night to win Walton's debut. D'Angelo Russell scored 20 points and Julius Randle added 18 points, seven rebounds and six assists as the Lakers got off to an exciting start in the franchise's first season without Kobe Bryant since 1995. With a revamped roster coming off the worst season in the 16-time champion team's history, Los Angeles surged in the fourth quarter while the Rockets tired. ""It wasn't pretty, but it got the job done,"" Russell said. ""Everybody did their part tonight, and it showed in the results."" The Lakers played an up-tempo offensive game under the 36-year-old Walton, and nobody seized the moment better than Clarkson, who came off the bench in his first game since signing a $50 million contract. His 3-pointer put Los Angeles up 116-112 with 1:48 left, and the Lakers hung on while the Rockets missed a series of open shots in the final minute. James Harden had 34 points, a career-high 17 assists and eight rebounds for the Rockets, who lost in former Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni's debut on the Houston bench. The Rockets missed 15 of their 16 3-point attempts in the second half on admittedly weary legs. ""I told them, `Look, the only thing that's been determined tonight is we're not going to win 82 games,"" D'Antoni said. ""We know that. You just throw it away and go to the next one. It's a marathon, a long time, and our legs will come to us."" After matching the franchise record with 14 first-half assists, Harden tied his career high with his 16th early in the third quarter. The Los Angeles native managed only six points in the fourth quarter, going 1 for 5, and his teammates were a combined 5 for 16. ""We were scoring so easily that we just didn't get stops,"" Harden said. ""It gave them confidence early in the game to where they made shots at the end. But we're not going to get down."" FIRST TIMES Brandon Ingram scored nine points in the No. 2 pick's debut for the Lakers. Timofey Mozgov had 12 points and eight rebounds, and Luol Deng had seven points in solid Lakers debuts for the veteran free agents. Ingram got a loud ovation when he checked in for his debut midway through the first quarter. The lanky wing scorer's first NBA basket was a 3-pointer from the corner near the Lakers' bench with the shot clock winding down. LUKE'S DEBUT After leading the Golden State Warriors to a 39-4 start last season while filling in for Steve Kerr, Walton finally has an actual game on his coaching record. His wins in Oakland were attributed to Kerr, but Walton captured the attention of the NBA and the Lakers, who brought him back to the city where he won two NBA title rings as a player. Hall of Famer Bill Walton proudly wore a purple Lakers T-shirt to his son's big night. Walton's mother and three brothers also attended the game. ""The Walton force will be strong tonight,"" Luke said. D'ANTONI RETURNS The Lakers fired D'Antoni after he went 27-55 in 2013-14, the first of a franchise-record three straight non-playoff seasons. When D'Antoni was asked before the game about reflecting on his time in LA, the coach quickly quipped: ""I try not to. ... No, I loved it. I actually did."" TIP-INS Rockets: Eric Gordon scored 19 points. ... Clint Capela, the 6-foot-9 Swiss forward, replaced Dwight Howard in the middle of the lineup with 16 points and nine rebounds. Lakers: Metta World Peace began his 17th NBA season, picking up three fouls in his first two minutes while guarding Harden. ... Jack Nicholson, Denzel Washington, director Peter Berg, YG, Kendall Jenner, Karlie Kloss, Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver attended the game.","400899415"
"CHICAGO -- Following a year of inconsistency and disappointment, the Chicago Bulls entered 2017 with plenty of resolutions. There's one thing, however, they are hoping remains the same -- the production of Jimmy Butler. Butler scored 52 points and outdueled Kemba Walker, carrying Chicago in a 118-111 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night. Butler was a point shy of his career high, which he got Jan. 14, 2016 at Philadelphia. He scored 20 points in the first half and 17 in the game's final four minutes. ""It's an understatement to say he was phenomenal. He did it in any which way,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""He just took what the defense gave him and obviously made huge plays down the stretch."" Butler also had 12 rebounds and six assists while shooting 21 of 22 from the free-throw line. He has scored at least 25 points in four straight games, and his performance Monday surpassed his previous season high of 40 points, which he notched Wednesday against Brooklyn. ""I was just playing basketball,"" Butler said. ""I didn't even know how many points I had. I just had a groove. Coach kept drawing up the same play."" Walker went blow-for-blow with Butler for much of the game, boosting his All-Star candidacy with 34 points and a season-high 11 rebounds. Walker, who scored 37 points against Cleveland on Saturday, notched consecutive 30-point games for the first time since March 7-9, 2016. Still, Hornets coach Steve Clifford saw room for improvement from everyone -- his star included. ""(Walker) did a good job on offense,"" Clifford said. ""But we have to try on defense, all of them. Our defense is soft and they pick and choose when they want to play. It's not going to work."" Charlotte, which entered Monday ranked among the top defensive teams in the NBA at 102.6 points allowed per game, has surrendered 119.5 over its last two losses. Nikola Mirotic had 12 points and Michael Carter-Williams finished with 10 points and nine rebounds for Chicago. Nic Batum, who recorded a triple-double in Charlotte's victory over Chicago on Dec. 23, had 19 points, six rebounds and five assists. Jeremy Lamb added 15 points off the bench. Charlotte led Chicago for much of the second half until Butler's three-point play with four minutes remaining tied the game at 100. Carter-Williams' jumper at 2:33 gave the Bulls a lead they would not relinquish. STILL NO LOVE FOR RONDO Rajon Rondo, who indicated he may ask for a trade after being benched both Friday and Saturday, again received no floor time in Monday's win. The 11th-year guard is averaging 7.2 points and 7.1 assists per game. TIP-INS Hornets: Cody Zeller entered the NBA's concussion protocol Monday after taking an elbow to the head in the fourth quarter of Saturday's contest with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He has no timetable for return. Roy Hibbert started in place of the injured Zeller. ... Marco Belinelli (left ankle sprain) missed his fifth straight game. Bulls: Dwyane Wade sat with swelling in his left knee. The 34-year-old veteran noticed the swelling Saturday night after playing in back-to-back defeats. Hoiberg does not believe the issue warrants an MRI, and Wade could return Wednesday against Cleveland. ... Rookie Denzel Valentine, who had played just four total minutes over his last seven games, played 18 minutes and hit his first three 3-pointers, finishing with nine points. He exited with an ankle injury in the second half.","400899416"
"HOUSTON -- James Harden had another triple-double, though this one wasn't record-setting like his last. Still, it was enough to help the Houston Rockets to their fifth straight win. Harden had 23 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds and Eric Gordon scored 31 points to lead the Rockets to a 101-91 win over the Washington Wizards on Monday night. Harden's ninth triple-double of the season was a rocky follow-up to his brilliant New Year's Eve performance where he had 53 points, 17 assists and 16 rebounds against the Knicks and became the first player in NBA history with a 50-15-15 game. In this one, Harden committed six turnovers and was just 2 for 11 on 3-pointers after going 9 for 16 against New York. ""The beauty of it is, when my shot isn't falling and when I'm not shooting the ball well, I've got other guys around me who can make up for it,"" Harden said. ""Tonight, Eric and Ryan (Anderson) stepped up for us and made big plays."" Anderson scored eight points on 3-for-7 shooting from the field, including 2 for 5 on 3s) to help Houston start off the new month with a win following a 15-2 December. John Wall had 18 points and 11 assists for Washington, which snapped a three-game winning streak and failed to move over .500 for the first time since it was 6-5 last season. Bradley Beal had 27 points for the Wizards after missing Friday night's game against Brooklyn with a right ankle sprain. Gordon hit a deep 3 to give Houston an eight-point lead with two minutes remaining and later stretched the lead to 10 with a layup with a little more than a minute left. Washington had a 53-41 lead at halftime, thanks in large part to Houston's eight turnovers and poor shooting from beyond the arc. The Rockets were just 2 of 17 on 3s in the first half but made 10 of 22 in the second half to turn the game around. ""At the beginning of the game, they were dead -- I felt like we were going to win the game by double digits just by the way we were flowing and they had no rhythm,"" Beal said. ""In the second half, it was just a totally different game."" Houston stormed back in the third quarter, outscoring Washington 37-17 to turn a 12-point deficit into an eight-point lead. ""It's easier to win when everyone's playing well and we're shooting the lights out and all that,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We've got that part, but to grind it out, we haven't done too many. We didn't have our mojo but found a way and that's really important for a team."" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said the third quarter was pivotal for Houston on both ends of the floor. ""We had too many mistakes, defensively, and they capitalized with 3s,"" Brooks said. ""We played a pretty good game throughout if you just take away seven or eight minutes in the third quarter."" TIP-INS Wizards: After scoring eight points in 24 minutes starting in place of Beal on Friday against Brooklyn, rookie SG Sheldon McClellan did not play. ... Marcin Gortat had 13 points and 14 rebounds. . Former Rockets SG Marcus Thornton had seven points in 18 minutes for Washington. Rockets: SF Corey Brewer started in place of Patrick Beverley, who missed his second straight game with a sprained right wrist. ... Houston scored a season-low 14 points in the first quarter. ... Harden clinched his triple-double with an alley-oop assist to Montrezl Harrell with 10 seconds remaining in the game. OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY Washington fell to 3-11 on the road, the second-worst road record in the Eastern Conference. At home, the Wizards are 13-6, third behind only Cleveland and Indiana in the East. Wall believs the solution to the problem is simple. ""Just play 48 minutes,"" he said. ""We play for 48 minutes at home but have to find a way to do it on the road. When we don't have the crowd behind us and we're not making shots, we've still got to defend at a high level."" FORMER WIZARDS' IMPACTS Rockets forwards Trevor Ariza and Nene both played in Washington for the 2013-14 season when the Wizards lost in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they both played key roles in defeating their former team Monday night. Ariza had 10 points, six rebounds, five assists, three steals and two blocks, while Nene had nine points, six rebounds and one towering third-quarter block of a floating jumper from Otto Porter Jr. PLAYERS OF THE WEEK Harden was named the Western Conference Player of the Week on Monday for games played from Dec. 26 through Jan. 1. Harden earned the honor for the third time this season and the 12th time in his career, matching Hakeem Olajuwon for the most Player of the Week awards in franchise history. Harden averaged 37.3 points, 12.5 assists and 9.8 rebounds. Wall was named the East's Player of the Week after averaging 24.3 points, 13.0 assists, 5.3 rebounds and 2.7 steals while guiding the Wizards to a 3-0 record. Wall won the honor for the sixth time in his career.","400899417"
"LOS ANGELES --  Not quite the lockdown defensive team they were to start the season, the Los Angeles Clippers managed to rediscover some of their old selves in time to stop a six-game skid. J.J. Redick scored 22 points and the Clippers beat the Phoenix Suns 109-98 on Monday night. ""We played with some urgency. We wanted to win so bad,"" said DeAndre Jordan, who had 20 rebounds. ""Our focus on defense was better."" Jamal Crawford added 18 points for the Clippers, who remain without Blake Griffin and Chris Paul. Griffin has missed nine games while recovering from right knee surgery, while Paul has missed six with a sore left hamstring. ""When you lose your top two guys you have to lean on each other,"" Crawford said. Los Angeles improved to 3-9 without Griffin and Paul in the lineup since Paul was acquired before the 2011-12 season. ""We just needed a win,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""That's the test. Without CP and Blake, try to find different ways to score."" T.J. Warren led the Suns with 24 points and former Clipper Eric Bledsoe added 22. Phoenix got within six with a minute left in the game on five straight points by Bledsoe. But the Suns failed to score again, and Devin Booker was called for an unsportsmanlike technical foul after hanging on the rim. ""Defensively we didn't have the presence that we had in the last three games,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""You can't expect to win on the road against anyone without a defensive presence."" The Clippers pulled away in the third quarter, using a 14-0 run to produce their largest lead of 89-70. Luc Mbah a Moute got things going with a 3-pointer and Jordan ended the spurt with his second dunk while the Suns missed all seven of their shots. Phoenix was 7 for 27 in the quarter. Mbah a Moute finished with 13 points. Crawford bounced back after going scoreless in 30 minutes in a 114-88 loss to the Thunder on Saturday night. ""I was a little disappointed in myself the last few games,"" Crawford said. ""I want to be in attack mode a lot more."" The Suns have lost four of five. TIP-INS Suns: They have lost seven straight in the series in Los Angeles and 10 of the last 11 at Staples Center. ... The Suns had allowed just 91 points in each of their last two games for the first time since March 2015. Clippers: Redick was called for a flagrant-1 foul to start the third quarter after catching Booker in the face with his elbow on a play that was reviewed. ...

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Everybody on the bench kept reminding Draymond Green in the final few minutes, ""One more rebound, one more rebound."" He figured they had jinxed him. Then he blocked out and secured that last board for a putback with 28.9 seconds left to give him his second triple-double of the season, also getting 15 points and 13 assists to lead the balanced Golden State Warriors past the Denver Nuggets 127-119 on Monday night. As much as the Golden State starters have sat through the fourth quarter during blowouts this season, Green has had fewer chances at triple-doubles and still come close. ""No, I don't care at all. It's not really a focus of mine,"" Green insisted. ""Trust me, if I cared I'd have a lot more than what I have -- one? -- this year."" Klay Thompson had 25 points to lead six Warriors in double figures, while Stephen Curry scored 22 points in Golden State's eighth straight home victory. Kevin Durant scored 21 points, Zaza Pachulia reached double digits for the third time with 11 points and nine rebounds, while Ian Clark came off the bench to score 12 points. ""At the end of the day we can all just miss and let Draymond clean it up,"" Curry quipped. Durant had a triple-double Friday against Dallas and the consecutive triple-doubles by different players were a first for the franchise, the Warriors said according to The Elias Sports Bureau. ""He does that for us every night,"" Durant said of Green's steady stat line. The Warriors also reached 30 assists for the third straight game and NBA-best 24th time total. Golden State is the first team in NBA history to win 30 of its first 35 games in three consecutive seasons. Wilson Chandler and Nikola Jokic scored 21 points apiece to lead Denver, which matched the star-studded Warriors for most of the first half. Golden State shot 56.3 percent and the Nuggets 54.2. Chandler's 3-pointer with 8:13 to play cut the Golden State lead to 104-98 before Andre Iguodala dunked on the other end moments later. Curry had seven 3s in the last meeting against Denver on Nov. 10, but went 3 for 9 from long range. He moved into sole possession of 15th place in NBA history for career 3-pointers (1,722), passing Dale Ellis (1,719) -- with Curry saying, ""I vaguely remember him as a player and it's kind of cool every so often when you get another notch on that list that name that you do pass and kind of getting a look back into the history books."" Defending the 3-point line was a top priority for Denver, which also is still working to finish out games. ""If you look at Golden State probably six years ago they were in the same position as we are right now,"" Emmanuel Mudiay said. Durant's 763 points in 33 games against the Nuggets is his highest total versus any opponent. Both teams put on an offensive show during a fantastic first half in which they were shooting at least 62.5 percent until midway through the second quarter. Green also made a pretty pass to Durant for a dunk, then Durant swished a 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer with a defender in his face for a 68-64 lead. The Warriors hit 8 of 14 first-half 3s. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver's Kenneth Faried -- who was taken off the court on a stretcher with a neck brace to stabilize him in Oakland on Jan. 2 a year ago immediately after his team's loss here -- didn't play this time because of lower back pain. ... Darrell Arthur also was sidelined for Denver because of left knee soreness. Warriors: Green had his 10th game with at least 10 assists, and the Warriors are 10-0 when he does so. ...

"ATLANTA -- Dwight Howard was everything the Hawks were hoping for in his hometown debut. Tim Hardaway Jr. in a starring role? That was a major surprise. Hardaway scored 21 points and ignited a fourth-quarter outburst that carried new-look Atlanta to a 114-99 victory over the Washington Wizards in the season opener Thursday night. Howard, who returned to the city where he grew up in the Hawks' biggest offseason move, did nothing to disappoint. He grabbed 19 rebounds -- more than anyone had for Atlanta all of last season -- and was a huge presence at the defensive end, disrupting shots and giving his teammates the freedom to be more aggressive on the perimeter. ""The worst thing you can do is lay an egg in the first game,"" said Howard, who also had 11 points and three blocks. ""I think all of us were a little nervous in the first half because we want to do so well. We really want put on for this city. ... Once we kind of settled in, kind of got our feet wet, we took it to another level."" Paul Millsap, for one, didn't have to spend so much time banging on the boards. He took advantage at the offensive end, leading the Hawks with 28 points on 11-of-20 shooting. But Hardaway was the one who really came up big, which was totally unexpected given that he was largely confined to the bench and even spent time in the D-League during his first season with the Hawks. ""It's definitely a new page, a new start,"" Hardaway said. ""But (last season) will always be the intro to me in Atlanta. That will always be in the back of my head, how they pushed me, how they got me prepared to get to this point in my career."" Hardaway scored 12 points in the fourth quarter, including back-to-back 3-pointers that helped Atlanta pull away, and wound up matching his best showing in a Hawks uniform. Thabo Sefolosha was another key contributor off the bench, scoring 11 of his 13 points in the third quarter. The Hawks, who led only 81-80 heading to the final period, outscored the Wizards 33-19 over the final 12 minutes. Markieff Morris led Washington with 22 points, but it was a tough night for the Wizards' dynamic backcourt duo. John Wall finished with only 12 points on 3-of-15 shooting, while Bradley Beal was held to 13 in the debut for new Washington coach Scott Brooks. ""We got a lot of good looks. Some went down, some didn't,"" Beal said. ""But at the end of the day, we can't control our offense. We can control our defense and our effort. We just gave up the last quarter and a half."" TIP INS Wizards: Marcin Gortat had 11 rebounds but didn't have much help. Washington was outrebounded 52-40. ... Otto Porter was the only other Washington player in double figures with 10 points. ... The Wizards locked arms during the national anthem. Hawks: Howard posted the most rebounds for anyone in their Atlanta debut, breaking the mark of 18 that Shareef Abdur-Rahim set at Houston on Oct. 30, 2001. ... Dennis Schroder, taking over as the starting point guard after the trade of Jeff Teague, had 14 points but only two assists. BROOKS RETURNS After deciding not to pursue a coaching job last season, Brooks was back on an NBA sideline with the Wizards. He spent six-plus seasons guiding the Oklahoma City Thunder before he was fired in 2015 after the team failed to make the playoffs. TEMPERS FLARE Atlanta's Kent Bazemore was called for a flagrant foul early in the third quarter when he got underneath Wall as the Washington star went in for a breakaway dunk, sending him tumbling to the court. Wall hopped up, looking to go after Bazemore, but several players stepped in before something more serious could develop. Bazemore said he didn't mean to make contact with Wall. ""I don't play the game that way,"" Bazemore said. ""It was just an unfortunate play. We hugged and made up after that.""","400899420"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid's most valuable role was as a decoy. Robert Covington made a fall-away shot off an inbounds pass set up by Embiid's screen with 0.2 seconds left to give the Philadelphia 76ers a 93-91 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night. ""We've been working on that for a long time,"" Embiid said. With everyone on the Minnesota bench to the fans in the last row expecting Embiid to get the ball, he instead set the high screen on Andrew Wiggins that helped free Covington for the acrobatic winner . Dario Saric hit Covington, who had been booed most of the game, for the decisive bucket that sent the crowd of 17,124 into a frenzy. The 76ers couldn't even believe they won -- the scoreboard read Wolves 94, Sixers 93 after the final horn. The Sixers needed the late basket after they blew a 26-point lead and seemed headed to overtime. Ricky Rubio, just a 26 percent 3-point shooter, buried one with 1.6 seconds left that tied it at 91. Covington, who missed all 11 shots last week at Utah, was booed after he airballed an early 3 and the fans never stopped as each shot clanked off the rim. ""I'm never going to give in to what others say about me,"" Covington said. Embiid, who led the Sixers with 25 points, again showed that the NBA's top rookie just might play on one of the league's worst teams. Embiid has won over Philly with his humor on social media and colorful quotes as he chases A-list celebrities for potential dates. He'll be a bigger hit if he helps the Sixers win more games. Embiid waved his arms and encouraged fans to get louder when they chanted his nickname ""The Process,"" and he later baited Karl-Anthony Towns into a technical foul. When the Sixers' 26-point lead was whittled to 11 late in the third quarter, Embiid made a steal and fed Nik Stauskas for a 3-pointer that seemed to steady the offense. Towns had 23 points and 15 rebounds for the Timberwolves, and Zach LaVine scored 28. Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said the Timberwolves continued to struggle playing a complete 48 minutes -- especially that final fateful second. ""We wanted the ball to go away from the basket. That didn't happen,"" he said. ""We needed some help on the curl and we didn't get it."" Embiid, who sat out two seasons recovering from a broken foot, was named before the game the Eastern Conference rookie of the month for the second time this season. Embiid averaged 20 points, seven rebounds and two blocks in 10 games -- numbers that could be even better had the Sixers not placed minutes restrictions on him and held him out in at least one game of back-to-backs. ""He feels like this is his program,"" coach Brett Brown said. Even with concern over the 7-footer's health, the Sixers have made a big push for fans to tweet, hashtag and vote Embiid onto the East All-Star team. ""I think he deserves it,"" Brown said. ""I think the health risk is becoming increasingly less, as I'm advised."" Embiid's popularity is soaring in a city desperate to cheer for competitive basketball. The big man had fans going wild in the second quarter. He pump-faked at the 3-point line, drove the lane and dished to Nerlens Noel on his right. Noel hit him back for a shot and was fouled. Towns airballed a 3 during a Minnesota run in the third, and Embiid was quick to pounce. Towns cursed near a referee as Embiid gleefully egged him on for the technical. Embiid, naturally, made the free throw. He stripped former Kansas teammate Wiggins later in the quarter and hit Stauskas for the 3. Embiid's dunk over Towns late in the fourth made it 88-80, and he flexed his muscle a bit and cupped his hand to his ear to hear the crowd like Allen Iverson. The Sixers have struggled with which natural center to pair with Embiid. Jahlil Okafor sat out the first quarter and Noel was benched for the third as the Sixers try to find the right big man to match with Embiid for the long haul. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Assistant coach Ed Pinckney enjoyed the 1985 and 2016 national championship banners that were raised to the rafters this season to honor Villanova. Pinckney, a star on the `85 title team, said two banners looked good but ""three would be beautiful."" ... The Timberwolves missed all eight 3s in the first half. 76ers: The Sixers played without Richaun Holmes (concussion), Sergio Rodriguez (sprained left ankle) and Gerald Henderson (sore left hip).

"CHICAGO --  Dwyane Wade got the ball in the corner, took a dribble to his left and stepped back for the dagger 3-pointer. He made a throat slashing gesture with his right hand after the ball swished through the net and started jumping around as the crowd roared. Wade scored 22 points in a triumphant Chicago debut, Jimmy Butler had 24 and the Bulls won their season opener, beating the Boston Celtics 105-99 on Thursday night. Wade hit the clinching 3 with 26.3 seconds left. Taj Gibson added 18 points and 10 rebounds, and the new-look Bulls got off to a winning start after missing the playoffs last season for the first time since 2008. ""To be able to make a shot like that and helps us get this win, it's like the perfect storm,"" Wade said. Isaiah Thomas led Boston with 25 points. Avery Bradley had 16, and Jae Crowder 14 points, but the Celtics came up short after opening with a win over Brooklyn the previous night. ""We lost the game in a fashion we didn't want to lose,"" Crowder said. ""I feel like we got punked all night."" The Bulls remade their roster in the offseason, jettisoning one hometown superstar and welcoming another when they traded Derrick Rose to New York and signed Wade to a two-year deal worth about $47 million in a move that stunned Miami. The three-time NBA champion and 12-time All-Star is off to a good start with the Bulls after 13 seasons with the Heat. Wade hit 4 of 6 3-pointers in this game after making just 7 of 44 all of last season. Rajon Rondo, signed by Chicago after a resurgent season with Sacramento, added nine assists. Butler had seven rebounds, and the Bulls pounded the Celtics on the glass 55-36. They showed a scrappiness and edge that was missing last season. They were unselfish, passing the ball around, and hit 11 of 25 3-pointers. ""I think everybody's having fun out there,"" Butler said. HANGING ON The Bulls were leading 95-81 midway through the fourth quarter after newcomer Michael Carter-Williams buried a 3 and a floater and Butler hit a floater of his own. The Celtics scored 11 straight to get back into it, a driving layup by Thomas cutting it to 95-92. It was 101-99 when Boston's Jaylen Brown got called for a travel. Wade then nailed that 3 over Bradley to make it a five-point game with 26.3 seconds left, sealing the win for Chicago. ""We're learning each other,"" Wade said. ""We're learning what we have in those types of moments at the end of ballgames and those types of moments."" TEMPERS FLARE Butler had some heated words with college teammate Crowder late in the first half. Crowder rebounded a miss by Wade -- another Marquette product -- and charged into Butler, leading to a heated exchange. Rondo also got into it with Isaiah Thomas, and all four players got called for technicals. ""Jae's my guy,"" Butler said. ""It's the heat of the moment. That's what's supposed to happen."" TIP-INS Celtics: Boston coach Brad Stevens said Rondo made a good impression on him during their time together in Boston. ""I thought he was very bright obviously, he understood the game, he can make passes in small areas that I have never seen before,"" Stevens said. ""And I tried to coach him like I would coach anybody else. The only thing I would say that you have to be yourself so I coached him like I would coach anybody else."" Rondo was working his way back from a torn ACL in his right knee and played in 30 games during Stevens' first season -- 2013-14. He started 22 games the following year for Boston before being dealt to Dallas. Bulls: The Bulls signed former Celtics first-round draft pick R.J. Hunter. The guard from Georgia State was let go by Boston this week in what Stevens called a numbers crunch. ""We had more than 15 NBA players so it was just a matter of time who he was going to get picked up by,"" Stevens said. ""I think the way that he plays fits with how they like to play.""","400899422"
"BOSTON --  Isaiah Thomas keeps setting personal bests, and the Boston Celtics keep winning games. Thomas had 29 points and a career-high 15 assists for Boston, which made 17 3-pointers for the second straight game while defeating the Utah Jazz 115-104 on Tuesday night. Thomas was coming of a 52-point night Friday against Miami, but it was his passing that helped the Celtics overpower the Jazz, who entered holding opponents to an NBA-low 94.5 points per game. ""I didn't plan on it but I just take what the defense gives me,"" said Thomas, whose previous high for assists was 13. ""When I attacked, they showed more than one guy and my job was to just get the ball to the open guy."" Thomas did just that, 15 times while turning the ball over only once. Al Horford and Jae Crowder added 21 points apiece and Avery Bradley scored 14 for the Celtics, who have won four of five and eight of 10. Boston coach Brad Stevens gave his players a couple of days off following Friday's win over the Heat and said it showed Tuesday. ""We looked fresh. We haven't looked fresh in a while,"" Stevens said. ""We need to take these days off as seriously as we take practice days and make sure we're getting rest and staying off our feet. Hopefully that has a cumulative effect as we move into some of the more intense parts of the schedule."" Al Horford and Jae Crowder added 21 points apiece and Avery Bradley scored 14 for the Celtics, who have won four of five and eight of 10. The Celtics ended Utah's four-game winning streak and beat the Jazz for the ninth straight time in Boston. Utah defeated the Nets 101-89 on Monday night before hopping a short flight to Boston. The Jazz were without second-leading scorer George Hill, who was out with concussion-like symptoms, and could not overcome a 17-point deficit the Celtics built in the second half. ""They did a great job moving the ball,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""They got jumps on the possession and it's tough to catch up because of their quickness. It's a very quick team."" Gordon Hayward led Utah with 23 points. Derrick Favors scored 12 and Rudy Gobert pulled down 13 rebounds, extending his streak of 10 or more to 21 consecutive games. Joe Johnson finished with 17 points for the Jazz, who managed to chip away at the lead before fading down the stretch. ""I think from the beginning there were a lot of defensive breakdowns,"" Hayward said. ""We gave up way too much in transition, so they got rolling and saw the ball go through the basket. It made it a long night for us."" Thomas' 3-pointer with 2:53 left in the second quarter started a 10-4 run that gave the Celtics a 54-45 halftime lead. Boston stretched it to 68-54 early in the third and Crowder hit his fifth 3-pointer to make it 83-66. Boston was up by 15 early in the fourth before the Jazz used an 11-3 run to pull to 98-91 on consecutive layups by Johnson. That was as close as it got and the Jazz were forced to foul late, sending Thomas to the line four times. He was perfect from the stripe for the second straight game. BIG IN BOSTON At 5-foot-9, Thomas doesn't appear to be much of a threat to drive inside -- until teams try to stop him. He made five 3-pointers against the Jazz, half of his 10 field goals, and has scored at least 20 points in 19 straight games. He also caught the Jazz off guard several times by driving to the hoop, then kicking the ball back outside to a teammate open for a 3. ""He did it in all kinds of ways,"" Snyder said. ""The best plays he made and the most impactful were when he got to the rim and he'd go up and find people. He was finding people everywhere."" TIP-INS Jazz: Raul Neto banked in a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give Utah a 29-28 lead entering the second quarter. ... Hayward and Shelvin Mack were teammates at Butler under Stevens. The 2009-10 Bulldogs clinched a Final Four berth in Salt Lake City with a win over Kansas State on March 27, 2010. ... Boris Diaw scored 15 for Utah, and Favors had a career-best seven assists. Celtics: Boston again tied its season high for 3s. Crowder and Thomas each hit five from beyond the arc. ... Bradley returned to the lineup after missing one game with an illness. ... The Celtics have not lost at home to the Jazz since March 14, 2008, when Utah won 110-92.","400899423"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Kawhi Leonard ripped the ball away from Ben McLemore and drove the other way for a three-point play. Then the next time down the court, Leonard grabbed it away from McLemore and scored on the other end. Those two plays turned the momentum San Antonio's way and sent the Spurs home with a very successful season-opening trip following a 102-94 victory over the Kings on Thursday night that spoiled the regular season opener at Sacramento's new downtown arena. ""He took two away in a row and said, `Gimme that.' He just grabbed it away from whoever it was,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He just grabbed it and took it twice in a row. I don't see many people doing that."" Few people are doing what Leonard is early this season. After scoring a career-high 35 points to go with five steals in a 129-100 season-opening win at Golden State on Tuesday night, Leonard had 30 points and five steals against the Kings. Leonard is the first player to put together back-to-back 30-point, five-steal games since Eddie Jones did it for Miami in December 2002. ""You see players play at an extremely high level on offense, but this guys does it on both ends,"" teammate Pau Gasol said. ""It's hard to say where he's more exceptional. He's a very special player."" Leonard helped dampen the excitement for the first regular season game at the new arena on an emotional night as fans remembered how close the franchise was to moving to Seattle before Vivek Ranadive bought the team in 2013 and reached a deal to build the arena. It didn't end as well despite a strong night from DeMarcus Cousins, who led Sacramento with 37 points and 16 rebounds. ""As much as this city has fought, the fans were more than deserving of this night,"" Cousins said. ""I wished we could have sealed the deal with a win."" The Kings built a nine-point lead midway through the third period before Leonard and the Spurs put it away. San Antonio went on a 16-2 run and held Sacramento without a basket for the final 7:20 of the period to take a 76-71 lead into the fourth. The Kings missed nine straight shots and Leonard then had the steals from McLemore. ""I just tried to do something for us, lighting up our defense a little bit,"" Leonard said. The Spurs built the lead to 10 points early in the fourth quarter before Cousins and Arron Afflalo made two baskets each in a 12-2 run that tied the game. But San Antonio pulled away late for the win. TIP-INS Spurs: The last San Antonio player with at least 30 points and five steals in consecutive games was Alvin Robertson in 1986. ... LaMarcus Aldridge scored 16 for San Antonio and reserves David Lee and Dewayne Dedmon added 12 apiece. Kings: Rudy Gay had 17 points but shot just 3 for 10. ... Sacramento shot 40 percent for the game. ... The Kings have lost seven straight to the Spurs. OPENING NIGHT There were many luminaries on hand for the arena opening. Former Kings great Chris Webber sat next to Ranadive at courtside, Commissioner Adam Silver and his predecessor were in attendance, as well as several politicians integral in getting the arena built, most notably Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson. ""I think it's a borderline miracle from where we were in 2013 to be here in 2016, a year earlier than they originally pledged to have an arena done,"" Silver said. ""To be done, to be here on opening night with the building completely finished with strong local ownership, it's everything a league could hope for.""","400899424"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  In a season when most teams are struggling to pull away from the pack in the Eastern Conference, beating a rival on the road is a major accomplishment. The Indiana Pacers, one of the NBA's worst clubs away from home, have done that twice to the Detroit Pistons. Paul George had 32 points and the Pacers beat the Pistons 121-116 on Tuesday night. ""We have a lot of firepower in our lineup, both our starters and our backups,"" George said. ""The way we have things now, with Monta (Ellis) in the second group, we've got the best of both worlds in both lineups."" Indiana also won 105-90 at the Palace of Auburn Hills on Dec. 17. The teams play twice more in Indiana. ""It's huge to come in here and win for the second time this season,"" Pacers guard Jeff Teague said. ""Things are so crazy and so tight in the Eastern Conference that winning a game like this on the road is huge. ""Paul was the biggest part of it. He's just a great, great player and we let him go."" Myles Turner and Teague each scored 17 for Indiana, which blew a 15-point first-half lead but pulled away in the fourth quarter to win its third straight game. The Pacers (18-18) are 2 1/2 games ahead of Detroit (16-21) in the East standings. Tobias Harris led the Pistons with 22 points. Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson each had a double-double. Detroit lost for the eighth time in 10 games, with two of the defeats coming at home to Indiana. George averaged 29 points in the two games. ""He's one guy that we've never been able to stop in the last couple years,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""Other guys have big games against us, but we slow them down at times. We never have an answer for Paul."" The Pacers hit six of seven 3-pointers in the first quarter to score a season-high 36 points and take an eight-point lead. The margin was 15 in the second before the Pistons rallied late to pull to 66-60. ""We were just standing there and watching, hoping someone would miss,"" Van Gundy said. ""We weren't willing to make the effort needed to close out on anyone."" George and Teague each had 14 points in Indiana's highest-scoring half of the season. The Pacers shot 59 percent from the floor, 88 percent on 3-pointers and 93 percent from the foul line. Detroit also shot well, hitting 57 percent of its shots, but couldn't keep up despite 13 points from Jackson. ""It is like we only play defense when we are down,"" Jackson said. ""We wait until we're back into a corner to apply any pressure, so we're always playing from behind."" Jackson's jumper early in the third cut the lead to 73-72 and prompted a timeout by Indiana coach Nate McMillan. Jackson's alley-oop to Drummond tied the game at 77, and it was 92-all going into the fourth. ""They got hot and started knocking down a lot of shots,"" McMillan said. ""We were able to keep ourselves in the game and finally get some stops."" Indiana's offense got going again early in the fourth, and the Pacers built a 103-96 lead with seven minutes to play. George's three-point play with 3:28 left made it 114-104, and Detroit couldn't get enough stops to threaten until the final minute. Marcus Morris' two 3-pointers pulled Detroit to 119-114 with 50.3 seconds left and, after a turnover, Drummond's putback made it a three-point game. Ellis made two free throws before Morris and Jackson missed at the other end. ""Our starters didn't guard anyone, and neither did our bench,"" Van Gundy said. ""I've got to figure out who to play and when to play them, but they aren't making it easy on us."" TIP-INS Pacers: The win was Indiana's fifth of the season on the road, and it snapped a three-game losing streak away from Indianapolis. The Pacers are 2-0 at the Palace this season, and 3-13 in other road games. Pistons: With Aron Baynes sidelined by an ankle injury, Detroit went with little-used Boban Marjanovic as Drummond's backup. Marjanovic matched up mostly with Al Jefferson, who always gives Drummond problems. STATISTICAL ODDITY Eight of the game's 10 starters finished with negative plus/minus ratings. Thaddeus Young and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope were each plus-3. Ellis was plus-15 off the Indiana bench. HISTORIC RIVALRY As part of their last season at the Palace of Auburn Hills, the Pistons spent much of the night honoring great moments from their rivalry with Indiana. The list was heavily populated by their postseason battles in the mid-2000s, with No. 1 being Tayshaun Prince's chase-down block of Reggie Miller in the 2004 Eastern Conference finals. Not a surprise: The most memorable Pistons-Pacers moment, the melee involving Ron Artest and fans in November 2004, was not included.","400899425"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Los Angeles Clippers' goal in their opener was to keep the Portland Trail Blazers from making 3-pointers. The strategy worked: Portland made just four of 18 attempts from the perimeter and the Clippers came away with a 114-106 victory Thursday night. Chris Paul said the Clippers had the luxury of being able to watch Portland's opener two days before. ""We just saw the clinic they put on at the 3-point line, so we just tried to make it tough on them and get them inside the line,"" said Paul, who had 27 points. Blake Griffin also had 27 points and added 13 rebounds in what was a contentious game that had fans booing the officials after two flagrant fouls called on Portland players in the fourth quarter. Chris Paul hit a 3-pointer that gave the Clippers a 102-90 lead with 4:07 left and the crowd headed for the exits. The Clippers were the last team in the Western Conference to start the season. Portland opened at home on Tuesday with a 113-104 victory over Utah that included 13 3-pointers. Damian Lillard led the Blazers against the Clippers with 29 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out late. His layup got the Blazers to 107-102 with 35.9 seconds left but the rally fell short. ""I just think we grew frustrated with the way some things went,"" Lillard said. ""When we're in that situation we've probably got to do a better job of controlling what we can control."" The teams last met in the opening round of the playoffs last season. Portland dropped the first two games of the series, but Paul broke his right hand and Griffin reinjured his left quadriceps tendon, and the Blazers won the next four to take the series. Portland would go on to fall to the Golden State Warriors in the conference semifinals. Jamal Crawford hit a 3-pointer that capped a 16-0 run to put the Clippers up 37-27. Griffin's layup extended the lead to 49-38 with less than five minutes left in the first half. Paul made a 3 to end the half and the Clippers led 58-49. The game got testy in the third quarter when DeAndre Jordan and Mason Plumlee got into a bit of a pushing match, resulting in offsetting technical fouls. Portland rallied to keep it close throughout the quarter and Allan Crabbe's jumper made it 76-73, but Marreese Speights answered for the Clippers with a 3-pointer. It was tied at 82 going into the fourth quarter. Raymond Felton put the Clippers ahead 90-84 but they couldn't extend it any further until midway through the quarter when the game got chippy again and Plumlee was assessed a flagrant foul. ""I won't comment on the officiating, but obviously I didn't like some of the calls,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. That shifted the momentum, and the Clippers went up 95-89. CJ McCollum was called for a flagrant on Jordan, who missed both free throws. J.J. Redick made a 3-pointer that put Los Angeles ahead 98-89. ""When you shoot 40 percent on the road and you have the grit to still win the game, that was pretty cool,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. TIP INS Clippers: The Clippers went after veterans in the offseason, bringing in 11-year pros Felton and Brandon Bass, eight-year pro Speights, and seven-year pro Alan Anderson. ... Los Angeles started Luc Mbah a Moute at small forward. Trail Blazers: Lillard opened the season with 39 points against the Jazz. ... Chance The Rapper was among the fans at the game. ... The Blazers made just four of 18 3-point attempts. TOGETHER: Paul, head of the NBA players' union, is one of a group of players that lent their voices to an NBA video to spread a message of unity. Along with Dwyane Wade, Kyle Korver and Carmelo Anthony, the video ends with the words ""There's only one way to work through our challenges -- together."" The Trail Blazers have been linking arms during the national anthem for the season's first two games. PLUMLEE'S GESTURE: He landed in the seats before his dustup with Jordan, startling two kids sitting courtside. After the game he brought them back to the locker room and signed a pair of jerseys for the youngsters. As for the officiating? He said it shouldn't be a distraction. ""If you are a mentally tough team you don't let that bother you,"" Plumlee said. ""You've got to play through stuff.""","400899426"
"DALLAS --  After a disappointing 2016, the Dallas Mavericks started the new year off on the right foot. Harrison Barnes scored 26 points and Deron Williams added 21 as the Mavericks rallied to beat the Washington Wizards 113-105 on Tuesday night. Devin Harris had 17 points and Seth Curry 16 for Dallas, which went 10-24 before the New Year. Williams, Harris and Curry all hit four 3-pointers as Dallas made 17-of-32 from long range. Six Mavericks scored in double figures, including Dirk Nowitzki, who started at center and chipped in with 11 points and nine rebounds. ""We've got to find ways to win right now,"" Nowitzki said. ""We want to make some ground up this month. Whoever's number is called has to be ready."" John Wall led Washington with 27 points and Bradley Beal added 25 for the Wizards, who fell to 1-6 on the second half of back-to-back games. They lost to Houston on Monday night. Dallas trailed by nine points in the third quarter before rallying on the strength of 11-for-16 3-point shooting in the second half. ""If we shoot the way we shot tonight, we're pretty good,"" Harris said. Trailing 88-87, the Mavericks scored the first eight points of the fourth quarter and led 110-100 on Barnes' 3-pointer with 2:51 to play. The Wizards shaved the lead to five, but Beal missed a 3-pointer and then Wall missed two 3s, any of which would cut the lead to two before Barnes made another 3 with 24.3 seconds left to put the game away. ""We had a great situation, a great opportunity to come in and take advantage of it, and we didn't,"" Beal said. TIP-INS Wizards: Wall was named Eastern Conference player of the month for December after averaging 24.5 points, 10.7 assists and an NBA-best 2.7 steals per game as the Wizards went 10-5. . Washington has lost 12 of 13 to the Mavericks dating to 2009, their only win coming last season. Mavericks: Andrew Bogut, who missed 11 games this year with a knee injury, limped to the bench with 3:52 remaining in the fourth quarter after banging his knee against a Washington player. But Bogut said after the game he would be fine. . Forward Dorian Finney-Smith was a finalist for Western Conference rookie of the month for December but lost to New Orleans' Buddy Hield. Finney-Smith started 16 of the team's 17 games in December, averaging 6.6 points. PUTTING UP A WALL Wall took over the final 2:30 of the first half, scoring 13 points in a 20-3 Wizards run that gave the Wizards a 67-61 lead at the break. He scored the final 11 points of the half for Washington. But Dallas held him to just seven points in the second half. ""I missed two or three pull-ups I thought were good shots,"" Wall said. ""They just rimmed in and out. They were making shots in the third and we didn't have an opportunity to get out in transition off missed shots."" STEPPING BACK Bogut asked Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle to bring him off the bench due to the struggles the team was having with both him and Nowitzki in the game as starters. Though the pair had only played 53 minutes together this season due to injuries to both, Dallas had been outscored by 62 points when they were on the floor together. ""It's better than starting the game and getting dragged out,"" Bogut said. ""If you're going to do that, you might as well do it the right way."" BURGER ANYONE? In an effort to promote the All-Star candidacy of Barnes, the Mavericks debuted the Harrison Barnes All-Star Burger at concession stands for all January home games. Barnes is averaging a team-leading 20 points for Dallas. ""I'm more concerned with his day to day progress, that he keeps learning and growing,"" Carlisle said. ""That's really his personality so I think he's going to continue to trend upward. He hasn't plateaued in his work ethic or his thirst to get better.""","400899427"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Toronto Raptors offered no excuses at the end of a two-week road trip, and the San Antonio Spurs didn't show any pity. Kawhi Leonard had 25 points, LaMarcus Aldridge added 23 and the Spurs beat Toronto 110-82 on Tuesday night, holding the Raptors to their lowest score of the season. Toronto was playing its sixth straight road game in 12 days, but refused to blame fatigue for falling 29 points below its season average. ""I think they just came out and beat our (butts),"" said Kyle Lowry, limited to a season-low six points. San Antonio dominated a matchup of teams with the second-best record in each conference, leading by as many as 34 points. The Spurs shot 55 percent from the field, collecting 32 assists on 43 field goals while capturing their eighth straight win at home. ""I thought we made the extra pass,"" Aldridge said. ""It's just the way our guys play here. Guys found the open guy trying to get to the rim. The guys were playing with confidence, moving the ball out there."" Aldridge and Leonard combined to shoot 19 for 28 from the field, but it was veteran point guard Tony Parker who set the tone for the Spurs. Parker finished with 15 points and eight assists in 23 minutes. ""Even when he's not making (his tear-drop shot), guys always have to respect him getting to the lane,"" Leonard said. ""He has a vision to see us out there. He's always drawing two guys and someone's always open."" After scoring the game's opening basket on a floater, Parker drove the lane and tossed the ball out to Aldridge and Pau Gasol for mid-range jumpers and to Danny Green for a 3-pointer. ""That was a championship performance by a championship team,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. ""That's the way you come out with a championship approach and desperation mode and we didn't meet it. It started from the first play of the game."" The Spurs raced to a 26-10 lead in the opening eight minutes, and the Raptors never recovered. Parker set up three straight dynamic plays in the first half that put the Raptors on their heels and gave the Spurs their largest lead at 54-32 with 2:28 left in the first half. Green's steal and half-court pass led to a one-handed, breakaway dunk for Leonard that revved up the sold-out crowd. Parker dribbled around his back on the run to lose Lowry at the top of the 3-point line, got DeMar DeRozan to leap in the paint and then whipped a pass to the left corner for a 3-pointer from Leonard. Parker then passed under the basket to Aldridge, who tossed it out to Leonard. He faked a shot, dribbled, reset and made a 3 for a 22-point lead. ""Usually we try to make that comeback, but they kept putting their foot on the gas,"" DeRozan said. ""That's why they are one of the best teams in the league."" DeRozan led Toronto with 26 points, but Lowry was held to 2-for-9 shooting. ""We knew that DeRozan and Kyle are the offensive threats of that team,"" Gasol said. ""We wanted to make it tough on them."" The Spurs had a season-high 15 blocks and forced 14 turnovers. TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto shot 37 percent from the field while failing to reach 90 points for the first time this season. ...

""We've got to get better if we want to compete with the best of the best,"" Lowry said. ""We've got to be better."" MISSING YOU Toronto guard Cory Joseph, who played four seasons with the Spurs beginning in 2011, remains a favorite with San Antonio fans and the team's coaching staff. ""He was a great teammate for everybody,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""One of the hardest workers.

"TORONTO --  Kyrie Irving cemented himself as a go-to late-game shooter in last year's NBA Finals. On Friday night, he picked up where he left off. Irving scored 26 points and hit a go-ahead 3 with 44.3 seconds remaining, lifting the Cleveland Cavaliers over the DeMar DeRozan and Toronto Raptors 94-91 in a rematch of last season's Eastern Conference finals. Irving made a tiebreaking 3 with 53 seconds left in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, helping Cleveland win its first title with a historic comeback from a 3-1 series deficit. Friday's make helped Cleveland survive a 32-point effort from DeRozan. Irving was 5 for 9 from beyond the arc and dismissed comparisons from reporters to his winning 3 in the Finals. ""No, it's just Game 2 of a new season,"" he said. ""I'm glad we went through a close game with a great team like that though. It shows a lot of growth on our end as a team."" LeBron James had 21 points and Kevin Love chipped in 18 with 10 rebounds to keep the Cavaliers perfect two games into their title defense. Cleveland led almost from the opening tip until Kyle Lowry put the Raptors in front with 2:37 to play. But Toronto missed its last five shot attempts in the final minute, with Cleveland's defense holding Toronto to .389 shooting from the field. The Cavaliers were a perfect 17-0 last year when they held opponents under 40 percent shooting. ""I think it was a good test for us,"" James said. ""It's fun to have games like that throughout the regular season, it sharpens your sword."" The Raptors were unable to capitalize on another strong effort from Jonas Valanciunas, who had 10 points and 17 rebounds, and DeRozan, who followed up a 40-point performance in a season-opening win over Detroit. DeRozan's combined 72 points bested Vince Carter's team record of 65 for the most points through the first two games of a season, set in the 2003-04 season. However, DeRozan was concerned with the second quarter, where Toronto allowed Cleveland to go on a 12-2 run that opened the game up. ""They caught a rhythm, we turned the ball over and they took advantage of it,"" he said. ""Since then we were always fighting."" TIP INS Cavaliers: With seven baskets, James moved past Patrick Ewing (9,702) for 15th career in field goals made. ...

"PHOENIX --  A game against the Phoenix Suns was just what the embarrassed and short-handed Los Angeles Clippers needed. And even that wasn't all that easy. Blake Griffin scored 29 points in his third game back from injury and the Clippers bounced back from a humiliating 46-point loss at Golden State to beat the Suns 124-114 on Wednesday night. The victory over the team with the worst record in the West left Los Angeles 2-4 since Chris Paul went down with a torn left thumb ligament. Raymond Felton added 18 points and J.J. Redick 16 for the Clippers. ""Right now, we are scrambling for each win,"" Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. ""That is the mode we have been in. We have been in that mode. We have been playing without Blake. We have been playing without both of them for a while. Now we get Blake back, but it takes him time. We are just in the mode of survival."" Griffin missed 18 games recovering from a right knee procedure. Los Angeles never trailed, but Phoenix cut the lead to two four times and was down by just one at 94-93 with 10:26 to play. Eric Bledsoe scored 41 to tie the career high he set two games ago, but Phoenix lost its fifth in a row. Devin Booker added 20 points, his 14th straight game scoring at least 20. ""I was proud how we stuck with it,"" Griffin said. ""At times, we let up defensively and didn't execute the way we want it to. But with the adversity, DJ going out, them playing real hard and E Bled (Bledsoe) having a fantastic game, I was proud the way we stuck with it and dug it out at the end."" The Clippers' DeAndre Jordan drew a flagrant foul two for flattening Phoenix's Marquese Chriss and was ejected with 4:52 left in the third quarter. ""I didn't agree with it at all,"" Jordan said. ""I tried to go for the ball, but I couldn't get it and got his arm. I am 6-11, 280 pounds. If I flagrant-2 somebody, they are probably not going to get up afterward."" Los Angeles led by as many as 14 early in the third quarter and was up 83-71 when Jordan left. The Suns came back to twice cut it to two late in the third quarter. Bledsoe's reverse layup in traffic cut it to 90-88 with 10 seconds left, but Brandon Bass' jumper put the Clippers up 98-88 entering the fourth quarter. P.J. Tucker's 3-pointer made it a one-point game, 94-93, with 10:26 to play. But Bass, who didn't play in the first half, sank a jumper and made two free throws and Los Angeles led 98-93. Phoenix stayed close for a while and was down 109-106 after Bledsoe's three-point play with 3:50 left. But Redick banked in a 3-pointer from the top of the key to make it 112-106, and Felton's 3 with 2:15 to play pretty much sealed the win. Los Angeles was up 45-34 in the second quarter when Marreese Speights scored inside with 8:50 left. But a Phoenix lineup mostly of reserves, led by Leandro Barbosa, narrowed the gap. Phoenix scored the last seven points of the half, five by Bledsoe, to cut the lead to 62-59 at the break. Bledsoe had eight assists and four rebounds to go with his 41-point performance. ""I think Bledsoe is playing at an elite level,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said, ""so we have to make sure moving forward our team, everything we do, we cannot waste his valuable time. ""So Bledsoe is at an elite level, Book is coming up, he's playing at that level, also."" Now, Watson said, he needs complementary players so the Suns can ""just capture this momentum that those two have in the backcourt.""

"MILWAUKEE --  Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle had nothing but praise for his scrappy team. Harrison Barnes scored 15 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter to lift the Mavericks to a 109-105 victory over the listless Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday. ""We have a high-character group, just look at our entire season,"" Carlisle said. ""Guys have continued to play hard and play together the entire time."" Barnes made 10 free throws, a 3-pointer and a fade-away jumper in the decisive fourth quarter. He came in for Dirk Nowitzki with 10:12 left and carried the team, especially at the foul line. ""The biggest reason (for the win) was we got to the bonus early,"" he said. ""That gave us some room to be aggressive, force them to call the whistle and try to get to the free throw line."" The Mavericks made a season-high 19 consecutive free throws, including 15 straight down the stretch, and finished the game 19 for 20. Greg Monroe said the Bucks did what the Mavericks wanted them to, and it cost Milwaukee. ""We played their game,"" Monroe said. ""We played at the pace they wanted to play at. Down the stretch, they got a lot of points at the free throw line. We've got to be better at not giving them easy points."" Bucks coach Jason Kidd agreed with Monroe's assessment. ""We were working into our game, and they were already into the game,"" Kidd said. Barnes played more minutes than Carlisle wanted because Nowitzki was experiencing some mild pain in his right Achilles tendon. ""We didn't want him to mess around,"" Carlisle said of Nowitzki. The Mavericks fought as if they still had a chance at the playoffs, while the Bucks frittered away an opportunity to cement their hold on the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference. ""At this point, we're playing with pride and trying to build for next season,"" Barnes said. ""Slow starts have plagued us all season long. Tonight was a great opportunity for us to start off the game the right way."" Dallas capitalized on 15 turnovers, turning them into 19 points, and Nicolas Brussino's uncontested layup gave the Mavericks a 91-82 lead with 7:12 left to play. The Bucks found some late energy and pulled to 106-103 on Matthew Dellavedova's 3-pointer with 1:24 to play, but got no closer. Nowitzki and J.J. Barea each had 17 points as the Mavericks snapped a four-game losing streak. Yogi Ferrell had 13 filling in for the ailing Seth Curry. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 15 rebounds for the Bucks, fresh off a 14-4 record in March. That was the franchise's third-most wins in a month and best mark since the 1970-71 NBA championship team went 16-2 in February. ""I think it wasn't who we are today,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We didn't play hard enough. We didn't do what we usually do. That's the game, and we move on."" Gary Payton II, signed to a multiyear contract before the game, entered the game with 5:18 left in the third. He hit his first shot, a wide-open 3, and followed that up with a dunk that gave the Bucks a 74-68 lead. TIP-INS Mavericks: Curry aggravated his injured left shoulder Friday night at Memphis. Carlisle is hopeful that Curry, who continues receiving treatment, could play Tuesday in Sacramento. Bucks: Rookie G Malcolm Brogdon missed his second consecutive game with back tightness. He sat out Friday's win over Detroit and missed two games earlier in March with the same problem. Kidd said that Brogdon would make the road trip, if he felt better. ... C John Henson (sprained left thumb) missed his seventh consecutive game. SEASON SWEEP Dallas has won nine of the last 11 meetings with the Bucks, including an 86-75 overtime victory earlier this season. Barnes scored a career-high 34 points and grabbed eight rebounds in that game.","400899431"
"BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics know any road to the NBA Finals will likely pass through Cleveland. They put the defending champs on notice that they are gearing up to challenge them for their Eastern Conference throne. Isaiah Thomas scored 31 points, including a pair of go-ahead free throws, as the Celtics outlasted LeBron James and the Cavaliers 103-99 on Wednesday night. Boston's win overshadowed the seventh triple-double of the season for James, who finished with 28 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. Kyrie Irving added 28 points for the Cavaliers, who lost for the first time when leading at any point in the fourth quarter on the road. The game marked the third meeting this season between the top two teams in the East, and the first win by the Celtics. ""We just played to win,"" Thomas said. ""They're the No. 1 team in the East. One of the best teams in the NBA, and we just wanted to protect home court and get a win. We did that tonight."" Jae Crowder had 17 points and 10 rebounds for Boston, which led by three entering the fourth quarter before there were six ties and 10 lead changes in the final 12 minutes. It was a 3-point barrage down the stretch, with the Celtics connecting on six straight attempts during one stretch. They also made this more difficult for a Cavs team that had averaged 126 points in its wins over the Celtics. ""This needs to carry over for us,"" Celtics guard Avery Bradley said. Deron Williams, signed by Cleveland earlier this week, scored four points in 24 minutes in his Cavaliers debut. But it did little to help the Cavs overcome a night in which they were outrebounded 47-41. It was tied at 99 when Thomas connected on a pair of free throws to put Boston in front 101-99. Irving then missed a jumper and Tristan Thompson grabbed the rebound and got it to Deron Williams, who then missed from the corner. Crowder got the rebound, was fouled and made his two foul shots to seal it. ""I saw Crowder running to me, he jumped and then I saw Marcus Smart running toward me,"" James said of the Cavs' missed opportunity in the waning seconds. ""I saw D-Will naked in the corner, so I gave him an opportunity and he just missed it. We got the shot we wanted."" Despite the loss, coach Tyronn Lue was pleased with his team's effort. ""It was a good game -- went down to the wire, shot for shot,"" Lue said. ""I.T. made two big shots, Avery made two big shots. We competed, we fought. That's all you can ask for."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Outscored the Celtics 50-42 in the paint. ... Finished 15 of 22 from the free-throw line. Celtics: Al Horford finished with nine points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. ...

I'm not taking no legend out."" -- James on his near collision with Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who was seated on the baseline. TOUGHER EAST Celtics coach Brad Stevens said he's been impressed by the recent additions by several teams in the Eastern Conference. Though, he said, the line still forms behind the defending champions following their acquisition of Williams and anticipated addition of big man Andrew Bogut, who is free to sign after clearing waivers. ""I don't think I'm saying anything earth-shattering here: We're all chasing Cleveland,"" Stevens said. ENERGY MAN Derrick Williams -- playing on his second 10-day contract -- provided the energy for the Cavaliers early on, scoring 10 points in the first half. He scored from the outside, got into the teeth of Boston's interior defense and sped the game up. One of his best highlights came in the second quarter when he blocked Bradley's jumper, sprinted ahead and received a pass from James for a fast-break dunk.","400899432"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Chicago Bulls got just the start they needed for their six-game road trip. Jimmy Butler scored 28 points to help the Bulls rout the Oklahoma City Thunder 128-100 on Wednesday night. Dwyane Wade had 18 points and seven assists for the Bulls, who shot 60.5 percent from the field overall and 68 percent in the second half. They needed the momentum on a trip that includes games at Houston and Golden State. ""This was just a great team win from start to finish,"" Wade said. ""We really came out and executed our game plan, especially offensively."" Russell Westbrook had 28 points and eight assists, and Jerami Grant scored a season-high 15 points for the Thunder, who lost their third straight overall and had their five-game home winning streak snapped. Westbrook made 10 of 23 shots. ""You just gotta challenge every shot,"" Butler said. ""He's a hell of a player, getting downhill, at the basket. He can make the outside shot and loves to get his teammates involved."" It took until the fourth quarter for someone other than Westbrook to reach 10 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City shot just 38 percent from the field and made 10 of 37 3-pointers. It was the second-worst loss of the season for Oklahoma City, behind a 34-point loss in Memphis. ""I don't think we were very good tonight, especially on the defensive end of the floor,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Butler scored 18 points in the first half to help the Bulls take a 55-47 lead at the break. Chicago started the second half on a 17-4 run to take a 72-51 lead. The Thunder trimmed the deficit to 14, but the Bulls bounced right back and led 94-73 at the end of the third quarter. Westbrook played less than a minute in the fourth quarter, sitting down for good with 8:14 remaining and the Bulls ahead 108-82. ""We just try to pack the paint and make them make shots,"" Wade said.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Miami Heat have been one of the worst offensive teams in the league this season, ranked No. 27 in points per game. Offense, however, wasn't an issue Thursday night. Goran Dragic scored 27 points and the Heat continued to play better on the road with a 111-110 victory over the Utah Jazz. James Johnson scored a season-high 24 points off the bench and Wayne Ellington added 17 for the Heat, who have five of their seven wins on the road. ""That is a good defense to be able to do that against,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Sometimes you need great players to make bigger plays against a good defense. That is what those guys are doing. Getting a little more organized offensively, the guys are getting a little more confident in their roles and simplify a bit."" The Jazz had the ball with 3.9 seconds remaining and Gordon Hayward missed a contested midrange jumper before time expired. The Heat attacked the rim relentlessly throughout the game to score 64 points in the paint. The Jazz allowed a season-high 58 points in the paint to the Heat in mid-November. Hayward scored a season-high 32 points and added seven assists. Joe Johnson chipped in 18 points as the Jazz lost despite knocking down a franchise-record 17 3-pointers in 30 attempts. A 6-0 run to start the fourth quarter gave the Heat a 12-point lead and Miami barely hung on the rest of the way. ""It takes grit,"" Ellington said. ""It takes toughness and that is what we showed all night long."" The Heat took a 52-48 lead into halftime thanks to a 19-2 run highlighted by eight points from Ellington. The Jazz answered with a 12-2 stretch to close the half. The Jazz came into the game allowing just 38.9 points per game in the paint, tied for No. 4 in the league. ""We were soft at the beginning of the game,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We didn't deserve to win the game. Miami outplayed us. By the time we woke up defensively, it was late and we had to expend a lot of energy. We lacked physicality, particularly in the first half.""

Exum had played less than nine minutes in the previous four games, including not playing at all Monday. Snyder said Exum isn't playing as much after starting 41 games as a rookie, in part, due to an improved roster. Still, Exum has struggled this season. ""He's probably tired of me talking to him,"" Snyder said. ""You can't talk to a player every time there's any kind of change. ... By and large I'd like to think our guys have a clear understanding of what we want from them individually and how that fits into what we're trying to do as a team.

"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Stephen Curry made a sweet crossover, then stepped back and knocked down another 3-pointer as Kevin Durant covered his mouth with his hand in pure admiration and awe. In his last six quarters, Curry has 20 3-pointers and 82 points -- and the Golden State Warriors have been so far ahead coach Steve Kerr could rest his MVP for the fourth period both times. With dad Dell watching live Wednesday night, Curry hit 11 3-pointers and scored 39 points, coming back with vengeance from a one-game absence while ill and leading the Warriors to a 126-111 blowout of his hometown Charlotte Hornets. ""It's always cool to see my dad on the sidelines commentating the game on their end,"" Curry said. ""You get a little juice from that, too. ... I don't take those opportunities for granted because this an unbelievable opportunity to play the game that he played for 16 years in the NBA and carry on that name in the league."" For everybody who questioned Steph's productivity and shooting touch months ago as Durant came aboard, he has quieted them all. ""Early on, he got it cookin',"" Durant said. ""We kind of rode the wave from there."" Klay Thompson added 29 points and matched his career high with eight assists, and Durant had 18 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the NBA-leading Warriors (42-7). Curry recorded his fifth career game with at least 11 3s, shot 14 for 20, 11 of 15 from long range and dished out eight assists facing Charlotte for the second time in exactly a week. The two-time reigning NBA MVP was sick -- his shooting, that is. He sat out Sunday night at Portland with the stomach flu. Nothing slowed him down this night, and he even hit one third-quarter 3 while falling into the front row of fans. ""It's amazing. You've got to appreciate greatness,"" Thompson said. Already having set the regular-season single-game record with 13 on Nov. 7 against New Orleans, Curry rested in the fourth. Golden State wound up with 21 3s in all Wednesday on a franchise-record 48 attempts. Frank Kaminsky scored 24 points off the bench for the Hornets, who lost their sixth in a row overall and ninth straight on the road. Curry hit six first-quarter 3s and Golden State matched a franchise record with nine 3s in a quarter, doing so for the sixth time. The Warriors led 41-21 after the first, their NBA-leading 14th 40-point quarter. The Warriors reached 70 points by halftime for the seventh time, up 77-56 at the break. Late in the first half, Curry hit his 1,788th career regular-season 3, which moved him past Rashard Lewis into 12th on the NBA career list. In the waning seconds before halftime, two defenders swarmed Curry near half-court in an effort to keep the ball out of his hands. ""When he's shooting the basketball like that, he's pretty unguardable,"" Charlotte's Kemba Walker said. JaVale McGee scored nine points and had a season-best four blocks starting in place of injured center Zaza Pachulia, who will miss at least a week with a strained right rotator cuff. JONES SCORES Back and forth to the D-League all season, rookie Damian Jones made his Oracle Arena debut and scored his first career NBA points.

"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Kevin Durant just missed the garbage can with his postgame ice bag, and that told the story of Golden State's long night. Then, Draymond Green expressed his disgust with the officiating. James Harden notched his fourth triple-double of the season with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists, and the Houston Rockets outlasted the Warriors 132-127 in double overtime Thursday night to end Golden State's 12-game winning streak. Eric Gordon scored 23 off the bench as Houston snapped an eight-game skid to the Warriors, who lost MVP Stephen Curry with 3:25 left in the last extra session when he was whistled for a charge. Ryan Anderson also scored 29 with five 3-pointers and the teams combined to shoot an NBA-record 88 3s, 44 apiece, the Warriors said according to the Elias Sports Bureau. ""A statement win to show the whole NBA that we can compete with anybody in the league,"" Rockets guard Patrick Beverley said. ""We're a very confident team. That's the one thing Coach instilled in the team."" Harden put his team ahead on a 30-footer with 3:12 left in the second overtime and hit a pair of free throws with 2:10 to go following a flagrant foul on Green. ""I thought there was other calls that could have been called flagrant, too,"" Green said. ""I'm under the impression that if you're hit in the head, incidental contact, I think that's a flagrant foul if I'm not mistaken. We'll see. Maybe I'll go read the rule book, maybe I'm wrong. If I'm not mistaken, I'm right. They're the best in the world."" Durant matched his season high with 39 points to go with 13 rebounds but shot 12 of 28 and went 3 for 11 from 3-point range. Green had 20 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists. Curry scored his team's first six points in the initial overtime and finished with 28 points and five assists. Durant also had three steals, three blocks and a gorgeous give-and-go to Green. Houston had an answer each time and the Warriors couldn't hit the big shots the way they usually do. Klay Thompson was 4 for 20, 3 of 13 on 3s, on the way to 15 points. ""There are going to be nights like that. You've got to find a way to win,"" Durant said. ""We put ourselves in a good position to win."" Houston snapped Golden State's seven-game home winning streak in an entertaining rematch of the first round of the playoffs, won in five games by the Warriors, who also beat the Rockets in a five-game 2015 Western Conference finals on the way to their first championship in 40 years. The Warriors hadn't lost in Oracle Arena since a 129-100 season-opening rout by San Antonio on Oct. 25 -- and Golden State has only lost two regular-season games at home in each of the past two seasons. Anderson shined in his first game with the Rockets back in the Bay Area where he starred collegiately for California, hitting the go-ahead free throws with 22.7 seconds left after beating the shot clock buzzer with a baseline 3-pointer and another late field goal.

Whatever it takes to fire up the versatile forward, as far as Kerr is concerned. ""He's our most vocal defender. He's our most vocal human being,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""It translates.""

Both received technical fouls in short succession for arguing -- then he picked up the late flagrant.","400899436"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Kawhi Leonard would prefer to see the Spurs seal their wins with sound defense, rather than last-second shots. When they need a big basket, though, he's up to the task. Leonard had 31 points and 10 rebounds, and San Antonio returned from an eight-game road trip to beat the Indiana Pacers 100-99 on Wednesday night. Leonard hit a turnaround, fade-away jumper from 16 feet against Paul George with 2.4 seconds left to help the Spurs win their first home game since Feb 4. ""Just something you think about when you're a kid and you're in your front yard or at your school playing and you just count down 3, 2, 1,"" Leonard said. ""But I would rather us play a better game and close it out without leaving the last shot up to me, but that's what happened tonight and I had to respond for my team."" Indiana's Monta Ellis missed a pair of free throws with nine seconds remaining and George missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""We didn't run it right at all,"" George said of his final shot. ""(C.J.) Miles was supposed to pin down and he didn't pin down. He made me catch the ball way out there and I tried to make something happen."" San Antonio extended its winning streak to five games, including four straight to close its annual rodeo road trip in February. Playing without point guard Tony Parker, who missed the game with a bruised quadriceps, the Spurs' starters struggled throughout. Leonard outscored San Antonio's other starters by 12 points. ""I don't know what the reason is that first game back from a long road trip, but it always seems it's a grind,"" Spurs reserve David Lee said. ""Guys aren't always at their best and it wasn't from a lack of effort. I thought we played really, really hard. Indiana is a tough team and they were hitting shots, but those are the kind of games you need to find a way to win."" The matchup of All-Star forwards was a stalemate until the final five minutes. Leonard scored San Antonio's final nine points during that stretch, including the game-winning shot, while George was limited to a pair of free throws. ""It's fun just being able to guard somebody that is just coming at you aggressively every possession,"" Leonard said. ""And even when I'm coming back with the ball he's into my head wanting me to miss shots. It's just fun playing basketball like that."" George finished with 22 points, Miles added 19 and Myles Turner had 16 for the Pacers. Pau Gasol and Lee had 18 points each off the bench for the Spurs.

"NEW YORK --  Isaiah Thomas had never been part of a 50-game winner, so one goal has been realized. The Boston Celtics have much bigger things ahead of them -- starting with a showdown against the defending NBA champions. Thomas scored 19 points in just 24 minutes and the Celtics remained atop the Eastern Conference, beating the New York Knicks 110-94 on Sunday. ""I've never won 50 games in my NBA career, so definitely was an individual goal of mine coming into this season to win 50 games and I'm just glad we got to that,"" Thomas said. ""But like I keep saying, we've got a lot more work to do."" Jaylen Brown added 16 points for the Celtics, who will be no worse than tied with Cleveland for the best record in the East when they host the Cavaliers on Wednesday. Boston is off until then, while the Cavs were set to play two games in between. Boston secured its first 50-win season since going 56-26 in 2010-11 and did it easily, shooting 55.6 percent and getting 14 points apiece from Marcus Smart and Al Horford. ""Couple years ago I would've thought that that was going to be something that we were really going to have to build for a while to, but I thought that obviously we've been lucky to strike on a couple of guys,"" coach Brad Stevens said.

Courtney Lee scored 16 points and Kristaps Porzingis had 14 for the Knicks, who announced during the game that Derrick Rose will have season-ending surgery to repair torn cartilage in his left knee. They also played without Carmelo Anthony (sore lower back). Boston had little trouble with the Knicks who remained. The Celtics never trailed, shot 60 percent in a 60-point first half and led by as many as 27 points. They had some easy dunks while cruising through the fourth quarter, when a loud ""Let's go Celtics!"" chant broke out in the final minutes at Madison Square Garden. TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens said he texted Sunday with ailing guard Avery Bradley, who said he was feeling better. ""All signs point to him practicing Tuesday with us,"" Stevens said. ...

The Knicks welcomed back coach Jeff Van Gundy and a few players from their 1999 Eastern Conference championship team during a first-half tribute on the court. DERRICK'S DONE Rose's injury news was a surprising but all too familiar ending to his first season in New York. Coach Jeff Hornacek said before the game he thought Rose could play again this season. Instead, it's another summer when Rose will be rehabbing from knee surgery -- and this one comes as he heads into free agency. ""I thought he's played well,"" Hornacek said. ""The explosiveness that you saw years ago, you saw (this year). Again, the way the season has gone, to have something like that happen towards the end is a bad break for us."" PROUD ZAG Former Gonzaga All-American Kelly Olynyk was hoping to join his many former teammates who are already at the Final Four for Monday's national championship game, but figures it will be difficult. He watched Saturday's victory at a bar in New York and his excitement was obvious to anyone following his Twitter feed . ""I was juiced. I was really juiced,"" he said. ""Juiced up -- not juiced. For the record, I was not drinking. I was really excited about things that that team was doing at the moment.""","400899438"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Jimmy Butler defied any inclination to give in to fatigue, and the rest of the Chicago Bulls followed suit with the kind of performance that left little doubt about their desire to make the playoffs. Taking the court on the Gulf Coast one night after a narrow victory on the shores of Lake Michigan, Butler poured in 39 points to lead Chicago to a 117-110 win over the recently resurgent New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday. ""I just want to win. I think my will to do that is going to overcome all the fatigue,"" Butler said. ""At this time of the year, everybody's tired, everybody's nicked up. But when you have mental toughness, you overcome all that."" Butler made 14 of 26 shots, including all three of his 3-point shots, to help the Bulls win for the fifth time in six games. The All-Star guard's final points came on a step-back jumper with 20 seconds left to stem a late Pelicans run. Chicago took sole possession of seventh in the Eastern Conference after beating a Pelicans squad that came in having won eight of 11 and six straight at home. Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg marveled at the way Butler was ""just shooting from all over the floor, the rhythm that he had going ... just rising up and shooting it like there is nobody else in the gym."" ""It was a great performance to get us going, get us a nice lead at halftime, and hold out down the stretch."" Butler hit nine of his first 11 shots and it didn't seem to matter who guarded him. He made everything from a short step-back fade over the 6-foot-11 Davis to decisive mid-range jumpers coming off of screens and a pair of 3s in the first half, when he had 25 points. ""He made some tough shots, shots off one leg, turnarounds, contested,"" said Pelicans forward Anthony Davis, who had 30 points and 11 rebounds. ""I think they played a little harder than us and it showed with the offensive rebounds, with the 50-50 balls."" Bobby Portis, who finished with 21 points, hit six of his first seven shots. His and Butler's accuracy helped Chicago shoot nearly 57 percent during the first half. The Bulls led by as many as 19 in the second quarter before going into the halftime up 63-47. Chicago still led by 13 with less than three minutes left, but New Orleans quickly got as close as six when Davis' jumper capped a 7-0 run that began with Jrue Holiday's 3. However, New Orleans missed a chance to get closer when Paul Zipser blocked Holiday's transition layup with 36 seconds left. Butler then drained his final basket, a 20-footer over Holiday from the right side, to help the Bulls close it out comfortably. TIP-INS Bulls: Joffrey Lauvergne scored 15 points, while Rajon Rondo added 10 points, nine assists, nine rebounds and three steals. ...

""We really shared the ball and it was a nice game to watch,"" said Lauvergne, who made three 3-pointers. ""Everybody was making shots, man,"" added Butler. ""When everybody's attacking and getting it to the open guy, everybody's going to get open shots."" NO REGRETS Butler said he likes the way the Bulls have come together since he and guard Dwyane Wade said in late January that it looked like some of them didn't care enough about winning. ""I don't regret anything,"" Butler said when asked to revisit the locker-room criticism. ""Everybody's just fine right now. We're winning. We're in a good place. ... We don't talk about it. Everybody's playing their role. Everybody's doing what they're supposed to do. That's all you can ask.""","400899439"
"TORONTO --  After a 40-point game going into the weekend, DeMar DeRozan helped his teammates score on Sunday to lead the Toronto Raptors past the Philadelphia 76ers 113-105 for their ninth straight home win against their division rival. DeRozan had just 17 points, but tied his season high with nine assists as the Raptors closed out a four-game homestand by going 3-1. In the continued absence of All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry, out following wrist surgery, DeRozan was only too happy to contribute to the win in any way he could. ""Sometimes people get so caught up in the scoring, but I watch the game of basketball from the perspective of getting other guys involved as well,"" he said. ""When I get a chance to exploit that and my teammates show it for me, it's great."" His selflessness didn't go unnoticed, with a number of the Raptors impressed by the way the NBA's fifth-leading scorer switched up his game, taking just four shots from the floor in the entire first half. ""It's big-time, you know,"" said Serge Ibaka, who led the way with 24 points and six blocks. ""One time, I passed him the ball and I told him to finish it and he passed it back to me. I asked him why he didn't finish it and he told me, `You had it.' When you hear something like that from your best player . that gives you a lot of confidence."" In falling to their third straight loss, the 76ers were frustrated that they couldn't close the gap during the fourth quarter. Up 10 points entering the period, the Raptors sat all of their starters except for Cory Joseph, who played just 3:42 in the final frame. Toronto ultimately pushed its lead to a game-high 17 on a free throw from Norman Powell with 3:49 to play, but although the Sixers scored the next 11 points, Jakob Poeltl's one-handed jam with 13 seconds left capped the scoring erased any hope of a Philadelphia comeback. The last time the 76ers won in Toronto was Nov. 10, 2012. ""We just couldn't get over the hump,"" said Canadian guard Nik Stauskas, who finished with 14 points. ""We were trying to put on a press, we were trying to slow them down a little bit, trying to get some turnovers and they showed why they are one of the best teams in the league."" For the second straight game, rookie Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot set a career high in points, with his 23 on Sunday trumping the 19 he had in Friday's loss to Cleveland. Dario Saric also added 16. While the injury-riddled Sixers will miss the playoffs for the fifth straight season, coach Brett Brown said his team's strong close to the game bodes well for the future. ""None of us intend on just rolling over,"" Brown said. ""We're playing with a spirit, which I've said many times, I hope that the city of Philadelphia is proud of."" TIP-INS 76ers: Saric (left heel) started the game, but was on a 24-minute limit. Saric is the only Sixers player to appear in every game this season. ... T.J. McConnell had 11 assists for his 12th game with 10 or more assists, the most by a Philadelphia player since Michael Carter-Williams had 12 in the 2013-14 season. . The Sixers had five players with double-digit scoring. Raptors: F P.J. Tucker (left knee) missed the game. ... DeRozan needs just 199 more points to tie Vince Carter's single-season franchise record of 2,107, set in the 1999-2000 season. ...

Toronto improved to 15-6 this season when they shoot 50 per cent or more from the field. . Poeltl tied his season high with 12 points. ALEX THE GREAT? D-League All-Star Alex Poythress made his NBA debut with 4:28 to play in the first quarter, entering the game wearing a No. 5 jersey in place of Saric. Poythress, signed by the Sixers earlier on Sunday, was added to the roster under the NBA's injury hardship exception. He scored his first points on a one-handed dunk over Valanciunas and ended up playing 24 minutes, scoring 11 points. DEROZAN TO THE POINT While the Raptors star turned provider in Lowry's absence, don't count on it being a regular thing. ""I told him he needs to hurry on back,"" DeRozan said of his injured teammate. ""Playing point guard is exhausting."" PASSING GRADE The Raptors finished with 25 assists, their fifth straight game with at least 20. That effort got an enthusiastic response from Ibaka. ""We know to win championships takes two things: playing defense and moving the ball on offense,"" he said.","400899440"
"NEW YORK --  Former Hawks assistant coach Kenny Atkinson played spoiler against his old team with playoff positioning on the line for Atlanta. Brook Lopez scored 29 points, Jeremy Lin had 15, and the Brooklyn Nets ruined Paul Millsap's return to the lineup by beating the Hawks 91-82 on Sunday. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 11 points for the Nets, who have won two straight games. Brooklyn, in its first season under Atkinson after he spent four seasons under Mike Budenholzer in Atlanta, won both games in a back-to-back set for the first time since March 31 and April 1, 2015. Dennis Schroder scored 16 points, while Millsap and Tim Hardaway Jr. each had 14 for the Hawks, who have lost two straight. Millsap returned after a seven-game absence with a left knee injury but Atlanta fell to 39-38, just a game ahead of seventh place in the Eastern Conference. ""I think everyone is disappointed with the loss,"" Millsap said. ""But at the end of the day, we have to get some wins. We know that. As long as everyone else keeps losing under us, we just have to make it to the playoffs. If we get there we feel like we have a really good chance."" The All-Star forward cut Brooklyn's lead to 82-77 with 4:07 remaining on a one-legged foul line jumper while being fouled by Lin. Hardaway then trimmed the deficit to 83-80 on a three-point play with 3:27 remaining. However, Brooklyn's Spencer Dinwiddie drained a corner 3-pointer with 2:33 left to extend the lead to 86-80. Atlanta was called for a shot clock violation on the following possession. Lin iced the game with a pass to a wide-open Trevor Booker under the basket to give Brooklyn a 90-82 lead with 28 seconds to play. Brooklyn took a 70-61 lead heading into the fourth quarter as Caris LeVert scored nine points in the third quarter after being held scoreless in the first half. Lopez led Brooklyn with 21 points at the half as the Nets took a 46-43 lead into the locker room. Dwight Howard and Hardaway led Atlanta with nine points apiece at the half. Lopez and Lin combined for 26 of Brooklyn's 29 first-quarter points. ""That's kind of why they're your two best players,"" Atkinson said. ""There's just a mentality, I was saying that about Brook. Brook after a bad game or a not-good shooting game like Detroit, he's going to come back and bring it the next game. They set the tone; I thought Jeremy and Brook really set the tone."" TIP-INS Hawks: Budenholzer praised Hardaway's development after increasing his scoring from 6.4 points per game last season to 14.2 this season. ""He's getting a lot more of an opportunity. Lots of times it comes with that, but he's earned that opportunity with his play. His confidence has grown and I think he's competing on both ends of the court. I think a lot of it is confidence paired with opportunity and good things happen."" ... Millsap came off the bench for the first time this season. ... Malcolm Delaney (back spasms) and Thabo Sefolosha (right groin strain) were out. Nets: Atkinson said Joe Harris will miss the rest of the season with a sprained left shoulder, but expressed optimism for his return next season. ""I like, obviously, 38 percent from the 3-point line. That's important in the league today. Love how he competes and fits into our culture. I'm very anxious to get him in the gym this summer and continue to work and get better. He is a high level worker and has high-level character. He's had a pretty good season.""","400899441"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Playing stifling defense is becoming second nature to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Such a development should surprise no one who has followed Tom Thibodeau's NBA coaching career. Thibodeau is well-versed in how to make life miserable for opponents on offense and gets his players immersed in every defensive scenario. The results have turned the Timberwolves into a scarier team than their record indicates. Minnesota dominated Utah for the bulk of four quarters on its way to a 107-80 victory Wednesday night. The Jazz's offense stayed out of sync for long stretches, coughing up 14 turnovers and shooting just 38.9 percent from the field. ""I feel like we want it more,"" Minnesota forward Andrew Wiggins said. ""We want to play defense more. We've been doing a lot in practice (and) shootaround, going through it. I think it's muscle memory now, starting to kick in."" Karl-Anthony Towns scored 21 points and grabbed 15 rebounds to lead the Timberwolves. Wiggins scored 20 points, and Shabazz Muhammad added 18 for Minnesota, who won for the fourth time in their last five games. Utah is the fourth opponent in the last seven games that Minnesota held under 90 points. ""It's just the discipline,"" Towns said. ""We're executing no matter what happens. We're sticking to our principles and that's a sign of a team growing."" Dante Exum scored a season-high 15 points and Gordon Hayward added 13 to lead the Jazz, while Derrick Favors had 10 points and 12 rebounds. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak in the series for Utah, which has lost two straight overall. Utah shot just 32.7 percent from the floor in the first two quarters alone and led just once. The early sluggishness opened the door for Minnesota to take control right away. The Timberwolves opened up their first double-digit lead early in the second quarter. Minnesota took a 27-16 lead when Tyus Jones turned steals into baskets on consecutive possessions. Jones took the first in for a layup. He set up a dunk for Shabazz Muhammad with the second. The Jazz strung together a 10-0 run to briefly threaten the Timberwolves before halftime. Exum created the initial spark with a 3-pointer and Joe Ingles finished the run off with another long-distance basket, cutting Minnesota's lead to 27-26. Utah could not erase the deficit altogether before the Timberwolves pulled away again. Towns buried a 3-pointer and Muhammad scored on another dunk on back-to-back possessions to key an 8-0 run that gave Minnesota a 39-30 lead. The Timberwolves then scored on three straight possessions -- highlighted by a 3-pointer from Wiggins and a layup from Muhammad -- to extend their cushion to 51-35 heading into the locker room. ""It's hard to pinpoint one thing,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We didn't have energy and we didn't execute."" Minnesota did not let the Jazz rally again after halftime. The Timberwolves led by as many as 30 points, taking a 95-65 lead on a dunk from Muhammad with 4:24 remaining. TIP INS Timberwolves: Towns notched his 46th double-double of the season. He also scored at least 20 points and collected at least 10 rebounds for the 33rd time this season. Both marks rank in the Top 3 in the NBA. ... Minnesota has allowed just 88.0 points per game over its last five wins. Jazz: Hayward set a career high for scoring average in a month in February. Hayward averaged 25.5 points per game while recording 30-plus points five times. ... C Rudy Gobert finished with two blocked shots. Gobert has tallied at least one block in 30 consecutive games and leads the NBA in total blocks (154). BENCH BOOST Minnesota pulled away from Utah multiple times in the first half behind a strong effort from its second unit. Muhammad finished four points shy of his season high. Nemanja Bjelica tallied 13 points and 11 rebounds for his second straight double-double. It is just the fifth of Bjelica's career. Both players contributed baskets in critical stretches that kept the Jazz at arm's length. Overall, the Timberwolves finished with 40 bench points. ""The bench was terrific again,"" Thibodeau said. ""I thought they played with good energy. There was good chemistry.""","400899442"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Orlando Magic coach Frank Vogel had a simple trick to help his team get over a brutal loss in Memphis the previous night. ""I let them sleep in,"" Vogel said. Aaron Gordon scored a season-high 20 points, Nikola Vucevic had 12 points, 11 rebounds and five assists and the Magic awoke from its slumber to cruise by the Philadelphia 76ers 105-88 in a matchup of slumping Eastern Conference teams Friday night. Serge Ibaka, Evan Fournier and Jeff Green all added 16 points for the Magic (8-12), who had lost five of six coming in, including a one-point loss to the Grizzlies on Thursday in which they blew a 14-point fourth-quarter lead. ""I thought we played well last night and we just didn't close the game out,"" Vogel said. ""We're continuing to show we have one of the top defenses in the league. We're going to be a great defensive team and we're going to score enough to win."" Bismack Biyombo had 13 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who shot 50 percent from 3-point range and 47.4 percent from the field. The Sixers (4-15) lost their fifth straight despite 25 points and 10 rebounds from rookie Joel Embiid. It was his fifth double-double of the season. Jahlil Okafor, who saw extended action with Embiid for the first time this season, also had a double-double with 16 points and 13 rebounds. Nobody else scored in double figures for the Sixers, who shot 37.9 percent from the field. They missed 20 of their 26 shot attempts in the first quarter and allowed the Magic to go on an early 16-0 run to fall behind for good. ""Sometimes you read so much into back-to-backs,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""You assume people are tired or depressed because they lost at the buzzer. I give them credit. They came in and played with great energy. I don't know how to explain that."" The game was the first for the rested Sixers in four days after Wednesday's scheduled matchup against the Sacramento Kings was postponed because of moisture on the Wells Fargo Center court. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando was back in the same building where it overcame an 18-point deficit in a 103-101 win over the Sixers a little more than a month ago. The Magic have won four straight vs. Philly. ... The Magic have two games left of a five-game trip. 76ers: Robert Covington left in the fourth quarter with a left knee sprain after logging nine points and six rebounds. ... PG Jerryd Bayless missed his third straight game with left wrist soreness after previously sitting out the first 13 games. THE EMBIID-OKAFOR EXPERIMENT Embiid and Okafor looked sharp when paired together as the crowd roared in delight watching the two cornerstones of the franchise's rebuilding effort. In the second quarter, Embiid hit a 3-pointer, fed Okafor for a basket and then hit a jumper to pull the Sixers within 23-21. During their second stint together in the fourth quarter, the two centers produced 12 of the team's 19 points while combining to shoot 5 for 5 from the field in just over 7 minutes. ""I thought we had our moments,"" said Embiid, who had his minutes restriction increased from 24 to 28 two days after being named the NBA's Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for October/November. ""We made shots. Obviously we need to play more together."" MEEKS' BIG RETURN Magic guard Jodie Meeks made his season debut after a foot injury held him out for the first 19 games. He finished with 10 points and three steals in 17 minutes, while shooting 2 for 3 from 3-point range. Vogel didn't think it was a coincidence that the sharpshooter's return coincided with Orlando's best shooting night of the season. ""It's contagious, I guess,"" Vogel said. ""It was good to see him back out there. He was a little rusty in certain areas but that's to be expected. But he looked a lot less rusty than I thought he would."" CLUTCH SHOOTING (AND PASSING) The Magic put the game away in the third quarter thanks to consecutive 3s from D.J. Augustin followed by one from Gordon -- shots Vogel called ""pivotal."" Gordon, who shot 9 for 14 from the field and 2 for 4 from 3-point range, credited the team's passing for all of the baskets. ""I think our passing was very good tonight,"" he said. ""We were on time and on target.""","400899443"

Gallinari scored a game-high 29 points, Nikola Jokic and Wilson Chandler each added 19, and the desperate Denver Nuggets beat the Miami Heat 116-113 on Sunday night in a matchup of playoff hopefuls. ""We needed this one,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We're still alive, man."" Denver moved within two games of No. 8 Portland for the final spot in the Western Conference. Miami (37-40) held on to No. 8 in the East, even after a second straight home loss. The Heat are a game behind No. 7 Chicago (38-39 after winning in New Orleans) and hold the tiebreaker over No. 9 Indiana (37-40 after losing in double overtime at Cleveland). ""This is like our playoffs right now and it's been like that for a while,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Our guys are laying it all out there. We just haven't been able to get the job done the last couple games."" Goran Dragic scored 22 points for the Heat. Josh Richardson scored 17 and Hassan Whiteside had 16 points and 12 rebounds for Miami. Denver survived some drama at the end. The Heat argued to referee Ron Garretson that Jokic traveled as he tried twice to inbound the ball after Tyler Johnson's 3-pointer with 10.8 seconds left got Miami within 114-113. Garretson wouldn't hear it, waving Heat assistants and players back to the bench. ""We all would have liked to have seen that call, just to see what would happened,"" Spoelstra said. ""That doesn't guarantee anything."" Denver burned two timeouts before Jokic eventually got the ball in to Jamal Murray, who made two free throws. Richardson missed a 3-pointer as time expired. ""C'mon man, he walked. He walked,"" said Whiteside, who was guarding the inbounds. ""I don't want to speak on it too much because the NBA loves fining people a lot of money, so I'm going to keep my money. But there's a reason why y'all asked that."" Gallinari hit two straight jumpers late in the fourth to push a one-point Denver lead out to six, and the Nuggets would hang on from there.

James Harden scored 26 points and the Rockets hit 20 of their first 39 attempts from beyond the arc in a 122-103 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Houston opened a 31-point lead early in the fourth quarter, so it didn't even matter that the Rockets missed their last 13 tries from 3-point range. ""You don't really realize how many we are taking until you hear later because it's so naturally the way we play,"" said Ryan Anderson, who had 23 points and a team-high six 3s. ""It's fun basketball when you trust the next guy to give up the shot and make the right play to get the open look."" Trailing 44-43 with 8:56 left in the second quarter, the Rockets outscored Los Angeles 66-34 over the next 21-plus minutes as they reached new heights for coach Mike D'Antoni. ""There were so many guys who played well,"" D'Antoni said. ""Probably our best game start to finish. It started early in the quarter when our second group came in and did a heck of a good job. ""It was a combination of things. They didn't play particularly well. They missed a few shots and James was picking them apart."" Harden hit four 3s and handed out nine assists.

""That was a big game for us, important obviously to bounce back,"" Anderson said. ""We didn't play the game we wanted to play last game. We got stops, really paid attention to detail on the defensive end, and ran the ball on them. That's where we knew we would have an advantage. It was a great effort tonight.""

Chris Paul had 16 points and 10 assists to lead the Clippers, who lost for the third time in four games. Blake Griffin added 17 points, Austin Rivers scored 16 and Luc Mbah a Moute 13 for Los Angeles. ""Most of all it was our defense,"" Paul said. ""I think that's where (the Rockets) sort of break your spirit when they make all those tough 3s. We have to be able to, when they make a shot, get it out, run it back down and score ourselves."" Houston's 70-58 halftime lead marked the eighth time this season the Rockets had 70 or more points by halftime. They made 11 of 24 3-pointers in the first half.

Bradley Beal, who scored 19 of his 23 points in the first half, didn't like the pro-Lakers fans, either. It didn't matter that Washington, whose last six-game run came from Dec. 8-19, 2014, won its 16th straight game at home -- second-longest in franchise history. ""I'm sick of that,"" Beal said. ""That's terrible. I felt like we were on the road today."" Jordan Clarkson led Los Angeles with 20 points. The Wizards outscored the Lakers 27-15 in the second quarter, and had a 14-point halftime lead. ""The second quarter was terrible,"" Los Angeles coach Luke Walton said. ""We actually came out and played a little better than I thought we would. It's tough when you fly across the country like that and you kind of expect some early sloppiness and then you expect the guys to clean it up. ""I think it took a little too long to clean it up, but I was proud the way we came back in the second half."" TIP INS Lakers: Walton was happy to hear that Magic Johnson was returning to the team as an adviser. ""I'm excited, obviously. He's Magic Johnson. Not only one of the all-time great Lakers, but one of the great all-time NBA players. He's a champion. It's a nice piece to have on your side,"" Walton said. ... F Julius Randle returned after missing two games with pneumonia and finished with two points and two rebounds in less than six minutes. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks said C Ian Mahinmi, who has missed all but one game this season with a knee injury, participated in drills the last two days and is getting closer to a return. ... Wall was selected as a participant in the Skills Competition on Feb. 18. WALL STAR: Brooks wasn't pleased with many facets of his team's game, but raved about Wall taking the game over in the final minutes. ""Rightfully so, he's an All-Star. He's one of the best point guards in the league,"" Brooks said. ""I don't know if he's ever had All-NBA, but he's an All-NBA player."" 3-POINT MAN: Los Angeles G Nick Young will participate in the 3-point contest on Feb. 18 during All-Star Weekend in New Orleans. The announcement was made during the game, and Young found out about it in an unusual way. ""I just found out so, it was a good moment. During the game, one of the fans told me,"" Young said. He entered the game shooting 42.4 percent on 3-point shots, but missed seven of eight. GORTAT HOT: Marcin Gortat equaled his season high with 21 points, shooting 10 for 13. He had 14 rebounds. During the six-game winning streak, Gortat has shot 42 for 52, 80.7 percent. He's allowing the other starters: Wall, Beal, Otto Porter and Markieff Morris to get the shots. ""I'm just running up and down. I guess they're disrespecting me the most of the five,"" Gortat joked.","400899446"
"BOSTON --  A runaway start for the Boston Celtics turned into a tight finish. Al Horford led the Celtics early and late, with 26 points, eight rebounds and six blocked shots to lead Boston to a 97-92 win over the Sacramento Kings on Friday night. ""He just was aggressive. He knocked down his shots. He did what we needed him to do and he carried us tonight,"" said Isaiah Thomas, who scored 14 of his 20 points in the second half to help the Celtics hold off the Kings. Jae Crowder added 16 points and Avery Bradley had 15 points and nine assists for Boston, which needed a 10-0 run in the fourth quarter to pull away and finish off the Kings. Sacramento continued to scrap until the end. Horford helped seal it with six seconds left when he swatted away 3-point attempt by DeMarcus Cousins, then hit a pair of foul shots for Boston's final points. ""I know that he tried to draw something there. I just stayed solid and not let him get a shot off,"" Horford said. ""I'm just trying to be active -- as active as I can be."" Sacramento outrebounded Boston 51-44, but hurt itself in the final period with turnovers, missed shots and a technical foul called on Matt Barnes as Boston surged ahead. Cousins led Sacramento with 28 points and nine rebounds. Darren Collison and Rudy Gay scored 13 apiece for the Kings. ""Cousins is Cousins. He's going to score,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""He's to get 28 points or whatever he got, but you can't let those other guys have huge nights too."" The Kings were playing for the first time since Monday. Sacramento's six-game road trip was interrupted when Wednesday's game at Philadelphia was postponed because of condensation on the floor. The layoff showed early as the Celtics went up by 13 points in the first period, but the Kings regrouped and rallied to tie it by the end of the quarter. ""It's almost like we have to get hit first for us to react. It's not good for us,"" Cousins said. ""We're in the situation where we have to come in and be aggressive every night. If we don't figure this out, we're going to continue to have these kind of games and just another losing season."" BIG AL It was Horford's best game since leaving Atlanta to sign with Boston over the summer. His previous high for scoring with the Celtics was 20 points and he hadn't blocked more for Boston since getting four against Brooklyn in his Celtics debut. ""He's all over the place. He covers a lot of ground. He calls out calls. I think he's a competitive guy and that's proved in his winning track record,"" Stevens said. ""One thing about Al -- he's always in the stands. His arms are always long. He takes up a lot of space and he reacts quickly to what is going on."" SLOW-DOWN OFFENSE The Kings had their chances to win in Boston for the first time since 2007. They didn't help themselves down the stretch, making just 6 of 23 in the fourth quarter and going without a field goal from Gay's layup with 8:33 remaining until Gay hit a 3-pointer with 4:51 left to play pulled Sacramento within 84-81. ""We got off to a really slow start,"" Gay said. ""They're a good team but we shot ourselves in the foot today. BIG BENCH Sacramento reserves outscored Boston's 33-12. Barnes led the Kings' reserves with 12 points and sparking Sacramento's rally in the first quarter after the dreadful start. ""Their bench crushed us when they came in,"" Stevens said. ""I didn't think we responded to attacking them well or defending them well with their energy in that group."" TIP-INS Kings: The Kings closed the first quarter on a 13-0 run to tie it at 29-all entering the second period. ... ... Sacramento entered the game having lost eight straight visits to Boston.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Brook Lopez reached a career milestone and was given the game ball. What he cherished most was the victory, a rarity these days for the Nets. The veteran Brooklyn center had 24 points and eight rebounds to surpass 10,000 points with the Nets, who never trailed in snapping a 16-game losing streak by defeating the Sacramento Kings 109-100 on Wednesday night. The Nets' previous win was Jan. 20 at New Orleans, and they had dropped 27 of 28 since beating Charlotte on Dec. 26. The franchise record for consecutive losses is 18 by the 2009-10 team that went 12-70, another low mark in club history. ""The win is the most important thing,"" said Lopez, who had eight fourth-quarter points. ""Obviously, I'm proud. It's a testament to all the people I've played with over the years."" Lopez's second-quarter dunk made him the second player in Nets history to score 10,000 points. Lopez has played all nine of his NBA seasons with the Nets and has 10,014 points, leaving him behind only Buck Williams (10,440) on the franchise list. Jeremy Lin scored 17 points, Isaiah Whitehead had 14 and Caris LeVert finished with 13 for the NBA-worst Nets (10-49). Brooklyn made 11 3-pointers and shot 46 percent. ""I'm so happy for him. He's a fun-loving guy and he works so hard and cares,"" Lin said. ""People don't realize how diligent and calculated he is with his work. So 10,000 points, I'm so glad I was able to at least be a part of it."" Lopez and Lin each played a huge role down the stretch to ensure the victory. The two combined for 14 of the Nets' final 16 points to help end a long and frustrating six-week winless period. ""It's so huge having him (Lin) out there leading and playmaking. He makes so many things much easier for us,"" Lopez said. Sacramento rookie Buddy Hield hit four 3-pointers and scored 16 points. Ty Lawson and Tyreke Evans both had 15 points, and Aaron Afflalo added 14. The young Kings have lost three straight and are 1/3 since trading DeMarcus Cousins to the Pelicans in a blockbuster deal. The struggling Kings (25-36) committed 15 turnovers that led to 18 points. They fell three games behind eighth-place Denver for the final Western Conference playoff spot and into a tie with Minnesota for ninth. ""I'm a little disappointed we didn't win tonight. We couldn't quite get over the hump,"" Afflalo said. ""Obviously, we're a young team now, but we've just got to learn how to take care of the ball a little bit better and get stops when we need them."" Evans hit a 3 and followed with a jumper, pulling the Kings to 99-93 with 2:34 remaining. A basket by Lawson with 30 seconds left cut the margin to four, but Randy Foye made two free throws and Lin added two more to secure the victory. ""We didn't come out with enough force to start the game and they physically manhandled us around the perimeter of the floor,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We just dribbled too much, which caused them to get opportunities on runouts. We've just got to get stronger with the basketball."" The Nets got off to a fast start, making six 3-pointers in the first quarter while taking a 35-31 lead. They led by three at halftime and outscored cold-shooting Sacramento 24-18 in the third period to take a nine-point lead into the fourth. TIP-INS Nets: This was the third stop on an eight-game road trip, their longest of the season. Kings: Rookie big man Skal Labissiere started his first game after several recent promising performances. He had 10 points and five rebounds in 15 minutes. ... Sacramento is clearly lacking an interior presence without Cousins. Starting center Kosta Koufos missed all seven shots and went scoreless in nearly 25 minutes. READY TO GO With three days' rest and a couple of practices to prepare, the Nets came out strong in the opening quarter, scoring the first eight points and taking their biggest lead at 21-6. Although the Kings came back quickly to cut into the lead, Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson thought the way his team started was vital to the victory. ""We felt it from the beginning,"" Atkinson said. ""We were here to take control of the game, rather than sitting back and waiting for the game. Give that starting group a lot of credit. I felt Brook was great and Jeremy was aggressive.""","400899448"
"HOUSTON -- Dwight Howard repeatedly insisted that this had nothing to do with revenge. Howard scored 24 points and grabbed 23 rebounds in his first game in Houston since signing with Atlanta in the offseason, leading the Hawks to a 113-108 victory over the Rockets on Thursday night. ""I didn't really think about it like that,"" Howard said. ""It wasn't like, `Aww, we've got to beat Houston because it's my first time back.' I just knew we needed the win."" The Hawks trailed by as many as 20 points and entered the fourth quarter down 13 before Howard led a late comeback. Tim Hardaway Jr. had a career-high 33 points for Atlanta, including a driving dunk with less than a minute remaining that gave Atlanta a three-point lead. Hardaway scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, going 8 for 11 from the field, 3 for 5 from the 3-point line and 4 for 5 from the foul line. Howard said Hardaway gets a scary look on his face when he's angry enough to take over a game, and he saw it in the fourth quarter. Teammates teased Hardaway in the postgame locker room, jokingly providing him special services, such as bringing him deodorant and offering to make him a plate for his dinner. ""These guys can play all they want, but what was working was DeAndre' Bembry -- you've got to give him all the credit,"" Hardaway said. ""He took the challenge of guarding possibly the MVP of the season, it's a hard task, but he stayed discipline."" Bembry matched up with James Harden for nearly the entire fourth quarter, holding him to just six points. Harden finished with 41 points, eight assists and eight rebounds, but the Rockets struggled to make shots down the stretch. Clint Capela had 22 points and nine rebounds. Houston lost its lead when Hardaway was fouled on a driving layup and converted the free throw to give Atlanta a one-point lead with two minutes remaining. During the fourth-quarter rally, Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer made the bold call to leave starters Paul Millsap and Dennis Schroder on the bench to keep the streaking unit in the game. ""I think it speaks to the character of the team to keep fighting until you find the right group that gave us the chance to win,"" Budenholzer said. ""That group found a way without two of our best players and that was special."" Howard, who spent the last three seasons in Houston, received a mostly warm welcome by the Toyota Center crowd, with some light, scattered boos. ""I appreciated my time here. I chose this city in free agency, and I chose it for a reason,"" Howard said. ""I think Houston is a great place, but with the business of basketball, I felt like coming home would be great for my career."" Howard dominated the game early, winning the tip against Capela and scoring eight points in the first four minutes. He had a double-double before halftime. After a back-and-forth first half that featured 13 lead changes, the Rockets held a slim 50-47 lead at the break. Houston got separation early in the second half when Harden drained three 3-pointers in the first two minutes of the third quarter. Harden scored Houston's first 13 points of the quarter, extending the lead to nine. After hitting one fadeaway jumper in his red-hot third quarter, Harden gestured to a sideline spectator in a newsboy cap and gold chain: boxer Floyd Mayweather, who was in town for the Super Bowl. ""Man, we just relaxed,"" Harden said. ""Honestly, we did a good job in the first three quarters, and in the fourth quarter, I don't know what happened. Obviously, we didn't make shots, but defensively, we just relaxed. We didn't follow our principles."" TIP-INS Hawks: Thabo Sefolosha missed his third straight game with a groin injury. Hardaway started in his place. ... Mike Dunleavy left the game early in the fourth quarter with an apparent ankle injury and did not return. Rockets: Before the game, SG Eric Gordon was selected as one of the eight participants in the 3-point shooting contest during NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans on Feb. 18. Gordon ranks second in the NBA with 170 3-pointers made, shooting 38.6 percent from the 3-point line. LATE ARRIVALS The nationally televised game was sparsely attended for much of the first half. With a sizeable area of downtown blocked off for nearby Super Bowl festivities, traffic was heavy, parking was difficult and fans were rerouted around usual routes, causing a late-arriving crowd. Two courtside spectators who arrived on time to sit midcourt courtside next to Rockets owner Les Alexander were Hall of Fame centers Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutombo. HONORING BATTIER As part of their ongoing celebration of the franchise's 50th season, the Rockets honored former small forward Shane Battier with a video montage during the first half. Battier played five seasons in Houston from 2006 to 2011 and was named to the Rockets' all-decade team for the 2000s. At one point during the third quarter, Battier returned to his baseline seat to find a familiar face occupying his chair: former teammate and 7-foot-6 Hall of Famer Yao Ming. LIVE BY THE 3 Houston went 13-for-51 (25.5 percent) from 3-point range, recording 50 3-point attempts for the sixth time this season. Only one other team has recorded 50 3s in a single game in NBA history. Houston has made 15 3s only twice in the past 11 games after doing so in 15 of 20 games prior.","400899449"
"DENVER --  With star center DeMarcus Cousins producing as expected, Darren Collison broke out of his offensive funk and pushed the Sacramento Kings to a big road win. Cousins had 31 points, Collison scored a season-high 26 to go with seven assists, and the Kings beat the Denver Nuggets 120-113 on Tuesday night. Sacramento led most of the way to stop a two-game skid and win for the fifth time in seven games. ""This win was crucial,"" Collison said. ""We had to get that taste out of our mouth. We felt like the last couple of games we got away from who we are as a team."" Collison was averaging just 8.4 points in the previous five games despite scoring 16 against Memphis on Saturday. He had 17 in the first half against Denver when Sacramento took the lead for good. ""D.C. finally got rolling,"" Cousins said. ""He was struggling but he came in and played with confidence and had a big game for us."" The Kings used a 15-0 run in the second quarter to take a 50-36 lead. Denver went nearly seven minutes without a field goal and missed 10 shots before Jusuf Nurkic hit a layup with 2:46 left before halftime. Denver got within three in the fourth quarter and had chances to trim it to one or tie, but Sacramento kept extending the lead with Cousins on the bench. The lead was five when he returned, and he helped the Kings push it to 11 with 2:22 left with assists on a 3-pointer by Arron Afflalo and a layup by Garrett Temple. Denver was stung by former Nuggets players. Afflalo had 19 points off the bench in his return to the lineup, and Kosta Koufos scored 18. ""DeMarcus is an All-NBA player. He's a load,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""But we couldn't allow Collison to get 26 and Koufos to go 8 of 9 for 18."" Danilo Gallinari led Denver with 24 points and Nikola Jokic had 18. He and fellow big man Nurkic, who scored 16 off the bench, had trouble containing Cousins all night. ""Their bigs had a tendency to just want to lay on me and try to be physical,"" Cousins said. ""They think it's about holding me up and I took advantage of that and used their advantage against them."" TIP-INS Kings: G Ty Lawson didn't face his old team due to a sinus fracture sustained in Saturday's loss to Memphis. He was close to playing but was held out after experiencing blurred vision in warmups. ... F Rudy Gay missed his third straight game with a right hip flexor strain. Nuggets: F Kenneth Faried missed his second consecutive game with a back injury. Malone said Faried was getting constant treatment for the injury, which flared up after Friday's loss to Philadelphia. ... The Nuggets hit a season-high 18 3-pointers. COUSINS FAN CLUB Cousins has been criticized for his emotional outbursts, but Malone is a big fan of the All-Star center, calling him one of the best in the NBA at his position. ""He's at the top. You tell me something he can't do,"" Malone said. ""I don't say that just because I coached him for a year and a half and I have a relationship with him. His talent is immense. He's an emotional player, he's passionate and he's a competitor. ""We've all seen times when he's kind of lost his emotions and that's never good for him or his team. When I coached him, teams would make a concerted effort to start the game to get under his skin. Portland did that and he went for 55 against them, so you have to be careful what you wish for.""","400899450"
"PHOENIX -- The last time the Phoenix Suns beat the Miami Heat, Devin Booker was 13 years old and rookie Marquese Chriss was 12. So the Suns' 99-90 victory Tuesday night was a long time coming. Booker scored 27 points -- 18 in the second half -- and Chriss added a career-best 18 as Phoenix handed the undermanned Heat their sixth consecutive loss. The Suns snapped a 12-game losing streak against Miami. Phoenix hadn't beaten the Heat since Nov. 3, 2009. Goran Dragic, who missed three of the previous four games with lower back spasms, scored 22 in the first half for Miami before his back tightened up in the second. ""I felt like I didn't move so well anymore,"" he said. Dragic finished with 24 points. He just about had to play, though, because he was one of Miami's eight available players. Willie Reed had 22 points and 18 rebounds for the Heat, both career highs. Eric Bledsoe added 17 points for the Suns, who stretched a four-point halftime lead to 19 in the second half. Phoenix, playing on consecutive nights after a road loss to the Clippers on Monday, wore down Miami in the second half. ""That was the game plan going in,"" Booker said. ""But we couldn't take them lightly. They started out with a short lead but we kept fighting, we kept pushing and finally came out with the win."" Booker shot 3 of 7 in the first half and 6 of 12 in the second, including 3 for 5 on 3-pointers. ""Just trying to find the flow,"" he said. ""I came in at halftime, everybody thought I was being passive. I just tried to be a little more aggressive, at the same time always trying to make the right play, which is tough. You've got to go through trial and error in this league."" Miami scored 14 points in the third quarter. ""That's the type of effort we need,"" Phoenix coach Earl Watson said. ""We understand that defense has to be our foundation in order to change our culture, in order to achieve something greater than just scoring points and having our name in the paper."" The Heat led by nine early and were up 42-37 on Dragic's inside basket with 8:34 left in the first half, but Bledsoe and Chriss sank consecutive 3s in a 9-0 spurt that put Phoenix up 46-42 when Booker made one of two free throws 3:13 before the break. Dragic cut the lead to 54-52 with a left-handed driving layup with 9.3 seconds left before Bledsoe's two free throws with 4.2 seconds remaining put the Suns up 56-52 at the break. The Suns opened the second half with an 11-3 run and were up 79-62 when Booker sank a 28-foot 3-pointer with 1:59 left in the third quarter. Phoenix led 83-66 entering the fourth. ""We struggled to score. We struggled to get good looks,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""I am not absolving us from that, but what I want to see us do is be able to defend during that stretch and be able to hold them to under 40 percent -- make it ugly and be a stone's throw away in the fourth quarter."" Wayne Ellington's 3 cut the Suns' lead to 85-74 with 8:13 to play, but Booker sank a 3-pointer with 6:36 remaining to boost the lead back to 14. Miami cut it to eight in the final two minutes but got no closer. LONG LIST The list of missing Miami players was long: James Johnson (food poisoning), Tyler Johnson (migraine), Dion Waiters (pectineus tear), Hassan Whiteside (right retinal contusion), Justise Winslow (right shoulder), Josh McRoberts (left foot stress fracture). That doesn't include Chris Bosh, who has not played all season. TIP-INS Heat: Miami last lost to the Suns in Phoenix on Jan. 5, 2007. ...

"NEW YORK -- Jeremy Lin fell just short of a triple-double, though there was a 10th assist after the buzzer. The point guard tracked down the game ball and gave it to Kenny Atkinson, who got his first win as an NBA coach not far from where he grew up. ""Pretty special,"" Atkinson said, his eyes welling up a bit. Lin had 21 points, nine rebounds and nine assists in his Nets home debut, Brook Lopez scored 25 and Brooklyn beat the Indiana Pacers 103-94 on Friday night. Lin drew some delirious cheers the way he briefly did during his run of Linsanity last time he played in New York, with the Knicks in 2012. Atkinson was the assistant coach who worked closely with him on that team, and Lin's first thought was of the Northport native when the buzzer sounded. ""This is his and he deserves it, and I better not see him play with that ball or whatever,"" Lin said. ""He better get that framed and make sure he knows."" Sean Kilpatrick hit consecutive 3-pointers during the decisive fourth-quarter surge and finished with 18 points for the Nets, who lost to Boston in their opener. Paul George had 22 points and nine rebounds for the Pacers, who were outscored 31-15 in the fourth quarter. The Nets opened their fifth season in Brooklyn by improving to 4-1 in home openers, an immediate highlight in a rebuilding season where there aren't expected to be many of them. ""They brought the fight to us,"" George said. ""We knew coming in that this team necessarily (did not have) have the names but they play hard and they play together."" The Pacers, who opened with a 130-121 overtime victory over Dallas, surged into the lead with a 31-point third quarter. But the Nets answered with a run early in the fourth, then took control after George's basket tied it at 85 midway through the period. Justin Hamilton's three-point play snapped the tie and Kilpatrick followed with consecutive 3-pointers to put the Nets up 94-85 with about 4 minutes left. Lin closed it out down the stretch with some free throws and a basket in the lane. ""I thought Brooklyn came out and played harder than we did,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. Pacers: Myles Turner, who had 30 points and 16 rebounds in the opener, finished with 13 points and 11 boards. ... G Aaron Brooks missed the game with a sore right knee.

The Pacers' six visits tied them with Atlanta for the most frequent home-opening opponent. THAD GLAD Thaddeus Young scored 19 points. He spent 1 1/2 seasons in Brooklyn and was told last spring by general manager Sean Marks that he wouldn't be traded. Then he was dealt, getting dealt to Indiana for the rights to first-round pick Caris LeVert. He wasn't disappointed by the deal, even though he's still trying to sell his home in Brooklyn. ""I think the farther we got into the summer, I think they realized that there wasn't any use in just holding me or continuing to keep me here if I'm trying to be in situations where I'm trying to win,"" Young said.

"LOS ANGELES --  With a dizzying flurry of long-range shots, the Los Angeles Lakers made Memphis look lost on defense. Nick Young scored 20 points, D'Angelo Russell added 18 and both keyed an early barrage of 3-pointers that sent the Lakers past the Grizzlies 116-102 on Tuesday night. The Lakers made a season-high 17 3-pointers, all but one coming in the first three quarters. They finished 17 of 33 from beyond the arc despite missing nine consecutive attempts in the final period. Young and Russell each connected on six 3s, and five Lakers hit at least one. ""When shooters get hot, a good offense is going to beat a good defense,"" Los Angeles coach Luke Walton said. All that outside shooting opened things up inside for forward Julius Randle, who finished with a triple-double: 19 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. The Lakers had 34 assists, outrebounded the Grizzlies 43-39 and held them to 39 percent shooting while winning for only the third time in 18 games. ""We had our L.A. cool jacket on tonight,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""I don't know who we were performing for, but it wasn't for each other. ""We show signs of greatness and then we are just zombies out there. Tonight was one of those nights."" Marc Gasol led the Grizzlies with 22 points, seven assists and six rebounds. Mike Conley had 21 points. For Randle, it was his third career triple-double. The 11 assists were a career best. Walton said he got on Randle at practice Monday about his inconsistency and later called him at home to see if he was still mad at him. ""I think he can be great and I'm going to continue to hold him to high standards,"" Walton said. ""He obviously responded pretty well and gave us a nice effort."" The Grizzlies have one of the NBA's top defenses. They are tied with Utah for allowing the lowest field goal percentage in the league, and are second to the Jazz in points allowed (97.6 per game). ""We didn't play with great effort, not to mention detail,"" Fizdale said. ""We looked silly out there guarding basic NBA sets. Stuff we run at each other every day, we couldn't even guard. For whatever reason, we just weren't there tonight."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: After making only 12 3-pointers (on 66 attempts) during his first eight years in the league, Gasol has 49 (on 120 attempts) in his first 35 games. ... The Grizzlies have played more games decided by five or fewer points than any team in the league, going 10-2. ... The Grizzlies went 11-6 last month, the best December in team history. Their previous best was nine wins in 2009. Lakers: Young is on a 3-point tear. He has hit 42 in his last nine games, shooting 56 percent (42 of 75). ... No Lakers player is averaging more than 29 minutes per game, while nine are averaging 20-plus minutes. ... The Lakers' bench leads the NBA in scoring (49.2 points per game). TAKING A TOLL The Lakers had lost 15 of 17, a tough grind for a young team that won only 17 games last season and 21 the previous season. ""I think you have guys who want to get better and are tired of losing,"" Walton said. ""It's been a rough couple of years."" GRIZZLIES IMPRESSED The Lakers are trying to get Randle to remain focused and not fall victim to what Russell called one of his mood swings. The effort worked Tuesday. ""He really dictated the pace tonight,"" Conley said.

"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- If this was the final home opener for the Detroit Pistons at The Palace, they certainly produced a performance worthy of the occasion. Andre Drummond had 12 points and 20 rebounds, and the Pistons routed the Orlando Magic 108-82 on Friday night in their most lopsided victory in a home opener. Tobias Harris scored 18 points for the Pistons, and Marcus Morris added 17. ""It was a good team effort tonight,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""I thought everybody was involved and played well."" Pistons owner Tom Gores confirmed before the game the team is close on a deal to move downtown next season, so a run in Auburn Hills that's included three championships may be nearing an end. There will be time later to celebrate the history of The Palace if the move does become official, but Friday's win was a nice moment already. Detroit's 26-point victory broke a franchise record that was last matched in 1967, when the team played at Cobo Arena and the Pistons won their home opener by 23. Ish Smith had 16 points and eight assists for Detroit on Friday. Aaron Gordon led the Magic with 17 points. Detroit went on a 16-0 run in the second quarter to take a 44-24 lead, and the Pistons ended up outscoring Orlando 30-9 in the period. The Magic trailed 54-31 at halftime after shooting just 27 percent from the field. There were so many missed shots by Orlando that Drummond had 16 rebounds in the first half alone. ""I thought that early on, too many guys were trying to get us into the game by themselves instead of trusting their teammates,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""Once it got out of hand, I think our shoulders slumped, but that's going to happen to any team that gets outplayed that badly."" Drummond reached 20 rebounds for the 28th time in his career. His rebounding has never been in question, but the big issue is whether he can finally improve his abysmal foul shooting. He made his only two free throws Friday, drawing a big cheer from the crowd in the third quarter. Orlando never made a game of it after its awful second quarter. The Pistons were up 86-51 after three, and even 7-foot-3 backup Boban Marjanovic got into the game at the end, much to the delight of the home fans. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando finished the game at 35 percent from the field. ... The Magic were outscored 60-36 in the paint. Pistons: Detroit is without PG Reggie Jackson, who is still recovering from a left knee problem. ... Backups Aron Baynes and Beno Udrih scored 13 points apiece. ... The Pistons have won seven in a row against Orlando. ... Drummond had 11 rebounds in the second quarter. BOUNCEBACK Detroit made the playoffs last season for the first time since 2009, so it was a bit of a downer when the Pistons lost their opener 109-91 to Toronto. Detroit evened its record out with an emphatic victory against the Magic. ""We know what it takes to win,"" Drummond said. ""We had that taste of success last year and we know how hard we need to play in order to be a great team. That wasn't the team that we showed against Toronto."" RETURN Orlando had C Bismack Biyombo available after he was suspended for the opener for exceeding the flagrant foul limit in last season's playoffs. He scored two points in 22:51. ""We have to start playing as a team,"" Biyombo said. ""We're out there playing one on one all over the court, and that's not how you win games in this league.""","400899454"
"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Tired wasn't an option for Russell Westbrook on Friday night. The explosive point guard had 51 points in a triple-double and scored the winning points in the Oklahoma City Thunder's 113-110 overtime victory over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night. He played just over 45 minutes and never slowed down. ""You've got to want to win,'' he said. ""Very simple. When you want to win, you don't think about being tired. To me, being tired is a mind thing. It's in your mind. You've got to go out there and compete at a high level and leave it on the floor.'' According to the Thunder, it was the first 50-point triple-double since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had one in 1975. Westbrook finished with 13 rebounds and 10 assists and took a career-high 44 shots to claim his 38th career triple-double. It was the franchise's first game without Kevin Durant on the roster since it moved to Oklahoma City in 2008. Durant left in the offseason to play for the Golden State Warriors. In Oklahoma City's home opener, Westbrook reminded the fans that there's still star power in town. Westbrook made a layup to put the Thunder up a point with 7.6 seconds remaining. Phoenix's Devin Booker missed a layup and Westbrook was fouled. Westbrook scored his 50th and 51st points at the free-throw line with 3.5 seconds remaining. Booker missed a 3-pointer as time expired. Westbrook was 17 of 44 from the field, 2 of 10 from 3-point range and made 15 of 20 free throws. He scored 39 points in the second half and overtime. ""That's what he does,'' Booker said. ""He is an aggressive scorer. One of the best players in the league. We knew that coming in here.'' T.J. Warren had a career-high 30 points for the Suns. Westbrook tied it at 59 on a layup and free throw early in the third, but the Suns responded with a 12-0 run. Westbrook kept the Thunder in it with 23 points in the third quarter on 7-for- 12 shooting, but the Suns led 83-77 heading into the fourth. Westbrook returned from a rest with 8:50 remaining and the Thunder trailing 89-81. Four minutes later, his driving layup gave the Oklahoma City a 97-96 lead. Westbrook then found Roberson open, and Roberson's 3-pointer pushed Oklahoma City's lead to 102-98 with 2:39 to play. After Phoenix rallied to tie it at 102, Westbrook missed several chances to put the Thunder ahead late in regulation, including a missed 3-pointer with 2.9 seconds left. Late in overtime, Westbrook didn't hesitate on his way to the hoop. ""I should have attacked the first time and be able to get to the paint and try to finish,'' he said. — Joel Embiid had 33 points and 14 rebounds, and his two free throws with 7.2 seconds left helped the Philadelphia 76ers seal a 114-110 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. With his fourth triple of the game, Steph Curry passes Reggie Miller to move into second place for the most 3-pointers made in NBA history. Ray Allen sits atop the list.","400899455"
"MIAMI --  Kemba Walker already knows one thing about these Charlotte Hornets. ""We're resilient,"" Walker said. That was proven in earnest Friday night. Walker scored 24 points and the Hornets erased a 19-point deficit in the third quarter on the way to beating Miami 97-91. Charlotte won in the building where its season ended in Game 7 of a first-round matchup last spring, albeit against a very different Heat team that played a home opener without Dwyane Wade on the roster for the first time since 2002. ""We could have given up, but we didn't,"" Walker said. ""We kept wanting it."" Hassan Whiteside led Miami with 20 points and 15 rebounds but sat a long stretch of the second half with foul trouble and needed four stitches to close a gash on his left elbow. Down 65-46, Walker made a 3-pointer to unknowingly start what became a 29-point turnaround. The Hornets clamped down on Miami in the second half, with the Heat shooting 6 for 17 from behind the arc in the final 24 minutes -- and just 6 for 26 from 2-point range in that time. Charlotte's reserves had 30 points after halftime, while the entire Miami roster combined for 34. ""One thing is we were able to stop their penetration more,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""Our defense more energized the offense, and we got really good bench play."" Jeremy Lamb scored 16 points for the Hornets, who had six players in double figures and turned the 65-46 hole into a 94-84 lead with 3 minutes left -- a 48-19 run in about 18 minutes. Nic Batum and Marco Belinelli each scored 12 points for Charlotte. ""They're a well-coached, veteran team,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""They weren't punch-drunk or anything when we went up. ... We knew going in we would have to play a complete game against them and we weren't able to do that."" Goran Dragic scored 14 points and Dion Waiters added 13 for the Heat, who lost a home opener for the first time in nine years. Charlotte had runs of 12-0 and 9-1 in the third quarter alone. ""We just stopped getting stops,"" Heat forward Justise Winslow said. ""That was it."" TIP-INS Hornets: Roy Hibbert started at center, played the first 4:29, and did not return because of right knee soreness. Cody Zeller started the second half in his place. ... Frank Kaminsky (right foot strain) went through a pregame workout but was inactive. ... Belinelli now has 11 regular season appearances in Miami with seven different teams. Heat: Team captain Udonis Haslem grabbed a microphone and addressed the crowd before tip-off, promising them that ""we will play as hard as we can for you guys every night."" ... The locker Wade used for the last several years is now empty, not assigned to any current Heat player. ... Wayne Ellington (right thigh bruise) and Josh Richardson (right knee) were again sidelined. FOR STARTERS Michael Kidd-Gilchrist just recently turned 23, missed most of last season with a shoulder injury and still made the 200th start of his Charlotte career on Friday night. Miami's entire starting five -- Dragic (100), Whiteside (77), Winslow (10), Luke Babbitt (2) and Waiters (2) -- now have a combined 191 starts in Heat colors. RILEY SPEAKS Heat President Pat Riley sat down with team broadcast outlet Fox Sports Sun before the game and raved about the job Spoelstra has done with a new group that was largely assembled after Wade left for Chicago this summer (and before Chris Bosh failed his physical in September to essentially end his time with the team). ""There's a saying that Spo uses a lot, and I like to use it myself now ... when you look at a player, the player doesn't care what you know until he knows how much you care,"" Riley said. ""Spo and his staff cares a lot about these guys and these young players.""","400899456"
"DALLAS --  James Harden walked the ball up the court in the final seconds of the third quarter, then decided he didn't want to set up the offense. The Houston star simply pulled up and hit a long 3-pointer for the first double-digit lead during a late-quarter run that put the Rockets in control for good. Trevor Ariza scored 27 points, Harden had 26 and Houston beat Dallas 106-98 with Dirk Nowitzki missing from the Mavericks' home opener Friday night. Harden went scoreless while playing the entire first quarter, missing all five shots, before getting 10 points in the second and 12 in the third, including the punctuating 3 that followed two others on a 10-2 run to finish the quarter. ""I was in a groove and it was time to close out the quarter,"" Harden said. ""Think that's one of the things that we're preaching is we got to end quarters the right way."" Harrison Barnes, playing his first home game for the Mavericks after signing a max contract in the summer, had a career-high 31 points. Nowitzki didn't play for just the second time in 19 home openers with Dallas. The 38-year-old had a stomach ailment bad enough that coach Rick Carlisle wasn't sure he would make the trip to Houston for the Rockets' home opener Sunday. ""Dirk's not going to be around here forever. And we're going to be sitting him sometimes this year,"" Carlisle said. ""The other guys have got to step up and step forward. And I'm one of them. We've all got to really raise the level of our game when a guy like that's not on the floor."" Two nights after recording a career-high 17 assists in an opening loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, Harden had eight assists and seven rebounds. Ariza was 5 of 7 from 3-point range, including one early in the fourth quarter to push Houston's lead back to nine points. He was fouled on 3-pointers twice and made all six free throws. TIP-INS Rockets: Harden became the second player in NBA history with at least 30 points and 15 assists in an opener when he had 34 points and 17 assists in the 120-114 loss to the Lakers. Tim Hardaway had 32 and 18 for Golden State at Denver in 1990. ... Eric Gordon was the other double-figure scorer for Houston with 18 points. ... Clint Capela had nine rebounds. Mavericks: Dallas has the two highest totals for 3-point attempts in a game in league history after shooting 48 in the 130-121 overtime loss to Indiana in the opener. The Mavericks made 18 (38 percent). Dallas shot a record 49 on March 5, 1996, against New Jersey, also making 18 (37 percent). ... Andrew Bogut, a starter alongside Barnes at Golden State before both joined Dallas after the Warriors landed Kevin Durant in free agency, had a game-high 12 rebounds. ... Deron Williams had 14 points, but just one in the second half. FILLING IN FOR DIRK The only other home opener Nowitzki missed was in 2012 when he sat the first 27 games recovering from knee surgery. Sliding over to power forward, Barnes was strong inside and out, going 13 of 23 from the field with five rebounds. ""I think he has a chance to be a very special player. I've felt that all along,"" Carlisle said. DEFENSIVE TURNAROUND After giving up 51 percent shooting in the loss to the Lakers, the Rockets allowed Dallas to shoot 52 percent in the first quarter while Barnes scored 12 points . But the Mavericks were held to 15 of 40 (38 percent) in the second and third quarters, when Houston outscored them 53-43. ""We can't just rely on offense or James bailing us out like he did a lot last year,"" Ariza said. ""We have to do it collectively on the defensive end."" SHOOTING STRUGGLES Dallas' Wesley Matthews scored 13 points on a second straight bad shooting night. He's 7 of 30 from the field through two games, including 3 of 18 from 3-point range. LONG-RANGE SUCCESS The Rockets were 15 of 32 from 3-point range (47 percent). Ariza, Harden (4 of 9) and Gordon (3 of 6) combined to make 12 of 20 from beyond the arc. ""I think our legs were a little bit better, and we'll get more in shape as we play more games,"" first-year coach Mike D'Antoni said.","400899457"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  George Hill said he wanted to help Utah win more close games. In his second contest since a June trade from the Pacers, the veteran point guard helped the Jazz do just that. Hill scored 23 points, Rudy Gobert had 13 points and 13 rebounds and the Jazz beat the Los Angeles Lakers 96-89 in Utah's home opener Friday night. Hill took over late and scored 10 points in the fourth quarter. ""A lot of guys can talk about it, I'm more big on leading by example,"" Hill said. ""Holding guys accountable. Doing what I can do first and let guys read that. ""That's the thing, the better off we're going to be is every one of these guys being able to hold each other accountable and give each other constructive criticism and don't take it the wrong way. Just knowing that we have one common goal and we all want to win."" The Jazz used a 16-1 run spanning halftime to take an 11-point lead, but the Lakers closed the third quarter on a 22-11 run -- highlighted by Tarik Black's put-backs and Lou Williams' 3 -- to take a 65-64 lead. The Jazz trailed by four midway in the fourth quarter when Hill's 3-pointer sparked an 11-0 run for an 83-76 lead. Utah led the rest of the way. ""I think he's just a good player,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said of Hill. ""He takes pride, is the main thing. He's got a lot of pride in his defense. On the offensive end ... he didn't stop attacking. That's going to be huge for us, especially with Gordon (Hayward) and Alec (Burks) out. We've talked about George being aggressive offensively."" Jazz forward Derrick Favors returned from a knee injury that kept him out for most of the preseason and the season opener. He finished with 15 points, nine rebounds and two blocks. Teammate Rodney Hood added 15. Williams led the Lakers with 17 points. ""We came out of halftime flat and that second unit came out and did a phenomenal job,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""We had a fourth quarter lead. Utah is a tough team at home. They are well coached. We missed some good looks, they shot 40 free throws, which is a little ridiculous to me, but that is kind of what happens when you play in Utah."" TIP-INS Lakers: No. 2 overall pick Brandon Ingram left the game with a sore right knee in the first half and did not return. He said it got sore while running and thinks it may be tendinitis. ""I think it was better to be cautious about it and just come back and try to run on it again. But it just felt like I needed to be done."" ... D'Angelo Russell shot just 3 for 14 and had nine points. Jazz: Hayward went through a workout, including shooting the ball, before the game. He is out indefinitely and missed most of the preseason with a broken finger on his non-shooting hand. ... Gobert had his second double-double in two games and also had four blocks HELLO, OLD FRIEND Snyder was an assistant with the Lakers from 2011-12 when Walton was on the roster. Snyder said he worked a lot with the second unit, which included Walton. ""His feel for the game and just the kind of quiet intelligence,"" Snyder said when asked what he remembered. ""Sometimes you had to ask him what he thought. ... You can always learn a lot from NBA players when you're coaching if you just pay attention and keep your ears open. There's things that they acquire over a period of a career. Luke, clearly, that stuff translates to him coaching right now."" SWAGGY Lakers guard Nick Young has already matched his number of starts from the 2015-16 season. He's started both games season and had just two last year. ""He earned it, honestly,"" Walton said. ""In training camp it wasn't like we had him penciled in. But he continued to work hard defensively, is what first caught our eye. ""When that first unit was struggling to kind of score in those preseason games, we were just thinking of different ways to get more firepower and kind of keep that second unit together that was playing really well. We tried Nick and he did a phenomenal job and kept working hard in practice. It felt right.""","400899458"
"NEW ORLEANS -- As Anthony Davis rose for a shot in the final minute of play, Kevin Durant met the Pelicans' star at his apex and swatted the ball away. Golden State's newly added All-Star then raced the other way for a game-clinching layup, completing a dominant night on both ends of the court. ""I just tried to make a winning play for the team,"" Durant said. Davis ""had it going all night, shooting over double-teams, making all these tough fade-aways. I had no doubt in my mind that if he had gotten it off, he would have made that one, so I just tried to make a play."" Durant finished with 30 points and 17 rebounds, Klay Thompson added 28 points and the Warriors bounced back emphatically from a surprising season-opening loss by beating New Orleans 122-114 on Friday night. ""I just didn't want us to get outrebounded,"" Durant said, adding that coach Steve Kerr ""told me that I could try to lead this team in rebounding and I'm trying to do my best to help out."" Durant's career-high for rebounds in a game is 18, a mark he could surpass with his new team before long. After scoring only six points on five shot attempts in the first half, Stephen Curry asserted himself more with an array of inside and deep shots to finish with 23 points, including a momentum-swinging 8-0 run by himself in the third quarter. Davis, who scored 50 points in New Orleans' season-opening loss, finished with 45 points and 17 rebounds against Golden State, but the Pelicans struggled to trim their deficit below double digits for much of the final quarter. ""We're playing hard, playing with a lot of energy, but we've got to find a way to execute better down the stretch,"" Davis said. Tim Frazier scored a career-high 21 points and added 10 assists for New Orleans. Lance Stephenson and Dante Cunningham each scored 15 points. Golden State, the two-time defending Western Conference champions, dropped their season opener at home in stunning fashion, 129-100 to San Antonio. The Warriors made far easier work of the depleted Pelicans, leading by as many as 16 points and trailing for less than a minute in the second half, and by only one point in the third quarter. The Pelicans trailed by 12 after Draymond Green's 3 early in the third quarter, but chipped away and briefly took the lead at 74-73 when Frazier hit a driving layup that gave him 11 points in the period. The Warriors seized momentum right back, however, when Curry scored the next eight points on a deep 3, a pair of free throws and a driving layup as he was fouled. Curry added another 3 from 30 feet a few possessions later, and wound up with 13 points in the third quarter, which ended with Golden State leading 92-81 after Andre Iguodala's dunk. ""In that certain stretch, we had purposeful play calls that got me in a better position to make some plays,"" Curry said. ""I kind of got a feel and some momentum."" New Orleans got as close as 116-110 on Davis' short basket with about a minute left, and had the ball with a chance to pull closer, but Durant blocked Davis' jumper and raced the other way for a breakaway layup to put it away. MAKING HISTORY Curry hit four 3-pointers to reach 1,600 for his career. He's the 19th player to do so, but none did it faster than Curry, now starting his eighth season. Meanwhile, Davis is the first Pelicans player (dating to the NBA's return to New Orleans as the Hornets in 2002) to score 40 or more in two straight games. ""My body feels great. I'm just in attack mode all the time,"" Davis said. ""I think that's the best way to try to help the team."" TIP-INS Warriors: Durant was called for a technical foul for shoving Stephenson to the floor after the highly animated Stephenson fouled him. ... Durant has scored at least 20 points in 66 consecutive regular season games, the longest such streak since Michael Jordan's 69 straight in 1990-91. ... Patrick McCaw, who hit his only shot from 3-point range, sprained his left ankle in the first half and did not return. ... Green and Zaza Pachulia each grabbed 11 rebounds. Pachulia scored 10 points. Pelicans: New Orleans missed 10 of its first 12 3s and shot only 38.8 percent (19 of 49) overall in the first half, after which they trailed 59-50. ... Sixth overall draft choice Buddy Hield played 17 minutes and once again had a quiet game offensively, hitting 1 of 6 shots for two points. He also let a pass slip through his hands and out of bounds when he was wide open under the basket.","400899459"
"SAN ANTONIO -- Gregg Popovich greeted his latest career milestone with his usual self-deprecation and deflection, insisting he only achieves these records because he is old. Friends and players rarely disagree with the San Antonio Spurs' emotional coach. But, they did this time. Popovich tied the NBA record for the most career wins with a single franchise, earning his 1,127th in the Spurs' 102-86 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night. Popovich matched Jerry Sloan of Utah for the league mark, but did so while saying he's not the equal of the coach who resigned in 2011 after 23 seasons with the Jazz. ""He's in a different league than me,"" Popovich said. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said that's nonsense. He spent 11 seasons with San Antonio before joining the 76ers and is one of Popovich's closest friends. ""In 2017, where professional sports are so ruthless and cutthroat, survival rates and people that can last are rare,"" Brown said. ""He would say, 'Well, that must mean I'm old.' I think it means he's good, really good."" Popovich's abilities are evident this season. San Antonio has seven new players on its roster and lost franchise stalwart Tim Duncan to retirement in the offseason. Despite the turnover, the Spurs maintained the league's second-best record at 38-11 with their 12th straight victory at home over Philadelphia and 11th straight overall against the 76ers. ""It's amazing,"" Spurs veteran Tony Parker said. ""To have Pop up there, he's going to keep going. It looks like he's not getting tired, he's not going to stop anytime. It's very impressive to coach that long and keeping your team motivated with the same message, it's not easy."" San Antonio had 15 steals and forced 23 turnovers, both season-highs, as both teams played shorthanded. The frontcourts for both teams were depleted, with San Antonio missing LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol, and Philadelphia without Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel and Robert Covington. Aldridge and Embiid were both late scratches with minor knee ailments. Kawhi Leonard scored 19 points and Dewayne Dedmon had 13 points and 10 rebounds for his second double-double for the Spurs. ""I think Dewayne Dedmon was the star of the show tonight,"" Popovich said. ""Everything he did was great."" The 76ers' frontcourt got 25 points and 10 rebounds from Ersan Ilyasova, and Dario Saric added 14 points. Philadelphia was held to 33 points in the second half, and San Antonio outscored the 76ers 31-20 in the third quarter after losing an eight-point lead in the second. The Sixers only made 10 shots in the second half. ""I think defense was the key in the second half,"" said rookie Davis Bertans, who finished with 12 points. ""If you can keep teams to 33 points a half, I think you'll win all the games."" Ilyasova had seven points during a 14-2 run beginning midway through the second quarter that gave the Sixers their first lead at 44-40. TIP-INS 76ers: Noel missed the game with an upper respiratory infection ... Covington sat out with a bruised right hand. ... Philadelphia has not won in San Antonio since Jan. 3, 2004 -- 83-77. ... The 76ers were also without assistant coach Jim O'Brien. The 64-year-old coach is battling the flu, but will be with the team Saturday in Miami. ... Philadelphia players have missed 167 games due to injury, illness or rest. Spurs: Aldridge sat out with a sore right knee. He has missed three games this season, including two for rest. ... Parker is 61st in career minutes at 35,541, passing the 35,516 of Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas. ... Gasol missed his eighth straight game since breaking his fourth metacarpal on Jan. 19. Popovich said Gasol should be back after the All-Star break and could return to play a game or two before the break. San Antonio has missed 53 total games this season due to injury or rest. UNCERTAIN ON EMBIID Brown was unsure if Embiid will be available for the team's next two games. Embiid remained at home to rest a bruised left knee. He will have his knee looked at Friday and a decision will be made at that time about his availability for Saturday's game in Miami. ""It's still up in the air,"" Brown said. ""I think it's going to be a challenge. I feel we will know categorically in the next few days. I think Joel will be a real great addition if we see him in Miami, but it's not something I am completely planning on at all."" LEARNING ON THE JOB Brown charged Saric with guarding Leonard, the Spurs' leading scorer. Leonard finished with 19 points, his lowest total in 10 games. The 6-foot-7 forward was 8-for-17 from the field and 3-for-5 on free throws. Brown was asked if he gave Saric, a rookie, any advice before the game. ""I remind [Saric] who he is,"" Brown said. ""That he, too, has a lot to offer -- his resume, his pedigree. His resume doesn't translate as much in the United States and NBA basketball, but it means something in Europe. I try to remind him that he has something to offer.""","400899470"
"CLEVELAND -- The playoffs are nearing. The Cavaliers are already feeling the pressure. LeBron James made a big 3-pointer in the final minute of the second overtime and scored 41 points to offset 43 by Indiana's Paul George, and Cleveland opened its April schedule with an emotional 135-130 win Sunday over the Pacers, who remain on the outside of the postseason in the Eastern Conference. James added 15 rebounds and 11 assists in 52 exhausting minutes -- his most in more than four years -- for the defending NBA champions, whose win was overshadowed by an angry exchange between James and teammate Tristan Thompson during a timeout late in the second OT. James accepted blame for the argument and said he apologized to Thompson. ""I had good intentions but I was a little bit too demonstrative at that point in the game,"" he said. ""I can't show up my teammates. Double T worked hard, he's a big-time player for our team. I had good intentions of what I wanted to happen, but the way it came out, it didn't look good on TV."" Thompson was reluctant to discuss the incident. ""We're family,"" Thompson said. ""Little miscommunication in the huddle. Move forward. We're family. Got each other's back always. Move forward."" Pressed for more details, Thompson got defensive. ""Not going to get into it,"" he snapped. ""Like I said, just miscommunication. Move forward. It is what it is. Got the win, on to Orlando."" Kyrie Irving made four free throws in the final 16.5 seconds and Kevin Love had 20 points and 12 rebounds as Cleveland stayed within a half-game of Boston for the East's top spot. The Cavs visit the Celtics on Wednesday. George was magnificent in defeat, scoring 19 straight points in the overtimes and adding nine rebounds and nine assists. But he couldn't prevent the Pacers from their eighth straight road loss. ""If we play like that to finish the season off I'll be happy with where we land,"" George said. ""If we can give this effort, we'll make the playoffs."" C.J. Miles added a season-high 27 points for Indiana, tied with Miami for the No. 8 spot with five games left. However, the Heat have the tiebreaker. After going 7-10 in March, the Cavs began their postseason push with a solid win. But they still had lapses in focus and execution, and Thompson was screaming mad after a blown defensive assignment allowed George to hit a 3 that pulled the Pacers within 128-127 with 49 seconds left. Love followed with a 3-pointer, and after Indiana called timeout, a heated Thompson stormed to the bench and shouted at James. Thompson walked away and sat on the scorer's table by himself. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue came over, grabbed his arm and tried to get his players to make up. ""That's part of the game,"" Lue said. ""You like to see that passion, and a lot of times take it out on the other team. They were both mad and frustrated, but that's what you want to see. We wanted to win that game and it was a big play. Some miscommunication right there, but they got over it."" TIP-INS Pacers: Lance Stephenson scored four points and committed five fouls in 18 minutes of his first game since returning to Indiana. ""He came in and gave us some spark,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""I like his toughness he brings to the floor. Our guys responded to that."" Cavaliers: G Kyle Korver missed his fourth straight game with a sore left foot. ... James has 11 triple-doubles this season, 53 in his career. .... James is on pace to become the first player to average 25 points, 8 rebounds, 8 assists and shot 54 percent from the floor. ... F Richard Jefferson returned after missing two games with left knee tendinitis and played 11 minutes. DOUBLE DIGITS James drove the lane in the second quarter and dunked over George and Myles Turner, giving him 11 points and extending his streak of scoring at least 10 to 787 games and tying him with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the second-longest streak in league history. Michael Jordan scored in double digits 866 straight times. LEBRON VS. LANCE James didn't only have words with Thompson. He also got into it with long-time nemesis Stephenson, who re-signed with his former team last week. The two have battled before, with Stephenson infamously blowing into James' ear during the 2014 Eastern Conference finals. ""I'm happy for Lance, man,"" James said. ""He's had a rough year with injuries and things of that nature. It was good. I needed that.""","400899471"
"LOS ANGELES -- The Warriors weren't messing around, not even against a team they've dominated for a while now. Stephen Curry scored 29 points despite making just three 3-pointers, Kevin Durant added 26 points and 10 assists, and Golden State defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 133-120 on Thursday night for their fifth straight victory. The Clippers gave up three dunks and had four turnovers to start the game. Curry forced two steals, feeding Durant and JaVale McGee for consecutive dunks that stunned the Clippers. ""We came out with intent, got two quick steals, pushed the transition, and set the tone that we were going to be physical on the defensive end,"" Curry said. Blake Griffin had 31 points, making 11 of 13 free throws, for the Clippers. They have lost nine in a row to their Bay Area opponents, the franchise's longest active skid against a single team. ""Trying to make plays is a never-ending struggle,"" Griffin said. ""You just figure out the situation and sometimes it is just not your night. Open shots killed us."" The rematch wasn't the debacle that occurred last weekend when the Clippers lost by 46 points at Golden State. But they still never led and trailed by 21. The Clippers got beat in every category despite Griffin's hard-charging effort. The Warriors were dominant in the paint, on second-chance points and fast break points. ""Everybody came out with a great mindset in helping each other on the glass, knowing we were kind of thin on the front line,"" Durant said. ""Our bench was great, our guards, everybody came in on rebounding."" Golden State has won 11 of its last 12. The Clippers got within seven on a 3-pointer by Jamal Crawford with 1:55 remaining in the game. But Durant answered with a 3-pointer and Klay Thompson added another. The Clippers' defense was no match for Curry. He slipped through the lane for a fastbreak layup with Raymond Felton dogging him on the left and DeAndre Jordan on the right. Curry fell down scoring, drawing the foul and completing the three-point play that kept the Warriors ahead by 15 in the third quarter. ""They performed at a much higher level than us, it wasn't even close,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""They're a better team until we prove differently."" The Warriors toyed with the Clippers, who got within four points in the first quarter and then five in the second quarter, only to have Golden State immediately push the lead back to double digits. ""I thought we took the fight to them right away,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr. ""We forced turnovers on the first three possessions of the game. That really set a good tone for us."" Golden State barreled around the court, knocking down former Warrior Marreese Speights and J.J. Redick in one fell swoop after Durant pushed Austin Rivers on another possession. It was all part of a rollicking first half when the Warriors bobbed, weaved and whipped circus-like passes around before scoring. ""We got to be more organized when we play them,"" Redick said. ""They don't run a lot of set plays. It's just a lot of movement. It's sort of to distract you with what's going on with the ball."" Los Angeles outshot Golden State in the first quarter when the Warriors took nearly twice as many shots as the Clippers. MAKING HISTORY Curry hit his 200th 3-pointer of the season with 2 1/2 minutes left in the second quarter, making him the first player in NBA history to have 200 or more 3-pointers in five consecutive seasons. He missed his first four 3-pointers in the game. Curry came into the game 4 of 28 from 3-point range in three previous games at Staples Center this season. ""He has 200 already? That's crazy,"" Durant said. ""It's very difficult to do that, especially when everybody expects you to shoot the 3. His skill allows him to play that way."" HIGHLIGHT REEL Griffin's windmill dunk over Warriors forward Kevon Looney drew oohs from the crowd and merited multiple replays on the video board. He took one large step through the lane and pushed his left hand off the head of a ducking Looney as Griffin elevated before slamming the ball down with his right hand. TIP-INS Warriors: Curry had 11 assists. ... McGee and James Michael McAdoo each finished 5 of 6 from the field. They were among seven Warriors in double figures. ... Curry got a technical for smacking the ball out of bounds in the second quarter. ... They have reached 100 points in each of the last 26 games. ... They were missing starting forward Draymond Green, who has a left shoulder contusion. Clippers: Griffin passed Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo to move into second on the franchise scoring list. ... Los Angeles is 2-5 in its last seven without injured Chris Paul. ... Jordan will participate in the slam dunk competition on Feb. 18 during All-Star weekend in New Orleans against Orlando's Aaron Gordon, Phoenix's Derrick Jones Jr. and Indiana's Glenn Robinson III.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs have the league's second-best record and can decide if they want to prepare for the postseason by resting or not resting players. They did a little of both against Utah. Kawhi Leonard had 25 points and seven assists, and the Spurs held off the Jazz 109-103 on Sunday in a matchup of postseason-bound teams. San Antonio (59-17) had six players sit for rest and injury. ""You've got to do whatever is best for you and your team to be ready for the playoffs,"" Spurs veteran Pau Gasol said. ""To be at your best at that point, whether it's playing more or playing less. That's up to the coaching staff to make that assessment. That's kind of our mindset, prepare for the bigger dance."" The Spurs got their 30th home win despite resting Manu Ginobili, David Lee and Patty Mills, and missing injured starters LaMarcus Aldridge and Danny Green. Aldridge has a sprained left thumb and Green sat out with a bruised left quadriceps. In the midst of five games in seven nights to close the season, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich opted to sit almost half his roster. ""That's a lot of games, a lot of activity for the end of the season,"" Popovich said. ""Then we have to end it by going all the way to Portland, so I think we need to manage it wisely."" The Jazz do not have that luxury. Utah (47-30) leads the Los Angeles Clippers (47-31) by a half-game for the Western Conference's No. 4 seed and home-court advantage in the opening round. The Jazz closed to 102-98 on Joe Johnson's 16-footer with 2:06 remaining that capped a 10-0 run. Leonard then blocked a shot by 7-foot-1 center Rudy Gobert to help San Antonio preserve the victory. Gobert had 19 points, 14 rebounds and six blocked shots. Boris Diaw scored 19 points, making all nine of his shots against his former team. Leonard had 19 points in the third quarter as the Spurs rebuilt a 15-point lead they lost in the first half. ""He got hot,"" Diaw said. ""That's the things he's been doing all season. He's a tough player when he's playing that way. He scored a lot of points in a row, (hit some) tough 3s. We were not able to stop him at that point."" The Spurs took a 17-point lead following a 20-4 run bridging the first and second quarters. The Jazz rallied behind six points, five blocks and four rebounds from Gobert in the second quarter. Tony Parker had 21 points. Five of the team's nine-player rotation scored in double figures. ""Tony's getting his mojo back, I think,"" Popovich said. ""The last couple of games, he's starting to get confidence shooting his shot. It looks like he's getting his speed back, so that was good to see."" TIP-INS Jazz: PG George Hill missed his third straight game with a strained right groin. ... Diaw missed the first two games against his former team with a bruised right leg. The 6-8 forward from France played in 331 games in 4-plus seasons with San Antonio after being released by Charlotte. Diaw averaged 7.4 points and 3.8 rebounds. ... Starting PF Derrick Favors has not played since March 6, missing 13 straight games with a bruised left knee bone. Coach Quin Snyder is not sure when Favors will return, but is hopeful it will be prior to the postseason. Spurs: Parker became the fourth player in league history with 500 points and 250 assists in 16 seasons, joining John Stockton, Gary Payton and Jason Kidd. ... San Antonio has the league's best record since the All-Star break at 16-4. Portland and Golden State are both 15-5 over that span. HISTORIC SHOOTING Gasol is on the verge of becoming the most accurate 3-point shooter in a single season by a 7-footer. Gasol is shooting 53.7 percent on 3-pointers, making 50 for 93 in his first season with the Spurs. Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki has the league's single-season record for shooting 3s by a 7-footer at 41.6 percent in 2007. NO MORE HOMECOOKING Diaw enjoyed a fine meal in his return to San Antonio, where he played from 2012-16 before being traded to Utah in the offseason. He visited with Parker, his longtime friend and teammate with France's national squad, on Saturday night after Utah arrived. Diaw responded by shooting 9 for 9 in 19 minutes. ""That was messed up,"" Parker said. ""I took part of the blame because I gave him good wine last night and we had a good dinner.""","400899473"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry sported the perfect postgame cap. ""I CAN DO ALL THINGS."" Pretty much. Curry hit nine 3-pointers and scored 42 points, also dished out eight assists, and the Golden State Warriors moved closer to locking up the Western Conference's top playoff seed by beating the Washington Wizards 139-115 on Sunday night. ""What I expect to do every night even if it doesn't happen, it's the same confidence I have going into every game,"" Curry said. Draymond Green had his 19th career triple-double and fifth this season with 11 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds. Curry scored 10 points over the final 1:52 of the first half and shot 15 for 22, including 9 of 14 on 3s, in the Warriors' 11th straight victory. It was his 26th career 40-point game and fourth this season. ""He's an arrogant basketball player, which is what you need to be a superstar,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""He goes out there and he's looking to light it up every night."" John Wall had 15 points and 11 assists for the Wizards, who couldn't make it two wins over the mighty Warriors in just more than a month's time. He set the single-season franchise assists record with No. 802 in the third quarter, topping Rod Strickland in 1997-98. Warriors star Kevin Durant went down with a left knee injury in a 112-108 loss at Washington on Feb. 28 and is still working back. Golden State still hopes to get him back before the regular season concludes next week. Klay Thompson scored 23 and Shaun Livingston came off the bench to add a season-high 17 points and grab seven boards, hitting his first five field-goal tries. ""It's been a great run. We always wanted to finish the season on a very high note and take some momentum into the playoffs,"" Thompson said. ""We're on that path."" Bradley Beal and Bojan Bogdanovic scored 20 points apiece for Washington, which hit 10 3s of its own. Golden State's defense has been the driving force behind this recent unbeaten run, with the Warriors holding opponents to 34 percent during the winning streak. Shooting just 28.6 percent -- 8 for 28 -- from 3-point range in that road loss at Washington, Golden State was 16 for 36 from long range Sunday and began with consecutive 3s by Thompson and Curry. Washington's Markieff Morris tested his sprained right ankle before the game and was good to go. He scored 13 points. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington last swept the season series 2-0 in 2009-10. ... The Wizards have lost three in a row on Golden State's home floor and this was their third straight road defeat overall. Warriors: Curry notched his 18th 30-point game and second in four. ... Green had 10 or more assists for the 19th time this season, matching his most games doing so, accomplished last season. ... The Warriors' winning streak is one off their season best of 12 from Nov. 7-28. ... Golden State is 25-5 vs. the Eastern Conference. WILD ENDING Kerr apologized to Wizards coach Scott Brooks after JaVale McGee took a 3 as time was running down. Brandon Jennings took issue given the lead, pushed him and received a Flagrant 1. ""It was kind of strange,"" Kerr said. ""JaVale should not have taken the 3. When we have a lead like that you shouldn't be shooting a 3-pointer."" WALL FINED Wall was fined $15,000 before the game for what the league called ""public criticism of the officiating."" ""I don't care what the league does,"" he said postgame. He ripped the referees to the media after a 95-88 loss at Utah on Friday night, frustrated with the free throw discrepancy. The Jazz shot 31 times from the line to 16 for the Wizards. He said, ""The way they've been officiating today doesn't make no sense."" ""I knew that he would be fined. He said what he said, it's now time to just move on, focus on basketball, and he will,"" Brooks said. ""And that's what we have to do. We have to control what we can control, and that's playing ball on the court.""","400899474"
"PHOENIX -- Patrick Beverley knew much more would be expected of him with his Houston Rockets missing James Harden on Sunday night. That motivated the veteran guard to play well, which Beverley did in the Rockets' 123-116 win over the Phoenix Suns. Beverley scored a career-high 26 points and the Rockets sent the Suns to their 12th straight loss without Harden in the lineup. Harden was ruled out with acute viral syndrome, the team announced before the game. He had not missed a game all season and entered Sunday tied for second in the league in scoring at 29.2 points per game. ""Coach walked up to me (and said), `We need a triple-double out of you tonight,"" Beverley said of the conversation with Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni, who told him Harden was out. ""I know I'm not even close to what James Harden is, but I just try to go out and try to lead these guys by example."" Beverley, who added nine assists and eight rebounds, played despite a sore right ankle and scored 11 of his points in the third quarter. Lou Williams scored 16 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter, and Troy Williams, called up from the D-League early Sunday, scored 18 of his career-high 21 points in the first half. Troy Williams, who last appeared in an NBA game on Dec. 16 with Memphis, shot 5 of 7 from 3-point range in the first 20 minutes. ""He really played,"" D'Antoni said. ""He's rangy and long. He made the most of it, that's for sure."" The Rockets became the first NBA team to make at least 1,100 3s in a season. They surpassed that mark with 14 on Sunday. Tyler Ulis finished with a career-high 34 points for the Suns, who were swept in a season series by the Rockets for the first time in franchise history. At 22-56, Phoenix has the West's worst record by a half-game below the Los Angeles Lakers. Ulis, a rookie, added nine rebounds and nine assists, and Devin Booker scored 27 for the Suns. Houston fended off the Suns' comeback attempts in the fourth quarter and pulled away, snapping a three-game losing streak. ""We can start back on a winning streak,"" Beverley said. ""This was a must-win game, we're trying to solidify third (place in the Western Conference.) We wanted to come out here and set the tone and I think that we did that from the beginning."" Back-to-back 3-pointers by Jared Dudley preceded a driving layup by Ulis to tie the score at 47 with 4:59 left in the second quarter, and Ulis hit a free throw after being fouled on the play to give the Suns a lead. Phoenix trailed by as many as 15 in the first quarter and 10 after 12 minutes. The Suns went on a 13-2 run that ended with Ulis' three-point play. ""I'm just trying to pick my spots,"" Ulis said. ""I usually look to pass coming off screens and things like that, and I'm learning to ... pick my battles, when to shoot, when to pass."" The Rockets scored the last seven points of the first half to take a 59-54 halftime lead on baskets by Nene, Beverley and Williams. TIP-INS Rockets: F Ryan Anderson did not play due to a sprained right ankle. ... F Trevor Ariza missed the game for personal family reasons. ... Another D-League call-up, G Isaiah Taylor, made his NBA debut coming off the bench for the Rockets. Suns: Booker was issued a technical foul after arguing an offensive foul call against him late in the third quarter. ... F T.J. Warren did not play due to illness. ... Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers attended the game, sitting along the baseline. DEKKER BREAKS HAND Rockets forward Sam Dekker left in the fourth quarter when he broke his left hand in a collision with Booker. Dekker had a cast over the hand after the game and will see a specialist in Houston on Monday. He said he hopes to return in three or four weeks and contribute in the playoffs. BENDER'S BACK Suns forward Dragan Bender played in his first game since surgery to remove a bone spur from his right ankle on Feb. 8. The rookie had not appeared in a game since Feb. 1. ""He's part of our core, our young core,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said before the game, adding that he hoped for 10 to 15 minutes out of the 19-year-old. Bender played 14.","400899475"
"Dwight Howard pushes off Joel Embiid and catches the lob pass from Dennis Schröder for the alley-oop dunk. (0:15) PHILADELPHIA -- Even with Dwight Howard having an off game, Atlanta won easily. And coach Mike Budenholzer said that's a good sign for the Hawks. Paul Millsap scored 17 points to lead five Hawks in double figures and Atlanta toppled the Philadelphia 76ers 104-72 on Saturday. Kyle Korver added 15 points and Mike Muscala added 14 for Atlanta. The Hawks barely needed top offseason acquisition Howard. The big man had just two points and seven rebounds in his second game for his hometown team after signing a three-year, $70 million free-agent contract this summer. The 31-year-old center had 19 rebounds and 11 points in Atlanta's season-opening 114-99 win over Washington on Thursday. ""The great thing about adding Dwight to our group and something that Dwight is embracing and cherishing is that we play as a team,"" Budenholzer said. ""Everybody steps up, everybody contributes. Dwight is going to have great, big nights. A day like today was maybe not his day. Muscala, Paul and Kris (Humphries) were great. It's much more a positive than anything."" Dennis Schroder displayed the playmaking ability the Hawks are counting on with him taking over for Jeff Teague as the team's point guard. After getting two assists in the opener, Schroder had 11 to go with 11 points against Philadelphia. Joel Embiid and Sergio Rodriguez had 14 points apiece for the 76ers. The Hawks' reserves (51 points) had nearly as many points (53) as the starters. ""It says a lot,"" Millsap said. ""Our bench is great. Our bench did a great job of coming in and sparking a nice, little run for us. This game, last game, they did a great job of doing that."" Millsap scored four points during Atlanta's 8-2 run to open the fourth quarter, capped by Muscala's 17-foot jumper for an 82-60 lead. After sitting out for two years because of a foot injury, Embiid dazzled the home crowd with 20 points and seven rebounds in 22 minutes in Wednesday's season-opening loss to Oklahoma City. The third overall pick in the 2014 draft, Embiid had trouble staying on the court in the opening half against Orlando. Moments after chants of ""Trust the process! Trust the process!"" serenaded Embiid on the free-throw line, the crowd erupted in the second quarter when Embiid blocked Howard's shot attempt. Embiid had to go to the bench seconds later after picking up his third foul. The Hawks took advantage, outscoring Philadelphia 17-10 from that point to enter the intermission up 53-39. Philadelphia could get only within 10 points in the third quarter on Jerami Grant's highlight-reel reverse dunk. But the Hawks scored eight of the final 10 points of the period to enter the fourth quarter ahead 74-58. NATIONAL ANTHEM A day after apologizing for prohibiting R&amp;B singer Sevyn Streeter from performing the national anthem at Wednesday's opener because Streeter was wearing a ""We Matter"" T-shirt, the song went off without any incidents or protests prior to Saturday's game. Mike Moore, a member of the team's ""Flight Squad,"" performed the national anthem with no signs that anything was amiss. NO CHEESESTEAKS DeAndre Bembry had two points for Atlanta. The rookie is a product of nearby Saint Joseph's. He received cheers when he entered with just under six minutes left. Bembry said he had ""a bunch of people"" in attendance from St. Joe's. One thing he didn't have while back in Philadelphia, though, was a cheesesteak due to the recent removal of a wisdom tooth. MORE MINUTES Embiid, on a minutes restriction because of his foot injury, played 15 minutes. ""With the minutes he played, he clearly helped us,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We're looking forward to him playing more minutes."" TIP-INS Hawks: Millsap, a three-time All-Star, is averaging a team-best 22.5 points per game through two games. ... Atlanta nearly doubled Philadelphia in assists, with 31 to the 76ers' 16. 76ers: Philadelphia, which started 0-18 on the way to a 10-72 mark last season, looks for its first win with its third straight home game to start the season, Tuesday against the Magic. Five of the 76ers' first six games are at home. Philadelphia is playing without three starters because of injury: Jerryd Bayless (wrist), Nerlens Noel (knee) and 2016 No. 1 pick Ben Simmons (foot).","400899476"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Avery Bradley said his goal coming into the season was to expand his game. So far, so good. Bradley had 31 points on a career-high eight 3-pointers and grabbed 11 rebounds, and the Boston Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets 104-98 Saturday night. Bradley was 8 of 11 from beyond the arc as the Celtics shot 75 percent from the field in the fourth quarter to pull away. Bradley is averaging 21.3 points and nearly nine rebounds through three games this season. ""That's my mindset this year -- I'm trying to rebound, pass the ball and make plays for others,"" Bradley said. ""I work on my game every single summer and know I'm trying to put it in the game."" Isaiah Thomas had 24 points and seven assists and Al Horford added 14 points for the Celtics, who trailed by one entering the fourth quarter. Boston finished 15 of 31 from 3-point range, while the Hornets were just 9 of 32. Coach Brad Stevens left Bradley in the game with the second team to start the fourth quarter and the strategy paid off. Bradley was 5 of 7 from the field in the final 12 minutes and made all three 3-point attempts. ""We've been starting or playing early in those quarters -- the second or fourth -- either Isaiah or Avery to try to keep one of our guards in with the second unit,"" Stevens said. ""I did think he was gassed at about the seven-minute mark. That's why we took him back out for a couple of minutes."" Hornets coach Steve Cliffford said Bradley was terrific. ""Especially in the stretch where they got a little bit of cushion (in the fourth quarter) which ended up being the difference in the game,"" Clifford said. ""They're a good team and they played well. You can see why people are saying they'll be top two or three in the East."" Walker led the Hornets in their home opener with 29 points, while Frank Kaminsky had 11 points and four rebounds in his first regular season action. The Hornets spent most of the game trying to claw even with the Celtics after falling behind early. They finally took the lead on a 7-foot jumper by Nicolas Batum on the final possession of the third quarter. But the lead was short-lived as Bradley started to heat up in the fourth quarter and the Celtics built a 93-79 lead. TIP-INS: Celtics: G Marcus Smart is making progress from his left ankle sprain, but Stevens said he's not sure if Smart will play Wednesday vs. Chicago. ""I anticipate that he'll at least go through some of Monday's practice, but I don't know if he'll be live,"" Stevens said. ... Amir Johnson received a flagrant 1 foul when he elbowed Cody Zeller in the head on a post-up move. Hornets: Owner Michael Jordan took in the team's home opener from the end of the bench. ... C Roy Hibbert, who has had a strong start to the season, missed the game with soreness in his right knee. ... G Jeremy Lamb left the game in the second quarter with a strained left hamstring and did not return. ... The Hornets took 22 free throws in the first half; Boston just two. TOO MANY TURNOVERS: Stevens wasn't real happy with his team's 13 turnovers that led to 13 points for the Hornets. ""They're one of the best teams in the NBA at packing the paint,"" Stevens said. ""We tried to thread the needle a little bit too much."" POOR DEFENSE: Clifford didn't like his team's effort on defense, particularly in the second half where they allowed 60 points. ""When you play defense, there's a way you do it. You have the right stance, you have the right talk, you have the right organization,"" Clifford said. ""That gives you a chance. When guys start making their own stuff up, you've got no shot against a good team. And that's what happened tonight.""","400899477"
"NEW YORK --  Joakim Noah pulled a hood over his head, covering a large bandage that hid an injury to his left ear. No matter how bad his ear was, he definitely heard the fans chanting his name Saturday night. ""Game 1 at the Garden, stitched up, wouldn't have it any other way,"" Noah said. Noah and fellow newcomers Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee all had impressive moments in their first home games at Madison Square Garden, and the New York Knicks used a fast start and strong finish to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 111-104. Kristaps Porzingis scored 21 points and Carmelo Anthony had 20, including the three-point play that sparked the decisive spurt. Rose had a couple of crossovers and quick bursts into the lane that showed his legs looked healthy and scored 13 points. Noah finished with six points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, and Lee scored 16 points as the Knicks got their first win under coach Jeff Hornacek after falling apart in the second half and getting routed 117-88 by Cleveland in the NBA season opener. ""I mean, we were a completely different team tonight,"" Anthony said. It was particularly meaningful for Noah, who grew up in New York and had himself announced during the starting lineups as from Hell's Kitchen, a neighborhood on the west side of midtown Manhattan. Fans chanted ""Joakim Noah!"" for the center, who the Knicks said had a laceration and contusion that required tissue glue. Marc Gasol scored 20 points for the Grizzlies, who climbed out of a 20-3 hole to beat Minnesota at home in their opener and nearly erased an 18-point deficit in this one. ""We've just got to get off to a faster start. We can't get down,"" forward Zach Randolph said. ""You know, we fought back. We were there, just got to keep working."" But the Knicks finally put them away with a 12-0 spurt after the Grizzlies had cut it to 87-85. Anthony's three-point play with 7:34 began the run and the Rose capped it off with a basket that made it 99-85 with 5:26 remaining. ""I'm so happy I got the first (home) game out of the way,"" Rose said. ""The crowd was in it from the jump. We came out and really surprised them (Memphis)."" The Knicks made 11 of their first 15 shots and even after cooling off a bit led 32-19 after one quarter. They pushed it to 43-25 early in the second but the Grizzlies chipped away before the half, cutting it to 57-49. Again the Knicks looked in control in the third, pushing the lead back up to 16, but it was down to five by the time the teams headed to the fourth. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Randolph passed Rudy Gay (479) for third in Grizzlies history in games played. Mike Conley leads the list and Gasol is second. ... The only other time the Grizzlies even won their opener in Memphis was 2014-15, when they started 6-0. ... Tony Allen (right knee) missed his second straight game.

CELEBRATING 70 The Knicks are celebrating their 70th anniversary season and welcomed back a number of former players or their family members. Hall of Famers and NBA champions Willis Reed, Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe were among the players taking part in the ceremony. WELCOME BACK, ZACH There was a picture outside the Grizzlies' locker room of Randolph -- in his Knicks uniform.

"CLEVELAND --  LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers got a late scare, but their winning streak over the Orlando Magic remained intact. James scored 23 points, Kyrie Irving added 20 and Cleveland beat Orlando for the 15th straight time, 105-99 on Saturday night. Cleveland built a 22-point lead late in the third quarter, but the Magic steadily got back in the game and trailed 88-85 with 4 minutes to play. J.R. Smith took over, hitting three 3-pointers and scoring 11 points in the quarter as the NBA champion Cavaliers improved to 3-0. They haven't lost to the Magic since Nov. 23, 2012, in Orlando. Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue was unhappy the Cavaliers didn't put the game away earlier against an 0-3 team. ""I thought we let our guard down because of their record, and not playing them as a good team,"" he said. ""They're struggling right now but they have a good team and we didn't respect that."" Smith, who missed most of training camp in a contract dispute, made 3-pointers on consecutive possessions and Cleveland forced a shot-clock violation. James followed with two baskets, including a left-handed finish at the rim. Serge Ibaka converted a three-point play and hit a free throw, cutting the lead to 98-95 with 45 seconds left, but Smith's 3-pointer from the corner pushed the lead to six. ""J.R. was able to knock a few down in the fourth quarter when we needed it the most,"" James said. ""We leave J.R. Smith open, and he's the only person you can't leave open out there,"" Orlando center Bismack Biyombo said. Smith scored 16 points and Kevin Love had 19 for the Cavaliers. Evan Fournier scored 22 points while Ibaka added 19 for Orlando. James put together a personal highlight reel in the first half. He converted a four-point play in the second quarter, hitting a 3-pointer while being fouled in front of Cleveland's bench with the shot clock winding down then made the free throw. James drove past Fournier and dunked over Nikola Vucevic despite getting hit in the face in the first quarter. He also motored down the lane for a dunk at the first-half buzzer. TIP-INS Magic: G Jodie Meeks (fractured right foot) has not played in a preseason or regular-season game. He was acquired in a June 29 trade with Detroit. Cavaliers: Rookie G Kay Felder made his NBA debut and scored his first points on a drive to the basket. ... C Channing Frye is away from the team because of the death of his mother. He also missed Friday's game in Toronto. ADVANCE ANALYSIS Magic coach Frank Vogel saw plenty of the Cavaliers while he was on the Pacers' bench. ""They've grown into what everyone thought they would be when they were put together,"" he said. ""Obviously, they won the championship, and now Cleveland looks like a finished product."" BACKUP PLAN Lue has been using Iman Shumpert at backup point guard, but doesn't want to overload the veteran. ""It's a hard position to play,"" Lue said. ""I know he can guard point guards defensively. As far trying to get him to learn the whole playbook, that's not fair. That's not going to happen. He's going to make some mistakes. We just have to live with it for right now."" BASEBALL FEVER Highlights of Game 4 of the World Series between the Indians and Cubs were shown on the arena scoreboard. The crowd cheered on several occasions as the Indians built the lead to go ahead 3-1 in the series. ""I looked too,"" Lue said. ""I'm guilty of that."" Several thousand fans attended a watch party across the street at Progressive Field.","400899479"
"CHICAGO --  With nine new players, including three starters, the Chicago Bulls seemed likely to struggle with cohesion early in the season. However, one of those newcomers -- Rajon Rondo -- has been credited by his teammates with fueling Chicago's fast start. Doug McDermott had 23 points, Jimmy Butler added 16 on 6-of-9 shooting and Rondo had 13 assists to lead the Bulls to a 118-101 rout of the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night, Chicago's second straight victory to open the season. McDermott scored 11 points in the fourth quarter as coach Fred Hoiberg gave his veteran starters -- Butler, Rondo and Dwyane Wade, who had 14 points -- the rest of the night off after the third quarter. Rondo, who has 22 assists in the two games, likely could have racked up a much higher number if he wasn't limited to 25 minutes. ""He pushes the ball up the floor and he gets it out, so he makes you run to get in front of him,"" Wade said. Playing with Rondo means you have to be alert at all times. ""I always tell those guys to understand that, `If you don't think I see you, I probably see you, so be ready for the pass,"" Rondo said. ""Who doesn't want the ball? Everybody wants the ball and everybody wants to score."" Taj Gibson had 12 points and eight rebounds, and Robin Lopez added 12 points for the Bulls. Paul George and Myles Turner had 20 points apiece to lead the Pacers (1-2), who were coming off a loss at Brooklyn on Friday. ""The message is loud and clear: we need to get to work,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""We have a talented team,"" George said, ""but it's going to take us a couple games to get our chemistry. We'll get through our battle wounds early."" The Bulls had a 24-20 lead at the end of the first quarter before breaking things open with a dominant second. They scored 38 points on 14-for-18 (77.8 percent) shooting in the quarter to race out to a 62-41 halftime lead. Indiana seemingly sleep-walked on defense throughout much of the second quarter -- especially in transition where the Bulls had a 19-0 edge in fast-break points. McDermott had seven points in seven minutes, and five players scored at least five points. Rondo added six assists. Chicago maintained its intensity in the third quarter and stretched the lead to 92-67 entering the fourth. The Bulls lead by as many as 29 points in the final quarter (102-73) before Indiana made a futile run in garbage time to trim the deficit to 112-101 with two minutes to play. TIP-INS Pacers: Aaron Brooks (sore right knee) and Rodney Stuckey (right hamstring) sat out with injuries. Stuckey is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday. Bulls: Wade said he's feeling fine but sat out Friday's practice after playing 32 minutes in the opener on Thursday. The 13-year veteran said he will take regular days off to stay healthy and fresh. ""Certain days (are) better to be mental days than physical days,"" he said. BENCH WOES Through three games, the Pacers have been outscored by a total of 33 points in the second quarter. That's mainly an indictment of the reserves. ""Our bench's got to get some chemistry."" McMillan said. ""We need to get that (second) team some time on the floor, and they just haven't had it."" CUBS FEVER With the Bulls idle Friday night, Wade attended Game 3 of the World Series at Wrigley Field. ""I noticed that everybody in my family that was at the game, everybody had on Cubs gear -- and I know everybody's not a Cubs fan,"" he said. ""But it's just about being a part of the moment. It's a historic thing for the city of Chicago and a lot of people just want to say they've been to a World Series.""","400899480"
"After Bojan Bogdanovic ties the game with a 3-pointer, John Henson tips home Jabari Parker's miss at the buzzer for a Bucks' victory. (0:42) MILWAUKEE --  Rashad Vaughn's teammates have been urging him to take more shots. He finally listened. Vaughn scored a career-high 22 points, 10 more than his previous best, and hit six 3-pointers in 12 attempts to lead the Milwaukee Bucks past the Brooklyn Nets 110-108 on Saturday night. He connected on three 3s in the fourth quarter with the game on the line. ""My teammates were giving me a lot of confidence,"" Vaughn said. ""I was feeling it tonight. There were a couple times I didn't shoot and they got on me."" Vaughn, the Bucks first-round draft pick last season, made just 29 percent of his 3-point attempts during his rookie campaign. ""He's a threat,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. Despite Vaughn's hot long-range shooting, the game wasn't decided until John Henson's buzzer-beating tip-in of Jabari Parker's missed layup, which gave the Bucks their first win of the season. Bojan Bogdanovic nailed a 3-pointer to tie the score with 11.6 seconds remaining, setting up Henson's heroics. ""Their strength is getting to the paint but (Vaughn) was the X factor,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I give him credit. He came in and hit some big shots."" Giannis Antetokounmpo added 21 points and 11 rebounds for Milwaukee. He scored all of his points in the paint, including seven dunks. Bogdanovic's 26 points led the Nets, who made just 11 of 35 3-point attempts. The Nets played without oft-injured starting center Brook Lopez, who rested after logging 26 minutes and scoring 25 points on Friday night in a home win over Indiana. ""(Brook) is our best player. We missed him a lot tonight,"" Bogdanovic said. TIP INS Nets: The team plans to closely monitor Lopez, who has had three surgeries on his right foot. ""This doesn't mean that he won't play back-to-backs the rest of the year,"" Atkinson said. ""We will look at what is best for him and the team. We want peak performance for the long term."" . G Greivis Vasquez left the game in the first half with a sore right ankle and didn't return. Bucks: After missing the season opener with a sprained left ankle, Tony Snell made his first appearance with the Bucks since being acquired in an Oct. 17 trade that sent Michael Carter-Williams to Chicago. ""We thought that'd be the best thing, to get him in the flow of things right of the bat instead of sitting and waiting around,"" Kidd said. MORE TIME The Bucks exercised the third-year contract option on Vaughn. The 20-year-old appeared in 70 games during his rookie season and averaged 3.1 points. ""This is a case where we'd love for him to make shots every time he takes the floor but it just doesn't happen right away,"" Kidd said. SCARY SITUATION The Nets have lost 14 straight games on the road and five in a row to Milwaukee. They haven't been over .500 since they were 4-3 on Nov. 12, 2014. FAMILIAR FACE Sean Kilpatrick, who was on the Bucks summer league roster in 2015, turned in another solid effort for the Nets, tallying 15 points in about 24 minutes. He credited the Bucks coaching staff with improving his overall game. ""They wanted to be me aggressive and just continue to keep playing within the flow of the game,"" Kilpatrick said. ""Coach Kidd, he actually believed in me. The fact that he believes in his players now is something that is helping them.""","400899481"
"SAN ANTONIO --  New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said the San Antonio Spurs will quickly expose any team's weakness. The Pelicans learned not only do they have a lot to work on, they also need some rest. Kawhi Leonard had 20 points and the Spurs beat the Pelicans 98-79 on Saturday night in their home opener. ""We didn't have the same energy that we're usually playing with,"" Pelicans forward Anthony Davis said. ""We wasn't making shots. There was some miscommunication. Against a team like this, you can't have plays where we have a mental breakdown, that's what they want and they always capitalize. We had seven turnovers in the first half and they scored on every turnover."" The Spurs won their first home opener in 20 years without Tim Duncan, who retired in the offseason. San Antonio played without any of its Big Three as Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili both sat out to rest in the first night of back-to-back games. San Antonio didn't appear to miss them, as 11 players were part of a balanced-scoring effort that helped the team remain unbeaten after three games. Patty Mills scored 18 points starting in place of Parker. Mills was 4 for 7 on 3-pointers, including one at the close of the first half to give San Antonio a 55-45 lead. ""I thought the play at the end of the first half was a big play,"" Gentry said. ""Instead of a seven-point game, it's a 10-point game. Patty makes a 3-pointer. We never really got him picked up. You can't make those kind of mistakes."" LaMarcus Aldridge added 12 points along with solid defense against the league's leading scorer. Davis was held to 18 points after scoring 50 and 45 points in the season's first two games. He was limited to 3:13 in the final quarter as San Antonio led by as many as 27 points in the fourth. ""I got some shots I wanted,"" Davis said. ""I got some jumpers that I wanted, just missed them. I'm not worried about offense, really. Shots are going to come. I just want to get everybody else going and try to find a way to find a win."" Davis took only nine shots in the first half. Aldridge picked up three fouls in the first half as Davis' primary defender, but still managed to hold the 6-foot-10 forward to 6-for-15 shooting in the game. ""(Aldridge) did a good job,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Anthony's obviously a great player. We just wanted to work on individual `D.' So, we didn't give him any help, we just let him guard him. In the future that may not be what we do."" E'Twaun Moore also had 18 points for New Orleans (0-3). Leonard added four rebounds and three assists and was 2 for 4 on 3-pointers. The 6-7 forward worked on drawing more fouls in the offseason and it continued to pay off, earning Leonard early MVP chants from the sellout crowd. He was 6 for 6 on free throws, raising his season total to 28 for 28. ""The only time I hear it is when I come to the games,"" Leonard said of the chants. ""I would never try to win an award. I'm out there just playing for my team. If I get noticed for my individual performance, then that's what happens. But other than that, I'm trying to win a game."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis played 32 minutes, raising his season total to 113. Before the game, Gentry said he was not concerned about the early workload, noting Davis is 23 years old and capable of handling big minutes. . New Orleans bench finished with 33 points, one less than San Antonio's. None of the Pelicans reserves finished in double figures but five had at least four points led by nine from Dante Cunningham. New Orleans' bench is averaging 31.7 points per game. Spurs: San Antonio has seven new players on its 15-man roster this season, including rookies Dejounte Murray, Bryn Forbes, Nico Laprovittola and Davis Bertans. ... Popovich chastised Jonathan Simmons for offensive goaltending when he dunked Laprovittola's layup as it was still on the cylinder. The veteran coach pointed to his head to signal the second-year player should be wiser. Simmons responded in the final quarter with a thunderous dunk over 7-2 center Alexis Ajinca. Simmons finished with 11 points. . Bertans missed his first shot of the season after making his first three attempts, including two 3-pointers. SIT DOWN Popovich opted to rest Parker and Ginobili even though it is the Spurs' third game of the season. Popovich is not a fan of the congested early schedule. ""Everybody goes through this,"" Popovich said. ""This is our third game in five nights. Tomorrow is going to be four games in six nights. It's ridiculous. (New Orleans) played at 8:30 last night and they have to play a back-to-back tonight. Seems like you could figure that out."" The Pelicans were coming off a 122-114 loss at home to Golden State Warriors.","400899482"
"DENVER -- The lights went out at the Pepsi Center. And no, the power outage had nothing to do with Damian Lillard's shooting. It only appeared that way since he was shooting lights out. Lillard scored 37 points, including the go-ahead floater with less than a second remaining in overtime, and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Denver Nuggets 115-113 on Saturday night in a game that featured a 28-minute delay in the fourth quarter due to a power surge. Lillard blew past big man Kenneth Faried in the lane and floated in a shot with 0.3 seconds left. Lillard had tied the game on a runner in regulation with 2.1 seconds remaining. Denver led 90-85 with 9:18 remaining in the final quarter when a bank of lights went out near the ceiling. The teams shot jumpers until the game was restarted. Portland shot lights out in its return to the court -- the Nuggets not as much, especially down the stretch when they squandered a nine-point lead. ""That was one of the craziest games I've been a part of, with the lights going out, us playing a great game,"" Lillard said of a contest that lasted 3 hours, 18 minutes. ""They played a great game, and us finding a way back in a short amount of time, forcing overtime, being down in overtime and us just finding a way. I think that speaks to our resiliency as a team."" CJ McCollum had seven of his 23 points in overtime to provide a spark for Portland. ""We essentially told the team after the lights (went out), it was a nine-minute game,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""We won that, and then we won the five-minute (overtime) game. To have a good season you have to find ways to win games like this."" Nikola Jokic led six Denver players in double figures with 23 points and he had a career-high 17 rebounds in the home opener for Denver. Trailing 70-59 at 9:35 of the third quarter, the Nuggets went on a 17-0 run to take a lead that held up until Lillard's layup off an inbounds pass from Mason Plumlee. Wilson Chandler had a chance to seal the game in the closing seconds of regulation but missed two free throws. ""If I make those free throws, game over,"" Chandler said. Really, though, it was a combination of factors. Like with 52.7 seconds remaining in regulation and Faried came up with a steal, only to turn it back over by throwing a bad pass. Lillard turned that mistake into a 3-pointer to cut the lead to 104-99 and give Portland a chance. ""Turnovers, missed free throws, poor execution,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Give them credit, they hung around and stole a game on the road, which is what good teams do. For us, going to keep our heads up. We've got to learn from this."" Denver honored Dikembe Mutombo at halftime by retiring the No. 55 jersey of the finger-wagging, shot-blocker extraordinaire. The team even brought out their ""Rainbow Skyline"" throwback uniforms for the occasion. TIP-INS Blazers: C Festus Ezeli (left knee) missed the game. ... The Blazers are 6-1 in their last seven games in Denver. ... Plumlee finished with 13 points. ... McCollum had 10 rebounds and a career-high three blocks. Nuggets: F Darrell Arthur (left knee) and G Gary Harris (groin) didn't play. The Nuggets were down a stalwart perimeter defender in Harris. ... G Emmanuel Mudiay had 21 points. NO TIMEOUT There was no way Lillard was calling a timeout with the game on the line in OT since Denver had three big men on the court. Instead, he drove right past Faried. ""If we called a timeout they could have adjusted, put maybe a defensive team in and got more wings out there,"" Lillard explained. MORE MUTOMBO Mutombo became the fifth player in team history to have his jersey raised to the rafters, joining Byron Beck (40), Alex English (2), Dan Issel (44) and David Thompson (33). Coach Doug Moe had No. 432 raised up to the roof, too, in commemoration of his franchise-record number of wins. In addition, the team presented Mutombo a $50,000 check for his foundation and a painting of him lying on the court, clutching the ball over his head, after the eighth-seeded Nuggets upset top-seeded Seattle during the 1993-94 postseason.","400899483"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  A new coach, a new arena and a new attitude. The Sacramento Kings hope these qualities can help transform a losing franchise into a winning one. DeMarcus Cousins had 29 points and Rudy Gay added 28 and the Kings defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 106-103 on Saturday night. Down as many as 18 points and playing lethargic basketball that was somewhat typical of the past few seasons, the Kings played inspired basketball in the second half when they outscored the Timberwolves 52-38 to win their second game of the season. ""It's definitely a different attitude this year and a different locker room,"" reserve guard Ben McLemore said. ""We have older veterans on this team who have been to the playoffs. They have been in a position like we were in tonight. We hung in there and played well when it mattered most."" One of those veterans is Matt Barnes, who played last season in Memphis under Dave Joerger, now the Kings coach. Barnes had 12 points and nine assists and played tough defense throughout the game. Following a listless first half, the Kings gained control in the third, running off 17 straight points to take the lead. The suddenly cold Timberwolves shot 3 for 12 in the third when they were outscored 31-12 and trailed 85-77 heading into the fourth. ""Just defense and energy,"" said Barnes, explaining the third-quarter turnaround. ""You've got to be locked in for 48 minutes, you can't pick and choose when you want to play defense. We got hit in the face (in the first half) and just played bad basketball."" McLemore had 13 points for the Kings, who won for the first time at new Golden 1 Center. And the Kings hung on to the victory despite losing Cousins, who picked up two fouls in the game's final minute and fouled out. Andrew Wiggins scored 29 points for the Timberwolves, who are off to an 0-2 start under new coach Tom Thibodeau. Zach Levine had three 3-pointers and 21 points while Karl Anthony-Towns had 15 points and Gorgui Dieng had 14 points and 13 rebounds. ""The third quarter was a problem. A big problem,"" Thibodeau said. ""So we got to look at the film to see what the issues were. We've got to be tougher."" A putback by Towns got Minnesota within 105-103. After regaining possession following a jump ball with 7.5 seconds left, Wiggins misfired on a jumper and Barnes corralled the rebound and made one of two free throws to end the game. Gay put the Kings ahead by two with a jumper and Ty Lawson connected on a corner 3 for a 105-100 lead with 1:10 remaining. BIG QUARTER Now in his fourth season, McLemore has suffered through some tough times, seeing his playing time continually decrease due in part to erratic shooting. After being stripped twice late in Thursday's game by Kawhi Leonard in a loss to San Antonio, McLemore delivered in the fourth quarter against Minnesota. He made two big 3-pointers and scored nine points in the fourth. ""He was very impressive,"" Joerger said. ""He had a tough game the other night and it didn't break him. That's what pro basketball is -- there's always going to be another night."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Last season the Timberwolves beat the Kings in all four games and they were 4-3 in the previous seven games in Sacramento. .

"LOS ANGELES --  Austin Rivers played as many minutes as the starters after coach Doc Rivers saw what his son was doing to disrupt Utah's Joe Johnson. The younger Rivers scored 19 points in 28 minutes, Blake Griffin added 18 and the Los Angeles Clippers routed the Utah Jazz 88-75 in their home opener Sunday. Jamal Crawford had 12 points, and DeAndre Jordan had 16 rebounds despite spraining his right thumb . George Hill led the Jazz with 18 points and reserve Dante Exum added 10. Johnson, who had 29 points in his Utah debut, was held to seven points on 3-of-9 shooting. Johnson was effective to start the game, including a sequence in which he hit a jumper, stole the ball and hit a 3-pointer that gave Utah its first lead. That's when Rivers came off the bench. ""I honestly didn't think we would go with him that early with Joe,"" Doc Rivers said. ""He actually was very effective on Joe because Joe had it going and once he got it going, we figured throw Austin in and see what we can do."" The Clippers took the lead for good in the second quarter on Griffin's fast-break dunk. It was part of a 22-4 run over both halves that pushed their lead to 49-35. Six different Clippers contributed to the spurt, led by Griffin's seven points . ""Last year we were trying to figure out each other and not get in each other's way,"" the younger Rivers said. ""Now the group has one goal. Everyone is focused on winning."" Rivers scored six of the Clippers' first eight points in the fourth, extending their lead to 77-56. The backup was 8 of 11 from the floor. The Jazz never got a sustained run going in the second half. Two free throws by Exum drew them within eight late in the third, the closest they came in the half. ""I don't think we played well offensively, our defense kept us in the game for a while, but some of our better players struggled,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. TIP-INS Jazz: F Gordon Hayward, who averaged 28.3 point, 8.6 rebounds and 4.0 assists against the Clippers last season, sat out his third straight game with a broken finger on his left hand. Clippers: In the first quarter, Griffin (8,836) surpassed Corey Maggette (8,835) for fourth on the team's career scoring list. ... They won their home opener for the fifth straight year. ... The Clippers have won eight in a row at home, including the final seven games of last season. HURTING D.J. Jordan had a severe reaction upon spraining his thumb midway through the third quarter. He returned midway through the fourth and got one rebound after getting hurt. ""I was worried because I saw the swelling,"" the elder Rivers said. ""Let's just hope it's OK."" Paul was concerned, too, calling Jordan ""the most durable guy in our league."" Jordan will have an X-ray. NBA DEBUT Utah's Joel Bolomboy made his NBA debut with one rebound, one assist and one turnover in four minutes. He didn't take a shot. The rookie forward helped Weber State earn a trip to the NCAA Tournament last season. ""He was a little nervous at first, but once he got in there he played well for the short minutes he was in,"" teammate Derrick Favors said. BOARDING The Clippers controlled the boards, 49-43.

"PHOENIX --  The Golden State Warriors with Kevin Durant are still an early season work in progress, as evidenced by a close call against the Suns in Phoenix. Durant scored 37 points, Stephen Curry added 28 and the Warriors held off the pesky Suns 106-100 on Sunday. ""We are not clicking and everybody can see that,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""It will come but the main thing while we are going through this process is to continue to compete and try to pick up wins."" The Warriors didn't seal the victory until Curry's two free throws with 12.9 seconds to play. Durant added a pair of free throws with seven seconds left to provide the final margin. Durant was 15 of 16 at the line. ""I was just taking what the defense was giving me,"" he said. ""If you play me straight up, I like my chances. I try to get there (the foul line) as much as possible. My guys were setting great screens for me and I was able to get downhill some. T.J. Warren scored 26 points and Eric Bledsoe had 21 for the winless Suns, who took the Thunder into overtime in Oklahoma City on Friday night.  Tyson Chandler grabbed 18 rebounds for Phoenix. ""Game 3 with a young squad, have a chance to beat OKC on the road, have a chance to beat Golden State at home,"" Phoenix coach Earl Watson said. ""I think we're right where we need to be."" Warren was coming off a career-high 30 points against the Thunder. ""Unbelievable,"" Bledsoe said. ""I mean, he's `Tony Buckets.' He does what his name says, he gets buckets."" The Suns led by as many as 13 in the first half. The Warriors finally took somewhat shaky control midway through the final quarter. The game looked well in hand for the reigning Western Conference champs when Durant took a lob pass from Andre Iguodala, dunked and was fouled. The three-point play put the Warriors up 102-94 -- their biggest lead of the day -- with 1:19 to play. But Phoenix got consecutive driving layups from Bledsoe, Warren and Jared Dudley to cut it to 102-100 with 14.8 seconds remaining. The Suns had to foul Curry, and arguably the best free throw shooter in the game made them both to put away Golden State's second victory after a loss in its home opener. SUNS RUN Phoenix scored 16 straight points in what became a 22-2 run to lead 30-17 when Alex Len sank a pair of free throws with 38.4 seconds left in the first quarter. Six Suns scored in the run.

Booker scored 1,078 points in 78 games as a teen. The only teens to score more are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Carmello Anthony, Durant and Dwight Howard. Booker had six 30-point games as a teenager, one fewer than Durant. He missed six of his first seven shots Sunday and wound up 3-for-12 for seven points. ""Devin's tough,"" Watson said. ""If you watch him, he's limping around a lot. He has no excuses or anything. He goes out there and plays."" Booker said that the toe injury restricted him some but insisted it was not affecting his shooting. ""I've cant' make no excuses. I'm just missing shots,"" Booker said. ""I'm going to catch my rhythm. ... I'm kind of anxious on some of my shots. I've just got to let the game come to me and I'll be fine.""

""That was the best part of the game. We didn't give in."" Hassan Whiteside made his final seven shots and tied a career high with 27 points for Miami, also grabbing 15 rebounds. Goran Dragic scored 25 points and Justise Winslow added 18 for the Heat. Miami took the lead on a layup by Dragic right before Leonard returned, yet only held that lead for 18 seconds. Leonard found Mills for a 3-pointer on his first possession back, then drove down a wide-open lane for a dunk on the next San Antonio trip. The Spurs didn't trail again. ""They made some tough shots,"" Dragic said. ""But I feel like we defended well."" When the Spurs last visited on Feb. 9, both teams used 11 players. Of those 22, only seven played Sunday -- four for the Spurs, three for the Heat. That game was the last Chris Bosh played for Miami. He was diagnosed with a blood clot in Toronto two nights later, pulled out of All-Star weekend and hasn't been cleared to play since. So the Heat remain in transition. But even with changes themselves, the Spurs remain the Spurs. ""You absolutely respect and enjoy how San Antonio just finds a way to stay ahead of the curve, continue to reinvent and be incredibly efficient,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. TIP-INS Spurs: Leonard made his first five free throws, then missed to end a season-opening streak of 33 makes. ... LaMarcus Aldridge (rest) got the night off. ... Danny Green (left quad strain) was on the trip, though isn't expected to play for a couple more weeks. Heat: Whiteside wore a sleeve to protect his stitched-up left elbow, cut in Friday's loss to Charlotte. ... Winslow missed his first five shots, airballing the last. He made his next seven. ... Spoelstra said Josh Richardson (knee) is doing more rehab, but hasn't fully practiced yet. SHORT NIGHT, LONG WEEK The Spurs played at home Saturday night, then landed in Miami at 2:30 a.m. -- and faced the Heat at 6 p.m. Good news for the Spurs: This trip is one of only two instances this season when they'll deal with such a long flight on a back-to-back. Bad news for the Spurs: The other is later this week. San Antonio plays Friday in Utah, then flies 1,100 miles to host the Clippers on Saturday. BENCH FACTOR San Antonio's reserves outscored Miami's bench 43-14. So far this season, the Spurs have a 174-81 edge in bench scoring.","400899487"
"Andre Drummond steals a pass and sprints the length of the court on a give-and-go sequence before capping it off with a tremendous one-handed slam dunk. (0:27) AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  Andre Drummond finished with another flashy stat line, and coach Stan Van Gundy felt the 7-footer's contributions went well beyond the numbers. ""He's just been really willing offensively to give himself up. He knows the attention he draws and he has been willing to do that,"" Van Gundy said. ""That's frustrating at times, but he's still getting shots -- a lot of them are offensive rebounds, I understand that, but he's still getting the ball down there and getting a chance to score."" Drummond had 20 points and 23 rebounds, helping the Detroit Pistons cruise to a 98-83 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday night. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 21 points for the Pistons, who scored seven straight points in the final minute of the third quarter to build a 10-point lead. Drummond reached 20 rebounds for a second consecutive game, and this was his 10th career game with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds. ""I worked hard this summer on all aspects of my game,"" Drummond said. ""The work is just showing."" Tobias Harris scored 16 points for Detroit, and Marcus Morris and Ish Smith added 11 each. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 17. Milwaukee never led in the second half. Detroit lost its opener at Toronto but has bounced back with double-digit victories at home over Orlando and Milwaukee. Detroit led 68-65 late in the third before finishing the quarter with a flourish. A 3-pointer by Caldwell-Pope was followed by a dunk from Harris that put the Pistons up 75-65. ""I thought that the best thing of the game was we played a pretty low-energy third quarter for the first nine minutes of it, but then we got right back in the game,"" Van Gundy said. ""We responded well to that and opened it back up to double figures, basically, with our defense the last three minutes of the quarter and getting out in transition. There were a lot of things to be really happy with."" Drummond's put-back dunk in the fourth made it 88-75. ""They made a few runs, but we didn't do a good job trying to stop their momentum and get it back within reach,"" Bucks guard Matthew Dellavedova said. ""We'd have a play or two where we wouldn't come up with a loose ball or they would get a rebound and pull away again. I felt like we were always chasing them on the scoreboard and we couldn't really get back level or get up."" The Pistons led 24-21 after the first quarter. An early 8-0 run in the second pushed the lead to double digits, and it was 50-39 at halftime. TIP-INS Bucks: Greg Monroe, in his second season with Milwaukee after leaving the Pistons, scored 11 points. ... Khris Middleton, another former Piston, is out because of a hamstring injury. Pistons: Detroit is without PG Reggie Jackson (knee), and Smith, his replacement, went 5 of 17 from the field. But all five starters for the Pistons scored in double figures. Smith had seven assists. ... Drummond had eight offensive rebounds. SHUT DOWN Detroit won easily despite shooting only 44 percent from the field. The Pistons held Milwaukee to 39 percent and outrebounded the Bucks 58-40. OVERWHELMED Milwaukee finished with season lows in rebounds (40) and defensive rebounds (30). Drummond's presence was a big reason for that. ""Drummond is an All-Star and he understands his role,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""He plays his role every night. He's going to score, get to the free-throw line, make or miss. When his team misses shots, he's right there for offensive rebounds.""","400899488"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Marc Gasol is trying to add long-range shooting to his repertoire. Gasol's 3-point basket in the closing seconds of regulation and two more from beyond the arc in overtime carried the Grizzlies to a 112-103 victory over the Washington Wizards on Sunday night. ""I don't see anything extraordinary,"" the Grizzlies' 7-foot-1 center said. ""My 2-pointers weren't going, and eventually, I got going from the 3-point line."" Gasol finished with 20 points, including eight in the extra period as Memphis overcame an eight-point deficit in the final 3-plus minutes of regulation, capped by Gasol's 27-footer with 15.7 seconds left. That tied the game at 100-all. John Wall's 9-foot attempt at the horn misfired, sending the game to overtime. ""I thought he had a chance to turn the corner,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of Wall's final attempt in regulation. ""And give (Grizzlies guard Mike) Conley credit. He cut him off. There was some contact, but I've been around a lot of NBA games, and that's not enough contact."" Conley had 24 points and 11 assists for the Grizzlies.

GUNNER GASOL'S SHOOTING Gasol's four 3-pointers were a career-high. He had never made more than three 3-pointers in a season.Fizdale is enco uraging his big men like Gasol and Randolph to take 3s. BROOKS' VIEW ""(Their center) hit four 3s. It's tough when they have a five that can step out and hit 4 of 6 from 3."" Scott Brooks on Gasol. MOMENTUM CHANGER: Washington led 96-88 approaching the 3-minute mark, when Carter was heading to the basket and was smacked on the head by Wall. After review, Wall was called for a Flagrant 1. Carter hit the free throws, Conley hit a 3 on the ensuing possession, and Memphis began its comeback. ""I just tried to make a play,"" Wall said, adding: ""I just tried to block a shot, and they called it.""

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook wasn't entirely pleased with his 51-point triple-double two nights earlier, so he adjusted his approach. Westbrook still scored 33 points as part of another triple-double, but he focused more on his role as a facilitator on Sunday. He had 16 assists to go with 12 rebounds, helping the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Los Angeles Lakers 113-96 to remain undefeated. Westbrook took a career-high 44 shots against Phoenix on Friday, and he criticized himself for it afterward. This time, he made 11 of 21 field goals. ""I thought we did a good job of running the offense, letting it work for us,"" he said. ""Getting better shots, easy shots, and it worked out for us."" According to the Thunder, Westbrook joined Magic Johnson, Jerry Lucas and Oscar Robertson as the only players in NBA history with two triple-doubles in the first three games of a season. He now averages 38.7 points, 12.3 rebounds and 11.7 assists. ""He had a masterful game tonight -- the way he was getting everyone involved, shooting when the shots were there and playmaking for teammates,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""When we were aggressive on him, he showed today why he's one of the top point guards in the world."" The Thunder have won 20 straight regular-season games when Westbrook registers a triple-double. He clinched this one, the 39th of his career, in the third quarter. ""That's standard for him,"" Thunder center Steven Adams said. ""He's a freak."" Victor Oladipo added 20 points for the Thunder. D'Angelo Russell and Julius Randle each scored 20 points for the Lakers. The Thunder led 58-46 at halftime, but the Lakers chipped away and pulled to 77-71 by the end of the third quarter. A putback dunk by Enes Kanter and a steal and dunk by Oladipo pushed Oklahoma City's lead to 10 in the first minute of the fourth. The Lakers tried to hang tough. Nick Young made a 3-pointer to trim Oklahoma City's lead to 95-91 with just under five minutes remaining. Adams scored in close, and Westbrook followed with a fast break dunk after a steal by Adams to put the Thunder back in control for good. ""The biggest part was we had Russ,"" Adams said. ""Russ did an amazing job of just controlling us as players, and then we got everything we wanted because he was scoring the basket, and obviously, they had to overhelp."" TIP-INS Lakers:  Randle made 5 of 6 shots in the first half, while the rest of the team made 13 of 39. ... Los Angeles shot 5 for 18 on 3s in the first half and finished 7 for 32 for the game. ...

"Wesley Matthews hits a game-tying 3-pointer for the Mavericks, but James Harden draws a foul with 0.1 seconds left and hits a free throw on the ensuing Rockets' possession to win the game. (1:01) HOUSTON --  James Harden blamed the added suspense on Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni. Harden made a free throw with 0.1 seconds left, lifting the Rockets over the Dallas Mavericks 93-92 in their home opener Sunday night. Harden put extra pressure on himself by missing the first of two foul shots after being fouled by Wesley Matthews on a driving layup at the buzzer with the game tied. ""Coach messed me up, man -- he said, `Make the first one and miss the second one,' and I did the opposite,"" Harden said with a smile. ""I'm just happy I made it and we came away with the win."" Harden led Houston with 28 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, edging Matthews in a gutsy back-and-forth. After trailing by 10 entering the fourth quarter, Dallas tied it at 92 on a 3-pointer by Matthews with 4.1 seconds remaining. D'Antoni was pleased with the execution on the play that won the game. Nene received the inbound pass and found a cutting Harden with a crisp bounce pass before Matthews drew his sixth foul. ""That's what he does,"" D'Antoni said. ""That's why he's one of the best, and he's just so good at drawing fouls and getting in the lane."" Matthews led Dallas with 25 points and J.J. Barea scored 18 points off the bench. In falling to the Rockets for the second time in three days, the Mavericks fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2011-12, the lockout-shortened season following their title. ""We gave ourselves a chance, and it comes down to the one play and the whistle,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We're up against it right now in a lot of ways, but no one's backing down. We've just got to find a way."" Dallas was without Dirk Nowitzki (illness, sore Achilles tendon) for a second straight game. Nowitzki participated in pregame warmups but was a late scratch. ""Our margin for error is so slim,"" Matthews said. ""We're not the Golden State Warriors, we're not the Cleveland Cavaliers, we're not the Spurs, but we're a ... good team. So we've got to minimize the stuff that we can control."" Houston got strong performances from offseason additions Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson and Nene in their home debuts. Gordon had 14 points, Anderson had 14 points and 12 rebounds and Nene had 11 points. The Rockets capped the first and second quarters with points at the buzzer. To end the first, Corey Brewer hit a 3-pointer from 30 feet out. Harden ended the second quarter on a driving layup to put the Rockets up 63-53. Late in the third quarter, Houston's Trevor Ariza and Dallas' Salah Mejri received double-technical fouls after both players fell to the floor and were tangled for a few seconds. Ariza clinched his fists before he was restrained by players. TIP-INS Mavericks: Without Nowitzki, Dallas was frequently undersized but managed to hold their own in the rebounding category, with Houston edging the Mavericks 46-42. ... Starting in Nowitzki's place, Seth Curry played 23 minutes and scored no points on 0-for-3 shooting. Rockets: Houston was plagued by 17 turnovers compared to just nine turnovers from Dallas. ...

"TORONTO --  DeMar DeRozan is looking like one of the NBA's premier scorers this season. He just isn't feeling like it yet. DeRozan had 33 points and Kyle Lowry made a couple key baskets late to finish with 29 points, helping the Toronto Raptors beat the Denver Nuggets 105-102. DeRozan is the first ever Raptor with three straight 30-point games to begin a season, and he and Oklahoma City guard Russell Westbrook are the only players to do it this season. Despite all that scoring, DeRozan quickly cut off comparisons to stars like Westbrook or New Orleans forward Anthony Davis, who each have a 50-point game already this season. ""Do you see what they were doing?"" DeRozan said. ""That's video game numbers. It's awesome just to ... have your name in any type of conversation about elite, top players."" DeRozan's run of 30-point games is one shy of Mike James' stretch from 2006 for the longest run at any point in the season. He's also the first to start a season with three straight 30-point games without a 3-pointer since Kobe Bryant did it for the Lakers in 2005. Danilo Gallinari, Will Barton and Emmanuel Mudiay each had 16 points for Denver, and Jusuf Nurkic added 13 points and a career-high 18 rebounds. After leading by as many as 19 in the second quarter, Toronto took its foot off the gas in the second half. Denver grabbed its first lead in over 34 minutes on Chandler Wilson's 3-pointer with 8:49 to play, and it took a furious Raptors rally down the stretch to pull out the win. ""It got away on the defensive end,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. ""We gave up 35 points in the third quarter. What saved us was getting into the paint. We had 58 points in the paint."" TIP INS Nuggets: F Darrell Arthur (knee) and G Gary Harris (groin) missed their third straight games. ... Coming into Monday's game, Denver had won eight of its last 12 games in Toronto. Raptors: C Lucas Nogueira (ankle) did not dress for the game. ... The Raptors got their first win over Denver in almost two years.

HALFWAY THERE Denver coach Michael Malone was upset the Nuggets waited until the second half to get in gear for the second straight game. ""When you play against a team that was in the Eastern Conference Finals last year, you can't do that,"" he said. ""I'm very proud of our effort. We outscored them by 10 in the second half, gave ourselves a chance to win, took the lead, but you can't spot that team that half that we did."" BOARD PATROL The Nuggets (59.5) and Raptors (51) entered as first and tied for third in average rebounds per game, but it was the Raptors who led the way, taking a 46-43 edge. HALLOWEEN HOMECOMING Denver rookie Jamal Murray, who grew up about 70 miles from Toronto in Kitchener, Ontario, played his first professional game in Canada. After scrambling to secure over 100 tickets for friends and family, Murray scored his first NBA basket following a technical foul with 10:41 to go in the fourth quarter. DOWN AND OUT Barton went down with 30 seconds remaining in the third quarter after twisting his left ankle stepping on the foot of Toronto rookie Jakob Poeltl.

"Rajon Rondo feeds Dwyane Wade on the fast break and Wade lobs it up to Jimmy Butler for the alley-oop. (0:20) NEW YORK -- Dwyane Wade left his defender in the dust with a vintage crossover that brought players on the Chicago bench and fans behind them to their feet. ""He's still got some `ahh' in his bag,"" teammate Jimmy Butler said. ""Very impressive."" So are the new-look Bulls. Butler scored 22 points, Wade had 12 in the first road game of his career not played for Miami, and the Bulls improved to 3-0 by beating the Brooklyn Nets 118-88 on Monday night. With Wade and Rajon Rondo in a revamped backcourt, the Bulls opened with home victories against Eastern Conference playoff teams Boston and Indiana before easily handling their road opener, leading by as many as 33 points. ""We only played a little bit together in the preseason, so we're still learning each other right now. We're only three games in, but we see it looking good at times,"" Wade said. The Bulls had seven players in double figures, with Wade becoming the last of them when he blew by Bojan Bogdanovic with that crossover and was fouled on a drive to the basket in the fourth quarter. Nikola Mirotic had 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Taj Gibson added 14 points and 11 boards for the Bulls. Bogdanovic scored 15 points and Jeremy Lin had 14 for the Nets, who fell to 1-3. Butler made all five shots as the Bulls built an 18-point lead after one quarter that grew to 25 in the second. Chicago led 93-66 after three, leaving the crowd with little to cheer in the fourth beyond Wade's smooth moves. The Nets' first three games had all been decided by single digits -- they had actually outscored opponents 328-326 despite starting 1-2 -- but they were never in this one after the opening minutes. ""It was just poor energy right from the start,"" center Brook Lopez said. ""Obviously there is no excuse for the way we played."" Butler and Gibson were a combined 9 for 9 in the first quarter as the Bulls got a number of easy baskets while playing at the quicker pace they are using since adding Wade and Rondo. ""It didn't show in the preseason, but I don't know what's gotten into us,"" Rondo said. ""We turned things around."" The Nets, who entered averaging an NBA-high 37.3 3-point attempts per game, were 5 for 31 (16 percent) behind the arc.

Hoiberg said the reserve guard will have an MRI on Tuesday. ... The Bulls have won four straight in Brooklyn, tied with Miami for the longest current winning streak. Nets: Coach Kenny Atkinson said guard Randy Foye, who hasn't played yet because of a strained right hamstring, was ""progressing well."" Also sidelined was backup guard Greivis Vasquez, who felt soreness in his right ankle Saturday at Milwaukee. Atkinson said Vasquez was day to day. ... The Nets fell to 6-7 on Halloween. They haven't won on the holiday since beating the Bulls in 2007. LOPEZ LEDGER Robin Lopez improved to 8-6 against twin brother Brook. The two, who rarely speak when playing each other, didn't even acknowledge each other in the moments before the opening tip. Brook stood with his back to Robin before beating him to win the jump. VALENTINE'S DAY Rookie Denzel Valentine, the college player of the year last season at Michigan State, scored his first NBA points with a 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter after replacing Wade. BROOK'S BACK TO BACKS Brook Lopez, who has battled foot problems during his career, sat out Saturday in Milwaukee on the second night of a back-to-back but Atkinson was vague when asked about the plan. ""There's an overall plan and then on a game-to-game basis you might have to adjust that depending on a lot of things,"" he said.

"ATLANTA -- Forget about Dwight Howard's trouble at the line and Atlanta's off night from the field. The Hawks settled down in time to secure their first 3-0 start in five seasons. Howard had 18 points and Kyle Korver and Dennis Schroder scored 17 apiece, leading Atlanta to a 106-95 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Monday. Every Atlanta starter scored in double figures, and the Hawks held Sacramento's DeMarcus Cousins in check after he averaged 30 points in the Kings' first three games. He finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds. The Kings scored 37 points in the third on their way to an 81-79 lead heading into the final period. But the Hawks closed with a flourish. ""Third quarter we didn't keep our composure, fourth quarter we did,"" Atlanta forward Paul Millsap said. ""That team wants to make the game ugly. If you get caught up into that, then you'll have a 37-point quarter, and we got caught up into it."" Howard went 8 for 20 from the line, but also contributed 11 rebounds and four blocked shots. Millsap had 13 points and a game-high 14 rebounds. Rudy Gay scored 22 points for Sacramento (2-2), and Matt Barnes had 14. Ben McLemore finished with 12 points. The Kings were whistled for 34 fouls, and the Hawks went 29 for 47 at the line overall. Sacramento led 83-81 in the fourth quarter when Millsap made a foul shot and Kent Bazemore connected on a 3 to give the Hawks the lead. Korver helped Atlanta hold on with another 3 with about four minutes left. The Kings made just 6 of 18 shots in the final period. ""Where it ran back away from us was we fell in love with the jump shot, and stopped getting in the paint,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger. Millsap helped with the defense on Cousins, and also finished with eight assists, three steals and a blocked shot. ""He's a special player,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""That third quarter I think got to him a little bit, and him not being on the court obviously impacts us."" TIP-INS Kings: Cousins became the Kings' career leader with 246 double-doubles. Chris Webber had 245. Only Howard (267) and Kevin Love (266) have more double-doubles in the NBA since 2011. Hawks: Atlanta has scored at least 53 points in the first half of all three games this season, and led each time. HAWKS ON THE MOVE Atlanta made a couple of moves after learning forward Mike Scott will be unavailable for about four weeks as he prepares to undergo a platelet replacement procedure to alleviate pain in his left knee. He was limited in the preseason, and missed the first two regular-season games.

"LOS ANGELES --  DeAndre Jordan looked around the press room with that big, megawatt smile and playfully avoided a question about his injured thumb as though it never happened. Jordan sprained his right thumb Sunday but played with it taped on Monday night. That meant the Big Three for the Los Angeles Clippers was still very much intact and effective. Chris Paul scored 24 points and Blake Griffin had 21 points and 11 rebounds in a 116-98 victory over the winless Phoenix Suns. Jordan added 19 points and 11 rebounds as the Clippers relied on their top stars in improving to 3-0 this season. ""I feel great,"" Jordan said. ""It was a scary play for a second (on Sunday). I really want to play basketball. I don't want to miss any games. My teammates were definitely on me about getting it taken care of, but I'm fine."" As are the Clippers. Phoenix, however, has plenty of work to do. Brandon Knight scored 18 points for the Suns (0-4), who gave Los Angeles a little scare on Halloween when they cut the lead to 56-55 in the third quarter. The Clippers pulled away after that, and Phoenix was marred by fouls and turnovers. ""We kept playing hard, but the momentum kind of switched over,"" forward T.J. Warren said. ""After the third, we couldn't get stops and we were fouling a lot and putting them on the free throw line."" Griffin scored 15 points in the first half, when Los Angeles built a 13-point lead. He made 12 of 14 free throws. The Clippers' defense was stout and forced the Suns into 14 first-half turnovers and 20 overall. Los Angeles closed with an 18-3 run to lead 48-36 at halftime. ""The two things I liked were that we stayed engaged defensively, and that's what we've done all year and they just kept trusting,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Like (they know) it's going to fall and eventually it started falling and once the basket opened up, with the way we were defending, we were in great shape."" Jordan entertained with an assortment of dunks and layups despite playing with his right thumb wrapped in tape. Early in the first quarter, he grimaced and grabbed his thumb when he missed an alley-oop. But he remained in the game and never showed any signs of a problem afterward. Four of the five Clippers starters had scored in double figures by the end of the third quarter. Los Angeles' offense has been slow to catch up with its defense early this season, but the Suns were no match on the defensive end as the Clippers got into a rhythm. Suns center Tyson Chandler fouled out with 7:51 left, a product of trying to contain Jordan and the rest of the Clippers' frontcourt. The fouls and turnovers caught up with the Suns late in the game. ""That's a lack of focus,"" coach Earl Watson said. ""They all came in the second quarter. And we can't let foul calls disrupt our rhythm mentally. We have to weather that storm and be mentally tough and play through that."" TIP-INS Suns: G Devin Booker, third on the team in scoring, was a game-time decision and sat out with a sprained toe. Before the game, Watson said: ""If he doesn't play, he's really in pain."" Clippers: Jordan injured his thumb in a win over Utah. He left the game but returned to play, and X-rays were negative. Rivers said he would monitor the situation throughout the game. BACK-TO-BACKS Both the Suns and Clippers were playing back-to-back games for the first time this season. The Suns hosted the Warriors on Sunday and lost 106-100. The Clippers played an afternoon game Sunday followed by a night game. Rivers said he doesn't mind that kind of schedule. PIERCE WINS HALLOWEEN Paul Pierce is still out with an ankle injury, but his Halloween costume was a winner. Pierce dressed up as rock star Rick James but changed just before tip-off. He posed for plenty of pictures before the game, including one with Clippers owner Steve Ballmer.","400899495"

Sixers center Joel Embiid lost his dribble at the top of the key and Orlando snagged the ball with 5.7 seconds left. Sixers guard T.J.

"CLEVELAND --  Kyrie Irving's personal showcases are becoming a common occurrence. Irving scored a season-high 32 points and the reigning NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers remained undefeated, beating the Houston Rockets 128-120 on Tuesday night. ""He's growing every day,"" said LeBron James, who scored 19 points and had 13 rebounds. ""He's only 24 years old. He's special."" Count Houston coach Mike D'Antoni as another Irving fan after watching Cleveland's point guard take over the game. ""Kyrie is great, he's got it all,"" D'Antoni said. ""All you can do is hope he misses shots. You put a hand in his face to make it as difficult as possible."" Kevin Love scored 24 points as Cleveland placed six players in double figures. The Cavaliers are 4-0 for the first time in 16 years. James Harden scored a season-high 41 points and had 15 assists for Houston. Ryan Anderson's 3-pointer cut Cleveland's lead to 114-112 with 2:18 to play, but 3-pointers by James and J.R. Smith and another 3 by Irving with 34 seconds left pushed the margin to 125-116. The game's tip-off was moved up an hour to 6 p.m. because the Indians and Cubs were playing Game 6 of the World Series across the street at Progressive Field. James and some teammates made their way across the plaza to Progressive Field for Game 6. Cleveland scored 43 points in the fourth quarter, making 13 of 15 from the field, including its last eight shots. ""It's all about executing down the stretch,"" Irving said. ""That's not necessarily hard for us. It's just about consistently getting better."" Harden, who was 13 of 20 from the field, gave the Cavaliers credit for hitting clutch shots. ""They didn't miss the last five or six minutes,"" he said. ""Some shots we wanted to live with and some shots they just made."" Smith scored 15 points for Cleveland while Mike Dunleavy and Channing Frye had 11 apiece. Eric Gordon scored 16 points for Houston. Nene added 13 and Anderson had 12. Irving's driving layup after a spin move in the lane gave Cleveland a 94-92 lead with 8 minutes to play and began a 13-3 run. Iman Shumpert and Dunleavy hit 3-pointers before Love was fouled shooting a 3 and made all three free throws. James, who air-balled a free throw in the second quarter, also had eight assists. Rockets guard Trevor Ariza left the game in the third quarter after bumping heads with Tristan Thompson. Ariza received five stitches and returned with a bandage under his right eye. Houston, which began a five-game trip, opens the season with seven road contests in eight games. The Rockets had won four straight games in Cleveland. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston committed a backcourt violation when Ariza stepped across the timeline after receiving the opening tip. ... Harden has been playing point guard in place of Patrick Beverley (left knee), who remains out after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on Oct. 25. ... C Clint Capela made two free throws in the third quarter after missing his first seven attempts of the season. Cavaliers: Smith hit his 344th 3-pointer, passing Cleveland assistant coach Damon Jones for ninth place on the team's all-time list. ... Frye returned to the team after missing two games after the death of his mother. ... Cleveland trailed after the opening quarter for the first time in four games. LESSONS LEARNED Harden thought the loss produced some positives for the Rockets, who fell to 2-2. ""It was a good test for us,"" he said. ""Playing against the defending champions on their home court, we can take some good things out of this."" NOT A BIG THING Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue won't lose any sleep over the fact the Rockets scored 120 points and shot 48 percent. ""I didn't care, just win,"" he said. ""So this game I just circled `Get a win.' That's a tough team to play.""","400899497"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Scoring isn't an issue for Indiana. The Pacers can put up points. It's the struggles on the defensive end of the floor that cost them two losses in their first three games, and almost once more on Tuesday night. And their All-Star is very aware. ""I know what a good defensive team is. I know what it looks like. We're nowhere close to that,"" Paul George said. George scored 30 points, including Indiana's final 12 of the game to rally the Pacers to a 115-108 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers trailed by as many as 16 points, but rallied and had their final lead at 108-107 before George put it away. ""We were searching for players to go to,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Paul hit his first shot and he looked like he wanted the ball, and we milked it. All-Stars like (Paul), you expect them to make plays like that. That's what makes them great players."" George made consecutive 18-foot jumpers for a 111-108 lead, then followed through on the opposite end of the floor with the biggest defensive rebound of the game. The Lakers' Jordan Clarkson missed an almost uncontested layup, and it was George who came down with the rebound, sending him to the free throw line to close out the contest. ""He's really good and I mean that's what great players do,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""We did a phenomenal job of coming back in the second half and we started playing with the effort and energy that we need to play the full game with, and at the end of the game anything came happen."" Monta Ellis had 17 points and CJ Miles scored 16 for the Pacers. Thaddeus Young finished with 14. The Pacers' most impressive moment on defense came in the second quarter, when second-year big man Myles Turner denied Tarik Black's attempted slam dunk with authority. For the majority of the game, though, the defense was nowhere to be found. Lou Williams scored 19 points for the Lakers and Clarkson had 15. TIP-INS: Lakers: The Lakers are 0-3 on the road this season ... The Lakers rank 30th in turnovers per game, averaging 16.3. On Tuesday night, they turned it over 19 times. Pacers: The Pacers topped 100 points for the third time this season ... The Pacers are 2-0 when George scores 25 points or more ... Indiana has won six of the last seven meetings against the Lakers. BAD TIMING The game was delayed three times in the first 30 seconds while scoring officials tried to fix a malfunction with the game clock. For the first 6  1/2 minutes of the game, the clock was not operable. Scorers were forced to use stop watches, and the Pacers' public address announcer had to announce when there was 10 seconds remaining on the shot clock, then count down when it reached 5 seconds. The issue was resolved with 5:55 remaining in the first quarter.","400899498"
"MIAMI --  DeMarcus Cousins went into the fourth quarter with no personal fouls. By the end of regulation, he had fouled out. And with that, Miami's home dominance over Sacramento continues. Goran Dragic scored 25 points, Tyler Johnson had seven of his 22 in overtime and the Heat beat the Kings 108-96 on Tuesday night -- Miami's 15th consecutive home win over Sacramento, the longest such current streak in the NBA. ""Remarkable, isn't it?"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said of Cousins' six-foul final quarter, one that included three offensive fouls -- the last of those waving off what would have been a go-ahead basket with 30.6 seconds left. With Cousins reduced to spectating, the Heat outscored the Kings 17-5 in overtime. ""I think it was good for us to go through another emotional game,"" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, whose team stopped a two-game slide. ""In the second half emotions were running high. A lot of frustration, a lot of elation, a lot of everything in between."" Rudy Gay scored 30 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for Sacramento. Cousins also scored 30 for the Kings. Hassan Whiteside got his fourth double-double to start the season, 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Heat -- and drew the last foul against Cousins. Dragic added eight rebounds and eight assists, and Dion Waiters scored 20 points for Miami. Whiteside and Cousins were very careful with their words after the game when asked about fouls. ""Good, hard, competitive game,"" Cousins said. Said Whiteside, who was in foul trouble throughout the second half: ""I don't want to speak on that, because the NBA is going to take my money."" The Heat wasted an 80-71 lead in the final six minutes of regulation. Gay went on a personal 7-0 run to turn a five-point deficit into an 89-87 lead on his jumper with 1:48 left. The Heat tied it twice from there, meaning the Kings lost two leads -- and then their star, too. ""We needed this one,"" Whiteside said. TIP-INS Kings: Cousins was suspended for both Kings-Heat games last season, the second of those for exceeding the league's 16 technicals-in-a-season limit. He picked up a tech Tuesday as well, already his third this season. ... The Kings shot 38 percent. Heat: Whiteside, who had an uncle succumb to prostate cancer on Monday and said playing Tuesday was difficult, is the second Heat player to start a season with four double-doubles. Rony Seikaly did it twice. ... The Heat are 4-2 on Spoelstra's birthday; he turned 46 on Tuesday. They have played on Nov. 1 in each of the last four years. DUNK DIFFICULTY Whiteside and Cousins had some dunk difficulties in the third quarter. Whiteside went up for a two-hander early in the quarter, only to get it blocked by Cousins and wind up on his backside. About a minute later, Cousins had an open look at a dunk of his own and got stuffed by the front of the rim. HASLEM DEBUTS Heat captain Udonis Haslem got his first playing time of the season -- and officially making this his 14th Heat season, the most anyone has spent with the franchise. Among current players, only Dirk Nowitzki (19 seasons, Dallas), Tony Parker (16 seasons, San Antonio) and Manu Ginobili (15 seasons, San Antonio) have been with only one team for longer.","400899499"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  The Detroit Pistons finally clamped down on defense, in plenty of time to secure their third straight win. Tobias Harris scored 25 points and Marcus Morris added 22 to lift the Pistons to a 102-89 victory over the New York Knicks on Tuesday night. Detroit closed the game with eight straight points, and the Knicks didn't score after Derrick Rose's bank shot with 5:40 remaining. ""I thought our offense in the first half was excellent,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""Defensively, I thought we finished the game real well."" The Pistons have won three in a row -- all by double digits -- since dropping their season opener. They held New York to 10 points in the fourth quarter. Carmelo Anthony scored 24 points for the Knicks, and Rose added 19. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 19 points for Detroit, and Andre Drummond had nine points and 13 rebounds. It's been an encouraging start for Detroit, which has been playing without injured point guard Reggie Jackson. The Pistons shot 55 percent from the field in a smoothly played first half, and Detroit was up 64-55 after two quarters. ""I have been very amazed about how we move the ball,"" Caldwell-Pope said. ""Everybody is getting equal shots. Nobody is being selfish. We are being a little too unselfish, but that's good."" The offenses bogged down in the second half, and the Knicks had chances to close the gap in the fourth quarter. Down 94-89, New York's Lance Thomas missed from the perimeter. Morris made two free throws at the other end with 3:22 remaining. A 3-pointer by Caldwell-Pope put the Pistons up by 10, and Harris added a three-point play with 1:11 left. ""It just didn't go down tonight,"" Rose said. ""When the shots aren't falling, we have to depend on our defense even more. We have to play the type of game where if we're having a hard time scoring, you're definitely going to have a hard time scoring. That's the mentality and culture we're trying to build."" TIP-INS Knicks: Joakim Noah had only two points, but he contributed eight assists and 11 rebounds. ... Former Detroit G Brandon Jennings scored 12 points for the Knicks. Pistons: Detroit outscored the Knicks 50-32 in the paint. ... Harris had 10 rebounds. ... Ish Smith, starting in place of Jackson (knee), had 10 points and eight assists. ... The Pistons went 8 of 13 from 3-point range. WEARING DOWN? Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said his team's stamina may have played a role in the offensive struggles late. ""We're not in the kind of condition that we need to be to play offense and defense for 48 minutes,"" Hornacek said. ""It looked like we did get a little tired and that's going to affect the shooting."" STICKY FINGERS The Knicks had only three turnovers in the first half, and the Pistons had only two. That was a big reason the game was so high-scoring early. New York finished with 12 turnovers and Detroit had 11. REPLACEMENTS Van Gundy wasn't totally buying the idea that the Pistons have had no problems without Jackson. Smith and Beno Udrih were a combined 8 of 23. ""I think anybody in the league would tell you that we're playing well, but Reggie's just a really difficult guy to guard in the pick-and-roll. So we miss him, and that's taking nothing away from Ish and Beno.""","400899500"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Jason Kidd wasn't going to discount the performance of his young Milwaukee Bucks squad simply because it came against the winless New Orleans Pelicans. When a coach sees six of his players score in double digits, three players grab 10 or more rebounds and five guys playing effective team defense in the clutch, on the road, it's hard to be critical. ""They all competed,"" Kidd said. ""We do not win if we don't play defense well. I thought we made plays. We made the stops."" Giannis Antetokounmpo capped a 24-point, 10-rebound performance with a pivotal 3-pointer with 1:34 to go, Jabari Parker added 21 points, and the Bucks defeated the Pelicans 117-113 on Tuesday night. ""We shared the ball,"" Kidd said. ""We got those open shots."" Anthony Davis scored 35 points -- the third time he has scored at least that many -- to go with 15 rebounds, three blocked shots and three steals. But once again, it was not enough for New Orleans, which has dropped its first four games, including three at home. ""We can't get a win. It's frustrating,"" Davis said. ""But whatever we need to do, we need to do it fast."" Milwaukee rookie Malcolm Brogdon had his best game yet, scoring 14 points -- 10 in the second half. Tony Snell had 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Bucks, while Rashad Vaughn scored 12 points and Matthew Dellavedova had 11 points and eight assists. ""Tonight was the first night that we really trusted our offense and executed what we practice,"" Brogdon said. ""We stuck to the game plan and played like a team all the way through."" The Bucks looked to pound the ball inside and the Pelicans offered little resistance. Milwaukee scored 58 points in the paint, compared to 38 for New Orleans -- which annoyed Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry. ""There's just no excuse for not talking defensively and we talked about the fact that when you play this team, they're going to drive the ball,"" Gentry said. ""They got half of their points in the paint. We've got to do a better job."" The Bucks also outrebounded the Pelicans 50-42. Tim Frazier had 20 points and nine assists for New Orleans, while Solomon Hill added 18 points and E'Twaun Moore had 17. Hill and Moore combined to shoot 6 of 10 from 3-point range. Rookie Buddy Hield, the NBA's sixth overall draft pick, scored 10 points, but was just 1 of 6 from 3-point range. ""We're not worried about the offensive part,"" Davis said. ""Defense is where we've got to become better and is starts with communication."" TIP-INS Bucks: New Orleans native Greg Monroe was productive off the bench for the Bucks, grabbing 11 rebounds to go with six points, six assists and a block in less than 18 minutes. ... G Jason Terry, who missed Milwaukee's previous two games because of a death in the family, was back with the team in New Orleans but did not play. Pelicans: After making five of their first seven 3-point attempts, the Pelicans missed nine straight before finishing 9 of 26 from long range. ... Davis continued to average nearly a point per minute on the court this season. He played 37 minutes against Milwaukee. BLOSSOMING ROOKIE Kidd praised the poise and production Brogdon brought to the Bucks in only his fourth regular season game. ""We trust Malcolm when he's on the floor,"" Kidd said. ""He's going to make some rookie mistakes, but no one panics -- he doesn't panic. He keeps playing and every time he's on the floor, he gets better."" Brogdon said coaches and teammates have helped his confidence through the faith they show in him. ""My team is always talking to me and it's just very helpful when you have people that believe in you and want you to do well."" MOMENTUM SWINGS The Pelicans led by as many as nine points early, but the Bucks took a 12-point lead in the third quarter when Antetokounmpo's layup made it 74-62. New Orleans responded with an 11-0 run that began with Moore's 3 and ended with Hill's 3, but the Bucks rebuilt a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter with a 13-4 run that included Brogdon's dunk and his 3-pointer. The Pelicans got as close as 114-112 on Davis' floater with 1:46 left, but Antetokounmpo hit his late 3 and New Orleans didn't recover.","400899501"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Timberwolves finally built a lead too big to lose. That their first victory of the season came against a weakened lineup mattered little after two stinging road losses to begin the year. Zach LaVine scored 31 points and hit five 3-pointers, and the Timberwolves led by as many as 40 points in a 116-80 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. Gorgui Dieng scored 17 points for the Timberwolves (1-2), who led by 17 points in the opener against Memphis and 18 against Sacramento before losing both games. ""More focus. Stop messing around,"" LaVine said of the difference. ""We know what we did the last two games. Don't let it happen again."" Memphis coach David Fizdale decided to rest Mike Conley and Marc Gasol on the front end of a back-to-back that finishes at home on Wednesday night against New Orleans. Tony Allen made his season debut for the Grizzlies after missing the first three games of the season with a right knee injury. Conley and Gasol are both coming off surgeries, so the Grizzlies are playing it safe in the middle of a four-game in five-night stretch. ""We just thought it was best that tonight, you know, we rested them and then you load up and you try to get a win at home tomorrow,"" Fizdale said. Memphis shot just 36.5 percent and turned the ball over 22 times. Rookie Kris Dunn had 10 points, six assists and five steals in his first career start after Ricky Rubio sprained his right elbow in their last game. Andrew Wiggins scored 17 points and Dieng shot 8 for 9 one day after signing a four-year, $64 million contract extension. ""When the ball moves and the spacing is good, we're going to score,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. Deyonta Davis led Memphis with 17 points. The Timberwolves shot 55 percent for the game, including 60 percent from 3-point range (12 for 20) against a Memphis team missing the grit and toughness that gave the Wolves so many problems on opening night. Zach Randolph played just 10 minutes after bullying the Wolves for 19 points and 11 boards in Game 1 and Vince Carter only played 15 minutes. ""I guess everything is a learning experience, but especially coming in here and being down at the margins that we had been, it doesn't make any sense even with Marc and Mike not playing,"" Grizzlies rookie Wade Baldwin said. ""Guys got to play better."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Allen had four points and four rebounds in 19 minutes. ... Memphis hit 11 of 24 3-point attempts to erase that big deficit in the season opener, but hit just 4 of 24 from long range on Tuesday night. Timberwolves: Karl-Anthony Towns had 11 points, 10 rebounds and four assists. ... With Dunn starting for Rubio, it gave the Wolves four players in the starting lineup age 22 or younger. That's the third time it has happened in franchise history. CARTER'S MILESTONES The 39-year-old Carter played in his 1,278th game, tying him with A.C. Green for 25th on the NBA's career list. He also surpassed 24,000 points with a runner in the lane in the third. He ranks 25th in league history for career scoring. ""I plan on using him all year in different ways,"" Fizdale said. JONES STEPS UP One of the intriguing subplots entering the game was who would be elevated to No. 2 point guard behind Dunn. Thibodeau kept four point guards on the roster, including second-year man Tyus Jones and veteran John Lucas III, who played for Thibodeau in Chicago. Jones got the nod on Tuesday night and delivered a crisp performance. The heady Minnesota native kept the ball moving with the second unit and helped the Wolves get rolling after a sluggish start by the first team. He finished with two points and six assists in 18 minutes.","400899502"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Utah point guard George Hill used the lessons he learned in three seasons with San Antonio to hand his former team a rare home loss. Hill had 22 points and the Jazz made a season-high 15 3-pointers, handing the Spurs their first loss of the season 106-91 on Tuesday night. ""He had a great game,"" San Antonio veteran Manu Ginobili said. ""For three quarters they played good solid basketball and in the fourth he just took over. Made some big shots, good plays off the pick-and-roll. He's a great player, we know he can do it."" Utah handed San Antonio only its second home loss since March 2015. The Spurs didn't lose their first home game last season until April 10 and finished 40-1 at the AT&amp;T Center. ""Every loss is disappointing to me,"" said Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard, who had a game-high 30 points. ""Just disappointed in our defensive effort. Our energy wasn't there in the first quarter. They were knocking down shots in the fourth quarter. They scored 33 in the fourth and that's not good either."" Hill made four straight baskets starting with about 6 minutes left in the fourth, scoring 10 points to give the Jazz a 96-88 lead with 4 minutes remaining. The Spurs rallied from an anemic first quarter to capture the lead, but Hill helped steady the young Jazz with a court presence he learned under San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich. ""Play like you've been there before,"" Hill said. ""Coach Pop always instilled that into me my first three years here. Don't show really that much emotion, unless it's part of the game, but act like you've been there before. That's what I try to instill in the guys, move onto the next play every time."" Utah needed that serenity after nearly blowing a dominant first quarter. ""We definitely allowed them to play too comfortable and get into a rhythm early on,"" San Antonio center Pau Gasol said. ""They were executing well, give them credit, but we didn't put enough pressure on their offense to force them to take tougher shots."" The Jazz built a 12-point lead in the opening quarter by shooting 72 percent from the field and 88 percent on 3s. Utah made seven 3-pointers in the first quarter, one more than their previous season high for a game. ""Some of it's just basketball gods,"" Jazz coach Snyder said. ""There are nights like that and then there are nights like tonight. The biggest thing for our guys is that they don't get discouraged when they miss and keep shooting."" Rodney Hood finished with 19 points, Trey Lyles 15 and Shelvin Mack 14 for Utah, which finished 15 for 31 from 3-point range. It didn't matter if the Spurs contested the shots or not, Utah's shots were falling in the first quarter. San Antonio didn't panic, sticking to their rotations and sets. The Spurs erased a 47-31 deficit, going on a 15-0 run over a 6-minute span. Leonard's 16-foot jumper pulled San Antonio within 47-46 and LaMarcus Aldridge's 18-footer tied the game at 48. Aldridge finished with 21 points on 8-for-16 shooting. But Lyles revived Utah's offense, scoring all but two points during a 10-0 run in the third quarter that gave the Jazz a 70-63 lead they would never relinquish. Lyles finished 2 for 7 on 3-pointers and Hood was 4 for 8. TIP-INS Jazz: Mack was 0 for 4 on 3-pointers this season before making his only two attempts against the Spurs. . F Boris Diaw missed his first game of the season, sitting out against his former team with a bruised right leg. Diaw, who played with San Antonio from 2012-2016, received a loud ovation when his image was shown on the video boards. Hill, who played three seasons in San Antonio, also received a loud ovation. ... Utah was winless in its two road games this season, losing by an average of 11 points. Spurs: San Antonio has a winning record in the regular season for all but 48 days since 1997. ... Jonathan Simmons made his first start of the season. Filling in for Danny Green, Simmons had two points in 29 minutes. Green is sidelined by a strained left quadriceps. ... Tony Parker is 73rd in league history with 1,084 games played, breaking a tie he had with Antawn Jamison and Dell Curry. FAVORS RETURNS Derrick Favors started for the first time this season after being limited due to a sore knee. Favors had six points and three rebounds in 16 minutes for the Jazz. He did not play in the second half as a precaution. ""He's on a minutes restriction,"" Snyder said. ""We're being smart with Fav and making sure that we bring him back the right way. I think he was ready to play. I think he got a little cold when we put him back in. He wasn't quite the same, but that's why we're doing what we're doing."" STILL A FAVORITE Hill remains one of Popovich's favorite players ever, even after he helped Utah hand San Antonio a double-digit loss. ""He played great, especially down the stretch,"" Popovich said. ""He was very controlled, ran the show, obviously made shots. He was great."" Hill made sure to hug Popovich after the game and let the veteran coach know how much he still means to him. ""Pop is one of the best people that came into my life,"" Hill said. ""I just asked him how his wife is doing, how he's doing and to tell him I love him.""","400899503"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Stephen Curry had just five points in the first half against the Portland Trail Blazers. He knew the second half was going to be different from his first shot. ""You see one go in and that's all you really need confidence-wise,"" he said. That first shot? It was a 3-pointer. Curry finished with 28 points, 23 in the third quarter alone, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Trail Blazers 127-104 on Tuesday night to extend their early season winning streak to three games. Ian Clark came off the bench with a career-high 22 points for the Warriors, who have rebounded after a season-opening loss to San Antonio. Kevin Durant added 20 points and Golden State rested its starters down the stretch after leading by as many as 35 points. Damian Lillard had 31 points for the Blazers, who fell in five games to the Warriors in the Western Conference semifinals last season. Playing the first of a back-to-back, Portland coach Terry Stotts also went to his reserves with eight minutes left. The Blazers beat the Warriors 137-105 in Portland last February, with Oakland native Lillard scoring a career-high 51 points against his hometown team. It was one of just nine losses for the Warriors. Lillard averaged 36.5 points against the Warriors last season. ""They played their game. In the first half, we were right there. In the second half, they stuck with it,"" Lillard said. ""Their defense was more consistent than ours, and their offense was more free than ours was. We needed to have more of a presence."" Lillard scored with 0.3 seconds left to give the Blazers a 115-113 win at Denver on Saturday. He finished with 37 points. Clark, who averaged fewer than 3.0 points in Golden State's first three games, scored 16 in the first half. Clark's 3-pointer midway through the second quarter extended Golden State's lead to 47-38. Clark hit his first 3-point attempt after going 1 for 7 from the perimeter in the Warriors' first three games. Lillard's 3-pointer pulled the Blazers within 55-51 but Golden State led 59-53 at the break. Lillard finished the first half with 22 points in just under 18 minutes. CJ McCollum, who finished with 16 points, made consecutive 3s to pull Portland within 76-69. Curry made a layup and a free throw to put the Warriors up 94-71 late in the third quarter as the game slipped out of reach for Portland. ""I've never seen anybody quite like him who can turn it on that quickly and turn a horrible game into a brilliant game,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""That's what makes Steph who he is."" Golden State was coming off a 106-100 victory over Phoenix on Sunday. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr was asked pregame if the team was in danger of looking past Portland to the Thunder and Durant's first game against his former team on Thursday. ""I don't know how you'd look past the Blazers,"" Kerr said. ... Durant scored 94 points in his first three games as a Warrior. Only Wilt Chamberlain had more, with 120 points in his first three games with the Philadelphia Warriors. Trail Blazers: The sellout crowd was enthusiastic, even giving Lillard a standing ovation for an early 3-pointer that put Portland up 14-7. ... Lillard has scored at least 25 points against the Warriors in seven straight games. QUOTABLE: ""I told him he looked like Riley Curry in the first half and Steph Curry in the second half,"" Kerr said about his postgame chat with Curry. For the record, Riley Curry is 4 years old. WHO IS THAT GUY?: Jake Layman came off the bench in the fourth quarter for the Blazers, essentially in garbage time, and scored 17 points in eight minutes, including five 3-pointers. He's the first Blazer ever to make five 3s in a debut, and finished one shy of the franchise record in a quarter. He had the most points for a first game with the Blazers since Lillard had 23 as a rookie in 2012. Layman was a second-round pick in last June's NBA draft out of Maryland. ""In the position I'm in, no matter when you go in you've got to play hard. That's what was going through my mind,"" Layman said. AND HOW ABOUT CLARK? In his third fourth year out of Belmont, Clark averaged 3.0 points and 7.9 minutes in 119 games with one start going into this season. He was 8 of 8 from the field against the Blazers, becoming the first Golden State reserve to hit at least eight field goals in a game without a miss since Chris Mullin in a game against Milwaukee in 1996. BEEN A LONG TIME: Durant extended his streak of games with at least 20 points to 68, which is the longest since Michael Jordan's 69-game streak in 1990-91, according to the Warriors.","400899504"
"WASHINGTON --  DeMar DeRozan wouldn't let a little ankle injury keep him from carrying the Toronto Raptors. DeRozan shook it off and scored 40 points, outdueling John Wall in a showcase of All-Star guards as the Raptors beat the winless Washington Wizards 113-103 on Wednesday night. Despite leaving the game briefly to get his ankles re-taped, DeRozan was 14 of 23 from the floor and cracked the 30-point mark for the fourth time in four games to start the season. ""He's playing on another level right now,"" said backcourt mate Kyle Lowry, who scored 18. ""He's making my life a lot easier and making I think everybody on our team's life a lot easier. He's saving possessions, he's creating possessions. He's creating offense."" DeRozan tied Mike James' 2005 franchise record with four consecutive 30-point games after previously dropping 40, 32 and 33 in games against Detroit, Cleveland and Denver. He said he didn't care about Sports Illustrated ranking him the 46th-best player in the NBA but tries to improve each night. ""I'm just a student of the game,"" DeRozan said. ""I just try and put everything together, be a student of the game while working, always feeling like I'm new to the game so I can soak up as much as possible. I try to release it once I get out there on the court."" DeRozan released enough that the Raptors (3-1) withstood a dominant performance from Wall, who scored 33 points in 13 of 19 shooting and dished out 11 assists. Otto Porter also shot 11 of 13 and had 23 points for the Wizards (0-3), who committed 21 turnovers that turned into 30 Toronto points. ""That's hard to overcome,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""There's a few things that we have to correct."" A CUT BELOW Lowry needed three stitches to close a cut below his right eye. Coach Dwane Casey knew DeRozan's ankle was OK but was concerned because he didn't know how bad Lowry's cut was. ""He bounced back,"" Casey said. ""He'd be probably a pretty good hockey player if that's the case. He came back. I thought that got his attention a little bit to say, `Hey this is for real tonight."" BENCH BOSSES When DeRozan and Lowry were out early in the second quarter, the Raptors climbed back into the game thanks to a big showing from reserves Terrence Ross, Patrick Patterson and Cory Joseph. Toronto's bench combined for 34 points to Washington's 11. ""They played great,"" DeRozan said. ""They got us the momentum back."" MUST-WIN? Center Marcin Gortat called this a ""must win"" for the Wizards at the morning shootaround, an ultimatum that didn't make much sense three games into a season. ""We're all right, we're fine, just three games,"" Wall said. ""I don't know why he said it's a must win. You want to win a home opener, yeah, but it's not a must win."" TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto has won eight consecutive regular-season meetings and 11 of the past 12. ... DeRozan tied Jose Calderon for the second-most games played in Raptors with his 525th. He's 18 away from tying Morris Peterson for first. Wizards: The Wizards fell to 0-3 for the fourth time in six seasons. ... Rookie Tomas Satoransky checked in late in the third quarter after playing just 6 minutes in the first two games. He finished with two points in just under 10 minutes.","400899505"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Nicolas Batum is learning that sometimes he needs to be a little more selfish on the court -- for the good of his team. The Hornets' $120 million man bounced back from a slow start to the season by scoring 17 of his 20 points in a pivotal third quarter to  help Charlotte overcome a seven-point halftime deficit and defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 109-93 on Wednesday night ""I've got to play for myself sometimes,"" Batum said. ""In the third quarter, I felt like I came out and stepped up my game."" Did he ever. Batum, who came into game shooting just 27 percent from the field and was limited to three points in the first half, was 6 of 8 in the third quarter with three 3-pointers as the Hornets outscored the 76ers 39-20.  Charlotte opened the second half on a 16-2 run and was never seriously challenged after that. The 76ers didn't help themselves with eight turnovers in the third quarter that led to 12 Charlotte points. ""Nicolas Batum is an elite player and made some very difficult shots,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We got jumped coming out of the locker room."" Batum said he was too passive in the first half and passed up too many shots. ""You could tell that he was going to come out and look for his shot more,"" Clifford said. ""You could tell from his body language that he was upset, in a good way, that he knew we had to play better and he was aggressive right from the start.  I didn't say anything to him."" Kemba Walker led Charlotte (3-1) with 22 points. Frank Kaminsky provided a huge boost off the bench, finishing with 14 points for his second-straight double-digit game since returning from a sprained foot. Cody Zeller added 13 points in his first game since receiving a $56 million contract extension earlier this week. TIP-INS 76ers: Jahlil Okafor was on a ""minutes restriction"" due to knee soreness and only played 23 minutes, scoring 12 points. ... Treveon Graham saw his first NBA action for the Hornets but played only one minute. ... Have lost six straight games to the Hornets. ... Committed 19 turnovers that led to 29 points.

The Hornets were 16 of 22 from the field in the third quarter. ILYASOVA TALKS TRADE Ersan Ilyasova, who was acquired in a trade Tuesday with the Oklahoma City Thunder, tied for a team-high 14 points on 5-of-12 shooting in his first game with the 76ers. While the 76ers have struggled in recent years, Ilysova believes there is talent to turn things around. ""We have to work together as a unit,"" said Ilysova, who joined the team on Tuesday. ""When you look at last year and the year before, those records stick with you. But winning is a habit and as soon as you start winning you feel more confident about yourselves."" Brown said he was impressed with Ilysova, saying, ""You can see why we were attracted to him.  I think he's going to be an excellent complement to what we have."" RIM PROTECTORS Brown said the 76ers are missing rim protection with Joel Embiid and Nerlens Noel still out. ""If you do get beat on the perimeter, there's an extra layer there behind that that has a chance to make a stop, to get a defensive play,"" Brown said. ""We've seen especially with Joel, him at the rim, how significant he can be. We haven't really seen Nerlens this year, but we have good memories from previous years.  Without those two, that's what you miss."" HALFTIME ADJUSTMENT Clifford said the Hornets went over the 76ers sets at halftime and talked about his team's one-on-one defense. ""We just got beat and we gave up a lot of penetration on pick-and-rolls and individual help plays.  In the second half, we did a lot better with that,"" Clifford said. The 76ers were limited to 40 points in the second half.","400899506"
"NEW YORK --  The Brooklyn Nets hit nearly all their shots at the start, and Trevor Booker made the stops at the end. Brook Lopez had 34 points and 11 rebounds, Sean Kilpatrick added 24 points, and the Nets beat the Pistons 109-101 on Wednesday night. ""We made some big plays down the stretch that really sealed the deal,"" Booker said. ""It was a tremendous game by everybody. Defensive plays by me, offense by Sean and Brook. It was a great team effort."" Brooklyn hit 16 of its 20 shots in the first quarter to take a 38-30 advantage. The Nets had more turnovers (5) than misses. Brooklyn's first miss came at the 6:03 mark in the first when Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was off on a 3-pointer. Lopez had 14 in the first quarter and 24 by the end of the first half to lead the Nets as Brooklyn took a 71-55 lead to the locker room. Detroit cut the lead to 11 heading into the fourth quarter and then as close as five with 1:34 remaining. Booker stole a rebound from Aaron Baynes with 1:20 remaining and then blocked a Caldwell-Pope layup on the break with 58 seconds remaining. After Bojan Bogdanovic then hit two free throws and Harris responded with a three with 38 seconds to go, Booker grabbed an offensive rebound with 16 seconds remaining before finding Lopez on the wing. Lopez was fouled and hit two free throws. ""Those plays are just so huge for us,"" Lopez said. ""He always brings that intensity and it's definitely contagious. If we can continue to play the way we did tonight as far as energy, effort and plays like that, 50-50 balls, we'll be alright."" Despite the win, it wasn't all good news for Brooklyn. Already think at point guard with Greivis Vasquez out, Jeremy Lin left the game with a strained left hamstring. ""No update yet,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""The doctor said he'll let me know. They're still evaluating, they'll evaluate him again tomorrow when he comes to the facility. We can have more for you then."" Tobias Harris and Marcus Morris each scored 23 points, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 15 points and Jon Leuer added 11 for the Pistons. ""We didn't guard anybody,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We came with no energy. We couldn't keep up with their pace. We couldn't guard them on pick and roll. Brooklyn played very well, moved the ball, shot the ball very well. They outplayed us for 48 minutes in every aspect of the game. Every game is a new game and we brought nothing to the table defensively tonight and we couldn't guard anybody, so of course it's disappointing."" TIP-INS Pistons: Van Gundy praised the addition of Ish Smith. ""We wanted a backup point guard who would push the pace a little bit more, really pick up the tempo of the game, which I knew he would do,"" he said. ""I had Ish for a short time in Orlando and also knew what kind of person he is and I thought he'd be a great team guy for us."" ... Reggie Bullock (back spasms) and Reggie Jackson (left knee rehab) were out. Nets: Lopez made multiple 3-pointers in a game for the first time in his career. ... Brooklyn's 38-point first quarter was the team's highest scoring quarter of the season. ... Randy Foye (mild strain, right hamstring), Greivis Vasquez (sore right ankle) and Caris LeVert (left foot rehab) were out. VAN GUNDY ON RESTING PLAYERS ""Look, I'm not one to do it,"" Van Gundy said. ""Our guys get paid to play 82 games. Everybody that's healthy will play for us every single night, but that's just us. Unfortunately, you've got to be willing to -- as a coach now -- you're going to get criticized for that. If you try to win every game, you get criticized for that now. You don't have a long-term vision and you're short sighted. That all may be true of me, but we're going to put our best guys out there every night and try to win. It's been a little surprising to me the guys being rested already. I mean are guys really worn down already? We're four games into the year and guys are resting their players. That part has been surprising to me. I know it's a league-wide trend as we get into the season, but I really didn't expect to see it the first week to be quite honest.""","400899507"
"NEW YORK --  James Harden and the Houston Rockets spent plenty of energy trying to knock off the champs. They had more than enough left a night later. Harden had 30 points and 15 assists, and Houston routed the New York Knicks 118-99 on Wednesday night. ""We're a special group and we're fairly new,"" Harden said, ""so the more we're going to continue to build and do things and play the right way no matter who we're playing, the better off we'll be."" The NBA's leader coming into the day with 11.8 assists per game, Harden toyed with the Knicks defense, setting up teammates for lobs or open 3-pointers as the Rockets easily bounced back from a 128-120 loss in Cleveland on Tuesday. Eric Gordon added 21 points for Houston, which has won seven straight at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks haven't defeated the Rockets at home since Jan. 26, 2009, so long ago that their coach was current Houston coach Mike D'Antoni. Harden also grabbed six rebounds, a night after he had 41 points and 15 assists. And the Rockets got a boost from their bench, particularly Montrezl Harrell, who had 17 points and 10 rebounds. ""Those guys helped us keep going and then James is James,"" D'Antoni said. ""He's really good and I think he can play every night."" Carmelo Anthony scored 21 points for the Knicks, who besides their poor defense also heard loud boos for their rebounding and turnovers in a dismal performance. ""If we don't start playing defense, we're going to keep getting smacked like this,"" guard Derrick Rose said. ""It comes with effort. It comes with everybody being on the same page."" The Knicks were also playing for the second straight night, but only they appeared to have tired legs. Houston quickly extended a 33-25 lead after one quarter into double digits and was ahead 68-51 at halftime. Gordon opened the third quarter with a 3-pointer to make it a 20-point game and Harden closed it with another 3 that sent the Rockets to the fourth quarter with a 100-78 lead. TIP-INS Rockets: C Nene sat out to rest on the second night of the Rockets' back-to-back. ... D'Antoni went 121-167 with the Knicks from 2008 until resigning in March 2012.

DEKKER HITS THE DECK Sam Dekker was headed for what would have been a breakaway basket when he stumbled and fell near the free throw line, the ball bouncing off the court, then off his face and out of bounds. Dekker went to the court again moments later after Kyle O'Quinn blocked his shot. HORNACEK IN HOUSTON? Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek, after being fired in Phoenix, interviewed for the Houston job last spring before the Rockets hired D'Antoni. With Harden in place and believing Ryan Anderson would sign there, Hornacek was interested. ""Obviously the pieces they've added have made them dynamic on the offensive end,"" Hornacek said. ""They're going to be hard to stop and so when you look around at jobs and they call you and want to talk, that was great."" CHICAGO IS HIS KIND OF TOWN Rose was hoping the World Series went to the Cubs, who had his son, 3-year-old Derrick Jr., throw out a first pitch earlier this season. On Friday, the Chicago native will be hoping to beat the Bulls in his first game against his former team. He expects a mixed reception from fans. ""I know I'm going to get some boos here and there but it's all part of the game, it's all part of the sport,"" he said. ""It's not going to affect the way I play or how badly I want to win that game.""","400899508"
"ATLANTA --  Lou Williams wasn't surprised he saved his best for the end. Williams scored 16 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter, and the Los Angeles Lakers rallied after trailing most of the game to beat the Atlanta Hawks 123-116 on Wednesday night. Williams, the Atlanta native who played for the Hawks from 2012-14, had a quiet game before his big final quarter. ""The fourth quarter is normally my best quarter of my career,"" Williams said. The Hawks led 60-51 at halftime. The Lakers, led by D'Angelo Russell's 23 points, dominated the second half. It was an impressive performance for a team playing the second straight night at the end of a four-game road trip. It was their first win of the trip. ""We're just learning,"" said Nick Young, who had 17 points. ""We've pretty much been in every game. It was bound to go our way one of these nights."" Dwight Howard had 31 points and 11 rebounds and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 26 points for Atlanta. A 3-pointer by Brandon Ingram early in the fourth quarter gave the Lakers a 99-98 lead -- their first since the opening period. A layup by Williams stretched the Lakers' lead to 107-100. A steal and basket by Atlanta's Dennis Schroder and a 3-pointer by Kyle Korver -- his first points of the game -- cut the lead to two. Williams beat the shot clock with a 3-pointer, and a jam by Larry Nance Jr. gave the Lakers a 118-112 lead. After Julius Randle blocked a shot by Schroder, Young's 3-pointer with 17.9 seconds remaining clinched the win. The Lakers outscored the Hawks 72-56 in the second half while excelling in the up-tempo pace the Hawks hope to embrace. When asked if the Hawks like the fast pace, Korver said ""We like to play defense, too."" Clearly, giving up 123 points didn't fit Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer's plan. ""You can't ever feel good if you give up that kind of offense in two consecutive quarters,"" Budenholzer said. TIP-INS Lakers: C Timofey Mozgov, who suffered a left eye contusion in Tuesday night's loss at Indiana, did not play. After results from a CT were inconclusive, Mozgov will have additional tests and will be examined by team doctors on Thursday when the team returns to Los Angeles. ... The Lakers shot 60.9 percent in the third quarter and 53.9 percent for the game. ... Luol Deng had 13 points and 10 rebounds. Hawks: Hardaway hit two 3-pointers in the last minute of the opening quarter, giving him 14 points with four 3-pointers for the period. ... Schroder had 11 points and six assists. ... Paul Millsap had four of the team's 18 turnovers. TECHNICAL ISSUES Technical problems with the scoreboard and shot clocks caused confusion in the third quarter. Hawks public address announcer Ryan Cameron had to announce the updated score following each basket for the final 3 minutes of the period. FACES IN THE CROWD Boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. had a front-row seat. Former Atlanta Falcons star receiver Roddy White also drew cheers when shown on the video board. ROOKIE DEBUT Lakers rookie Ivica Zubac, 19, of Croatia had six points in his NBA debut as the fill-in starter for Mozgov. Howard went straight at Zubac with a jam on Atlanta's first possession, but the young Zubac didn't back down. Zubac answered by making a hook shot over Howard and then scored again for the Lakers' second field goal. Zubac lasted only about five minutes before going to the bench with his third foul.","400899509"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  It took an extra five minutes for the Memphis Grizzlies and New Orleans Pelicans to finally figure out which team would finally play well enough to win. The Grizzlies outscored the Pelicans 14-8 in the overtime to eventually grab an 89-83 victory over the still-winless Pelicans on Wednesday night. ""Boy, that was ugly, but I'll take it,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. JaMychal Green scored 21 points and Mike Conley added 20 for the Grizzlies. James Ennis had 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Zach Randolph finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds, part of the Grizzlies outrebounding the Pelicans 52-43. Lance Stephenson led New Orleans with 21 points and six assists, while Langston Galloway and rookie Buddy Hield had 18 points each. Anthony Davis, the league's second-leading scorer, was limited to 10 points, connecting on only 3 of 13 shots as New Orleans lost its fifth straight. ""I think Lance really found his shot, and he let the game come to him,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said of Stephenson, who carried New Orleans in the first half. ""I think he shot the ball well."" The game was tied 75-75 at the end of regulation as Davis' last-second 26-footer banked off the backboard and then hit the rim before bouncing harmlessly away as the horn sounded. Green had tied the game for Memphis at 75 with 1:35 left on a 3-pointer. The game was sloppy with New Orleans committing 22 turnovers, while Memphis had 20. The Pelicans shot 37 percent from the field, and Memphis managed a mere 35 percent. Davis wasn't the only one who struggled from the field. Marc Gasol was 3 of 18, scoring only eight points for Memphis, but he connected on a 3-pointer in overtime that extended the Grizzlies' lead to 84-76. ""I think we gave them a run, but there were a couple of 50-50 balls that we just didn't come up with,"" Gentry said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Stephenson, who played in 26 games for the Grizzlies last season, received a mixed reaction when he entered the game in the first quarter. ... Davis entered the game averaging 37 points. He was limited to six points in the first half, taking only five shots. Grizzlies: G Tony Allen, who missed the first three games of the season with a sore right knee, got his first start. That meant the fourth different starting lineup in Memphis' first five games. ... With a hook shot inside late in the third quarter, Randolph passed Pau Gasol (3,324) as the all-time leader in Grizzlies field goals. HIELD'S IMPROVEMENT Hield, the sixth overall pick in last summer's draft, recorded his second straight game in double figures. He had 10 points in Tuesday's loss to Milwaukee. ""There were blankets of what I think we are going to be able to see,"" Gentry said. As for Hield, he said: ""Just staying confident in who I am. I know it's going to come around."" BENCH BOOST The Pelicans starters managed only 19 points, 10 from Davis. Part of that was Gentry getting strong play from his reserves early. Stephenson played just short of 45 minutes, Omer Asik recorded 35 minutes in grabbing 11 rebounds, while Galloway and Hield each played 30-plus minutes.","400899510"
"Isaiah Thomas hits a ridiculous reverse layup for two crucial Celtics points. (0:16) BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics played without new addition Al Horford for the first time this season on Wednesday night. Thanks to Isaiah Thomas and Amir Johnson, they didn't miss a beat. Thomas had 23 points and 10 assists, Johnson finished 23 points -- including a career-high four 3-pointers -- and the Boston Celtics handed the Chicago Bulls their first loss of the season, 107-100. Boston avenged its lone setback of the season despite being without Horford, who was placed in the concussion protocol Tuesday after exhibiting concussive symptoms during practice. Johnson was active from all over the court, scoring 16 points in the third quarter. The Bulls managed just 18 points in the period, their lowest scoring quarter of the season. ""I just made the first one and my confidence got a little higher,"" Johnson said of his 3-point performance. ""When I knocked down the fourth one, I don't even think I even saw the basket."" The Bulls cut into what had been a 16-point Boston lead in the fourth quarter and tied it at 100 on two free throws by Nikola Mirotic. But Boston regained the lead 101-100, then went up five on a driving layup by Thomas and a basket by Marcus Smart. Jimmy Butler led Chicago with 23 points and nine rebounds. Before Wednesday Johnson had never made more than two 3-pointers in a game and had never attempted more than four. He entered the night 0 for 1 on the season. Boston led by as many as 14 points in the first half, but took only a two-point lead into halftime. After a slow start, Jae Crowder scored eight straight points during a 21-4 Boston run. The Bulls stayed in it via a few mini spurts, including an 8-0 run by Butler. But Crowder will join Horford on the injured list after he left in the second quarter with a left ankle sprain. Coach Brad Stevens said he doesn't expect Crowder back ""any time soon."" ""It's a great opportunity for everybody else,"" Stevens said. ""We're early in the season, so everybody gets a chance to step up and make plays and compete. And we'll see. We'll try to figure it out."" TIP-INS Bulls: G Michael Carter-Williams (left knee bruise, left wrist sprain) and Doug McDermott both sat out. Coach Fred Hoiberg said McDermott felt good, but that he hadn't gone 24 hours without experiencing symptoms yet. Celtics: Tyler Zeller started in place of Horford. ... Stevens said Horford would also sit out Boston's game Thursday against the Cavaliers. A teammate inadvertently swiped Horford in the face with the ball during practice on Monday, but Horford didn't show any initial symptoms. But he experienced some nausea in practice on Tuesday and was pulled. QUOTABLE ""We fought our way back in the second quarter to get back in it. (Johnson) had a hell of a third quarter. I like the fight in this team. We gave ourselves a chance to win."" -- Dwyane Wade on the Bulls' second-half effort. NUMBERS GAME The Bulls outrebounded the Celtics 49-39 but they had 19 turnovers that led to 18 Boston points. BIG QUARTER The Celtics' 36 points in the first quarter were the most in a period for Boston this season. Its previous high was 33. WELCOME BACK MR. ROSE Hoiberg said he thinks former Bulls guard Derrick Rose to get a good reception when he returns to the United Center later this week. ""I think he should be received well,"" Hoiberg said. ""Derrick did a lot of good things for the city and for the franchise. I think he'll be received very well.""","400899511"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The offseason acquisition of George Hill was a clear upgrade at the point guard position for the Utah Jazz, but few expected this type of production from the nine-year veteran. Hill scored 25 points and the Jazz defeated the Dallas Mavericks 97-81 on Wednesday night. Hill continued to power the Jazz offensively after coming to the team in a three-way trade with the Pacers and Hawks last summer. He has scored 18-plus points in all five games, the only Jazz player to do so. ""Some of the things that he's doing, you were hopeful that he would do,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""But you're equally pleased that he's doing them. He's made big shots at crucial times. What I've seen is his willingness to (say), `Where do you need me? Do you need me to score? Do you need me to get a stop? Do you want me to lead?' ""The leadership component, to me, is probably the most unique. That's something our team is responding to."" The Mavericks trailed the entire game except for a 16-15 lead at the beginning of the second quarter. After shooting just 37.0 percent in the first quarter, the Jazz hit 49.2 percent the rest of the way. They were 12 for 25 from 3-point range. ""I'm just happy we're winning, I don't care about the numbers,"" Hill said. ""Just doing what it takes to try to win a game. I'm glad my teammates have confidence in me to control the tempo out there and try to make plays."" Rodney Hood scored 22 points and grabbed seven rebounds for the Jazz as teammate Rudy Gobert had 12 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks. Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 14 points, but they shot just 26.9 percent behind the arc. ""It's been a tough start for us,"" Mavs center Andrew Bogut said. ""No one is going to give us anything easy, so we got to dig ourselves out of this hole. ""We weren't in the game, really from the start. Whatever it was, we were kind of chasing our tails from the start. Our bench did a great job of getting us back in the game. Made a run. We just couldn't sustain it."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Dirk Nowitzki started after missing the last two games with an illness. He scored nine points on 4-for-14 shooting. ... Point guard Deron Williams, who was drafted by the Jazz No. 3 overall in 2005, was still booed five years after being traded away. Jazz: Derrick Favors matched a season-high with 23 minutes as he works his way back from a knee injury. ... Dante Exum matched a season-high 10 points off the bench. STICKING AROUND Gobert signed a lucrative multi-year extension Tuesday to keep from entering restricted free agency after the season. The 7-foot-1, 245-pound center averaged career-highs in points (9.1), rebounds (11.0) and blocks (2.2) last season and has developed into one of the top defenders in the league. Gobert said the extension puts both he and the team on the same page and reinforces their belief in him. He knows he has to produce, but said there isn't any extra pressure. ""As a human, it wasn't really impacting my game, but in my mind you think about it a little bit,"" Gobert said. ""Now that it's done I'm focused on basketball and the team."" MORE OFFENSE The Mavericks entered the game ranked No. 15 in the league averaging 103.7 points per game. Coach Rick Carlisle is looking for more on that end of the court, but didn't get it Wednesday. ""We want to move the ball,"" Carlisle said. ""We want to get it in the paint as much as possible. We've had some tough luck with shot-making, but that will come.""","400899512"
"PHOENIX --  In need of a go-to guy at the end of a tight game, the Phoenix Suns turned to Eric Bledsoe, and the veteran guard delivered. Both times. Bledsoe dropped in a rainbow 3-pointer at the overtime buzzer, giving the Suns a 118-115 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. He had also scored a go-ahead basket with 1.1 seconds left in regulation. Bledsoe finished with 20 points, his only 3 of the night being the game-winner. The shot, made over the outstretched arms of Blazers star guard Damian Lillard, gave the Suns their first win of the season. ""I wanted the ball,"" Bledsoe said. ""I was just going to get whatever they gave me. The shot was there, I took the shot and just took it with confidence, and you live with the results."" The Suns, who made 6 of 10 shots and both free throws in overtime, got 27 points from T.J. Warren and 18 from Alex Len while center Tyson Chandler had 18 rebounds. Phoenix outscored Portland 62-38 in the paint. The Blazers played the second of back-to-back games after a home loss to Golden State on Tuesday. The Suns went ahead by six points with 38.5 seconds left in overtime, but the Blazers tied it at 115 when Lillard scored and was fouled with 6.4 seconds. Lillard's 27 points led the Blazers, with C.J. McCollum adding 24. ""We played good defense, he just made a tough shot,"" Lillard said. ""I don't know what Bledsoe shot from the field (7 of 20) but I'll take that shot every day of the week,"" McCollum said. Bledsoe's layup with 1.1 seconds left in regulation gave the Suns a 103-101 lead, but after a timeout, Mason Plumlee inbounded to Meyers Leonard for a layup at the buzzer to send the game to overtime. ""To be in two overtime games (this season) against playoff teams, there's no better experience for such a young group,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""Today was the first time I really felt like we actually became a family."" The Blazers took a 90-83 lead midway through the fourth quarter, but the Suns came back to take a 93-92 lead on Warren's running bank shot with 2:47 to play. Suns guard Devin Booker, who missed Monday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers with a toe injury, returned to the starting lineup and finished with 15 points on 6-of-15 shooting. Portland led for much of the second quarter and went ahead 50-43 on Maurice Harkless' 3-pointer with 4:07 left. The Suns responded by going on a 10-0 run capped off by Bledsoe's layup and free throw and led 57-53 at halftime. The Suns took a 76-73 lead into the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Blazers: C Festus Ezeli remains out with a left knee injury. ... No Blazer saw more time on the court than Lillard's 40 minutes. Suns: The Suns had been one of the most turnover-prone teams in the NBA, averaging 16 per game entering Wednesday. They committed only 12 against the Blazers. KNIGHT FLIER The play that energized the Suns' comeback late in regulation time was Brandon Knight's one-handed throwdown over Turner with 5:41 left in the fourth. It brought the Suns' bench and the crowd to its feet. ""That was a huge play,"" Len said. ""He's just getting healthy ... so now you can see when we get him back, he has athleticism, his bounce back."" `DAME' TIME Lillard is the first NBA player to score 27 or more points in each of his team's first five games since Kobe Bryant did so with the Lakers at the outset of the 2005-06 season. Lillard's 163 points in the season's first five games are the most ever by a Blazer to start a season. FOCUS ON DEFENSE Watson believes the Suns can be a top defensive team in the NBA at some point this season. He said analytics showed they were 13th in the league in points allowed per 100 possessions before Monday's games. ""We know we're going to get better. We understand we just played three of the top four teams in the NBA (Oklahoma City, Golden State, Clippers) so the sample size is too soon to judge,"" Watson said before Wednesday's game. ""We believe we can end up top seven easily."" CULTURAL CELEBRATION The Suns celebrated Day of the Dead, a traditional Mexican holiday, to honor their Latino fan base Wednesday night. They wore their purple ""Los Suns"" jerseys, a group of mariachis played the national anthem and fans received ""calavera,"" or skull head, bobbleheads.","400899513"
"LOS ANGELES -- Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder could have been excused for looking ahead to a momentous visit to Golden State and a reunion with Kevin Durant looming Thursday night. Instead, Westbrook added another gutsy performance to his incredible start to his first season as the main man. Westbrook hit a jumper with 18.7 seconds left to finish with 35 points, and the Thunder remained unbeaten with an 85-83 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night. Westbrook added six rebounds and five assists for the Thunder, who surged in the final minutes of a tight meeting between Western Conference contenders. Although he wasn't near a triple-double for the first time this season, the ferocious point guard carried the Thunder down the stretch, scoring their final six points and making a key hustle play in the last minute. ""That's the only way I know how to get it,"" Westbrook said. ""Nothing was ever given to me growing up, and I always had to find ways to get it. ... I play every game like it's my last. I play every game the same, always, like I've been saying for years. Regardless of who we play, I'm going to play the same way."" Westbrook had triple-doubles in the Thunder's last two games, and was one assist shy of another in their opener. He mostly concentrated on scoring in his hometown, delivering a spectacular dunk in the third quarter while going 14 for 30 in 31 minutes. ""He's been great,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""Just being around him and seeing his commitment to his teammates, his leadership and his competitive fire rubbing off on his teammates, it's been great to watch. What he's doing statistically is amazing, but as a coach, I've been impressed with his leadership."" Chris Paul had 15 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists for the Clippers, who hit just one shot in a 5 1/2-minute span late in the fourth quarter. Blake Griffin scored 10 of his 14 points in the third quarter, but none in the fourth. ""The most frustrating part for me (is) the turnovers especially,"" said Paul, who made three of his five turnovers in the fourth quarter. ""My job is to orchestrate the offense, and I had some terrible turnovers down the stretch."" TIP-INS Thunder: Alex Abrines only played the final 12.3 seconds of the first half, but he hit a 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left to stake OKC to a 49-41 lead. ... Victor Oladipo's nine points were the second-most by an Oklahoma City player. Clippers: LA's early-season struggles from the 3-point line continued in the first half when the Clippers went 3 for 14, including 1 for 7 by the starters. ... Marreese Speights had 14 points. BIG FINISH Westbrook's layup put the Thunder up 81-78 with 2:17 left, and he converted Jamal Crawford's turnover into a dunk 66 seconds later. J.J. Redick hit a 3-pointer to trim Oklahoma City's lead to two points, but Westbrook hit a 17-footer to essentially seal it. RUSS BALL Westbrook averaged 38.7 points, 12.3 rebounds and 11.7 assists in a spectacular three-game start to the Thunder's post-Durant season. He became the first player since Magic Johnson in 1982 to start a season with triple-doubles in two of the first three games Westbrook's numbers were down against the Clippers in a defense-minded game featuring poor shooting by both sides. He had 16 points, four assists and two rebounds in the first half. NEW GUY Jerami Grant made his Thunder debut one day after they acquired him from Philadelphia in a trade for Ersan Ilyasova and a protected draft pick. The third-year forward from Syracuse came off the bench in the second quarter and eventually finished with six points in 18 minutes.","400899514"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  So much has been made about the process in this first season of the Orlando Magic under Frank Vogel. There are just no shortcuts in the climb toward respectability for the Magic. And after slow starts in their first four games, Orlando put together its most complete game this season in a 102-94 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Thursday night. Led by Evan Fournier's 29 points on 10-of-15 shooting, the Magic were effective on offense and held DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay in check during the second half to come up with their second straight win. ""It was better tonight obviously,"" Fournier said. ""We were pretty good defensively. The last four games we started the game super flat and had a 10-point deficit by the first quarter."" The Magic never trailed Sacramento by more than eight points. Orlando brought the offensive pressure for a change by building its lead to 13 points with Aaron Gordon, Serge Ibaka and Jeff Green all hitting timely shots. ""There are no guarantees early in the season but these guys are working to gel to come together as a group on the court and to try to do what I am asking them to do,"" said Vogel, whose team improved to 2-3. ""That takes a little time, it's a process."" Late in the second quarter, Vogel turned to his bench of veterans that includes Green, D.J. Augustin, C.J. Watson and Bismack Biyombo to reclaim the lead for good. Bismack was a force with his interior defense, blocking two shots and changing several others, while Augustin and Green both came up with big baskets to give the team a spark. But as big as the baskets were, the Magic's defense was even bigger in the second half. Cousins seemed unstoppable in the first half with Ibaka guarding him, but in the fourth quarter Vogel put Nikola Vucevic on Cousins to limit his effectiveness in the paint. Cousins finished with 33 points but only managed eight in the critical fourth quarter once Vucevic was switched on him. Gordon was also huge against the more physical Gay in the second half. Gay only had four points in the second half. ""This is one of the few complete performances that I've seen being with the Orlando Magic so that is very inspiring and reassuring that this team can be great,"" said Gordon, who had 13 points and 10 rebounds. Sacramento coach Dave Joerger liked the fight in his team, but felt the continued issues with turnovers was the determining factor. The Kings (2-4) committed 14 turnovers after coming in averaging 15 per game. ""They just got too many second chances with our turnovers and too many second chances on the offensive glass,"" said Joerger, whose team lost its third straight to start a five-game trip. ""That's the story of the game."" TIP-INS Kings: The Kings signed veteran free agent G Jordan Farmar to a contract on Tuesday in hopes of adding some flexibility to the backcourt. ...The NBA announced Wednesday that F Matt Barnes has been fined $15,000 for directing inappropriate language at game officials during the Kings' 108-96 overtime loss at Miami on Tuesday. Magic: The Magic have made at least one 3-pointer in 743 consecutive games dating to March 17, 2007. It's the fifth-longest streak in the NBA. WORKING LATE Realizing that he needed to work on his free throw shooting, Bismack said he came up to Amway Center by himself late Wednesday night to put up some extra shots. ""I always try to do that every other day, just listening to the sound of the ball and doing my game preparation,"" he said. ""I just love doing that. I enjoy the environment of the gym by myself and sometimes I talk to myself.""","400899515"
"MILWAUKEE --  Milwaukee Bucks head coach Jason Kidd needed plenty of superlatives to describe Thursday night's victory. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker had 27 points each to lead the Bucks past the Indiana Pacers 125-107. ""You could see right off the bat they were ready,"" Kidd said of the dynamic duo. ""They took good shots. They shared the ball. If they had an open shot, they took it. If not, they got off of it. They made good, quick decisions. When you do that, you're going to score a lot of points."" Kidd has turned the offense over to Antetokounmpo, and the 6-foot-11, 222-pound guard has responded. He had nine assists and seven rebounds and his running mate, Parker, made a career-high four 3-pointers and grabbed eight rebounds. Kidd also got production out of Greg Monroe, who added 16 points, 16 rebounds and six assists, and Tony Snell, the newcomer acquired from the Chicago Bulls for Michael Carter-Williams, had 14 points, including a 3 at the buzzer that gave Milwaukee a 63-57 lead at halftime. ""Everybody was great,"" Kidd said. ""Everybody who participated did their job and stayed in character. It was a great team win against a talented, well-coached team."" Paul George scored 23 points, reserve C.J. Miles added 19, Jeff Teague had 16 and Myles Turner 15, but it wasn't enough as the Pacers slipped to 0-3 on the road. When Parker hit from in close and then from beyond the arc to open the fourth quarter, it looked like the Bucks would coast to their third win of the season. Indiana had other ideas and closed with a flurry led by George who hit a 3-pointer with 9:28 to go, cutting the deficit to 95-82. When Turner made two free throws and Thaddeus Young hit a basket, the Bucks' lead was nine. After a steal by Monta Ellis who dished to George for another basket, the Pacers trailed by seven with 4:11 to play, but that was as close as they got. Snell hit a 3-pointer, Miles Plumlee dunked and Antetokounmpo scored in traffic to push the lead to 14 points and the Bucks regained control of the game. George was not happy with the outcome, despite coming close down the stretch. ""I'm real frustrated,"" he said. ""I know how good we could be. I know how good we were. We're nowhere close to it. It's embarrassing the way we're playing and we look on the floor right now."" Miles agreed with his teammate's assessment. ""We're not tied together, man,"" he said. ""You can see it. You can see it. We're not showing no spirit, no heart. You don't see guys getting excited about anything."" Parker sparked the Bucks with nine points as Milwaukee opened the third quarter with some energy, attacked the boards on both ends and pulled away to a 74-61 lead. Parker hit a 3, two driving dunks and a putback before George stopped the surge with a wide-open 3-pointer with 7:03 left in the quarter. But the Bucks were off and running again, building the lead to as many as 17. ""You look at what Jabari did tonight, catch-and-shoot, making plays for his teammates,"" Kidd said. ""He scored. He made the extra pass. That's his game. He's the total package."" Malcom Brogdon, the Bucks' second-round draft pick from Virginia, scored 12 points, including two free throws that pushed the margin to 90-73 with seconds left in the third. TIP-INS Pacers: G Rodney Stuckey missed his third consecutive game with a right hamstring strain. ... The Pacers took three of four from the Bucks last season. Indiana's 37-point win on Nov. 21 was the Pacers' largest win and Milwaukee's largest loss in 2015-16.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  As Minnesota Timberwolves forward Nemanja Bjelica let a 3-pointer fly at the buzzer, Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone was already preparing for overtime. ""After the last couple games, it's kind of like here we go again,"" Malone said. ""To see it actually in and out was kind of nice for us to get a favorable bounce."" Wilson Chandler scored eight of his 19 points in the fourth quarter and Bjelica's 3 rattled out to help the Nuggets outlast the Timberwolves in a 102-99 victory. Danilo Gallinari scored 19 points and Jusuf Nurkic added 18 as Denver erased a 15-point deficit in the first half. The Nuggets outscored Minnesota 45-23 off the bench and shot 48 percent for their second win of the season. Karl-Anthony Towns had 32 points and 14 rebounds and Andrew Wiggins scored 25 for the Timberwolves, who gave away a lead of at least 15 points for the third time in four games this season. Bjelica scored 10 of his 14 points in the fourth quarter. ""It's like we have half of the puzzle done and we don't finish the puzzle,"" Towns said. Denver led by 13 with eight minutes to play, but Bjelica's scoring flurry helped the Wolves pull within 102-99 with 90 seconds to go. Emmanuel Mudiay responded with a three-point play and the Wolves missed three 3-pointers that would have tied the game in the final 30 seconds to help the Nuggets hold on. Jameer Nelson had 14 points, seven rebounds and seven assists and Mudiay finished with 12 points and six rebounds. ""It was a sloppy game,"" said Mudiay, who had six of Denver's 22 turnovers. ""It was a bad game for us personally but we picked it up and we did what we had to do."" Minnesota led by 17 in the season opener against Memphis and 18 at Sacramento, but lost both games. Denver outscored Minnesota 33-14 in the third quarter to surge to a 13-point lead, with Nurkic bulling his way to the paint and Gallinari knocking down 3s from the perimeter. But the Nuggets have been just as shaky with the lead in this young season, including letting an eight-point lead slip away against Portland in the final 90 seconds before losing in overtime. ""The third quarter is haunting us right now,"" Wiggins said. TIP-INS Nuggets: G Will Barton missed the game with a sprained left ankle and backup G Gary Harris was out with a strained right groin. ... Rookie Jamal Murray started for Barton. ... F Darrell Arthur made his season debut after sitting out the first three games and the preseason while recovering from surgery on his left knee. He had two points in nine minutes. ...

Gorgui Dieng had a rough night with two points in 28 minutes and picking up a Flagrant-1 when he hit Nurkic in the throat in the third quarter. PINCKNEY BOWL A mini-drama broke out between the Nuggets and Timberwolves this summer. Assistant coach Ed Pinckney was on Michael Malone's staff in Denver last season, but has a long history of working with Tom Thibodeau, who took over in Minnesota. At one point the Nuggets offered Pinckney a bump in pay to stay on, but after initially agreeing, Pinckney ultimately decided he wanted to leave for Minnesota. Pinckney's change of heart didn't sit well with the Nuggets, who dug their heels in. The two teams went back and forth for a month. The NBA ultimately got involved and Pinckney did not officially join the Wolves until after training camp started, getting a sizable raise from what he was making in Denver.","400899517"
"CLEVELAND --  LeBron James approached another milestone and the Cleveland Cavaliers remained unbeaten. Just another day of work for the reigning NBA champions in their 128-122 victory over the Boston Celtics on Thursday night. James scored a season-high 30 points and moved within two points of passing Hakeem Olajuwon for 10th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. ""It's always humbling when you're able to put yourself in any category with guys that laid the path for you and the rest of us,"" James said. Olajuwon had 26,946 points, a total James will likely surpass Saturday night in Philadelphia. ""He'll get it, hopefully he'll score two points,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said with a laugh. The Cavaliers are 5-0 for the first time since 1976-77 when they started 8-0. Kevin Love scored 26 points, also a season high, while Kyrie Irving added 23 for the Cavaliers. Tristan Thompson recorded a double-double in the first half, finishing with 15 points and 14 rebounds. Isaiah Thomas scored 30 points and Avery Bradley had 26 for the Celtics, who played without two starters, center Al Horford (concussion) and forward Jae Crowder (sprained left ankle). James, who was 12 of 22 from the field, scored 20 points in the third quarter after having six at halftime. He also had 12 assists and seven rebounds, and brought the crowd to its feet in the third quarter with a fast break drunk after Irving passed the ball off the backboard. Asked what the other Cavaliers' players do when James gets on a roll, Irving said, ""Just get out of his way. He's capable of doing it on any given night. We've seen it for Lord knows, how many years?"" The Celtics played the Cavaliers evenly for most of the first quarter, but Cleveland's ball movement led to a flurry of open shots. The Cavaliers made 11 of 18 3-point attempts in the first half. ""I thought our defense in the first half was porous,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""There's no excuse for that."" Cleveland also matched the best start for a team James has played on since the Miami Heat were 5-0 in 2011-12 when they swept Oklahoma City in the Finals. Thomas didn't miss a free throw in 14 attempts. Jaylen Brown, making his first career start, scored 19 points while Marcus Smart added 14 for Boston. ""We played a game we felt like we could've won,"" Thomas said. ""We didn't play that well and only lost by six."" TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens said Horford is feeling better but has no timetable for his return. ... Crowder is expected to miss two weeks after being injured in Wednesday's win over Chicago. Cavaliers: Love was 12 of 13 at the free throw line. ... Cleveland didn't commit a first-quarter turnover. ... G. J.R. Smith crashed to the court after running into a screen from F Jonas Jerebko, but was still called for the foul. HIGH STAKES James will wear a Cubs uniform when the Cavaliers play in Chicago on Dec. 2, per terms of his bet on with Dwyane Wade on the World Series. Wade would have worn an Indians jersey had they won the series, which ended with an epic Game 7 at Progressive Field on Wednesday night. ""Obviously to get all the way there and not be able to come out victorious, it hurts,"" said James, who attended Game 7. ""You can't say they didn't give it their all. They gave a great shot."" The series also caused some debate between Stevens, a Cubs fan, and his wife, Tracy, who is from Rocky River, a Cleveland suburb. Adding to the tension, the Celtics' flight from Boston to Cleveland on Wednesday night lost its internet connection in the bottom of the 10th inning. The Cavaliers gave a video tribute to the Indians on the scoreboard during the first timeout.","400899518"
"Russell Westbrook won't say much about Kevin Durant when asked about him after the loss to the Warriors, calls out Golden State's trash talk and makes note there are more games to be played between the two teams this season. (1:05) OAKLAND, Calif. -- Maybe being dunked on and stared down did it. Kevin Durant found some extra fire after Jerami Grant slammed one home right over him and his old teammates started talking. Durant matched his career high with seven 3-pointers and scored 39 points, coolly knocking down long jumpers while thoroughly embarrassing Russell Westbrook and the rest of his old Oklahoma City teammates in Golden State's 122-96 rout of the Thunder on Thursday night. ""When you get dunked on like that, as a competitor out there you want to come back and try to make a play and try to ignite your team,"" Durant said. ""He ignited his team with that dunk. I was just trying to do the same throughout the whole game."" This rematch of the Western Conference finals won by the Warriors in seven games quickly turned into the KD show at sold-out Oracle Arena, where OKC (4-1) took its first loss to leave LeBron James and the champion Cavaliers as the NBA's lone unbeaten team. So much for this one being just like any other game for Durant. Even he knew it would certainly mean more once the ball was tipped, a matchup circled on calendars everywhere from the moment he left the Thunder as a free agent and joined the Warriors in July. ""As soon as the game started it brought back some memories, but after that it was back to business,"" Durant said. Westbrook was held to 20 points after coming in as the league's leading scorer at 37.8 per game. Stephen Curry added 21 points and seven assists, while Klay Thompson emerged from his 3-point funk to make four from long range on the way to 18 points in the Warriors' fourth straight win. But this one was all about Durant on a night when No. 35 and his new teammates redeemed themselves after a 129-100 flop in their season opener Oct. 25 against San Antonio that sent fans for the exits with more than 5 minutes left. When KD sat down for good with 6:41 to play, he received a rousing ovation and fans began chanting ""K-D!"" Durant dunked to end the third quarter and pumped his arms and shook his head. He repeatedly pointed to the roof and roared in celebration to punctuate big plays -- and, wow, did he have his share of them in this first, fabulous, hyped-up reunion with his former OKC boys. Consecutive 3s before the half, baskets off rebounds, altering shots with that superior wingspan, KD flat out did it all. He shot 15 for 24, including 7 of 11 from deep, in his third 30-point performance, and had seven rebounds and a block. Westbrook had put up triple-doubles in two of his previous three games, with a 35-point outing in Wednesday's win at the Clippers. But he didn't have it the very next night, going 4 for 15 with 10 points coming on free throws to go with 10 assists and six rebounds. ""The Warriors are doing a lot of trash talking,"" Westbrook said. ""Apparently I guess they talk a lot of trash now, but we'll see how that goes."" Victor Oladipo led Oklahoma City with 21 points.

"WASHINGTON --  With John Wall sitting out the second game of a back-to-back on Saturday night, part of an effort to ease the All-Star point guard's return from offseason surgery on each knee, the Washington Wizards will be counting on Bradley Beal to lead them. Beal just wants to make sure he doesn't try to do too much in Wall's absence. What the Wizards and Beal would love to see is the same sort of go-to-the-basket style he displayed while scoring 20 of his 28 points after halftime Friday night, helping Washington give new coach Scott Brooks his first victory with the team, 95-92 over the Atlanta Hawks. The key Saturday at the Orlando Magic, Beal said, will be for him to ""not feel like I've got to take over and do everything."" Beal averaged only 14 points during Washington's 0-3 start, never getting more than 15, and Brooks said before facing Atlanta he considered that his fault for not giving his young shooting guard enough opportunities. ""He's going to have a breakout game sooner or later,"" Brooks said, nearly 2 hours before tipoff. ""Hopefully it's tonight."" How prescient. Before an announced crowd of only 14,663 -- nearly 5,000 fewer people than were at Wednesday's home opener against Toronto -- Beal made 13 of 14 free throws. ""He was attacking,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""He's such a great shooter that you have to take that away. He may have just been more aggressive at getting to the rim."" Atlanta cut the deficit to 95-92 and inbounded the ball after a timeout with 11.7 seconds left, but Kyle Korver missed a 3-point try with 3.6 seconds left with Markieff Morris in his face. Wall had 21 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, now just four assists shy of breaking Hall of Fame center Wes Unseld's franchise career mark. But that will have to wait until at least Monday, when Washington hosts the Houston Rockets. ""Part of his rehab plan was to be real cognizant of his minutes,"" Brooks said. ""He might not play in the first few"" second games of back-to-back nights, the coach added, explaining: ""That's all fluid."" Brooks deflected a question about whether rookie Tomas Satoransky would start Saturday in Wall's place, but did say, ""There's a good chance."" Wall said he'll spend his day off doing some of the same rehab work he did during the offseason and joked about the game at Orlando: ""I might be the head coach."" ""It's just something I have to do if I want to play a long career in this league,"" Wall said. ""Coach believes in me and my teammates understand what I have to go through. When I'm out there, I'm going to give 110 percent effort."" TIP-INS Hawks: Korver finished 1 for 9 from the field, including 1 for 6 on 3s. ... Atlanta has at least 10 steals in every game this season. Wizards: Wall's streak of 16 consecutive games with at least 10 assists, dating to last season, ended.

""There will be times where the ball feels like soap,"" Paul Millsap said. ""There will be times when there's a lid on the basket."" WHAT'S IN RESERVE? Atlanta's reserves outscored Washington's 33-8.

"TORONTO --  DeMar DeRozan is showing no signs of slowing down. The Toronto Raptors star has surged to the top of the NBA scoring charts, averaging 35.8 points after dropping 34 on the Miami Heat in a 96-87 victory Friday night. It was his fifth straight game with at least 30 points for DeRozan, passing Mike James for the longest such streak in franchise history and the best such start to a season since Michael Jordan did it for six straight games to open the 1986-87 season. DeRozan was not about to dwell on his place alongside such distinguished company. ""Yeah, I heard,"" he said. ""I don't believe it."" What he could believe was the four turnovers he had in the first quarter, part of the six the team committed as it fell behind by 12 points at one point. DeRozan admitted he was passing too much at that point, something that he quickly adjusted in helping his team rally back from a double-digit deficit for the second straight game. ""A couple shots I passed up,"" he said. "". (Coach Dwane Casey) just said to me to go out and shoot it."" Toronto's win was helped greatly by the play of its reserves, which combined for a season-high 36 points as the Raptors beat the Heat for the fourth straight time in the regular season. This was the first meeting between the teams since Toronto beat Miami in the Eastern Conference semifinals last season. Terrence Ross had 20 points off the bench, and his play epitomized Toronto's comeback. ""We always go 15 deep and we really have a full team,"" said Kyle Lowry, who had 13 points. ""One day it's one guy's time and the next day it might be another guy's."" The Heat looked to be back in the game after reducing a 16-point deficit to just three over the last 4 minutes of the third quarter. But Toronto opened the final quarter with a 7-0 run and Miami never got closer than five points the rest of the way. ""That third quarter was good for us but in the fourth we were not focused enough, we made too many mistakes offensively and defensively and they took advantage of that,"" said Goren Dragic, who had 17 points. Center Hassan Whiteside led the Heat with 21 points and 16 rebounds. The Raptors held the Heat to 38.6 percent shooting from the field in the game, the fourth game out of five that Toronto has held its opponent below 42 percent. Miami was unable to say the same, particularly about DeRozan, who went 14 of 26 from the field. ""We tried to give him different looks,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We really wanted to try and take it out of his hands a couple of times but we weren't able to do it. He's a heck of a player."" TIP-INS Heat: G Wayne Ellington (quadriceps) missed his fifth straight game to open the season. ... Whiteside recorded his fifth straight double-double, a franchise record streak to open the season. Rony Seikaly had four straight to open the season in 1990-91 and 1991-92. ... Whiteside registered a block for the 34th straight game, extending his career-long streak and putting him just one behind Alonzo Mourning for the third-longest streak in team history, set in 2006-07. Raptors: DeRozan broke a tie with former teammate Jose Calderon for the second-most games played in franchise history, playing his 525th game in a Raptors uniform. ... Raptors 905, Toronto's NBA Development League affiliate, announced three additions to head coach Jerry Stackhouse's staff on Friday night. Former Tennessee coach Donnie Tyndall will serve as an assistant coach; Nicki Gross, the only female coach in the D-League, was appointed player development coach; and John Corbacio was promoted to video-coordinator/player development coach. FINDING MOTIVATION While DeRozan was discussing his latest 30-point game with reporters, center Jonas Valanciunas chimed in. ""Still 46th, man,"" he said jokingly in reference to Sports Illustrated ranking DeRozan as the 46th best player in the NBA in its preseason issue. ""But No. 1 in our hearts."" THE CENTURION Former Raptor James Johnson made the most of his return to the city he has called home twice in his NBA career by registering his 100th career 3-point field goal with 1:58 to play in the third quarter. He finished with 11 points on 4-of-8 shooting and two assists, the first of which was the 600th of his career. BACK IN BUSINESS After partially tearing the MCL in his right knee eight weeks ago, Heat guard Josh Richardson made his season debut with 3:50 remaining in the first quarter. He had no points on 0-for-4 shooting in 11:36 minutes.","400899521"
"NEW YORK --  Kemba Walker lost his backup and a few other key players from the best team he's played on in the NBA. Instead of taking a step back, his Hornets are off to their best start in 16 years. Walker scored a season-high 30 points and Charlotte improved to 4-1 for the first time since 2000 by beating the Brooklyn Nets 99-95 on Friday night. ""It's pretty early but I like the team that we can become,"" coach Steve Clifford said. Nicolas Batum added 18 points and nine rebounds, while Marvin Williams, who missed his first 10 shots, made a 3-pointer with 1:05 left after the Nets had cut the lead to one point. Reserve Sean Kilpatrick scored 19 points for the Nets, who didn't have starting point guard Jeremy Lin available to face his former team because of a strained left hamstring that will keep him sidelined for at least two weeks. Lin played behind and alongside Walker last season on a team that went 48-34, but then also lost Al Jefferson and Courtney Lee in free agency. But Walker said he isn't surprised by their fast start. ""We have players who put in the time and effort and the work, so I'm not surprised at all,"" he said. ""This is what we're supposed to do. I feel like we're a really good team, so we want to continue to get better each and every day."" Brook Lopez added 18 points and Trevor Booker had 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Nets, who because of injuries had to turn to rookie Isaiah Whitehead, a second-round pick out of Seton Hall, to make his first career start. The Brooklyn native finished with eight points but the best point guard in the game, and from New York, was Walker, who shot 11 for 22 and also grabbed six rebounds. ""It was a good experience but at the end of the day we lost,"" Whitehead said. ""That's never good."" The Nets had a 13-point lead in the first half and were still ahead 55-43 early in the third before Walker and Cody Zeller, who played just five minutes in the first half because of foul trouble, turned it around. Walker's basket capped an 18-3 run that gave Charlotte a 61-58 lead and it remained a three-point game going to the fourth quarter. ""I thought that third quarter really hurt us,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I thought we got stagnant. I thought the ball stopped moving. They got into us."" The lead was down to 92-91 when Williams nailed a 3 from the corner. Walker followed with a free throw to make it 96-91 and the Nets never got closer than three points again. TIP-INS Hornets: Walker and Batum each scored 11 points in the first quarter. Charlotte's only other point was a free throw by Ramon Sessions.  ... The Hornets followed their 4-1 start in 2000-01 by losing their next five games. They finished 46-36. Nets: Brooklyn was also without guards Greivis Vasquez (sore right ankle) and Randy Foye (strained right hamstring). ... Kilpatrick entered as the NBA's top-scoring reserve with 16.6 points per game. HORNETS' NEST Charlotte has won the last five meetings overall and three in a row in Brooklyn. OFF NIGHTS Williams finished 2 for 13 for six points. On the other side, Nets guard Bojan Bogdanovic shot 4 for 17. He had 14 points. LIN UPDATE Lin, who averaged 11.7 points last season in Charlotte, was at the game with his left leg wrapped. He said he's never had a hamstring injury before and doesn't know yet how long he could be out. ""I think we're just saying like the first three days, it's really important to do a whole lot of nothing, and after that time you can get a much better gauge of where I'm at,"" Lin said.","400899522"
"Derrick Rose beats the Bulls defense down the floor and hits the reverse layup with time running out in the first half. (0:18) CHICAGO --  Derrick Rose tried watching the video tribute to him and Joakim Noah during a first-quarter timeout in their return to Chicago on Friday night. Noah, though, would have none of it. ""I watched some of it, but Jo was telling me to stay focused,"" Rose said. ""I had to listen to my big brother at that time."" Stay focused they did. Perhaps inspired by the emotional homecoming, the New York Knicks shrugged off their early season struggles for a 117-104 victory over the Bulls. Kristaps Porzingis had 27 points and Carmelo Anthony added 25 to help New York (2-3) snap a two-game losing streak. The night, though, belonged to the former Bulls. Rose, Chicago's first-round draft pick in 2008, finished with 15 points and 11 assists (five in the fourth quarter), while Noah, a 2007 first-rounder, had 16 points and nine rebounds. They teamed up to play a familiar two-man game late as New York held off a Chicago rally. Noah hadn't scored more than six points in a game this season and was held scoreless in two of the previous four games. ""We're still trying to find ourselves as a team,"" Noah said, ""but I'm not going to lie: this win felt really good."" Dwyane Wade led Chicago (3-2) with 35 points on 12-for-20 shooting and Jimmy Butler added 26 points. ""We didn't come out with the right mentality,"" Wade said. When asked if the game meant more to Rose and Noah, Wade said: ""Anybody could sense that."" Both Rose and Noah received loud ovations from the United Center crowd during pregame introductions, although there were some boos mixed in for Rose. The Chicago native also was booed every time he touched the ball in the first couple of minutes. ""I love when the crowd is into it,"" Rose said. ""I knew there was going to be some yells, I knew there were going to be some boos. I'm from here, I'm used to it. I've been getting it since I was in sixth grade going to play on the West Side and me being from the South Side."" New York broke open a close game by scoring 10 straight points to begin the fourth quarter for a 94-81 lead with 9 minutes to play. The Knicks led by as much as 98-83 before the Bulls rallied within 108-102 with just under 2 minutes to go. But Rose ended any hopes of a comeback with a three-point play on the next possession. TIP-INS Knicks: F Lance Thomas was inactive because of a sprained left ankle. He is listed as day-to-day. ... Noah played just 29 games last season before undergoing season-ending shoulder surgery. ""Right now, I'm just happy to be on the court,"" he said. Bulls: Doug McDermott, who missed Wednesday's game at Boston with a concussion, was cleared by the NBA's concussion protocol earlier Friday. ... Wade had five 3-pointers to give him 10 in five games this season. He had a total of seven last season. REGRETS On the day the Cubs celebrated their World Series title, Rose said the biggest disappointment during his time in Chicago was not leading the Bulls to a championship. ""Only thing I can do about that is say I gave it my all,"" he said. ""I really tried. I had multiple times, many times, where I envisioned winning a championship here. It never happened, so I've got to take (those) visions and take them to New York."" MOVING ON Noah said he wasn't surprised management broke up the Bulls' core following last season. ""I think it was time for a change,"" he said. ""I look back on (last season) and I was definitely frustrated. There was definitely a lot of adversity going on there. Now I can look back at it and see where went wrong. It's not about blaming one person. Everybody in that locker room is good people. It's just (stuff) happens. ""We didn't make the playoffs. Everybody was disappointed. It was a team that had high expectations.""","400899523"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Los Angeles Clippers are concentrating on developing a better defensive identity. On Friday night, they made life rather miserable for the Memphis Grizzlies. The Clippers caused 19 turnovers -- 17 on steals -- and forced Memphis into 37 percent shooting before holding off a late Grizzlies' push for a 99-88 victory. ""Our defense is something, right now, that we can hang our hat on,"" said Chris Paul, who had 27 points and 11 assists for the Clippers. ""The offense, we have to find it,"" said Paul, who also had six steals. ""We'd love to have everything clicking, but I'm just happy that our defense is pretty good."" Blake Griffin added 14 points and 10 rebounds. J.J. Redick scored 12 points for Los Angeles while DeAndre Jordan grabbed 21 rebounds. The Grizzlies chipped into a Clippers' lead that reached 21 points in the third quarter, scoring nine straight points in the fourth. Memphis eventually pulled within 93-86 with less than a minute left, but got no closer. ""We just got messy,"" Paul said of the Memphis rally. ""We didn't take care of the ball."" Mike Conley led Memphis with 30 points and 10 assists, while Marc Gasol added 21 points and nine rebounds. Whether it was the Los Angeles defense or poor execution by Memphis, the Grizzlies never really seemed to keep pace with the Clippers. The Grizzlies' only salvation was scoring 31 points in the final quarter, connecting on 10 of 18 shots, Conley hitting two 3-pointers. ""We need to be where they're at, and we're not,"" said Memphis forward Zach Randolph, who finished with 15 points and nine rebounds. ""We have a lot of work to do. Tonight, they were the better team, and I give them credit."" TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles started the game connecting on its first six shots. ... Los Angeles converted the 19 Memphis miscues into 30 points. . The Clippers bench, which averages 40 points a game, had 22 through three quarters before ending the game with 36. Grizzlies: Memphis coach David Fizdale, who was upset with officials through much of the first half, drew his first technical as a head coach with 3:57 left in the second quarter. Rookie official CJ Washington did the honors. ... Gasol, who was only 3 of 18 from the field in Wednesday's win over New Orleans, started 1 of 11 Friday. ... Memphis lost its first home game of the season. HELPING HAND Paul became the Clippers' franchise leader in assists early in the second half, passing Randy Smith, who had 3,498 in his Clippers career. Asked about the milestone, Paul initially said: ""It's cool,"" then added of the assists: ""I've got the easy job. All I have to do is pass it to somebody. They're the ones that have to make the shot."" HELLO OLD FRIEND Including the postseason, the Grizzlies and Clippers have played 31 times since the start of the 2011-12 season, the most of any Memphis opponent over that span. BAD BOYS, BAD BOYS Entering Friday's game, the teams had been assessed 32 technical fouls over the last 20 games. Griffin has six, while Paul has four and Jordan three. Randolph leads the Grizzlies in techs over that span with three. Fizdale was the only one to draw a technical Friday.","400899524"
"NEW ORLEANS -- Things were a little fuzzy for Phoenix Suns coach Earl Watson after watching Devin Booker tie the game with a tough shot at the regulation buzzer. ""I remember the shot, but honestly I don't remember the play,"" he said. ""I'm going to watch (the game) tonight on the plane. I will collect my thoughts and will try to see what I was thinking. ""I know we ran that play for him for sure."" Good idea. Booker scored 38 points, including the improbable jumper that tied it at the buzzer, and the Suns beat New Orleans 112-111 in overtime Friday night, keeping the Pelicans winless on the season. T.J. Warren added 18 points on 4-of-17 shooting for the Suns (2-4), while Eric Bledsoe had 17 points and Tyson Chandler had 12 points and 18 rebounds. Anthony Davis had 22 points and 11 rebounds for the Pelicans (0-6), while forward Terrence Jones, starting in place of the suspended Dante Cunningham, had 19 points. Though the Pelicans outshot the Suns 46 percent to 43 percent, they managed to shoot just 53.6 percent from the free throw line (15 of 28). The Suns finished 24 of 28 at the line. The win was second in a row for the Suns who started the season with a four-game losing streak. The Pelicans started 0-6 for the second straight season. ""It's good that we're able to get these wins, especially as a young team,"" Chandler said. ""We'll start trying to close these teams out earlier, but it does build character in the long run. ""I thought we were on the right track before, but unfortunately we got a couple of losses. But I definitely like the way we've been playing all season."" Booker tied the game at 102 with a fadeaway jumper from the side as time expired. He had made a 3-pointer to tie the game at 100. With 11.7 seconds remaining, Lance Stephenson took the entry pass down the left side of the lane and threw up a fall-away floater, which he watched go in as he fell to the court, leaving 2.1 seconds to play. ""He made a great shot, a contested jump shot,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""He's a great player."" A back-and-forth overtime ended with Pelicans guard E'Twaun Moore making two free throws with 8.6 seconds left after being fouled by Booker, who fouled out. But Warren took an inbounds pass from P.J. Tucker, cut through the lane and dunked, giving the Suns a 112-111 lead. Moore missed a jump shot as time expired. ""I thought we became too cautious at times,"" Gentry said. ""You can't play that way. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, but you can't be cautious."" It was the second straight overtime game for both teams. The Suns beat Portland 118-115 on Wednesday night in Phoenix, while New Orleans fell 89-83 at Memphis the same night. TIP-INS Suns: Booker had three of the Suns 8 3-pointers for the game. ... Bledsoe led the Suns with four assists. Pelicans: F Dante Cunningham was suspended for the game by the NBA after pleading guilty to ""operating a motor vehicle in a negligent manner while exhibiting the effects of having consumed alcohol"" in Washington state, according to a league press release. The NBA ""just let us know (today),"" Gentry said before the game. ""It's no big deal. It's something that happened and he regrets it."" No other information was available from Pelicans team officials. Jones, his replacement, made the most of his first start for the Pelicans, finishing with 18 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four blocks. ... Buddy Hield and Langston Galloway combined to go 4 of 7 from 3-point range in the first 4 minutes and finished a combined 6 for 16 for the game. PELICANS SCARE: With 4:19 left in the fourth quarter Booker bumped Davis as he raced down the court to receive a long pass from Stephenson. Davis remained on the court for some time. He returned to the game and Booker was charged with a common foul. Booker said he wasn't fazed by the boos he received after he knocked down Davis. ""The crowd turned against me after that AD play, but I embraced it and had fun with it,"" Booker said. ""I talked to him afterwards about it and he said that he wasn't hurt or anything by it. He did tell me I overdid it though."" OVER/UNDER Gentry praised Suns small forward Jared Dudley, whom he coached for four years during his tenure in Phoenix, though not without a dash of his good-natured humor. ""He's the least athletic (small forward) in the history of the game,"" said Gentry, laughing. ""He's just really smart. He found his game to be effective in this league and sometimes that's tough to do."" Still, Gentry doesn't expect Dudley to transform into a rim-crashing machine this year. Asked if he thought Dudley would achieve his promise of throwing down five dunks this season, Gentry replied, ""I'd take the under on that one.""","400899525"
"DALLAS -- Damian Lillard extended the Dallas Mavericks' season-opening misery on the court. Dirk Nowitzki's aching Achilles continued it off the court. Lillard scored 27 of his season-high 42 points in the second half to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 105-95 victory over Dallas on Friday night, sending the Mavericks to the first 0-5 start in their 37-year franchise history. Nowitzki sat out the second half with a sore right Achilles and after the game, the team announced he would miss at least the next week. ""It's just uncomfortable and sore,"" Nowitzki said. ""So we decided to just shut it down. I'm already not moving great at 38 as it is, so to be out there moving on one leg is not helping myself and it's not helping the team."" The Mavericks were also without Andrew Bogut (personal reasons), and Lillard and the Blazers took advantage. With backcourt mate C.J. McCollum saddled with foul trouble for most of the game, Lillard had 18 of Portland's 25 points during a 14-minute stretch of the second half. ""Sensational. Amazing. All-Star. MVP,"" McCollum said of Lillard's performance. ""He definitely saved us. He saves us all the time."" Mason Plumlee had 19 points and Al-Farouq Aminu added 12 points and 10 rebounds for Portland. J.J. Barea scored 23 points and Harrison Barnes had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Mavericks. The Blazers led by three at halftime despite shooting only 3 for 14 on 3-pointers in the first half, but started 7 for 8 from beyond the arc in the third quarter to open a 78-62 lead. However, Portland went 0 for 10 for the rest of the quarter and the Mavericks pulled to 79-76 entering the fourth. After Salah Mejri's dunk closed the gap to one, Lillard scored two quick baskets at the other end, then made a 3 with 8:18 left to put the Blazers up 89-80. The Mavericks got no closer than six the rest of the way. ""When they got it to one, I knew coach was going to put me back in a little earlier than usual,"" Lillard said. ""As soon as he called my name, I ran to the scorer's table and knew what needed to happen."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Coach Terry Stotts earned his 300th win as a head coach. . Lillard has scored at least 27 points in each of Portland's first six games. ... McCollum played only 24 minutes due to foul trouble and scored nine points, but his driving lay-up with 4:34 to go gave the Blazers a 95-87 lead. It was his only basket after the first quarter. ...

Mavericks: Devin Harris has missed all five regular season games after suffering a right big toe sprain in the team's final preseason game. ... The Mavericks scored more points (six) on the fast break in the first quarter than their game average of 4.5, the NBA's lowest. MISSING BOGUT Lillard, who earlier this week said Golden State's defense was ""just not the same"" without Bogut this year, began exploiting Bogut's absence in the Dallas defense in the second quarter with an attacking style of play. Lillard scored 10 points in the quarter, all of them a result of drives to the basket that ended in lay-ups or foul shots. ""He's a huge difference,"" Lillard said. ""He makes a huge difference for them defensively and offensively as a big that can catch the ball in the middle of the defense and make plays. And he protects the paint on defense."" RALLY THE RESERVES The Mavericks sliced into Portland's third-quarter lead, playing mostly with Barea and four reserves in the game. Justin Anderson scored two inside baskets and fired up the crowd with a block of Aminu's layup at the other end. ""They went hard. They had energy. They ignited the crowd,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""That's what this is going to take. It's a time when everyone is going to need to dig very deep.""","400899526"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder put it simply after his team lost to the San Antonio Spurs on Friday night, ""Kawhi Leonard was really good."" Leonard scored 29 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the Spurs avenged their lone loss of the season with a 100-86 victory over the Jazz. The Spurs bounced back from a 15-point home loss to the Jazz on Tuesday after losing just one game in San Antonio all of last season. ""I expected for them to come out and try to get off to a great start and just sustain, and they did that,"" Jazz forward Joe Johnson said. ""After we kind of hit first, they withstood the first five minutes and made a run of their own. We just never really got back. ""(Leonard) is shooting the ball unbelievable off picks. He's handling off pick-and-rolls and making plays. He's been tough to guard."" The Jazz jumped to a 10-2 lead in the first quarter and an unhappy Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called a timeout just minutes into the game. The Spurs responded with a 29-7 run and the Jazz never led again. Utah got within seven points in the third quarter, but Leonard responded with five quick points and the Jazz never got within single digits the rest of the game. Leonard continued his MVP-caliber season by shooting 9 for 18 from the field while LaMarcus Aldridge added 19 points and six rebounds. Rodney Hood led the Jazz with 18 points, but they shot just 37.5 percent. ""It's only two games,"" Popovich said about facing the Jazz twice. ""You win some, you lose some. It's not necessarily (that we) discovered the Holy Grail and instituted it tonight and won the game because of it. We played better."" TIP-INS Spurs: G Tony Parker missed the game due to right knee soreness. He did not travel with the team. ... Patty Mills started at point guard and scored 16 points to go with three rebounds and three assists. ""Patty is a great offensive player and he has been playing really well running the offense,"" Spurs center Pau Gasol said. ""Tony is a very important player for us, but if he is taking this time off it's because he needs it."" Jazz: Gordon Hayward went through a pregame workout with the fingers on his left hand taped up. The star forward is out indefinitely with a broken finger on his non-shooting hand. ... F Boris Diaw missed his second consecutive game with a right leg contusion. NO WARMUPS The Jazz season has started with four playoff teams in their first six games, including the Spurs twice. They hit the road for five straight and seven of nine away from Salt Lake City. ""The biggest thing for me is, you hope for your team to continue to improve,"" Snyder said. ""That is the primary thing. If competition early can accelerate that process, that is a good thing. There's been times where that competition early can knock you back. So it can go either way."" QUOTABLE ""Our identity as a defensive team has to be something we hold on tighter to,"" Snyder said. ""You can call that lack of focus. It's more subtle in some ways. For me it's a lot of little things we weren't doing. They add up. ""We have to know if we're not focused and we're not ready to play defense, we won't. It's not habitual yet. It's not who we are yet and it's who we need to become who we are.""","400899527"
"LOS ANGELES --  While the Los Angeles Lakers shouted and shoved each other with elation, Luke Walton managed to look unsurprised by the incredible upset unfolding before them. The Los Angeles Lakers were battering the mighty Golden State Warriors. Walton's championship-tested former team just couldn't catch up to his young, hungry new squad. Although it's far too early in the season to truly celebrate anything, Walton thinks the Lakers' future is fascinating. Lou Williams scored 10 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter, and the Lakers snapped Stephen Curry's NBA-record streak of 157 games with a 3-pointer during their 117-97 victory Friday night. Julius Randle had 20 points and 14 rebounds, and D'Angelo Russell added 17 points for the rebuilding Lakers. They built a 21-point lead in the third quarter and hung on to shock the Warriors at Staples Center for the third consecutive season. ""It obviously feels better because they're the best,"" Walton said. ""They're as good as it gets. ... But it was just good to see the progress continuing."" After his first meeting with his former team and his coaching mentor, Steve Kerr, Walton claimed the win meant nothing special to him -- but he could understand why the Lakers and their fans might feel differently. Los Angeles has made a habit of surprising the Warriors recently, but as Williams put it: ""This one was valid."" ""We've got a lot of young talent here,"" Williams added. ""Finally it's starting to look like we have some pieces in the right places."" Kevin Durant scored 27 points and Draymond Green had 16, but the Warriors never led and couldn't entirely close the huge gap in the second half while falling to 4-2. Golden State didn't lose its second game under Walton last year until Dec. 30. One night after Durant scored 39 points to beat his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammates, the Warriors scored a season-low 15 points in the first quarter and never fully recovered. ""You don't like the feeling at all,"" Curry said. ""But you've got to wrap your head around where you are in the season, and the good we've shown early in the year, but also focus on the things we need to work on. Regardless of a game like last night or tonight, we still have some things we need to work on."" STREAK SNAPPED Curry scored 13 points while going 0 for 10 from 3-point range, ending several incredible long-distance streaks. He had hit a 3-pointer in every regular-season game since Nov. 11, 2014. Including the postseason, Curry had at least one 3 in 196 straight games, and he had also hit in 116 straight regular-season road games -- both NBA records. ""That was a cool little ride,"" Curry said. ""Would have loved to finish my career making one every game, but hey, start a new one. What was it, like two years? Kind of weird not to make one, but I will keep shooting."" NOT AGAIN Eight months ago at Staples Center, the pre-Durant Warriors also lost 112-95 to the worst Lakers team in franchise history, one of Golden State's mere nine losses last season. Another bad Lakers team also beat Golden State at home on Dec. 23, 2014. ""It's our annual beatdown at Staples by the Lakers,"" Kerr said. ""They do this every year. Let's just give them credit. They came in sky-high with a ton of energy, played really well, and we were flat, right from the beginning."" TIP-INS Warriors: Durant scored at least 20 points for his 70th straight game, surpassing Michael Jordan's 1990-91 streak and matching Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the sixth-longest such streak in NBA history. ... G Patrick McCaw is still out with an ankle injury. ... Drake, Denzel Washington, Dodgers slugger Yasiel Puig and Kings goalie Jonathan Quick were among the crowd that turned out to see the revamped Western Conference champions. Lakers: Timofey Mozgov played despite a bruise around his left eye, courtesy of an elbow from Indiana's Jeff Teague earlier this week.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Thunder showed no lingering effects from their emotional loss at Golden State. Russell Westbrook scored 28 points to help Oklahoma City beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-92 on Saturday night. Enes Kanter had 20 points and 10 rebounds, Steven Adams scored 14 points and Victor Oladipo added 12 for the Thunder in their first game since being blown out by Golden State and former teammate Kevin Durant on Thursday. ""We'll take something from that game to help us learn going forward,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""And it was all about us tonight. It was all about what we need to do, how we needed to play defensively, how we needed to play offensively."" Westbrook also had eight assists and six rebounds. The Thunder improved to 5-1 on the season, matching their best six-game start since moving to Oklahoma City for the 2008-09 season. The Thunder shot 52 percent from the field and held the Timberwolves to 39 percent shooting. ""You have to make plays,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You have to move the ball side to side, and when we did that, we got good looks at the basket."" Karl-Anthony Towns scored 33 points for the Timberwolves after scoring 32 Thursday night against Denver. He scored 25 points in the first half, but Westbrook countered with 18 to help the Thunder take a 59-53 lead into the break. ""Towns, he really played exceptionally well in the first half, and he made a lot of shots,"" Donovan said. ""He did it in a lot of different ways. He made 3s, he had post moves, he had face-ups. He had everything. He's a terrific offensive player."" No Minnesota player other than Towns reached double figures until the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves hung close for the early part of the third before the Thunder took over. An 11-0 run, sparked by a 3-pointer by Westbrook, then a steal and dunk by Westbrook, made it 79-61 and led to a Minnesota timeout. Jerami Grant's two-handed dunk put Oklahoma City up 83-62, and the Thunder led 90-72 at the end of the third quarter. The Thunder held the Timberwolves to 30 percent shooting in the third quarter.

The long runs by opponents have been a recurring issue for the Timberwolves. ""It's a problem,"" Thibodeau said. ""The only thing we can do is take a look at the film, try to get some work in, try to make the corrections."" --- TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns scored 13 points on 6-for-9 shooting in the first quarter, while his teammates shot 5 for 15 and scored 12. ...

Andre Roberson and Oladipo were largely responsible for defending them. LONG DISTANCE Tony Juarez of Oklahoma City won $20,000 from Mid-First Bank when he made a halfcourt shot during a timeout in the third quarter. According to the Thunder, it was the 10th time someone made the shot since the team moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, and the first since Dec. 13, 2015. The 22-year-old Juarez told a Thunder spokesman he would use the money for school. He called his mother in El Paso right after stepping off the court.","400899529"
"PHILADELPHIA -- The Cleveland Cavaliers were pushed to the limit by the Philadelphia 76ers, and LeBron James doesn't think that's such a bad thing. James scored 25 points, moving into 10th place on the NBA's career list, and added 14 assists and eight rebounds as the unbeaten Cavaliers held off the winless 76ers 102-101 on Saturday night. ""It's always great to have these kinds of games,"" James said. ""We will clean it up. It's a great learning experience for us. I know we have room for improvement."" Kevin Love added 20 points and 11 rebounds for the reigning champion Cavaliers, who improved to 6-0. Coach Tyronn Lue wasn't disappointed, either, that the result was so surprisingly close. ""We stayed poised,"" Lue said. ""We were tested tonight. Overall, I'm pleased to come out with a win when we had some adversity."" Joel Embiid scored 22 points, making all four of his 3-point attempts, but the 76ers dropped to 0-5. James passed Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon by converting a fast-break layup midway through the first quarter. Olajuwon finished his career with 26,946 points. It looked to be an easy night for the Cavaliers at that point. But the 76ers nearly shocked them. Channing Frye's 3-pointer with 1:05 left gave the Cavaliers a 102-101 lead. After a turnover by Philadelphia's Sergio Rodriguez, J.R. Smith missed a 3 with 15 seconds left that would've clinched it. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown then called a timeout with 7.3 seconds remaining. The 76ers were trying to get the ball to Embiid, but they couldn't and Gerald Henderson turned the ball over as he tried to get a shot off in the final seconds. Henderson said a foul should've been called on the play. ""We tried to run something to get it in to (Embiid),"" he said. ""Time was running down so I just took it myself. I got fouled. They didn't call it. And it's the end of the game."" Said Brown, ""The tape will show what the tape shows. That's obviously a tough way to end a great game."" James' first attempt at passing the record was an emphatic, highlight-reel block by Embiid about 3 1/2 minutes into the contest. After two more misses, James quickly raced up the court for an easy layup to reach the milestone. ""It's a blessing and an honor,"" James said. He is No. 12 in scoring on the combined ABA/NBA list. The 76ers remained one of three winless teams in the NBA, along with Dallas and New Orleans. Philadelphia opened last season by tying a league record with 18 straight losses. Philadelphia battled back from an 18-point, first-half deficit. Philadelphia outscored Cleveland 16-9 over the first 5:50 of the final quarter, taking its biggest lead on Henderson's short jumper that made it 96-91 with 6:10 remaining. Smith's 3-pointer with 2:50 left put Cleveland back in front, 99-98. But Ersan Ilyasova answered with a 3-pointer 13 seconds later to give the 76ers a 101-99 advantage. The Cavaliers used a 16-0 run to finish the first quarter, helping them to a 34-19 lead. James played all 12 minutes of the opening quarter, finishing with six points, four rebounds and seven assists. The Cavaliers led 57-46 at halftime. NOT THEIR MONTHS The 76ers have lost their last 42 games in October and November, dating to an overtime win over Milwaukee on Nov. 22, 2013. GOOD ADDITION Ilyasova, playing in his second game for Philadelphia after being acquired on Tuesday from Oklahoma City for Jerami Grant, added 21 points. OFF NIGHT Kyrie Irving, who entered ninth in the NBA in scoring (26.0 ppg), scored eight points on 3-for-17 shooting. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland is off to its best start since the 1976-77 Cavaliers opened 8-0. It also is the best start for a James team. ... Love went down hard with 6:47 left in the second quarter after a block attempt by Embiid. No foul was called on the play. 76ers: Former Phillies slugger Ryan Howard was among the sell-out crowd.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  A starter throughout much of his career, Jeff Green is adjusting to the role coming off the bench in his first season with the Orlando Magic. But there have been nights so far this season when it has all seemed so natural for the versatile veteran. Green certainly appeared in his element Saturday night as he knocked down several big shots as part of a second-unit that helped the Magic overcome a 12-point third-quarter deficit to come away with an 88-86 win over the Washington Wizards at home. Green led his team with 18 points off the bench as the Magic improved to .500 with its third straight win after starting the season 0-3. ""My job is to just go play basketball,"" said Green, who scored 10 of his points in the fourth quarter. ""It doesn't matter if I come off the bench, start, play five minutes, play 30 minutes. My job is the same. I just have to be aggressive with the minutes I play. ""I'm just finding my rhythm and that's what it's all about."" Green, who is playing behind Aaron Gordon at the small forward spot, led the second unit which provided energy in both the first and second halves to pull the Magic out of double-digit deficits. The bench, which also includes Bismack Biyombo, D.J. Augustin and Mario Hezonja was so impressive that Frank Vogel left them in the game down the critical stretch as the Wizards threatened. Biyombo was huge in the paint on the defensive end, coming up with 12 rebounds and three big block shots to energize the team. Hezonja, a second-year swingman, finally broke out of his slump, by scoring eight of his nine points in the fourth quarter on clutch baskets. ""That's what we need from the second unit, come in with a lot energy, scoring mentality and just be more aggressive,"" said Evan Fournier, who finished with 13 points. Vogel admitted that second-unit gave the team a much-needed lift. ""We road some of those guys out the rest of the game because of their first-quarter energy and obviously they got going late into the third and into the fourth,"" said Vogel, whose team has won back-to-back games at home. ""So credit those guys for turning the game around."" The Wizards (1-4), who were playing without point guard John Wall, struggled to come up with shots down the stretch even though Markieff Morris came close to knocking down a game-winning 3-point shot at the buzzer. Morris led the team with 18 points while Bradley Beal added 15. ""A few missed defensive assignments,"" said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. ""They hit some 3s. They got some breaks."" TIP-INS: Wizards:  As expected, Wall did not play in Saturday night's game against Magic. He is not playing in back-to-back night games while still recovering from offseason surgery on both knees. Rookie Tomas Satoransky started in his place and veteran Trey Burke served as the backup. Magic: Orlando had lost 12 straight games to the Washington Wizards entering Saturday night's game. ... The Magic entered Saturday night averaging 13.2 offensive rebounds per game, which ranks second in the NBA. ... The Magic debuted their new dark grey uniforms. WATCHING IBAKA SURGE Wizards coach Scott Brooks had a front seat view of Serge Ibaka's transition from Spain to the NBA when the Seattle Supersonics (Oklahoma City Thunder) drafted him in 2009 and Brooks was the head coach. Ibaka was a talented player but didn't speak English initially so explaining what he wanted from Ibaka was a challenge for Brooks. ""My first (go-around) with him was very interesting,"" Brooks said. ""We didn't know how to communicate. Even on the basketball court the first couple of months it was very difficult but I give Serge a lot of credit. He came and took English lessons and really challenged himself to pick up the language.""","400899531"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  Andre Drummond bounced back from a couple quiet games, and the Detroit Pistons breezed to another easy victory at home. Drummond had 19 points and 20 rebounds, and Detroit beat the Denver Nuggets 103-86 on Saturday night. The Pistons have won all four of their home games this season by double digits, and they haven't trailed by more than three points in any of them. They were never behind Saturday after scoring the game's first 10 points. Drummond had only six points in a loss at Brooklyn on Wednesday night, and only nine in a win over New York the previous night. ""I wasn't myself the past two games,"" Drummond said. ""I wasn't playing with energy and I wasn't doing things I'm supposed to do to help my team win games."" The Pistons were all playing with purpose at the beginning of Saturday's game. Drummond threw down a one-handed dunk off an alley-oop pass from Ish Smith in transition to put Detroit up 8-0, and Denver took a quick timeout. It was 16-2 when the Nuggets called time again, and by the time the first quarter ended, Denver was 5 of 27 from the field and trailed 29-12. ""I thought in the first quarter, our defense was the best it's been all year, and maybe as good as it's been since I've been here,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said.  ""We were really on it, and it was making more than one, two efforts on every possession."" It was 51-44 at halftime and 77-67 after three, then the Pistons started the fourth quarter with another 10-0 run and the rout was on again. ""We're only five games in, but there's been a pattern for four straight games where we've gotten down by 15, 18,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""It was 20-4 to start the game. We're paid professionals. You have to be ready to play."" Marcus Morris and Jon Leuer scored 15 points each for Detroit, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 13. Wilson Chandler led Denver with 21 points. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver was averaging 31.8 points in the third quarter this season, the second-best mark in the league. The Nuggets were held to 23 by Detroit. ... F Nikola Jokic was called for a flagrant foul in the third, and Drummond made both free throws after Denver had cut a 14-point lead to nine. Pistons: Detroit (4-2) is off to a solid start despite the absence of PG Reggie Jackson, who has been dealing with knee issues. ... The Pistons recovered nicely on defense after allowing a 71-point first half against Brooklyn. ... Drummond went 7 of 11 from the free throw line. MILESTONE Drummond had three blocked shots, bringing his career total to 500. ""Not enough,"" he joked. ""It's definitely a good milestone, and thanks to my teammates for letting their man get by them."" Drummond finished one point short of what would have been his 11th career game with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds. CHANGES Malone was understandably displeased with his team's performance at the beginning of the game, and he indicated the starting lineup would be altered. ""We were flat everywhere, it wasn't just offensively,"" Malone said. ""Our defense was horrendous. They did whatever they wanted. It was the fifth game in a row where our starting group came out asleep, so we're not going to have the same starting lineup (Sunday) night."" Chandler wasn't about to dispute the coach's reaction. ""I can understand his frustration,"" Chandler said. ""Us as players individually, we're frustrating ourselves.""","400899532"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  After spending two days dissecting the problems from their last loss, the Indiana Pacers found some solutions Saturday. And they didn't even need their best player, Paul George, to bail them out. Instead, Indiana made a season-high 12 3-pointers, forced 18 turnovers and pulled away from the struggling Chicago Bulls for a resounding 111-94 victory, after George was banished to the locker room for the final 13 1/2 minutes after inadvertently kicking the ball into the stands. ""This is what we feel we can do out on the floor,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Again, it's going to be a process and it's going to take time for us to continue to build. But this is the type of game we want to build off of."" There was a reason this one looked easy. After seeing their problems exposed on tape, the embarrassed Pacers (3-3) found motivation in proving everyone wrong this time -- especially against a team playing back-to-back games for the first time this season. The Pacers took full advantage of the opportunity. C.J. Miles scored 20 points off the bench, making four 3s. Myles Turner finished with 16 points and four blocks, and George still had 13 points and seven rebounds. That was more than enough against the Bulls (3-3), who have lost three straight. Jimmy Butler and Doug McDermott each scored 16 points, while Rajon Rondo had nine points and five assists. But Rondo (four) and Butler (six) combined for nearly as many turnovers as the Pacers had as a team (12). ""Right out of the gate, you could see it was going to be tough,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We've got to find a way to bounce back and do the things to be successful."" The game was only tied once, at 2-2, and Indiana soon took control. EJECTED George appeared to be upset when there was a no-call on one of his shots and then he was called for a foul on the Bulls' ensuing possession. He was assessed a technical foul and immediately ejected. He said he apologized to the fan the ball hit. ""I just meant to kick the ball against the stanchion,"" George said. ""My soccer skills aren't as good as I thought. I'm glad my teammates were able to pick up this win and me not be at fault for a loss."" THREE FOR THE SHOW After George's departure, with 1:42 left in the third, the Pacers had two 3s out of their next four baskets. Indiana, which took 26 attempts, had made 10 3-pointers three other times this season. TIP-INS Bulls: Had an eight-game streak with 100 or more points snapped. ... One night after Wade made five 3-pointers, his highest single-game total since April 2009, he was 1 of 9 from the field and 0 for 2 on 3s. ... Guard R.J. Hunter returned to his hometown for the first time with Chicago. Pacers: Extended the lead to 26 in the second half, their largest lead of the season. The previous best was 16 points against the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 1. ...

"ATLANTA --  Dwight Howard had 20 points and 14 rebounds in his first game against his former Houston teammates, Paul Millsap scored 23 points and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Rockets 112-97 on Saturday night.

James Harden scored 30 points and continued his hot start to the season by making 10 of 19 shots. He had 12 assists and nine rebounds.

"MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Bucks executed their game plan to perfection. Mirza Teletovic scored 22 points and matched his career high with seven 3-pointers, Giannis Antetokounmpo added 17 points, eight assists and eight rebounds, and the Bucks beat the short-handed Sacramento Kings 117-91 on Saturday night. ""First, we are focused on the defensive end,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""We are getting stops and then there are multiple guys touching the ball on one possession."" The Bucks have scored 117 points or more in each of the last three games for the first time since February 2009. ""We are passing up maybe a good shot to get a great shot,"" Kidd said. ""I think our guys really believe that."" Jabari Parker had 19 points and four steals for the Bucks, who pulled their starters after three quarters. ""Being able to get some rest in the fourth quarter was great for me,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It's great for the guys with fresh legs, too."" Garrett Temple scored 19 and tied his career-high with five 3-pointers and DeMarcus Cousins had 15 in the first half for the Kings, who slipped to 0-4 on their five-game road trip and gave up 100 points or more for the sixth consecutive game. The Bucks forced 15 turnovers and converted them into 29 points. ""They covered up the paint very well and got some deflections,"" Kings first-year coach Dave Joerger said. ""They had 12 steals on our 15 turnovers and most of them were pick-sixes. They dribbled down and got a highlight dunk, an easy 3. It's hard to play uphill against that."" Milwaukee outscored Sacramento 26-1 on fast-break points. ""On defense and half court, we're playing pretty well,"" Temple said. ""We just can't give up transition baskets."" Leading 61-48 at the half, the Bucks opened the third quarter with a 21-3 run. Parker highlighted it with nine points, including a basket in traffic and the foul shot, leaving a disgusted look on Cousins' face as the three-point play pushed the lead to 80-51. The Kings went scoreless for 5:14 before Temple's 3-pointer with 3:03 left in the quarter momentarily stopped the Bucks' surge. Teletovic made his first five 3-point attempts, Antetokounmpo had 11 points, eight assists and Parker added 10 points as the Bucks used a swarming defense and capitalized on the absence of Rudy Gay to force the Kings into 40.5 percent shooting from the floor in the first half. Gay played with sore ribs in Thursday's loss to the Orlando Magic, but did not play against the Bucks. The Kings missed their second-leading scorer's 22.5 points and 5.3 rebounds, and his defense on Antetokounmpo. TIP-INS Kings: The Kings had 20 points in the paint to the Bucks' 26 in the first half. . F Omri Casspi made his first start of the season filling in for Gay.

"SAN ANTONIO --  Doc Rivers and Gregg Popovich are not fans of the congested early schedules the Los Angeles Clippers and San Antonio Spurs are playing. But the Clippers can rest easier after their largest victory over the Spurs on the second night of a back-to-back for both teams. Blake Griffin scored a season-high 28 points and the Clippers handed the Spurs a second straight home loss, 116-92 on Saturday night. ""It was great to win,"" Rivers said. ""It's always great to win here, but these games shouldn't happen. You could literally see both teams, they couldn't even walk in the middle of the third quarter. A national TV game with two elite teams should be (played) with a day off."" The Spurs have dropped two straight at the AT&amp;T Center after losing just two regular-season home games in the previous 600 days, including a 40-1 mark last season. San Antonio had not lost consecutive home games since dropping back-to-back triple-overtime games to Memphis (117-116) and Portland (129-119) in December 2014. ""We feel like we gave two away,"" San Antonio forward Kawhi Leonard said, ""but we've just got to learn from our mistakes. Teams that are good learn from their failures."" It was the Clippers' most lopsided victory in 160 games against the Spurs and it started on a historic note. Los Angeles scored the most points in the opening half in Popovich's 21 seasons, rolling to a 73-55 lead. The Clippers shot 50 percent from the field while dominating the battle between one-loss teams. ""We got some stops and got out in transition,"" said Clippers point guard Chris Paul, who had nine points and 10 assists. ""We played a lot of faster than we've been playing and we got some easy buckets."" After giving up eight straight points to open the game, the Clippers made eight consecutive stops to take a 16-8 lead they would never relinquish. ""After that it was just survival for us because we had a big enough lead,"" Rivers said. Jamal Crawford finished with 16 points, J.J. Redick had 14 and Luc Mbah a Moute had 14 points while shooting 2 for 4 on 3-pointers. But it was Griffin who keyed the early run. The 6-foot-10 forward had 26 points in the first half, shooting 12 for 16 from the field. ""Our offense was clicking so well I got out in transition, got some easy ones there,"" Griffin said. ""But I also got some easy looks from C.P. and (DeAndre Jordan) rolling. It's nice to have those easy looks go down and that kind of builds your confidence."" Griffin finished 13 for 19 from the field, banking in shots and rising up for jumpers against LaMarcus Aldridge. ""I'm no dummy, I just told them to get it to him,"" Rivers said. ""I didn't care where, but through movement. They did a good job of not just handing it to him they swung it, swung it and then dropped it. But when he's that hot, you just try to get it to him and space the floor."" Aldridge had 19 points and Leonard added 14, but the duo shot a combined 10 for 26.

""Luc put in some great work this summer. Sometimes I think we believe in him more than he believes in himself."" Mbah a Moute entered the game averaging 2.4 points. VOTE EARLY Popovich wore a ""Vote Pedro"" shirt to his pregame interview, which was the same one worn by Napoleon Dynamite in the 2004 cult movie classic.

"Rudy Gobert receives a pass in the paint and soars over Kristaps Porzingis throwing down an epic, one-handed slam late in the fourth quarter.

Hayward made all 14 of his free throws and finished with 28 points in his season debut, leading the Utah Jazz over the New York Knicks 114-109 Sunday. Hayward had been sidelined since breaking his right ring finger in training camp. He led the team in scoring last season, averaging nearly 20 points per game. ""I think any time you add a player of his caliber, everybody gets to do what they're good at a little easier,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""There's a trickle-down effect. I think he gives guys confidence. It allows us to play small with more size and more force,"" he said. Hayward shot 6 of 17 from the field, including 2 of 8 on 3-pointers.

Hood scored 12 points in the fourth quarter, as did Rose ""(Hood) was aggressive,"" Hill said. ""When he's aggressive, we're a different team. Like I told him going into the fourth quarter when Gordon and I were sitting down, he has to take over the game.""

LADIES and GENTLEMEN, CHANDLER PARSONS Parsons, the Grizzlies biggest off-season acquisition, started in his season debut Sunday and missed all eight of his shot in just under 22 minutes. Parsons, signed by Memphis during the offseason for four years, $94 million, did not play in the preseason or in the first six regular season games, recovering from right knee surgery. ""I expected him to be rusty,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""The guy hasn't played in I don't know how long."" DAME DINGED UP Lillard injured his left thumb in the second quarter, but didn't leave the game although he kept shaking the hand the rest of the half. While the thumb was swollen, he didn't anticipate any long-term affects. Lillard also rolled his ankle. ""It would take more than that to keep me out of the game,"" he said. STILL ADJUSTING With Parsons debut, Memphis employed its fifth different starting lineup in the first seven games as first-year coach David Fizdale searches for consistency.","400899538"
"TORONTO --  By winning on the second night of a back-to-back, the Sacramento Kings avoided an empty road trip. DeMarcus Cousins had 22 points and 14 rebounds, Rudy Gay scored 23 against his former team and Sacramento beat the Toronto Raptors 96-91 on Sunday night before a sellout crowd of 19,800 at Air Canada Centre. ""It was much needed, a confidence boost, a momentum boost,"" Cousins said. ""It's a good feeling. It would have been a pretty long flight if we went home off this road trip with no wins, so it makes it a bit better. But we're still finding ourselves. We've still got a lot of growing to do."" Gay had nine points in the fourth quarter as the Kings (3-5) snapped a four-game losing streak by winning the finale of their five-game trip. Matt Barnes had eight points and 10 rebounds, and Kosta Koufos added 13 points and six rebounds. DeMar DeRozan led the Raptors (4-2) with 23 points, the first time this season he's been held under 30. Kyle Lowry added 15 points and 11 assists for Toronto, which had a three-game winning streak snapped. ""We were out of it the entire night offensively. We were off rhythm,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""They did a good job of sending bodies off of our young guys and onto DeMar, Kyle and our shooters."" With center Jonas Valanciunas sidelined by a sore knee, rookie Jakob Poeltl started for Toronto. But he was in foul trouble all night and fouled out with six points and four rebounds in 18 minutes. Valanciunas' injury and Poeltl's foul trouble meant Lucas Nogueira, seeing his first action of the season, had to pick up the slack. He had seven points and five rebounds in 21 minutes. The teams swapped leads throughout the fourth quarter until Cousins' layup with 2:55 to go gave the Kings a 90-88 advantage. They led the rest of the way. ""I think it shows what we're capable of,"" Barnes said. ""Out of all the teams (on the road trip), we beat the best team after a back-to-back. ""We just need to stick together, start gelling and it won't be a problem."" After DeRozan missed a pair of free throws that would have tied it, Gay hit two from the stripe at the other end to give the Kings a 92-88 lead with 1:54 remaining. ""We got a lot of great shots at the end of the game that we missed,"" DeRozan said. ""I missed two free throws. Norm (Powell) had two wide-open 3s that would have given us big momentum. ""It was one of those games that we are going to be able to look at and learn a lot going forward."" Lowry's steal and three-point play put Toronto up 73-72 with 9:34 to go. But 3-pointers by Gay on consecutive trips staked the Kings to an 87-83 lead with 4:41 left. Lowry's 3 and DeRozan's basket gave Toronto a short-lived 88-87 lead. ""It was a hard-fought game,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""I'm really proud of our guys getting the win on a back-to-back, our third back-to-back of the season already. ""We played a team that was waiting for us and that is a very, very good team that I have a lot of respect for. It's been a tough road trip and it's good to finish with a win."" Sacramento led 68-66 going into the fourth quarter. The Kings, who trailed by 11 midway through the third, closed the period on a 7-2 run to take their first lead since early in the first. The Raptors led 50-44 at halftime. TIP-INS Kings: Cousins had his 247th double-double, most in Sacramento history. ... The Kings dominated in the paint, outscoring the Raptors 52-30. ... Sacramento has defeated Toronto in three straight games. Raptors: Valanciunas was a late scratch. He bruised his left knee last week and it swelled up before the game. He is day to day. ... Toronto rookie Pascal Siakim set season highs for minutes (24) and points (10). ... The Raptors scored 13 points off 11 Kings turnovers, while Sacramento had two points off six Toronto turnovers. KINGS OF THE ROAD Sacramento has played an NBA-high six road games, going 2-4. SHUTDOWN D The Kings limited the Raptors to a season-low 35.7 percent shooting from the field (30 for 84), holding them without a field goal over the final 6:42 of the third quarter. TWO-YEAR SELLOUT STREAK The Air Canada Centre was sold out for the 96th straight game, including playoffs, dating to Nov. 11, 2014. That's the longest streak in franchise history. HE SAID IT ""They played as well as you can against a guy like DeMarcus Cousins. He's one of the hardest matchups that you can have in the NBA."" -- Casey on the play of rookies Poeltl and Siakam, who filled in for Valanciunas.","400899539"
"DALLAS --  When the Dallas Mavericks signed Harrison Barnes to a max contract in the offseason, they probably had nights like this in mind. With the team in search of its first win and two starters out, Barnes scored a career-high 34 points and the Mavericks beat the Milwaukee Bucks 86-75 in overtime Sunday. Barnes, who left Golden State to sign a $94 million, four-year contract with Dallas, has scored at least 30 points twice this season after hitting the mark only once in his four years with the Warriors. His 20-foot jumper opened the scoring in overtime, and the Mavericks (1-5) never trailed in the extra period, outscoring the Bucks 12-1 and forcing five turnovers. ""I think the biggest thing that Coach (Rick Carlisle) has told me is just look for my shot and be aggressive,"" Barnes said. ""My teammates have a lot of confidence in me and when I was able to get into a good rhythm, the basket got bigger and bigger."" Dallas played without starters Dirk Nowitzki (right Achilles soreness) and Deron Williams (left calf strain). J.J. Barea added 21 points for Dallas, including five in overtime. Jabari Parker led Milwaukee with 16 points, only two after halftime. Greg Monroe had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks, who had won three straight. ""I didn't finish really well,"" Parker said. ""I'd rather have a bad first half and have a good second half."" Wesley Matthews shook off a 3-for-17 shooting night to hit a 3-pointer with 59 seconds remaining in overtime that put the Mavs up by nine. Barnes' driving layup with 13 seconds to play in regulation tied the score at 74. Giannis Antetokounmpo's long jumper at the buzzer missed, forcing overtime. The Bucks led by 13 points in the first quarter but went cold in the second and trailed 47-39 at the break. Barnes scored 19 points in the first half, including nine in a 14-0 Dallas run to end the half. It was the Mavericks' first lead at the end of any quarter this season. TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo picked up two fouls in the first 1:37 and played only 6 minutes in a scoreless first half. He finished with 11 points. . The Bucks had 27 turnovers. Mavericks: The team honored longtime team physician J.R. Zamorano, who died June 12 at age 81, with a moment of silence before the game. Players wore uniform patches and Mavericks coaches wore lapel pins with the letters JRZ. . Andrew Bogut, back in the lineup after missing Friday's game for personal reasons, had 16 rebounds. BREAKING IN Dallas rookie Dorian Finney-Smith played 31 minutes, including most of the second half and overtime, after playing less than 5 minutes cumulatively over the first five games. He finished with five points, the first of his NBA career. More importantly, he defended Antetokounmpo on the final possession of regulation, forcing the long miss. The team gave Finney-Smith a game ball after the game. ""It felt good to know that (Carlisle) trusts me enough to play me down the stretch to get stops,"" Finney-Smith said. ""That's what I like to do. I like to play defense."" SLOWING DOWN THE BUCKS Milwaukee had scored 117 or more points in three consecutive games for the first time since February 2009. But the Mavericks held the Bucks to 75 by taking away the two things they like to do most -- score in the paint and on the fast break. The Bucks had only 28 points in the paint, less than half their season average of 57, and managed just 12 points in transition as Dallas often used the entire shot clock on offense. ""We couldn't find stops,"" Parker said. ""When we find stops we are able to go out in transition. They eliminated that by playing the clock out.""","400899540"
"BOSTON -- Emmanuel Mudiay learned quickly that in the NBA, shooters often benefit from a short memory. Coming off a rough game, Mudiay scored 24 of his season-high 30 points in the opening quarter Sunday night while helping the Denver Nuggets to a big first half on their way to a 123-107 victory over the injury-depleted Boston Celtics. ""One thing about this league that I've learned from last year is there's always another game,"" said Mudiay, in his second season. ""You can't think about the last one. You just grow and move on from it. That's the main thing I was thinking about."" Mudiay, who went 0 for 7 from the floor Saturday night in Denver's double-digit loss at Detroit, shot 9 of 10 in the first quarter and had a season high already as he outscored the Celtics. The Nuggets led 42-23 after one. Wilson Chandler added 22 points before leaving with a left hamstring injury. Danilo Gallinari scored 16, and Gary Harris and Jamal Murray each had 12 for the Nuggets, who lost 16 of the previous 18 meetings in Boston. Isaiah Thomas led Boston, tying his season high with 30 points. Avery Bradley had 14. ""These signs aren't good. We're not giving our all on the defensive end,"" Thomas said. ""We can have five starters out (but) you can definitely, it's a mindset thing on that end, and we've got to do a better job on that."" The Celtics were missing starters Jae Crowder (sprained left ankle) and Al Horford (concussion protocol), a high-priced free agent acquisition. Denver pushed its lead to 66-41 midway into the second and led 77-52 at halftime. Boston left the floor to a loud chorus of boos. The Celtics made a brief spurt in the third, closing to 84-69, but the Nuggets scored 14 of the next 19 points en route to a 103-83 edge after three. There was a smattering of boos again when the game ended. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver scored just 86 points in its loss at Detroit. ... G Will Barton missed his third straight game with a sprained left ankle. Celtics: F Kelly Olynyk was also out and hasn't played this season while rehabbing his right shoulder. He was the only player on the floor minutes before the teams came out for pregame warmups, doing extensive shooting with a few ball boys in front of Boston's bench. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Olynyk is still on pace for ""mid-November."" FAST START The Nuggets emphasized getting off to a quick start after falling behind by 17 after one quarter against Detroit. They thought it was a bad pattern they had been getting into so far this season. ""We had to not lose the first quarter. We were losing the first quarter too much,"" Mudiay said. ""I just felt like we had to come out and do something about it. We can't be pointing fingers."" THEY WEREN'T LISTENING Before the game, Stevens addressed his team's struggles on defense. ""I'm not as concerned (with offense),"" he said. ""Again, my focus is on the defensive end of the floor with our team right now."" Then the Celtics went out and allowed the Nuggets to score 77 points in the first half while shooting 64.4 percent, with a number of baskets coming off drives down the lane.","400899541"
"LOS ANGELES -- Julius Randle refused to back down from Tyson Chandler, and both big men got technical fouls for trash talking. Moments later, the crowd rose to its feet when Randle got the ball against Chandler on the perimeter in the closing minutes. Instead of forcing a confrontation, Randle fed Jordan Clarkson for a decisive 3-pointer. The Los Angeles Lakers are young and headstrong, but they're learning all the time. And for just the second time in three years, they're a winning team. Nick Young scored 22 points, Clarkson added 18 and the Lakers moved above .500 with their third straight victory, 119-108 over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night. Two days after their stunning upset of Golden State, the Lakers (4-3) held off the Suns down the stretch despite Devin Booker's career-high 39 points. Randle also scored 18 for the Lakers and assisted on that 3 by Clarkson with 1:27 left to seal it. ""The fact he did what he did was such a winning play on his part,"" Los Angeles coach Luke Walton said. ""Unselfish. It's everything we want. It's him using his brain, him being competitive, him fighting for the team."" After three seasons of gradually increasing misery, the Lakers are young, fun and improving. They're also unbeaten at home, winning three straight games at Staples Center for the first time since April 2013. ""We're doing things the right way, and we're starting to see some success,"" Randle said. ""We easily could have given up the lead, but we kept fighting. ... That's just my game. I don't back down from anybody. I'm not afraid of nobody."" Other than its season-opening victory last month, Los Angeles hadn't had a winning record since the franchise was 10-9 on Dec. 6, 2013. The three worst seasons in team history followed, but Walton's new Lakers are already injecting optimism into their huge fan base with up-tempo excitement and a quick start to the season. Booker scored 29 in the second half while setting a career high for the second straight game. T.J. Warren had 22 points and Eric Bledsoe added 19 for Phoenix, which started slowly two days after a road game in New Orleans. ""They're a good team in transition, and we knew that coming in,"" said Booker, who also had seven assists. ""We had some mental breakdowns, and they took advantage of it."" BOOK MAKING Booker followed up his 38-point game against the Pelicans on Friday with another beauty. After missing nine of his 12 first-half shots, the 20-year-old heated up with a series of high-difficulty buckets while Phoenix trimmed the Lakers' lead. ""Doesn't matter,"" Booker said. ""It's another game, especially if we lose. If we get a win, I'm more excited about it. Everybody looks good when you win, and that's what we're trying to do. Scoring as many points as you want and not making the playoffs isn't a good look."" Booker outscored D'Angelo Russell, his fellow second-year NBA guard, but Russell had 11 points -- eight in the fourth quarter -- and six assists. UNCLE P DELIVERS Young's strong game included a four-point play with 4:19 left. Even the Suns have taken notice of the veteran guard, whose Lakers career appeared to be over last summer. ""We knew Nick has been playing well all season,"" Phoenix coach Earl Watson said. ""He's done a really good job turning his game around."" NANCE INJURED Lakers F Larry Nance Jr. has a concussion after a first-quarter tumble. Nance was undercut by P.J. Tucker while they scrambled for a loose ball near midcourt. Nance didn't return, and he must miss Tuesday's game against Dallas as well, according to the NBA's concussion protocol. Nance is a valuable reserve in his second NBA season, averaging 8.2 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. TIP-INS Los Angeles' bench outscored the Suns' reserves 47-9. ... Timofey Mozgov added 14 points and eight rebounds for the Lakers. ... Lakers fan Travis Milne hit a half-court shot before the fourth quarter to win $35,000. Several Lakers high-fived Milne, who pointed at his forearm in an imitation of Russell's famed ""Ice In My Veins"" celebration of big shots. Russell didn't see the homage, but was visibly pleased to hear about it after the game.","400899542"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Gordon Hayward's return to the lineup just might make Utah a factor in the Western Conference. Derrick Favors had 16 points and 14 rebounds and Rodney Hood scored 18 points to lead the Utah Jazz to a 109-84 victory over the winless Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night. Hayward scored 20 points in the second game of his return since he broke his right ring finger in training camp. He led the team in scoring last season, averaging nearly 20 points per game. ""That's one of the better teams, I think, in the West,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. The Jazz won their second straight game on the road and cruised against a Sixers team again mired at the bottom of the NBA standings. The Sixers have lost 43 straight games in October and November. The Sixers last won a game in either of those two months on Nov. 22, 2013, against Milwaukee. The Sixers are 0-6 for the third straight season and have lost 10 straight dating to last season. Jahlil Okafor led the Sixers with 15 points. ""We were flat the entire night,"" Okafor said. The Jazz let the Sixers hang around until Shelvin Mack hit a 3-pointer during a 10-0 run that pretty much ended the game. Hayward, who 28 scored points in his season debut Sunday against New York, had four points during the run. He made 9 of 17 shots and had five assists and seven boards. ""He's going to continue to have good games,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder. ""He's put a lot of time in, a lot of energy, a lot of work. You see it out there with his demeanor. Other guys look to him and they see that, too."" Utah's Rudy Gobert and Philadelphia's Joel Embiid had an anticipated battle of the big men curtailed by foul trouble. Gobert fouled out and scored eight points. Embiid was whistled for five fouls and scored 14 points. Gobert blocked a shot by Embiid early in the first quarter and Embiid missed a dunk late in the first half. ""We wanted to put hands on balls and be aggressive defensively,"" Gobert said. Embiid, the franchise center nicknamed ""The Process,"" had a rare quiet game for a team desperately looking for a win. The Sixers lost their first 18 games of the season and 17 straight to open 2014-15. The winless count goes on again this season. ""You're always wanting to know why and how to achieve wins, close-game wins, close-out wins,"" Brown said. ""The time that we've spent, I think is going to pay dividends."" TIP-INS Jazz: The Jazz beat the Sixers for the eighth straight time. ... The Jazz made 11 of 19 3-point attempts. ... Utah had 11 blocks. 76ers: The 76ers fans, who have been patient during the rebuilding process, loudly booed Nik Stauskas when he missed a pull-up 3 trailing by 16 late in the third. They loudly booed as they fled for the exits with the Sixers down 20 late in the fourth. HILL OUT George Hill sat out with a sprained right thumb. Mack started for Hill, who was named NBA Western Conference player of the week on averages of 20.8 points, 5.8 assists and 3.3 rebounds. ""Whoever plays for George isn't going to be George,"" Snyder said. ""The good thing about George is that I think he's prepared to score, to defend, to lead, whatever it is, at any moment that the team needs for him to do."" JOEL EM-3IID Embiid actually led the NBA in 3-point percentage (67 percent) because he had made 6 of 9 attempts entering the game. He did not attempt a 3 against the Jazz. ""He has an unusual skill as a 5 man that we can use from time to time,"" Brown said. Embiid was again on a 24-minute restriction following two seasons off because of a broken right foot. ""I want to play more but it's on them,"" Embiid said.","400899543"
"WASHINGTON -- James Harden was not about to let one rough half ruin his evening. And the Houston Rockets' star guard figures he has enough help around the court that the points are bound to flow for himself and the rest of his team. Harden set aside a slow start to finish with 32 points and 15 assists -- his fourth straight 30-10 game -- and led the Rockets past the slumping Washington Wizards 114-106 on Monday night. ""Chemistry with everybody is getting there,"" Harden said after helping Houston improve to 4-3, with help from Ryan Anderson's 23 points, Trevor Ariza's 15 and Clint Capela's 14. ""It's just predicated on me making the right decision."" Washington's John Wall broke Hall of Fame center Wes Unseld's franchise record for career assists before getting ejected with 33.3 seconds left and his team trailing by five en route to falling to 1-5. Official Marc Davis explained the reason for Wall's second technical foul this way via a pool report: ""After granting the team a timeout, I felt that there was contact and that he bumped me. I wasn't certain of his intent. I told him to watch himself. He looked over his shoulder and used vulgarity and inappropriate language."" Wall left with 21 points and eight assists. ""I didn't do a good job of helping us win,"" he said. Harden shot just 1 for 4 and had five turnovers in the opening period, which ended with Washington ahead 30-23, and had only seven points by halftime. But he got more and more involved at the offensive end and scored eight consecutive Houston points in one stretch of the fourth quarter, including half of a 12-0 run that gave the Rockets a 106-95 lead with a little more than 3 1/2 minutes left. ""He uses his body well. He's a strong guy. He gets away with a few push-offs, here and there, but that's just the nature of his character,"" Washington's Bradley Beal said. ""Got to give credit where it's due: He was struggling in the first half, pretty much almost the whole game, until the last quarter and a half."" Harden, who entered the day leading the NBA in assists at 12.3 per game and fourth in scoring average at 31.5 points, made all 11 free throws against Washington. ""He's not going to go through a whole game where he's not back on track to a degree,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. TIP-INS Rockets: Harden scored at least 40 points both times Houston faced Washington last season. ... Fs Ariza and Nene both used to play for Washington. Nene, who went from the Wizards to the Rockets this offseason, was greeted with applause when he entered as a substitute in the first quarter; he finished with four points and four rebounds in 21 minutes. Wizards: F Markieff Morris missed his first nine shots and wound up with seven points on 3-for-14 shooting. WALL'S RECORD Wall entered the game three assists shy of the club mark of 3,822 assists and tied it in the first quarter. Wall then eclipsed Unseld by feeding Beal during a 12-2 stretch to open the third quarter. ""It don't mean nothing to me right now, because I didn't win the game,"" said Wall, in his seventh NBA season since being the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 draft. ""But it's an honor, and I have a lot of basketball left to play.""","400899544"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  There was a point midway through the first quarter when Paul George began to wonder if the Indiana Pacers were ever going to keep the Charlotte Hornets from scoring. Kemba Walker had 24 points and 10 assists, and the Hornets scored on their first 12 possessions to build a 21-point lead in the first quarter on their way to a 122-100 rout of the listless Pacers on Monday night. Charlotte scored on every possession until Marvin Williams missed a jumper with 5:48 left in the first. By that point, the Hornets led 30-14 and were already on their way to a lopsided victory. ""We couldn't get a stop and we couldn't get a break,"" George said. ""It's concerning that they are scoring and no one cares. No one cares. We are looking bad. We are terrible right now."" Charlotte, meanwhile, is looking pretty good under fourth-year coach Steve Clifford. The Hornets (5-1) tied a 23-year franchise record with 75 points in the first half on 56.5 percent shooting and are off to the best start in franchise history. Charlotte scored 35 points off 18 Indiana turnovers. ""We know the formula,"" said Charlotte center Spencer Hawes, who had 13 points and 13 rebounds. ""The way we move the ball when we're playing defense, we'll do well. That's what we have to do moving forward because when we do that, we do pretty well."" Charlotte's starters were 17 of 25 from the field before halftime as the Hornets established a 20-point lead and never looked back. ""We're all out of whack. There's no trust, there's no chemistry, there's no belief. We're kind of just lifeless right now,"" George said. TIP-INS Pacers: C.J. Miles led the Pacers with 23 points, while Al Jefferson had 12 points and nine rebounds in his return to Charlotte. ... Indiana shot only 15 free throws, compared to Charlotte's 32. Hornets: Have won four straight against the Pacers. ... Treveon Graham scored his first NBA points when he knocked down a 3-pointer from the left wing. KIDD-GILCHRIST HURTS BACK Michael Kidd-Gilchrist made all four shots from the field and all five free throws and had 13 points before leaving the game in the third quarter with a lower back injury. Clifford said Kidd-Gilchrist is day to day. ""He's sore,"" Clifford said. ""He wanted to keep playing. But he was laboring out there and we can't have him hurt. He's been sore. Hopefully, he'll get treatment and we'll see how he feels."" ROAD WOES Indiana is 0-4 on the road this season, losing those games by an average margin of 16.5 points. Pacers coach Nate McMillan said he can't explain his team's inconsistency away from home. ""We play a really good ballgame (against Miami) and we get on the road and we haven't even been in these games,"" McMillan said. ""It's something we need to look at."" TOUCHING TRIBUTE The Hornets put together a nice video tribute to Jefferson and showed it on the scoreboard during the first quarter. The crowd responded with a standing ovation. Jefferson played three seasons for the Hornets before signing last offseason with the Pacers. ""It was very touching. It was cool,"" Jefferson said. ""It was good to know that they appreciate the time I spent here. It was cool and I was glad to see it."" PICK AND ROLL The Hornets effectively used the pick and roll to beat the Pacers. ""It gets back to the same thing -- when we're taking 3s when the ball hits the paint and we have the ability to go to the basket, where we're very difficult to guard,"" Clifford said. ""When we have those possessions where the ball sticks a little bit or it's not a good screen or not a good attack and you play around the perimeter ... then you put no pressure on the defense.""","400899545"
"CHICAGO --  Jimmy Butler and the Chicago Bulls were pushed by the Orlando Magic in the third quarter, and their response delighted coach Fred Hoiberg. Butler scored 20 points, Taj Gibson had 16 points and 11 rebounds, and the Bulls routed the Magic 112-80 on Monday night. Dwyane Wade also scored 16 points and Doug McDermott finished with 11 for Chicago, which had dropped three straight. Wade went 7 for 12 from the field in 25 minutes, bouncing back nicely from a dismal four-point performance in Saturday's 111-94 loss at Indiana. The Bulls held the Magic to 23 percent shooting and 28 points in the second half. ""We're not going to win too many ballgames if our defense is not doing what it did,"" Wade said. Orlando had won three straight, but it played listless defense as Chicago pulled away in the third quarter. Aaron Gordon scored 15 points for the Magic, and Evan Fournier added 13 on 6-for-12 shooting. ""I just think our defense wasn't there,"" Gordon said. ""And then offensively, because our defense wasn't there, we didn't execute as well. Our defense bled into our offense."" Butler was a perfect 10 for 10 as the Bulls went 25 for 31 at the free-throw line, compared to 5 for 6 for the Magic. The Bulls have made at least 20 free throws in their last four games and five of their first seven. ""We scored the ball decently well,"" Butler said. ""But whenever we're guarding we make the game a lot easier for ourselves."" Chicago led by as many as 17 points in the first half, but Gordon had a cutting dunk and Fournier made a 3-pointer to help Orlando close to 63-58 in the third. The Bulls then ripped off the next 13 points, and the Magic never threatened again. Gibson, Rajon Rondo and Robin Lopez closed the run with three straight layups, making it 76-58 with 6:05 left. ""We turned the ball over too much and they made all the hustle plays,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""If you're going to win on the road, you have to make all the hustle plays and you have to take care of the ball."" McDermott and Butler each converted a three-point play to help Chicago to an 88-63 lead heading into the final period. The Magic shot 4 for 21 in the third and committed six turnovers in the quarter. ""That's the defensive mindset that we have to have for the entire game,"" Hoiberg said. TIP-INS Magic: Nikola Vucevic had 11 points and six rebounds. ... The Magic shot 39 percent (33 for 85) from the field. ... Asked about the discrepancy at the line, Vogel responded: ""I have no comments, we will discuss that through proper channels."" Bulls: Isaiah Canaan provided some energy off the bench and finished with 10 points. ... Butler had seven assists and five rebounds. ... The Bulls outrebounded the Magic 56-39. FAST START The Bulls used a 15-0 run to grab a 37-24 lead after one. The first quarter has been key for Chicago so far this season. The Bulls allowed 20 points in the first quarter in each of their first three games, all wins. They allowed at least 31 in each of the previous three games, all losses. ""It's as simple as that,"" Hoiberg said. ""Need to get off to a good start. When we do that we generally play a good game."" COMING UP The Bulls picked up a little momentum heading into a difficult stretch. Eight of Chicago's next nine games are on the road, including Wade's return to Miami on Thursday night after he signed with his hometown Bulls in the offseason.","400899546"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Even without another scoring outburst from Russell Westbrook, the Oklahoma City Thunder easily handled Miami. Westbrook had just 14 points -- 19 below his season average entering the game -- but the Thunder still beat the Heat 97-85 on Monday night. Enes Kanter had 24 points and 10 rebounds, shooting 10 of 12 in 21 minutes off the bench. Victor OIadipo scored 17 and rookie Domantas Sabonis had a season-high 15 points to go with 10 rebounds for Oklahoma City. Westbrook finished with 11 assists, and his control of the action helped the Thunder build a 22-point lead after three quarters. He didn't play in the fourth. ""He's always looking for his teammates,"" Kanter said. ""He's looking to score, but he knows that he's going to get double-teamed, triple-teamed. They cannot guard him. There's no one guy in the league that can guard him 1-on-1. He's making himself better, and he's making everybody else better on the team."" Oklahoma City improved to 6-1, the best seven-game start for the franchise since moving to Oklahoma City in 2008. Miami's Hassan Whiteside, who entered averaging 20 points and 14.2 rebounds, finished with five points on 1-for-9 shooting and 12 rebounds. Westbrook said Thunder center Steven Adams played well against Whiteside. ""Steven did a good job of buckling down, using his size, using his ability to be able to use his body and his strength to match,"" Westbrook said. James Johnson led the Heat with 18 points. Miami shot just 36.9 percent from the field. ""You have to give them credit defensively,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""They've shown this year they're long, they're athletic, they make multiple efforts."" The Thunder led 55-47 at halftime, despite Westbrook's 2-for-10 shooting. The Heat chopped their deficit down to four before Westbrook went off. He converted a three-point play, a mid-range jumper and a 3-pointer to spark a 20-0 run that put the game out of reach. ""He's a great player, so he's going to have his fingerprints on the game one way or another,"" Spoelstra said. ""It's a matter of time, and you have to find a way as competitors to overcome all of that, and we didn't."" --- TIP-INS Heat: Former Thunder player Dion Waiters was cheered loudly during pregame introductions. He scored two points on 1-for-9 shooting. ... Whiteside had no points or rebounds in the first quarter. ... Double technicals were called on Kanter and Miami's Josh Richardson in the third quarter after an altercation. Heat C Willie Reed was called for a flagrant foul on Kanter late in the third quarter. Thunder: Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said before the game that reserve point guard Cameron Payne is healing from his broken right foot, but there remains no timetable for his return. ... Adams banged his right thumb in the first quarter, but returned to play with it wrapped. HEAT UNIFORMS The Heat wore patches bearing the names of deceased military members on the front of their uniforms for the first time, a tribute that will continue for four more games. The ""Home Strong"" uniforms -- which have been worn before, without the soldier-name patches -- feature military insignia and patriotic symbols. Heat President Pat Riley founded the program to honor returning soldiers in 2006, and the franchise has been active with several veterans' programs since. ""It's just a very small part that we can play in this, to let them know that their lives did have significance,"" Spoelstra said. QUOTABLE Westbrook on Sabonis' performance: ""I was very, very happy for Domas. He stayed aggressive all night long. He missed some shots early, but he stayed consistent."" STAT LINES The Thunder held Miami to 7-for-24 shooting in the third quarter to take an 83-61 lead at the end of the period.","400899547"
"LOS ANGELES --  At 6-1, the Los Angeles Clippers are off to the best start in the history of a once-beleaguered franchise. They believe they can be even better. Chris Paul scored 24 points and made five of the Clippers' season-high 13 3-pointers in a 114-80 rout of the Pistons on Monday night, their 11th consecutive victory against Detroit. That's the Clippers' second-longest active winning streak against any opponent. ""We keep talking about not getting complacent,"" Paul said. ""One of the biggest things we keep talking about is finishing."" Both teams' starters rested in the fourth quarter, when Detroit's reserves never got closer than 34 points in the final minute. Andre Drummond had 15 points and 13 rebounds to lead Detroit, which shot 37 percent and went 4 for 12 on 3-pointers in its worst loss of the young season. ""This game will bother me for a couple of days,"" Drummond said. ""You need to learn from a game like this and don't brush it off. You don't forget the embarrassment and you don't want to feel like that again."" J.J. Redick added 20 points, including three 3-pointers and all five of his free throws for the Clippers, who shot 54 percent. Blake Griffin just missed a triple-double with 13 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. Paul was 8 of 10 from the field and 3 of 4 at the free throw line. He had eight assists and six rebounds in a game featuring the NBA's top-ranked defenses. Los Angeles came in allowing an average of 90.7 points, while the Pistons were giving up 93 points per game. ""We get excited about stopping teams and trying to keep them under certain numbers,"" Paul said. ""That could be contagious all season."" The Clippers put the game away in the first quarter, scoring 17 straight points as part of a 24-2 run that extended their lead to 28-8. Griffin had eight in the 17-0 spurt in which five players scored. Los Angeles shot 67 percent in the period and ended it leading 33-15. ""Even when you're up 30 or 20, there shouldn't be a letup,"" Griffin said. The Clippers' bench kept up the pace in the second quarter, building a 47-19 lead to open the period, helped by consecutive 3-pointers from Wesley Johnson, Raymond Felton and Jamal Crawford. The team had five 3s in the period, which ended with a 10-0 run that sent the Clippers into halftime ahead 62-32. ""Nothing positive came out of this game. It's like starting at ground zero again,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""They dismantled us."" Los Angeles hit five 3-pointers in the third, stretching its lead to 91-53. The Clippers scored six straight on Griffin's free throw, Paul's step-back 3 in front of Detroit's bench and DeAndre Jordan's dunk off Griffin's alley-oop pass. TIP-INS Pistons: F Reggie Bullock missed playing against his old team because of a hip pointer. ... Detroit fell to 0-3 on the road. ... The 15 points in the first quarter were the fewest the Pistons have scored in any period this season, and their 32 at halftime was also a season low. Clippers: They hit a season-high seven 3-pointers in the first half, with Paul making all three of his attempts. ... Their only loss was to Oklahoma City by two points. ... Jordan had 10 rebounds and the Clippers controlled the boards, 46-39. ISH MISS Pistons guard Ish Smith was 1 of 9 from the floor and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed all six of his shots. ""I can't say what I want to say (about how we played), but they shot the ball well and we missed lots of shots,"" said Smith, who was averaging 10.5 points. ""They punched us in the mouth and they made it tough on us. We tried to keep it within striking distance but it got out of hand."" Caldwell-Pope came in averaging 12.8 points. SMALL CONSOLATION The only quarter the Pistons won was the fourth when their reserves outscored the Clippers' bench 29-23. Detroit outscored Los Angeles 40-32 in the paint and 13-2 on second-chance points. Detroit's lone lead of two points came early in the opening quarter. HE SAID IT ""I don't want to forget this game until we fix it. It was embarrassing."" -- Pistons reserve forward Stanley Johnson.","400899548"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Stephen Curry let it fly from the top of the arc, backpedaled as his record-breaking 3-ball dropped and then wildly began bobbing his head and shuffling his feet with the swagger of a two-time reigning MVP. Add another remarkable achievement to a long list of them for Curry: most 3-pointers in one game. The star guard sank 13 to set an NBA mark -- one game after missing all his 3-point tries for the first time in two years -- and the Golden State Warriors beat the winless New Orleans Pelicans 116-106 on Monday. ""This was a special night,"" Curry said. He finished with 46 points, three days after his league-record streak of 157 games with at least one 3 was snapped when he went 0 for 10 on 3-point tries in a 117-97 road loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. ""I was hard on myself in practice the last two days. I had pretty good shooting sessions,"" he said. ""I don't overreact to games like that whether I go 0 for 10 or 2 for 12 or whatever it is. My process is the same, but I had another level of focus the last two days trying to get my rhythm back and see the ball go in."" Curry shot 13 of 17 from beyond the arc in his seventh career game with double-digit 3s. He broke the mark with 2:23 to go and bobbed his head in delight as the crowd roared. Curry shared the previous 3-point record of 12 with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall. ""Nothing you can do about it. He was being Steph,"" Pelicans star Anthony Davis said. Grabbing back the spotlight from new Golden State star Kevin Durant, Curry raised his right arm and pumped his chest all night, howling and pointing as one shot fell after another. He went 16 for 26 overall in his first 40-point performance after leading the NBA with 13 last season. Warriors fans enjoyed every minute of it, chanting ""M-V-P! M-V-P!"" ""That was quite a show. Not at all surprising the way Steph bounces back from bad nights,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. Klay Thompson had 24 points with two 3s as the Splash Brothers looked far more in sync from long range at last. Durant added 22 for the Warriors. Davis had 33 points and 13 rebounds for New Orleans (0-7), which along with the 76ers (0-6) are the NBA's lone teams still without a victory. Davis gave the Pelicans a 73-72 lead on a turnaround hook shot with 4:14 left in the third quarter. Davis had 45 points, 17 rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks in the teams' initial matchup on Oct. 28. Draymond Green had his second double-double with 12 rebounds and 11 assists for the Warriors, who were back at Oracle Arena after they embarrassed the Oklahoma City Thunder 122-96 there in Durant's first game against his former team last Thursday. Thompson -- 2 for 10 against the Lakers from 3-point range, a combined 0 of 13 vs. Phoenix and Portland and 9 of 46 overall (19.6 percent) this season coming in -- missed his first three attempts before hitting from the baseline late in the second quarter as the sellout crowd went crazy. Curry knocked down his first 3-point attempt at the 7:29 mark of the first quarter. He received a technical with 1:45 left in the third for arguing he was fouled by Davis on a 3-point attempt. TIP-INS Pelicans: E'Twaun Moore added 15 points. ... The Pelicans signed veteran G Archie Goodwin and waived injured G Lance Stephenson, scheduled to have surgery to repair his torn groin in Philadelphia on Tuesday. ... New Orleans lost for the 15th time in the past 16 games against Golden State. Warriors: David West appeared in his 900th regular-season game, one of 22 active players to reach the number. ...

Former Warriors player and coach Al Attles celebrated his 80th birthday, receiving a video tribute and the birthday song with cupcakes after the first quarter. DURANT'S MARK Durant has scored 20 or more points in 71 straight regular-season games, matching Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the fifth-longest streak in NBA history. ANNIVERSARY Monday marked 70 years to the day since the Warriors played their first game in franchise history .

"CLEVELAND --  The Cleveland Cavaliers were handed a surprise Tuesday night. Dennis Schroder scored a career-high 28 points and the Atlanta Hawks gave the reigning NBA champions their first loss of the season, 110-106. Cleveland (6-1) cut into two large second-half deficits, but Atlanta converted clutch shots down the stretch. ""It was a weird game,"" said LeBron James, who scored 23 points after having only two in the first half. Atlanta led by 18 points in the third quarter before Cleveland cut the margin to two. The Hawks rebuilt the lead to 15 early in the fourth, but the Cavaliers got within two with 25 seconds remaining. Kent Bazemore, who scored 25 points, hit a jumper from the corner with 7 seconds left and put the game away. ""They've dominated the Eastern Conference for a long time now,"" Bazemore said. ""They're definitely the measuring stick, and we passed our first test tonight."" Atlanta had lost 11 straight to Cleveland, including playoff sweeps the last two seasons. ""For my two years here, they've kicked our butts,"" Bazemore said. ""This is one of the biggest wins I've had since I've been here."" Paul Millsap scored 21 points for Atlanta. Dwight Howard, who received four stitches for a bloody lip in the first half, had 17 rebounds. ""Give them a lot of credit,"" James said. ""They played a heck of a game. You know toward the end of the season they'll be right there."" Kyrie Irving led Cleveland with 29 points while Love added 24, but the Cavaliers were 11 of 42 on 3-point attempts. ""I think they might have had one of those nights, but our guys were really committed out there,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Our defense in the first half gave us a cushion, and we were able to hold them off."" Cleveland cut a 96-81 deficit to 101-97 on James' basket with 3:14 to play. The Hawks scored the next six points, but 3-pointers by James and Irving made it 106-103 with 48 seconds left. Milsap's basket pushed the lead to five, but Love converted a three-point play with 25 seconds remaining  before Bazemore hit his clutch shot. Atlanta finished the second quarter on a 22-6 run to lead 53-42. James didn't score until he hit a jumper late in the first half. Atlanta scored the first five points of the third quarter and stretched the lead to 58-42. Hawks guard Kyle Korver did not travel to Cleveland after the birth of his third child Sunday. TIP-INS Hawks: Korver is expected to play Wednesday night when Atlanta hosts Chicago. ... C Mike Muscala took a hard fall to the court after a dunk in the first quarter but remained in the game. ... F Mike Scott (left knee) and C Tiago Splitter (right hamstring) remain sidelined, leaving Atlanta with 12 active players. Cavaliers: F Tristan Thompson was scoreless with two rebounds in 25 minutes. .. .G J.R. Smith scored six points and was 2 of 13 from the field. ... Cleveland Indians players Jason Kipnis, Carlos Santana and Michael Brantley attended the game. QUEST FOR HISTORY James is averaging just under a triple-double, leading to the question if he can do it for an entire season. ""I don't want to say it's impossible, but if there is anyone who can average a triple-double in this day and age, it's LeBron,"" Budenholzer said. BIG MAN Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue believes signing Howard is an important addition for Atlanta. ""They have a dominant post presence,"" Lue said. ""He's very physical. Sometimes he demands double-teams if he gets deep in the paint. He's going to drive fouls on your big men. They also have a shot blocker.""","400899550"
"NEW YORK --  No matter how much Tom Thibodeau screamed, his Minnesota Timberwolves clearly aren't hearing his message about defense. Kenny Atkinson sure liked what he saw from his offense. Brook Lopez scored 26 points, and the Brooklyn Nets kept the Timberwolves winless on the road with a 119-110 victory Tuesday night. The Nets shot 55.3 percent from the field and had eight players with at least nine points, the kind of movement and involvement that Atkinson wanted to bring to Brooklyn from his time as an Atlanta assistant. ""We're sharing the wealth a little more and in the perfect Utopian motion system, that's what it should look like, where it's really everybody's touching it,"" Atkinson said. It led to a surprisingly easy offensive performance against a young Wolves team that clearly hasn't yet grasped Thibodeau's defensive schemes. Thibodeau, whose teams in Chicago were among the NBA's strongest defensively, said 110 points is ""more than enough to win."" ""Unless we correct the defensive end, it's going to be a struggle,"" he said. ""That has to become a priority by everyone, otherwise nothing positive is going to happen."" Trevor Booker added 15 points and Sean Kilpatrick had 14 for the Nets. Andrew Wiggins scored a career-high 36 points for the Wolves, making a career-best six 3-pointers. Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points, but scoring wasn't the problem for Minnesota. The Wolves are 0-4 on the road and just 1-5 overall. ""We keep hearing we're young, that's why we're playing the way we play,"" Towns said. ""That's not the reason. We're just not executing."" It was close most of the way, neither team having much luck stopping the other, and the Nets' lead was just two after Wiggins' jumper with 56 seconds left. Bojan Bogdanovic then made a 3-pointer with 37 seconds to go for a 115-110 lead, and Isaiah Whitehead and Bogdanovic closed it out with free throws. Without injured point guards Jeremy Lin (strained left hamstring) and Greivis Vasquez (sore right ankle), the Nets got a scare in the first quarter when starter Whitehead had to leave the game after he fell onto the court and Gorgui Dieng accidentally stepped on his face. But the second-round draft pick from Brooklyn was able to return shortly after and had six points, seven rebounds and seven assists. ""That's the toughness we need and that's the definition of Brooklyn grit right there,"" Lopez said. The Nets shot 62 percent in the first half and led 66-65 despite 19 points from Towns. TIP-INS Timberwolves: The Timberwolves lost for just the fifth time in the last 15 meetings. ... Wiggins' previous career-bests were 35 points and four 3-pointers. Nets: Randy Foye made his Nets debut after beginning the season with a strained right hamstring, scoring three points. ... Bogdanovic and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson each had 13 points. EAST MEETS WEST The Nets were playing their first Western Conference opponent in their seventh game, the longest they had gone into a season since moving to Brooklyn in 2012. The Wolves were playing their first East team. SKILLED KILPATRICK The Timberwolves once signed Kilpatrick in part because they were so short-handed they needed another player just to meet NBA rules of having eight in uniform, and he was playing in the NBA Development League close enough to arrive on time. Now he entered the game as the NBA's highest-scoring reserve with 17 points per game. ""He's still the guy that would get in a car and go to any game at any place,"" Atkinson said. ""That guy, he's just a competitor. He's grinded through some tough times to get where he is and then he just keeps blossoming and we're giving him a lot of responsibility and he's answering the bell.""","400899551"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Trailing by one point, the Memphis Grizzlies had no timeouts and little time. For the oldest player in the NBA, the obstacles were simply a welcome challenge. Thirty-nine-year-old Vince Carter tossed a perfectly timed, and expertly lobbed, inbounds pass to 7-footer Marc Gasol and he dropped in a shot as the buzzer sounded to lift the Grizzlies to a 108-107 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night. Gasol's basket came over Emmanuel Mudiay on a high-arcing pass from Carter underneath the Memphis goal. When Carter inbounded the ball there were 0.7 seconds left. ""I had progressions, I had a couple of options, but I just had to be patient while still keeping the 5-second violation in mind,"" Carter said. ""It's a stressful situation, but I've been in it before. I know how to relax and take my time."" Carter scored 20 points, while Gasol had 19 for the Grizzlies, who had lost two straight. Zach Randolph added 16 points. Mudiay had 23 points and Danilo Gallinari added 21 for the Nuggets. Mudiay appeared to have led the Nuggets to a victory when he stripped the ball from Mike Conley and converted a fastbreak layup with 7.9 seconds left. Memphis' James Ennis followed with an errant pass out of bounds. But Conley came up with a steal in the closing seconds and drove the length of the court before the ball was knocked out of bounds by Denver with 0.7 seconds to go. That set the stage for the Carter-to-Gasol game-winner. ""The play was executed to perfection,"" Carter said. ""I just wanted to put it up there where only Marc could get it and let him take care of the rest."" Gasol said the key to the play was the experience of Carter ""The guy guarding the inbounds pass jumped too early,"" Gasol said. ""That opened up the passing angle and Vince made a great pass."" Mudiay said he didn't know what the breakdown defensively was on the game-winning shot by Gasol. ""It just happens sometimes,"" Mudiay said. ""Some games end like that, some games don't end like that."" The Grizzlies went up 83-76 early in the fourth quarter on a twisting layup by Jarell Martin and led by 95-88 following a driving layup by Andrew Harrison midway through the quarter. But the Nuggets battled back to take their first lead of the final period, 99-98, on a 3-pointer by Nikola Jokic, with 4:27 left. The lead changed hands six times in closing 5 minutes. ""We make it interesting, don't we?"" Grizzlies coach David Fizdale said. ""I'm just really proud of my guys handling adversity. Everything that could go wrong went wrong, but they just kept staying with it. They stayed in the moment."" The game was 56-all at the half. Denver shot 54 percent and outrebounded Memphis 23-17 to overcome 10 turnovers. Those Nuggets' mistakes led to 16 Grizzlies' points. Memphis fell behind by seven points in the opening minutes, but recovered behind a 12-0 run in which free-agent pickup Chandler Parsons, playing in only his second game, scored his first points of the season. Parsons went 0 for 8 in Sunday's game against Portland, but had consecutive layups in a 26-second span of the first quarter. The Grizzlies built a 42-35 lead midway through the second quarter before the Nuggets closed to tie the game. TIP-INS Nuggets: G Will Barton, who played at the University of Memphis, did not play because of an ankle injury. ... Wilson Chandler participated in parts of Tuesday's shootaround, but did not play. He is recovering from a left hamstring injury. Grizzlies: G Tony Allen was placed on the inactive list before the game with a right groin injury. ...

TURNAROUND The Grizzlies entered the game ranked last in the NBA in field goal percentage, but shot 51.2 percent. The Grizzlies scored 58 points in the paint.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The scoreboard may say victory, but Damian Lillard sees work to do. Lillard scored 38 points, making key free throws in the waning seconds, and the Portland Trail Blazers held off the Phoenix Suns for a 124-121 victory on Tuesday night. After leading by 18 points early, it shouldn't have been so close at the end, Lillard said. ""We talk about just being able to play the way we want to play for longer spans of time,"" he said. ""We'll play really well for seven minutes, and then in four minutes we'll give up a 15-2 run and give up everything we just worked for. We got to continue to work on that. The good thing is, we're able to find a way to win games while we work on it."" CJ McCollum added 33 points for the Blazers, who have won three straight. Lillard hit a 3-pointer with 6:45 left that put Portland in front 101-95. Eric Bledsoe made a free throw to pull Phoenix within 115-114 with just under a minute left, but he missed the second attempt that would have tied it and Lillard scored a layup on the other end. Bledsoe hit two free throws to again get within a point, but Lillard was fouled with 13.3 seconds left and made both to put Portland up 119-116. Devin Booker made a 3-pointer that pulled the Suns within 122-121 but Lillard again hit two free throws with 3.7 seconds left and Booker missed from some 25 feet has time ran out. Bledsoe finished with 31 points and Booker had 23. ""It's not tough for us to come back, we come back a lot,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""That's what we do. Our team is really close and we have a lot of belief."" The Suns, who opened the season with four straight losses before winning two of their last three, were without Tyson Chandler because of personal reasons. Chandler has been in double-digit rebounds in three of the last four games. Watson started rookie Marquese Chriss, who was making his first career start. Chriss, who finished with seven points, was a first-round draft pick (eighth overall) out of Washington by the Sacramento Kings, acquired by the Suns in a draft-day trade. Portland was hurt when they lost starting forward Al-Farouq Aminu to a left calf strain early and he did not return. Aminu is averaging seven points and 7.9 rebounds this season. Aminu said after the game that he was unlikely to play on Wednesday when the Blazers visit the Clippers. McCollum hit his first six shots, including three 3-pointers, and the Blazers jumped out to a 27-12 lead. McCollum matched his career high with 37 points in Portland's 100-94 victory at Memphis on Sunday. Booker had 39 points in the Suns' 119-108 loss at the Lakers on Sunday, after scoring 38 in a 112-111 overtime victory over New Orleans on Friday, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to have back-to-back games with at least 38 points. TIP-INS Suns: The Suns beat the Blazers 118-115 in overtime last week in Phoenix. The teams play four games this season. Trail Blazers: Portland made 12 of its first 13 field goal attempts. ... It was the second time in his career that McCollum has had back-to-back games with 30 or more points. MENTOR AND FRIEND: Watson played his final NBA season with Portland and grew close to Lillard. The summer before last, when the Blazers lost four starters and Lillard was the last remaining starter on the roster, Watson said the two talked and he told Lillard he needed to be a leader on and off the court. Lillard responded by organizing a team bonding trip to San Diego and the young Blazers went on to go 44-38 and advance to the second round of the playoffs. ""That is when you saw this young group become something else,"" Watson said. FAST START: Lillard has scored 262 points so far this season, the most through the first eight games of a season in franchise history. It is also the most by an NBA player since Kobe Bryant had 264 through the first eight in 2009-10.","400899553"
"LOS ANGELES --  After four seasons in the Golden State Warriors' supporting cast, Harrison Barnes is seizing his opportunity to be the main man in Dallas. Barnes scored 31 points, Seth Curry added 23 and the Mavericks won their second straight game after an 0-5 start, 109-97 over the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night. Two days after Barnes scored a career-best 34 in the Mavs' victory over Milwaukee, he hit 11 of 18 shots at Staples Center while leading Dallas past the Lakers for the 11th consecutive time since April 2, 2013. Barnes scored seven consecutive points after Los Angeles took a lead with 7 1/2 minutes to play, and his teammates finished it off. ""I'm just being aggressive,"" Barnes said. ""That was the biggest thing in my first few games (with the Mavs), figuring out when to be aggressive and when not to. You just kind of have to leave the switch on, and if you fail, fail aggressively."" It's working: Barnes has scored 30 points three times in Dallas' last six games after hitting that mark once in his first four seasons with Golden State. After getting their first win of the season Sunday against Milwaukee, the Mavs won again without injured Dirk Nowitzki and Deron Williams. Nowitzki missed his second straight game with a sore Achilles tendon, while Williams missed his second straight game with a strained calf muscle. Dallas used only eight players in LA, but it was enough. ""This is two team efforts, just scrappy and grinding,"" Barnes said. ""Everyone is getting in the mix offensively and defensively. It's not always pretty basketball, but we're getting it done, and that's the most rewarding thing about it."" JJ Barea had 18 points, seven rebounds and eight assists for the Mavericks, who beat the Lakers on the road for the sixth straight time. ""Our guys stuck to a game plan of tempo and patience and discipline, and they won the game,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said.

Carlisle, who still calls him Ron, said World Peace has reached out to him to ask questions about coaching. ... Mavs rookie Dorian Finney-Smith had five points in his first NBA start. Lakers: Luke Walton coached Barnes and Curry as an assistant with Golden State. ... Luol Deng scored two points in 30 minutes, going 1 for 5. ... Julius Randle had 15 points and 10 rebounds, but also committed six turnovers. LAKERS LOSS Jordan Clarkson scored 22 points and Nick Young had 20 as the Lakers' three-game winning streak ended with 17 turnovers and some late-game struggles. Lou Williams scored 15 points for Los Angeles, which rallied from an 11-point deficit in the second half before failing to execute in the final minutes. ""I thought we did a little better job in the second half fighting,"" Walton said. ""I thought we were a little soft in the first half. We had our chances."" Young scored 13 points in the first 3:15, staking the Lakers to an early lead. Dallas scored the final 11 points of the half to move ahead 58-54. HEADING BACK Barnes had his latest monster game one night before he returned to Oakland to take on the Golden State Warriors for the first time since leaving as a free agent during the summer. Barnes was a key player on the Warriors' 2015 championship team and last season's runner-up, but left after the Warriors renounced his rights when they landed Kevin Durant. When asked if the homecoming was anything special, Barnes said: ""Nah. ... It's another game. We're 2-5, so it's another game. Trying to 3-5 and go back home."" SHORT-LIVED The Lakers (4-4) had moved above .500 for just the second time since Dec. 6, 2013, with a victory over Phoenix on Sunday. Los Angeles also hadn't won three straight games since the 2012-13 season, but couldn't make it four.","400899554"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Although DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay were once again the primary weapons for Sacramento, the Kings displayed their depth in beating the winless New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night. Cousins had 11 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and Gay finished with 21 points for the Kings, who never trailed in defeating the Pelicans 102-94. Aaron Afflalo added 15 points and made a huge four-point play in the fourth quarter for the Kings. The return of suspended point guard Darren Collison was also a factor in the victory, along with a bench that contributed great energy and 32 points. Afflalo is still assimilating offensively, but looked more confident, getting open for 3s and posting up. He made all three shots in the first half and finished 5 of 6. ""He was fantastic,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""If I'm him, I'm thinking -- `If Coach would have called more plays for me I would had had 30 points.' He had 15 points on six shots, that's pretty efficient."" It was the second straight victory for the Kings (4-5), who were 1-7 in their first eight games last season. The Kings are 2-1 at home this season and this was the first in a string of seven of eight home games. ""That's one of our main goals this year, take care of home court,"" Afflalo said. Anthony Davis had 34 points, eight rebounds and four blocks for the Pelicans, who have started the season with eight straight losses, matching the 2004-05 team for the worst start in franchise history. Rookie guard Buddy Hield had 12 of his 14 points in the fourth quarter and E'Twaun Moore added 13. It's been a miserable start to the season for New Orleans, which is without three starters -- Jrue Holiday (personal reasons), Tyreke Evans (right knee) and Quincy Poindexter (left knee). ""We just have to play better. There's just no way of getting around it,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""The effort is good and I talked to the guys about the fact that I love the way we are playing hard. But we all have to play smart. In some cases we are not playing smart."" After Hield scored six straight points to pull the Pelicans within five, Afflalo hit a 3 and was fouled. He made the free throw, completing a four-point play and giving the Kings a 97-88 lead with 45 seconds left. ""For me, I'm still trying to adjust to how to be efficient, and not get frustrated with a lack of rhythm and just play through it,"" Afflalo said. ""I don't come into a game with expectations. It depends on the situation regarding how much I shoot."" Despite 14 points from Davis, the Pelicans could not cut into the Kings' lead and still trailed 76-70 entering the fourth. ""I'm not use to this at all. But it's a long season,"" Hield said. ""We just have to stay confident. We're 0-8 right now, but we're going to find a way and we are going to break through this. We have a lot of games left. All we need is a win to build our confidence up."" Collison, who entered the game late in the opening quarter,  had nine points in his first game this season. He missed the first eight games, serving a suspension for a domestic violence incident in the summer. After an unproductive first half, Collison picked up his offense in the third quarter when he scored seven points and helped the Kings maintain their lead. He finished with four assists and two steals in 27 minutes. ""I think the best part of the day was earlier this morning,"" Collison said. ""I came into the locker room and my teammates were waiting and started cheering. That made me feel real good and the fans embraced me. It felt really good to be out there and be with my teammates."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Due to a foul that put them over the limit and wasn't noticed, the final 18.9 seconds of the first half were replayed after intermission. The replay led to a five-point halftime lead rather than a three-point lead by the Kings. ... Hield struggled in the first half, missing his first four shots and had two first-half points. Kings: Cousins, who has seen his rebounds totals dip this year, had four boards. ... Reserve Willie Cauley-Stein had five fouls in 13 minutes, but also contributed nine points and three blocks. ... The Kings shot 8 of 25 on 3s, but made 48 percent of their shots overall.","400899555"
"Kristaps Porzingis swats Justin Hamilton and then dunks it while drawing the foul on the ensuing possession. (0:36) NEW YORK --  Carmelo Anthony wasn't making enough shots and the Brooklyn Nets weren't missing many. Once that changed, the Knicks had an easy time in the first matchup this season between the New York rivals. Anthony scored 14 of his 22 points in the third quarter and Kristaps Porzingis added 21 in the Knicks' 110-96 victory Wednesday night. Rookie center Willy Hernangomez had a season-best 14 points, Derrick Rose also scored 14 and New York climbed out of a 14-point hole by holding the Nets to 27.5 percent shooting in the second half. ""Our bench guys were great,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""They came in there, brought the energy, Melo got hot there in that third quarter and was rolling, so great second half for our guys to see what putting pressure and getting after it defensively can do for your team."" Brook Lopez and Justin Hamilton each scored 21 points for the Nets, who wilted on the second night of back-to-back games after a strong first half. Normally a good fourth-quarter team, they were outscored 38-25 while struggling to run their offense without an experienced NBA point guard. New York, which came in allowing 109.8 points per game to rank 26th in the league, had more problems on that end in the first half but dominated the second. And the Knicks got strong performances off their bench, with Brandon Jennings posting 11 assists and Hernangomez shooting 6 for 7. The Nets, who set season highs for points and shooting percentage (55.3 percent) in their 119-110 victory over Minnesota on Tuesday, shot 55 percent in the first half and led 55-50. Then Anthony, just 3 for 11 at halftime, had a baseline drive with the Knicks down nine and then turned to his jumper. He made five of them and then a pair of free throws, putting up 14 points in the final 5 minutes to give the Knicks a 72-71 lead. ""But even after that stretch it was a one-point game,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Then I felt like the real difference was again their bench coming in and just took us out of our stuff."" Hernangomez provided a spark before Porzingis made a pair of 3-pointers and threw down a dunk while getting fouled as the lead grew to 92-78. ""Melo got it going. He probably had like 10 or 12 straight at one point, so that kind of just enlightened the whole team,"" Jennings said. ""And then we were just taking care of the defensive end and then just finding KP coming down for transition 3s and then he got an and-1 dunk, so we were just clicking tonight."" TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn opened a five-game trip by falling to 0-3 on the road. ... Sean Kilpatrick made his first career start in his 43rd game. He came in averaging 16.6 points, tops among reserves. Knicks: New York improved to 93-91 against the Nets. Brooklyn had won six of eight meetings over the previous two seasons. POINT GUARD PROBLEMS Brooklyn rookie Isaiah Whitehead, who had been starting at point guard with Jeremy Lin sidelined by a strained left hamstring, was placed in the concussion protocol, a night after hitting his head on the court. He finished that game but had a headache and experienced symptoms Wednesday. He will be out until he is symptom free and has passed the NBA's protocols. The Nets also waived point guard Greivis Vasquez, who struggled to recover from ankle problems, and recalled Yogi Ferrell from their NBA Development League team to make his NBA debut. HIT THE ROAD The Nets only had to go about 5 miles to start this road trip, and they have an even shorter segment during it. They play a back-to-back in the same building, facing the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday and the Lakers the next night in Staples Center.","400899556"
"WASHINGTON -- Otto Porter didn't think much of ""Otto Porter"" chants in the final minutes of the Washington Wizards' 118-93 rout of the Boston Celtics. But they sure were familiar. Back in the same building he called home when he starred at Georgetown, Porter scored a career-high 34 points and had 14 rebounds Wednesday night. Porter shot 14 of 19 and 3 of 5 from 3-point territory, sparking the Wizards to a 26-point lead after a quarter -- an advantage that never dipped below 15 the rest of the way. ""Right now I'm trying to play at a high level every night,"" Porter said. ""I'm trying to do what it is I can do to help this team win."" Porter scored 20-plus for the second consecutive game and delivered the win he believed the Wizards (2-5) desperately needed. On a night Bradley Beal left with right hamstring tightness and John Wall was ejected for the second game in a row, Porter was the offensive and defensive catalyst with four assists, three steals and three blocks. ""He gives you a lot of winning basketball plays,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""You can look at his field goal percentage, you can look at all the things that he does in his midrange game, his 3-point shot's developed, his offensive rebounds."" Porter earned plenty of credit from the Celtics (3-4) for his energy all over the court. ""He outworked us, getting off his rebounds, put-backs,"" said Isaiah Thomas, who led Boston with 23 points. ""You've got to tip your hat to him, but they were running isolation plays for him and we just couldn't guard him."" SLOW START The Celtics started the game 4 of 22, including 0 of 8 from 3-point range, as the Wizards' 26-point lead was the largest by any NBA team after the first quarter this season. According to ESPN Stats and Info, Boston's eight points were its fewest in the first quarter since scoring seven against the Milwaukee Bucks in 1974. ""I didn't think there was a lack of purpose or focus,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""I thought we looked a little shook by them on offense."" WALL EJECTED Wall, who scored 19 points, was thrown out with 5:24 left when he was assessed a Flagrant-2 on video review for fouling Boston's Marcus Smart. It was his fifth career ejection but second in as many games, and Wall was also fined $25,000 on Wednesday for inappropriate actions toward an official when he was tossed from the Wizards' loss to Houston on Monday. ""We have to keep our composure,"" Brooks said. HORFORD PROGRESS Stevens said C Al Horford made some more progress in the league's concussion protocol Tuesday after the team left Boston. Horford has missed four consecutive games. ""The process restarts itself if you have symptoms when you start the different levels of exercise, so he's had to restart a few times already,"" Stevens said. TIP-INS Wizards: Beat the Celtics for the first time since Dec. 27, 2014, snapping a four-game skid. ... Brooks said Beal will have an MRI on his hamstring Thursday and that Wall wouldn't play either Friday against Cleveland or Saturday at Chicago. ... The team held a pregame moment of silence for Greg Ballard, a member of the 1978 NBA champion Bullets who died Wednesday at age 61. Celtics: C Kelly Olynyk played 25 minutes and scored two points in his season debut after undergoing right shoulder surgery in May. ...

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  They have been dubbed ""Bench Force One."" Charlotte's pesky, hard-nosed group of backups is paying big dividends for the Hornets early this season. They outscored Utah's reserves 41-20 in a 104-98 victory over the Jazz on Wednesday night. Kemba Walker scored 21 points and Marvin Williams had 19 for the Hornets, but it was the play of Marco Belinelli, Frank Kaminsky, Spencer Hawes and Ramon Sessions off the bench that proved to be the difference as Charlotte stretched its winning streak to four games. Belinelli and Kaminsky had 13 points each and Hawes added 11. ""They're good players. They fit together well,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""They have an identity off the bench with that group. They go to Marco coming off screens and he's hard to guard and then they post Kaminsky and Sessions in the pick and roll."" Kaminsky, by far the youngest of the crew in just his second season, shook off a viral infection to post a big night. Charlotte trailed most of the game, but he made an inside jumper to give the Hornets a lead with 7 minutes remaining that they wouldn't relinquish. He later knocked down a 3 from the top of the key. ""We talk about coming off the bench and providing energy,"" Kaminsky said. ""We know it all starts with defense and letting that lead to offense. It looks like we're doing a great job. It's been so much fun so far this season."" Charlotte's reserves are averaging 39 points per game this season despite Roy Hibbert and Jeremy Lamb being out with injuries. ""It's all about winning,"" Belinelli said. ""I think the guys from the bench, we try to bring energy on the court, we try to play together."" The Hornets (7-1) have the second-best record in the East behind the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers. The Hornets overcame a solid effort from Jazz guard Gordon Haywood, who finished with 29 points and seven rebounds. Rodney Hood had 20 points and Derrick Favors added 16 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Jazz: George Hill, who came in averaging more than 20 points per game, was unable to play due to a sprained right thumb. ... Hayward's 17 points in the first half were the most in a half by a Jazz player this season. ... The Jazz outrebounded the Hornets 46-37. Hornets: Coach Steve Clifford said he's optimistic Hibbert will able to return Friday night. He's missed the team's last five games with right knee soreness. ... Walker has scored in double figures in all seven games. ... It won't show up in the stat sheet, but Hornets C Cody Zeller battled hard in the paint and drew three fouls while battling for an offensive rebound. STRUGGLES FROM DEEP Snyder wasn't upset the Jazz attempted 34 shots from beyond the 3-point arc. He just wasn't thrilled that they missed 26 of them. ""We're not a team that takes bad 3's, so if we are taking that many it's because they're open,"" Snyder said. ""Some of them were good, clean looks and we just have to make them. Those are shots that we want to take."" WALKER STRONG LATE The Jazz kept Walker in check most of the game, but the East's third-leading scorer at 24.3 points per game began to find his touch in the fourth quarter. ""He started to bang some shots on us, but over the course of the game I thought we were really good against him,"" Hayward said. ""At the end of the game they just got in a groove, they got in a good rhythm."" ON THE ROAD AGAIN Joe Johnson isn't blaming the schedule for the Jazz's 5-4 start. Utah has played six games on the road this season. ""That has nothing to do with it,"" Johnson said. ""We controlled the most portion of the game, just in that second half, especially the fourth quarter, we just kind of let it get away from us.""","400899558"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Minnesota Timberwolves are a collection of young talented players who are still trying to figure out how to maintain big leads once they get them. Orlando, meanwhile, is just trying to find its way. On Wednesday night, the Timberwolves may have taken a critical step in their journey, while the Magic are looking like they have far more questions than answers after Minnesota jumped to a 30-point first-half lead before coming away with a 123-107 victory. Zach LaVine scored 37 points and Andrew Wiggins added 29 for the Timberwolves (2-5), who bounced back from a defensive meltdown a night earlier to record their first road win of the season. ""There is a small difference between winning and losing,"" said Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau, whose team snapped a three-game losing streak. ""You take a hard look at the mental mistakes. The biggest thing is eliminating all of the ways you beat yourself first."" For the Timberwolves that meant not doing the little things to squander 20-plus point leads as they have done this season. When the Magic pulled within 11 points in the second half, Minnesota consistently came up with plays to stretch the lead back to 20. Tyus Jones came off the bench to come up with a couple of key steals for Minnesota, which made 13 3-pointers. ""That's what you can be,"" LaVine said. ""It doesn't matter whose hitting in a game, we find the man with the hottest hand. We have so many dynamic players on this team. Once we get it all clicking you get a result like this tonight."" Coach Frank Vogel doesn't seem to have that luxury at this point as the Magic (3-5) got off to another slow start and found themselves vulnerable on defense all game. Orlando, which has lost two straight, allowed Minnesota to shoot nearly 52 percent from the field and 57 percent from 3-point range. ""We're working to correct (the letdowns), but we haven't figured it out yet,"" Vogel said. ""It's a long NBA season. Blowouts happen when you hit teams that are red hot. You hope you'll do better than we did tonight."" Karl-Anthony Towns dominated inside with 20 points and 11 rebounds while Shabazz Muhammad scored 13 points and Gorgui Dieng had 12. Nikola Vucevic led the Magic with 24 points and 14 rebounds, while Elfrid Payton had 18 points and Evan Fournier added 13. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota had lost eight straight in Orlando ...

Magic: Vogel got so frustrated with his starting unit that went to his bench quicker than usual, bringing in D.J. Augustin, Jeff Green and Bismack Biyomboa for Payton, Vucevic and Serge Ibaka in the first 4 minutes of the game. ... Orlando was averaging 16.0 second-chance points per game entering Wednesday night, which ranked them fourth in the NBA. Last season, the Magic averaged just 12.6 second-chance points. NO KNEE-JERK DECISIONS There has been speculation that Vogel may be ready to make a change to his lineup, inserting Biyombo into the starting unit in place of Vucevic to improve the interior defense. But Vogel he doesn't feel such a move is necessary at this point. ""When it becomes apparent to me and I'm not a knee-jerk coach,"" he said when asked what will make him know it's time to make a change.  ""If it's needed you will see it. I wouldn't expect it anytime soon."" SAME FACES, NEW PLACES Vogel and Thibodeau met for years as Central Division foes as coaches of the Indiana Pacers and Chicago Bulls, respectively.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  If not for Paul George, the Philadelphia 76ers might have left Indiana with their first win of the season. On Wednesday night, two familiar storylines played out in the game's final minutes: the Pacers once again relied on their All-Star forward to pull out a close win at home; and the Sixers lost yet another close game. George, who finished with 28 points and eight rebounds, scored seven of the Pacers' 13 points in overtime to defeat the Sixers 122-115. ""They're a young group. They're still going to come out and be competitive. That's what we overlooked,"" George said. The Sixers were resilient all game, and multiple times during the final 3 minutes they looked as if they were going to put the game away. The 76ers led by as many as six points with less than 2 minutes remaining in the game before Jeff Teague hit a floater in the lane to give Indiana a one-point lead. With 6 seconds remaining in regulation, Gerald Henderson hit a 3-pointer to give Philadelphia a 2-point lead. But on the ensuing Pacers' possession, George hit a baseline jumper with 3 seconds left to tie it at 109. On the Pacers' first possession of overtime, George set the tone with a 3-pointer to give Indiana the lead. And it was George who threw down an emphatic dunk that gave Indiana a six-point lead, ultimately sealing the win for the Pacers. ""Coach drew up a play for the 3-pointer to open up overtime,"" George said. ""Those moments, I have experience.Those plays suck the life out of you, and I knew at that moment we needed to play (with urgency)."" Teague finished with a season-high 30 points and added nine assists. Teague and George combined to score Indiana's final 15 points of the fourth quarter. Myles Turner finished with 15 points and nine rebounds for Indiana. The final score won't show how much Philadelphia controlled Wednesday night's game at times. The Pacers could not pull away from the Sixers throughout much of the game, and even squandered the small lead they held at one point, having to climb back from a double-digit deficit. Indiana led 37-34 halfway through the second quarter when the 76ers opened up a 13-0 run to take a 10-point lead. Indiana answered with a 10-2 run to pull within single digits, but the 76ers went into halftime leading 60-54. Philadelphia even had an opportunity to win the game in the fourth quarter. With about 3 seconds left in regulation, Jahlil Okafor attempted a fade-away jumper from the baseline that bounced off the back of the rim as time expired. Robert Covington led the Sixers with 23 points. Henderson finished with 17 points and five rebounds while Dario Saric had 14 points and 12 rebounds. ""We had a lot of balance in our scoring, but we gave up a few too many points,"" Henderson said. ""A couple of times we messed up on game plan-type stuff and had some silly turnovers. We deserved to win the game, we just came up a little short, and we move on."" Saric was searching for an answer. ""I don't know what to say,"" he said. ""We fall a point short. We have to continue to work hard in practice, everyone give 100 percent and a win will come one day. We hope it comes in the next game at home, in front of our fans, they deserve it."" TIP-INS Philadelphia: Joel Embiid did not travel with the team to Indiana, remaining in Philadelphia for rest. Indiana: The Pacers have won 10 of the last 11 regular-season meetings with the 76ers dating to 2013-14. ... Indiana has won six straight games over Philadelphia at home.

"ATLANTA --  Thabo Sefolosha loves it when the Atlanta Hawks get so many players contributing on offense. Eight of the Hawks' 10 players scored in double figures Wednesday night, led by Sefolosha, whose primary role is a defensive specialist off the bench. ""Everybody can play on this team,"" he said. ""On different nights, a different guy steps up. It's a huge plus to have that."" Sefolosha scored 20 points, Dwight Howard added 18 and Atlanta beat the Chicago Bulls 115-107 for its third consecutive victory. Paul Millsap had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Hawks, and Dennis Schroder scored 13. Howard grabbed 10 boards as Atlanta outrebounded Chicago 49-30. Jimmy Butler finished with 39 points and Dwyane Wade had 25 for the Bulls, who have lost four of five. The output was Butler's highest since he scored a career-high 53 points against Philadelphia on Jan. 14 last season. ""They got what they wanted, and then we decided to start playing -- once again,"" Butler said. ""Defense is all about effort, let's get that straight. We've got to man up and guard, take it personal. We'll be fine, but we've got to guard."" Atlanta carried over some momentum from Tuesday's rare victory at Cleveland. The defending NBA champion Cavaliers had won 11 straight in the series, including two playoff sweeps. Sefolosha sparked the Hawks when he entered late in the first quarter, scoring 16 of their 21 points in a 3:44 stretch that spanned the first two periods to help Atlanta take a 45-31 lead. Sefolosha loved how Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer changed the defense to keep Butler and Wade in check. ""In the second half we switched it up a little bit,"" Sefolosha said. ""They're good players, so we're not going to stop them every time, but we got just enough stops and we had good offense at the end to pull through."" The Hawks led by 17 early in the second on Millsap's jumper, but Chicago pulled within three early in the third. Kent Bazemore was called for a technical foul after slamming into Butler near the rim on a fast break, and Butler hit three free throws. After Wade's jumper put the Bulls up 74-73, Chicago took its biggest lead at five on Doug McDermott's fast-break dunk before Tim Hardaway Jr.'s runner put Atlanta up 86-85 late in the third. The Hawks led the rest of the way, pushing the margin to 11 when Hardaway hit a straightaway 3-pointer. McDermott's short jumper made it 103-101 with 4:54 remaining, but the Bulls didn't get any closer. ""Our depth in the entirety of the roster is something we have a lot of faith and belief in,"" Budenholzer said. ""Tonight you kind of saw that."" BACK IN TOWN Wade will return to Miami on Thursday for the first time with an opposing team. The 12-time All-Star, who helped the Heat win three NBA titles in 13 seasons, had 23 points at the end of the third but went 1 for 4 from the field in the fourth. X-RAYS NEGATIVE Bazemore jammed his right pinkie against the backboard on his hard foul. X-rays were negative, but he wore a protective sleeve on the finger. He said he got the technical for slamming his mouthpiece to the floor. STAYING CLOSE Bulls G Michael Carter-Williams made the two-game road trip even though he's sidelined four to six weeks with a bruised left knee. Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said Carter-Williams is ""moving around well,"" but his timetable hasn't changed.","400899561"

DeRozan, the NBA's leading scorer with a 34.1 average heading into the game, made 13 of 22 field goals and 11 of 15 free throws. ""You know, sometimes you've got to tip your hat, and good offense can beat great defense,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""He had that happen several times where he made some very, very difficult shots."" Westbrook had 36 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, but he made just 9 of 26 shots and committed eight turnovers. ""I thought everybody that guarded him did a decent job, but it was a five-man job,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""Not one guy is going to stop him, and I say that all the time.

Toronto, which shot 51.8 percent from the field, has won four of five. The Thunder (6-2) entered the night tied for the NBA's best record, but their offense was inconsistent against the Raptors, and they couldn't find and answer for DeRozan. Victor Oladipo scored 18 points and Steven Adams added 14 points and 12 rebounds for Oklahoma City. The Raptors led 62-55 at halftime behind DeRozan's 22 points. Toronto scored 16 points off 11 Oklahoma City turnovers in the first half. ""Little things like us turning the ball over, then leading to fast breaks,"" Oladipo said. ""Rotations weren't great today. Little things like that that we can correct. We've just got to continue getting better and push forward."" A bounce pass by Lowry led to a jam by DeMarre Carroll that gave Toronto a 68-59 lead, and a basket by Pascal Siakam bumped the lead to 11 and led to a timeout by the Thunder. DeRozan's mid-range jumper in the closing seconds of the third quarter gave the Raptors an 88-75 lead. The Thunder opened the fourth quarter with a 9-1 run to cut the deficit to 89-84.

You don't ever want to see one of your brothers go down like that."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led the Pistons (4-4) with a season-high 27 points, making 5 of 10 3-point attempts, but he missed a potential tying 3 with 1:35 to play and the Suns up 99-96. Andre Drummond added 18 points and 14 rebounds. The Pistons went on a 14-0 run between the end of the third quarter and early in the fourth to take an 87-81 lead. Former Sun Jon Leuer scored six of the points and finished with 11 points and nine rebounds. Phoenix went back ahead 92-90 when Dudley fed Len for a dunk with 5:02 to play. Dudley's fourth 3 of the game made it 99-93. ""That's been my role the last couple of years, the trailing jump shot,"" Dudley said. ""Once you hit one, your teammates start looking for you."" The Pistons led by as many as 11 points in the first quarter and 28-19 going into the second. Caldwell-Pope scored nine points in the first. The Suns made only 6 of 22 shots in the first quarter. Phoenix rallied in the second quarter, going on a 16-4 run. Dudley then knocked down three 3s as part of his 15 points in the quarter and gave the Suns a 49-47 lead with 3:17 left. Suns leading scorer Devin Booker didn't make his first field goal until early in the third quarter, but his three-point play with 6:15 to go gave the Suns a 66-60 lead. Booker had scored 100 points in his previous three games. He had 11 on Wednesday. Len had seven points in the third quarter, two on a power move inside to give the Suns a 78-69 lead at the 1:02 mark. But Caldwell-Pope hit a 26-footer at the third-quarter buzzer to cut the Suns' lead to 81-76. ""We couldn't get stops the last of the fourth quarter,"" Caldwell-Pope said. ""We just kept trading baskets and that wasn't what we wanted to do."" TIP-INS Pistons: G Reggie Jackson remained out with a left knee injury ...  F Marcus Morris, a former Sun, was roundly booed when introduced as a starter and when he touched the ball. He did have the dunk of the night in the second quarter when he flew in for a one-handed slam. Suns: Len recorded his first double-double of the season. ... The Suns' bench totaled 41 points, compared to 21 for Detroit. VAN GUNDY RIPS TRUMP Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy went on a near 6-minute rant about the election of Donald Trump before Wednesday's game. ""I don't think anybody can deny this guy is openly and brazenly racist and misogynist and ethnocentric, and say that's OK, we're going to vote for him anyway,"" Van Gundy told reporters. ""We have just thrown a good part of our population under the bus."" Van Gundy said what the country has done to women and minorities in electing Trump is ""despicable,"" and that he'd never been ashamed of the United States until Wednesday. LOVE FOR BOOKER Van Gundy said a case can be made that Booker is the best player in his draft class at present. ""He doesn't have a lot of holes in his offensive game at all,"" Van Gundy said. WINLESS ON THE ROAD Detroit is 0-4 on the road this season. ""We're not bringing enough at either end of the floor so we've got to get it changed around,"" Van Gundy said. BACK-TO-BACK AT HOME The Suns won consecutive home games for the first time since Dec. 13 and 18 of last season.","400899563"
"SAN ANTONIO --  When the San Antonio Spurs finally stopped James Harden, his Houston Rockets teammates came through on defense. Harden had a triple-double with 24 points, 15 assists and 12 rebounds, and Houston made two late defensive stands to hold off San Antonio 101-99 on Wednesday night, handing the Spurs their third straight home loss. ""It was important for us,"" Harden said. ""The only way we're going to get to where we want to go is on the defensive end. The game wasn't pretty at all, but defensively we got stops."" Kawhi Leonard scored 34 points for the Spurs but missed his final two shots, either of which could have tied the game. After Leonard missed a layup in the final seconds, LaMarcus Aldridge missed a tip-in attempt at the buzzer. Aldridge finished with 14 points and five rebounds. ""It was a good play called,"" Leonard said of his last shot. ""I got to the paint, got a shot off, just didn't fall. (Aldridge) had a good chance, it just fell short, but we'll take that again."" Leonard made 11 shots on a career-high 26 field goal attempts. San Antonio extended its longest skid at home since dropping three straight overtime games in December 2014. The Spurs did not lose at home last season until April 11 against Golden State and tied an NBA record by finishing 40-1 at the AT&amp;T Center. ""It's tough to win in this building,"" Rockets forward Ryan Anderson said. ""They're a team that obviously has some great players. To get a win in here, you've got to be happy."" The Spurs used a rotation spearheaded by Leonard and Danny Green to defend Harden, but found little success. Harden set an aggressive tone early with nine points, six assists and three rebounds in the first quarter. ""He's always been a great passer,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He has the ball in his hands a lot more as the point guard. He is one of the best players in the league. Very difficult to guard."" When Harden wasn't draining jumpers and tossing in runners, he kicked the ball out to open teammates after drawing multiple defenders on his drives. The Rockets were 10 for 30 on 3-pointers and shot 47 percent overall in snapping a four-game skid at San Antonio. Anderson was 4 for 6 on 3-pointers and had 20 points. Eric Gordon scored 15 and fellow reserve Sam Dekker added 12. ""Coach is liable to call anybody and guys stepped up,"" Harden said. ""Dekker hit some big shots."" The Spurs sat Pau Gasol the entire second quarter in favor of a quicker lineup and it helped them erase a 13-point deficit to take a 51-50 lead. San Antonio employed the same strategy late in the third to pull within a point twice, but could not overcome the Rockets even when Harden struggled. He missed his final three shots as well as a pair of free throws and committed a turnover in the final 3 minutes, yet Houston was able to win with defense. ""They had my back,"" Harden said. ""But those turnovers, those can't happen consistently, or two missed free throws."" TIP-INS Rockets: Harden had his streak of four straight games with at least 30 points and 12 assists snapped. ... Houston played seven of its first eight games on the road. The last team to open with such an arduous schedule was Cleveland in 1970-71. ... Corey Brewer started his second straight game. Gordon started the team's first six games. Spurs: Tony Parker missed his third consecutive game with a sore right knee. Popovich expects Parker to play Friday at home against Detroit or Saturday in Houston. ... Manu Ginobili joined Rashard Lewis as the only second-round draft picks in NBA history with 13,000 career points and at least 1,300 3-pointers. Ginobili is the 15th second-rounder to reach 13,000 points. ... Green became the sixth player with at least one 3-pointer in 300 games for the Spurs. Parker, Ginobili, Bruce Bowen, Matt Bonner and Sean Elliott are the others. GOOD FIT Harden's move to point guard has paid off for the Rockets, who are tied with the Spurs atop the Southwest Division at 5-3. ""He's scoring a bundle and getting about 10 assists a game,"" Popovich said. ""I think anybody would take that. That's pretty darn good."" DANNY BOY Green made his season debut for San Antonio, scoring eight points in his return from a strained left quadriceps. He missed his first 3-point try but drained his second from the right corner and finished 2 for 8 on 3s. ""I thought Danny was great,"" Popovich said. ""He hit big shots. He drove it a few times. He played good defense. I thought he looked really good.""","400899564"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers are playing stingy defense and having fun doing it. Blake Griffin had 22 points and 13 rebounds, Chris Paul added 19 points and Los Angeles rolled past the Portland Trail Blazers 111-80 on Wednesday night to improve to an NBA-best 7-1 with its fourth straight victory. ""When you play defense the way we have been, it's a lot of fun,"" Griffin said. ""We enjoy getting stops and look forward to getting stops. Guys are just flying around, and even if someone makes a mistake, there's another guy to cover up for them. When you are playing basketball like that, it's a blast."" It was the second time the Clippers beat the Trail Blazers this season. This one was never close. The Clippers stunned Portland from the opening tip, shooting 59 percent in the first quarter. They built a 32-point lead in the first half, when Griffin had 17 points. Los Angeles' bench opened the second quarter on a 14-2 run to go up 50-18 before extending the lead to 61-32 at halftime. ""We got our (rear ends) whupped,"" Blazers guard Damian Lillard said. ""They had a lot of energy and they wanted it more than we did. They hurt us on the glass and we didn't take anything away from them."" Lillard, the NBA's second-leading scorer at 32.8 points per game, was held to eight. CJ McCollum, who was averaging 22.9 points, also scored eight for the Blazers. They didn't have anyone in double figures until Shabazz Napier hit a 3-pointer with under 2 minutes left. He led the team with 11 points. DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and nine rebounds and J.J. Redick added 10 points for the Clippers, who sat their starters for good at 3:54 of the third quarter while owning a 44-point lead. It was the fourth straight game that the Clippers had at least an 18-point lead in the first half. ""We kept telling each other to not play the score and respect the game,"" Jordan said of keeping up the defensive pressure. ""We wanted to make shots they took tough."" Before the starters left, they began the quarter with a 17-3 run that stretched the Clippers' lead to 78-35. Each of the five starters scored in the spurt. Paul and Luc Mbah a Moute each had a 3-pointer, and Jordan slammed down a two-handed, fast-break dunk off Griffin's alley-oop pass. It was one of three signature dunks by Jordan in a period that ended with consecutive 3-pointers by reserves Marreese Speights and Austin Rivers, leaving the Clippers ahead 93-50. Los Angeles held Portland to 35 percent shooting. The Blazers shot just 6 of 30 on 3-pointers as their three-game winning streak was snapped. ""The Clippers beat us at both ends,"" coach Terry Stotts said. ""They were good at the rim, good on the free throw line, good at passing, good on defense, good in transition."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: They failed to score at least 100 points for the first time in nine games. ... They were held to 16 points in the first, a season low for a quarter. ... Portland was playing the second half of a back-to-back, having won at Phoenix by three points on Tuesday. Clippers: With his fifth rebound in the first quarter, Griffin reached 4,000 in 417 career games, the second-fastest player since 1983-84 to reach 8,500 points, 4,000 rebounds and 1,500 assists. Chris Webber did so in 408 games. ... Jordan played his 600th career game, joining Randy Smith (715) and Eric Piatkowski (616) as the only players in franchise history to do so. ALL IN Everyone on Portland's roster saw action except Al-Farouq Aminu and Festus Ezeli, who are injured. All but Ed Davis scored. The only Clipper not to play was Paul Pierce, and all 12 of their players scored. SECOND UNIT The Clippers' second unit was led by Speights with 12 points. The fourth was the only quarter won by the Blazers, who outscored the Clippers' reserves 30-18.","400899565"
"Chauncey Billups offers his take on Mavericks center Andrew Bogut's comments about the lack of genuine people in the NBA. (0:21) OAKLAND, Calif. --  Klay Thompson figured it would just be a matter of time until his outside shot started falling again. That time came in the first quarter. Thompson hit his first seven shots and scored 18 of his 20 points in the opening period, and the Golden State Warriors cruised past the undermanned Dallas Mavericks 116-95 on Wednesday night. ""I feel it's coming every game, honestly,"" he said. ""I won't let missed shots dictate how hard I play. As long as I play hard, I know I'll be successful. It's that simple."" Kevin Durant led Golden State with 28 points, Stephen Curry added 24 and Draymond Green had 16 points and 10 rebounds as the Warriors used their outside shooting to build a 19-point lead in the first quarter and never looked back. Harrison Barnes scored 25 points to lead Dallas in his first game against the Warriors since leaving as a free agent last summer. But he didn't get nearly enough help. ""The first half it was kind of like a deer in headlights,"" he said. ""It was kind of like the scouting report went out the window and we were just out there playing. Once guys settled in we did a much better job."" Thompson had been in a bit of a shooting slump to start the season, making just 11 of 53 3-pointers in the first seven games. But he returned to form from the start in this one. He hit four of Golden State's eight 3s in the opening quarter during a span of just more than 2 minutes. ""It was good to see him get the 3-point stroke going,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""He started off on fire. It didn't carry over the rest of the game, but he had a tremendous first quarter. You can see it coming. It's absolutely coming with Klay."" Durant got going after that and extended the lead to 67-34 in the final minute of the first half with his own shot from long range. The Mavericks managed to cut the deficit to 13 early in the fourth quarter but never really threatened Golden State the rest of the way. TIP-INS Mavericks: Starting guards J.J. Barea and Wesley Matthews and C Andrew Bogut got the night off on the back end of a back-to-back. ... Dallas has lost eight straight in Oakland. Warriors: Durant scored at least 20 points for the 72nd straight regular-season game, tying Michael Jordan for the fourth-longest streak ever. ... Curry left briefly in the third quarter after tweaking his right ankle. He got it taped and came back into the game. REUNION The game marked a return to Oakland for Barnes and Bogut, who left in the offseason after the Warriors signed Durant. They both got long ovations before the game and a video tribute in the first quarter for their roles in winning the NBA title in 2015 and a record 73 regular-season games last season. ""The fans here are phenomenal,"" Barnes said. ""They showed love ever since my rookie year up until my last year here, so it was very nice."" BROTHERLY LOVE With Barea sitting, Seth Curry got the start for Dallas and a matchup with big brother Steph. They guarded each other when both were in the game and Stephen hit a 30-footer over Seth in the second quarter. Seth had 10 points and nine assists. ""It's always a good time when we're matched up against each other,"" he said. SPREAD THE WEALTH Thompson, Durant, Curry and Green all hit four 3-pointers for the Warriors. The Elias Sports Bureau said it's the first time a team had four players hit at least four 3s in one game.","400899566"
"MILWAUKEE -- New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry wasn't about to worry about his team's flaws after its first victory of the season. Anthony Davis hit a pair of free throws with 12 seconds left and scored 32 points, and the Pelicans ended their winless start after eight games by beating the Milwaukee Bucks 112-106 on Thursday night. ""Are you kidding me, we were 0-8 and fighting for our lives,"" Gentry said. ""Everything that we've done in some kind of way had gone bad. ""To be able to finish the game and come away with a win, it's relief,"" he said. ""We're not going to say it was just another game."" The Philadelphia 76ers (0-7) are the remaining winless team in the NBA. ""We've been working hard and playing our butts off, and tonight we just got one,"" Davis said. ""We needed everyone tonight to get this win."" Jabari Parker scored a season-high 33 points for Milwaukee, which lost its second straight game to a team that was winless. In their last game Sunday, the Bucks fell 86-75 in overtime to Dallas, which was 0-5 coming into that game. ""We were in this situation in Dallas,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""They hadn't won a game either and they were desperate. New Orleans was desperate, and they found a way to win a game."" E'Twaun Moore added 20 points for New Orleans, playing its third game in four nights. Milwaukee used a late 9-4 run to pull within 108-105 on Giannis Antetokounmpo's three-point play with 40 seconds to go. Matthew Dellavedova made a free throw to cut the New Orleans lead to 108-106, but Davis converted both free throws to make it a two-possession game. Mirza Teletovic missed a running 3-point attempt with 6 seconds left, and Tim Frazier hit a pair of free throws to close the scoring. Frazier had 15 points, 10 assists and five rebounds for New Orleans. Four of the Pelicans starters scored in double figures. TIP-INS Pelicans: F Cheick Diallo was sent to the Austin Spurs of the NBA Developmental League. Diallo was the 33rd overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft. ... New Orleans led the entire second half.

Starting C Miles Plumlee played 11 minutes, all in the first half, and all three of his shots were blocked by Davis. CHARITY STRIPE The Pelicans have had trouble making free throws this year at 73 percent coming into the game, but made 25 of 27 against the Bucks. ""We've had close losses and have missed 13 foul shots (in a game) and 12 foul shots,"" Gentry said. ""In those situations, you can't afford to do that. Tonight, we stepped to the line and shot them great."" ANOTHER DOUBLE-DOUBLE Antetokounmpo had 17 points, 10 rebounds and one assist in 35 minutes, his second double-double of the season. He picked up two early fouls against Dallas on Sunday and never got into a rhythm, and was charged with his fifth foul with 5:53 left in the fourth quarter against the Pelicans. He didn't return until there was 2:40 left in the game and was unable to rally his team to victory. A TYPICAL ROOKIE Through the Pelicans' first nine games, Buddy Hield was averaging nine points, making only 33 of his first 96 shots (34 percent). Gentry calls Hield, the sixth overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft, ""a typical rookie. He's trying to feel his way. He's had some good games for us and he's had some struggles.""","400899567"
"MIAMI --  For 13 years, Dwyane Wade made plenty of what the Miami Heat call ""winning plays."" He made another one Thursday. And the Heat didn't enjoy this one. Wade turned a debated foul call into two big free throws with 13.7 seconds remaining, helping the Chicago Bulls hang on for a 98-95 win and ensuring that his return to the arena he called home for 13 seasons would be a winning one. It was Wade's first time facing the Heat as an opponent, and afterward he seemed more than a little relieved that this was over. ""I can only imagine what he was going through today,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""A lot of emotions coming back here."" Chicago was up 94-92 when Wade got the call that went against Miami's Justise Winslow, a foul along the sideline on an inbounds pass where it appeared that the 12-time All-Star may have embellished a bit for effect. If he did, it worked. ""If it was last year, he got pushed out of bounds,"" a smiling Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""This year? He's selling it."" Jimmy Butler scored 20 points and Rajon Rondo finished with 16 points and12 rebounds for the Bulls. Robin Lopez had 16 for Chicago, and Wade scored 13 on 5-for-17 shooting. ""I thought I'd shoot better, since I've been knowing these rims for a while,"" Wade said. But he made the two big free throws when it counted most, and acknowledged afterward that he might have gotten a break. ""I got the vet call,"" Wade said. Said Winslow: ""I didn't agree with the call. I think that was because of the stage, because of him being back here. I don't think if he was at another venue, another regular game, they would have made that call."" Robin Lopez had 16 points for Chicago, which prevailed in a game that had 14 ties and 19 lead changes. Doug McDermott scored 13 for the Bulls, and Nikola Mirotic added 10. Hassan Whiteside led Miami with 20 points and 20 rebounds. Dion Waiters and Josh Richardson each scored 16 for the Heat, who lost point guard Goran Dragic to a sprained left ankle in the third quarter. Winslow scored 15 and Tyler Johnson added 14 for Miami. Richardson tied the game with a 3-pointer with 6:13 remaining, but the Bulls scored the next six points and led the rest of the way. After the game, Wade went over and greeted the wife of Heat managing general partner Micky Arison, then general manager Andy Elisburg before leaving the floor and blowing a kiss to the fans who remained. ""That was the most emotional part of the night for me,"" Wade said. TIP-INS Bulls: Wade spent the last couple of minutes of halftime greeting Heat staff -- with a big hug for Spoelstra. ... Wade has made a career on his pump fake, which he taught to some Heat players, and Johnson burned him with it in the second half. ""It's good that he takes notes,"" Wade said. Heat: It was the third career 20-20 game for Whiteside. The only player to have more in a Heat uniform is Rony Seikaly, with 12. ... Winslow entered the game in a 10-for-43 slump over his last three games, then shot 6 for 12 on Thursday. ... Dragic left in a walking boot, but X-rays were negative. GOOD JOB Rondo isn't always the friendliest sort with opponents, but when he got a layup blocked by Whiteside with 5:20 left he offered the Heat center a congratulatory hand-slap. NO SHOWDOWN There was one thing Wade wanted that he didn't get Thursday: He wanted to be on the floor with Udonis Haslem, his teammate on all three Miami championship teams. ""Let me get 1-on-1 with UD, that's what I've been waiting on. That right there would make my night,"" Wade said. Spoelstra said he was disappointed that he didn't make it happen.","400899568"
"DENVER --  In a story Nov. 11 about the game between the Golden State Warriors and Denver Nuggets, The Associated Press erroneously reported the Nuggets beat the Detroit Pistons 108-86 last Saturday. The Pistons beat the Nuggets 103-86. A corrected version is below: Curry leads Warriors to 125-101 rout of Nuggets Stephen Curry scored 33 points Thursday and the Golden State Warriors beat the Denver Nuggets 125-101 on a night Kevin Durant's string of 72 straight regular-season games with at least 20 points ended By PAT GRAHAM AP Sports Writer Kevin Durant needed just one more basket to keep an impressive scoring streak going and more than 5 minutes to get it. His coach, though, didn't want to risk injury. Not in a blowout. Not in game No. 9 of the season. Like that, another astonishing streak snapped. Stephen Curry scored 33 points Thursday and the Golden State Warriors beat the Denver Nuggets 125-101 on a night Durant's string of 72 straight regular-season games with at least 20 points ended. Durant finished with 18 points. He remained tied with Michael Jordan for the fourth-longest streak of 20 or more points in league history. ""It was cool while it lasted,"" said Durant, whose streak began on Nov. 23, 2015, while with Oklahoma City. ""Up there with some great names. But I've got bigger goals in mind."" A week ago, Curry had his league-record streak of 157 games with at least one 3-pointer ended. ""None of it matters and our guys know that,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr explained. ""It's about winning."" Hence, an early end to his night. Durant stayed in the game, trying to get to the magic number of 20, until 5:51 remaining. He was subbed out after being called for an offensive foul. ""I'm not going to mess with the basketball gods. If you want to leave a guy out there to get some kind of record, you're asking for an injury,"" Kerr explained. ""The game called for him to come out. He came out. He had no problem with it. I think there's going to be a lot of that stuff this year."" Curry tweaked his ankle in a win over Dallas on Wednesday, but it didn't appear to hamper him against the Nuggets. He finished 7 of 13 from 3-point range, including one that he turned into a four-point play. That shot even impressed him as he lay on the ground and celebrated. ""One of those you don't expect to go in,"" Curry said. ""But that was a terrible celebration."" So torrid was his touch that Curry even launched one from just inside half-court. He missed it, but the crowd erupted. ""Honestly, it was a dumb shot,"" Curry said. Then again, he did have Draymond Green egging him on. ""It's like the demon-angel on your shoulder -- which one are you going to listen to?"" Curry said. ""It would've been fun to make it."" Rookie Jamal Murray had 14 points for the Nuggets, who are 0-2 at Pepsi Center this season after stressing the importance of regaining a home-court advantage. Fellow rookie Malik Beasley scored his first NBA points on a 3-pointer in the third quarter. He finished with 12 points. If that wasn't enough, the third rookie of the group, Juan Hernangomez, chipped in 11. ""There were some positives at the end,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""But you tip your hat. We got our (rears) kicked tonight. We have to regroup."" TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State went on a 17-2 run in the first quarter and never looked back. ...

Denver starts 0-2 at home for the third time in four seasons. PROTEST Denver filed a protest with the NBA over a disputed call in the final second of a 108-107 loss in Memphis on Tuesday. The ball appeared to go off a Grizzlies player with 0.7 seconds remaining, but the ruling on the floor and video review awarded possession to Memphis. Marc Gasol hit the game-winning shot on a tip-in. ""Best-case scenario would be to replay the last seven-tenths,"" Malone said. The odds of that happening, though, are ""slim and none,"" Malone said. ATHLETE SIGHTINGS There were quite a few Denver Broncos in attendance, including pass rushers Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware, along with receiver Demaryius Thomas and cornerback Chris Harris Jr. The Colorado Avalanche were represented by forward Nathan MacKinnon and defenseman Tyson Barrie.","400899569"
"After the final whistle is blown, DeMarcus Cousins walks towards the Lakers bench and chest bumps Julius Randle with an exchange of words, stating afterwards that it was ""UK love"" and detailing insight on what could have made Cousins react the way he did. (1:19) SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Lou Williams assumed the closer role that Kobe Bryant for so long relished against the Sacramento Kings. Williams scored 13 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter to help the Los Angeles Lakers rally for a 101-91 victory over the Kings on Thursday night. Williams continually hurt the Kings in the fourth quarter, going 4 of 8 from the field and 4 of 5 on free throws to help the Lakers rebound from a poor first half in which they trailed by as many as 19 points. ""He is one of those players who keeps getting better as the game progresses,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""He's been doing this his whole career, making big shots."" The Lakers took control by breaking away from a tie game with 10 straight points, the final five by Nick Young, to go ahead 92-82 with 3:36 left. Los Angeles has four wins in a five-game stretch for the first time since November 2013. ""It's a little like your kids, you love all your victories,"" Walton said when asked if this was the Lakers' best win of the season. ""It was nice to fight like that and get a win on the road."" Another veteran with big-shot capabilities, Young made four 3-pointers and scored 16 points. He had 13 points in the second half, when the Lakers outscored the Kings 56-36. ""We really were able to pick it up in the second half when we played much more aggressive,"" Young said. ""Starting a (three-game) road trip and winning the first one is great."" DeMarcus Cousins had 28 points and nine rebounds, Rudy Gay had 15 points and eight rebounds, and Ty Lawson had 11 points for the Kings, who had their modest two-game win streak snapped. Sacramento had won the last seven meetings with the Lakers. ""I think our defense broke down towards the end. We let them get a lot of shots that they can hit and that gave them confidence,"" Cousins said. ""We should have buried them in the second half. But we gave them confidence and some momentum in this game for them to finish it out the way they did."" D'Angelo Russell scored 17 points and Julius Randle had 15 points and eight rebounds for the Lakers. Timofey Mozgov added 10 points. With the Lakers trying to hold on, Williams drove the lane and was fouled while making an off-balance shot. He converted the free throw for a three-point play and a 97-88 lead. The Kings led by double digits in the first half but their offense grew stagnant in the third quarter and continued halfway through the fourth, when they were outscored 28-21. Both Young and Russell had eight points in the third quarter, when the Lakers outscored the Kings 23-18 and pulled within 73-70 heading into the fourth. TIP-INS Lakers: The Lakers opened the game making their first five shots, then missed 12 of 14 the remainder of the quarter and trailed 30-16. ... Larry Nance Jr. entered the game in the first quarter. He missed Tuesday's game against Dallas due to concussion symptoms. .. Los Angeles committed 21 turnovers that led to 27 points. Kings: Lawson made his first field-goal attempt. In the previous three games Lawson had missed 15 straight shots and scored six points in 77 minutes. ...

Playing in his second game following an eight-game suspension, Lawson missed nine of 11 shots and had six points. BENCH BUNCH Williams was the key contributor in the Lakers' 41-24 advantage in bench points. Both Jordan Clarkson and Tarik Black had seven points in a reserve role. Nance played 22 minutes and had only two points, but he secured seven rebounds and had two steals. ""He (Williams) is one of the players that can get off at any minute,"" Gay said. ""I honestly think that he's underrated. He's a guy who can get buckets and also he knows how to facilitate.""","400899570"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid wanted the ball down the stretch and the 76ers were happy to give it to him. Embiid scored 16 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and overtime to lead Philadelphia to its first victory of the season, 109-105 over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. Ersan Ilyasova added 14 points for Philadelphia, which was the last winless team in the NBA. The 76ers snapped a 44-game losing streak in October and November that dated to Nov. 22, 2013. And they can thank Embiid, the No. 3 pick of the 2014 draft who missed the last two seasons due to a broken foot but has returned as a leading Rookie of the Year candidate. ""I want to be the best player and every time I step on the court, I think I'm the best player,"" Embiid said. ""And if the team needs me to do that kind of stuff -- I think I've still got a long way to go -- but I can do those types of things."" Embiid, on a minutes restriction, played just 25 minutes. ""Joel brought us home with some individual brute strength,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""He came in and won the game for us. Joel was the focal point at the end."" Paul George had 26 points and Monta Ellis added 19 for the Pacers. After scoring nine points over a 2 1/2-minute stretch late in regulation, Embiid put the Sixers in front for good with a three-point play with 55 seconds left in overtime that made it 107-105. The Pacers turned it over on their ensuing possession and Embiid then came up big again, corralling a loose ball after he missed a jumper and then making a pair of free throws with 8.6 seconds left to put Philadelphia up four. ""It just feels good to finally get the chance to close a game out, which we haven't been doing,"" Embiid said. ""Getting a chance to make shots in the clutch is a learning process for me and you've got to trust it."" The teams completed a home-and-home after the Pacers won 122-115 in overtime in Indiana on Wednesday night. Jeff Teague had 30 points and nine assists, and George had 28 points and eight rebounds on Wednesday. ""We executed in our last game down the stretch; they executed tonight,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Our offense wasn't sharp down the stretch. The things we need to do to win a ballgame, we didn't do."" Embiid didn't play on Wednesday as he eases back into action. ""He's a big man and made plays down the stretch,"" McMillan said. The Sixers looked like they were going to lose yet another November game after blowing five-point lead with 25.4 seconds left in regulation. But the 76ers couldn't hold on. Ellis converted a three-point play with 22 seconds left. After Philadelphia coach Brett Brown called timeout, Teague stripped Sergio Rodriguez to give the Pacers possession. George was fouled and made a pair of free throws to tie it at 100 with 2.8 seconds left. Embiid's game-winning attempt in regulation went long. HELPING OUT Philadelphia's Jahlil Okafor, who had offseason knee surgery, wasn't scheduled to play on Friday night in order to rest for Saturday's game at Atlanta. But Okafor was called into action in the first half and went scoreless in two minutes. STREAK SNAPPED The 76ers ended a six-game losing streak to the Pacers. Indiana still has won 10 of the last 12 against Philadelphia. TIP-INS Pacers: George sprained his left thumb in the first quarter but returned in the second quarter. ...

"WASHINGTON --  For all of LeBron James' achievements, from MVP awards to NBA championships, the hootin' and hollerin' coming from the Cleveland Cavaliers' locker room Friday night -- and the water dumped on No. 23 by teammates -- was to mark a relatively obscure milestone: youngest NBA player to reach 27,000 career points. ""They lied to me. They said that Coach (Tyronn) Lue had accomplished something, and they were going to douse him. And I was kind of surprised, like, `What happened? You guys are going to mess up his suit,"" James said with a smile. ""And then ... they rushed me and got all my clothes wet and everything."" The impromptu celebration capped a perfect trip to the nation's capital for the Cavs, who added a win to their White House visit by beating the Washington Wizards 105-94 as James had 27 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. He made three of Cleveland's 14 3-pointers. At 31, James is about 1 1/2 years younger than Kobe Bryant was when he became the previous youngest to 27,000 points. ""That's NBA history, man. It's truly an honor to be part of the journey like that,"" said teammate Kyrie Irving, who scored 29 for Cleveland and helped hold Washington's John Wall to only five of his 28 points after halftime. ""And he's really just humble about it."" Adding a bit of humor to the proceedings, Irving noted: ""It also tells you that he's been in the league for a while."" A day after being feted as NBA champions by President Barack Obama, the Cavaliers improved to 7-1 this season, recovering quickly from their only loss, which came against Atlanta on Tuesday. Kevin Love contributed 14 points and 16 rebounds, while J.R. Smith's 17 points included five 3s. One gave Cleveland its biggest margin of the game, at 84-72 with a minute remaining in the third quarter. Wall noted the stats from 3-point range: The Cavs were 14 of 33; the Wizards were 3 of 15, barely attempting more than their opponents made. ""That's basically the game,"" Wall said, ""right there."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: James clutched at his lower right back after getting fouled with 7 1/2 minutes left, but remained in the game. ... Smith was called for a Flagrant-1 foul in third quarter. Wizards: Fell to 2-6. ... SG Bradley Beal sat out with a tight right hamstring. He was replaced in the lineup by Marcus Thornton, who scored two points in 21 minutes. ... F Otto Porter Jr., who had a 34-point, 14-rebound effort against Boston on Wednesday, had 11 points and eight rebounds Friday. OUBRE'S OFFENSE Wizards substitute Kelly Oubre Jr. scored the team's last eight points of the first quarter, which ended with the hosts ahead 31-26. ""It's my job to be ready whenever my name is called,"" Oubre said. ""I can't worry about minutes. I can't worry about nothing else."" FREE CHICKEN! A sellout crowd of 20,356 saved its loudest cheers for when two free throws missed by Love meant spectators would be able to get a free fast-food chicken sandwich. WHITE HOUSE ""When you get a chance to meet the President of the United States -- and he knows your first name and last name, and knows your stats and how you play and who you are as a person -- it just means a lot,"" Lue said.","400899572"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  DeMar DeRozan continued his torrid pace, scoring 34 points as the Toronto Raptors snapped the Charlotte Hornets' four-game winning streak with a 113-111 win Friday night. DeRozan came into the game averaging an NBA-high 34.1 points per game. He shot 14 of 26 from the field and made several key jumpers down the stretch as the Raptors erased a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win for the fifth time in six games. DeRozan has scored at least 30 points in seven of Toronto's eight games. His latest big night offset a huge performance from Charlotte guard Kemba Walker, who scored 40 points on 12-of-19 shooting, including 7 of 12 from 3-point range. Walker also had 10 rebounds and six assists. Jamal Murray sends the game to overtime and seals it in the second OT, sending the Nuggets to a 120-112 victory vs. the Suns. — Nikola Jokic had 29 points and 22 rebounds, Jamal Murray hit a difficult 3-pointer to force overtime and the Denver Nuggets outlasted the Phoenix Suns 120-112 in two overtimes Saturday night.","400899573"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  It's been a grueling early season road swing for the Utah Jazz and it was pretty obvious during the first three quarters of their matchup with Orlando on Friday night. The Jazz barely kept pace with the offensively challenged Magic, but that changed in the fourth quarter. Utah came up with stops and then knocked down timely shots late in the game to pull away for an 87-74 victory. ""I think it's (being sluggish) part of it,"" said Jazz coach Quin Snyder, whose team ends its five-game Eastern Conference trip Saturday at Miami. ""There are going to be games where you are. Tonight felt that way."" Perhaps no player epitomized the Jazz more than guard Rodney Hood, who was fighting a cold and entered the decisive fourth quarter just 1 for 7 from field and with two points. Hood knocked down a 3-pointer, drove through the lane for a slam and scored on a 22-foot pullup jumper on three straight possessions early in the fourth quarter to turn a two-point deficit into a 75-71 advantage with 7:20 to play. Utah (6-4) never trailed again in a game that had seen 10 lead changes and six ties up that point. ""It is always going to be times where a guy might not be feeling well or a guy might not be playing well, whatever it may be,"" said Hood, who finished with 13 points on 5-of-15 shooting. ""You just have to give your team minutes whether it is scoring, rebounding, defense, and it was big. This was a big win for us going into tomorrow."" It was an even bigger loss for the Magic. Coach Frank Vogel changed up his starting lineup for the first time this season, inserting Jeff Green into the small forward spot ahead of Aaron Gordon. But it did little to change the Magic's offensive fortunes to prevent them from dropping their third straight game. Orlando shot just 33 percent from the floor and went nearly nine minutes without converting a field goal in fourth quarter while being outscored 20-4 during that span. Nikola Vucevic and Serge Ibaka were a combined 5 for 24 on the night, leaving Evan Fournier and D.J. Augustin off the bench as the only consistent scorers on the night. ""We've just got to continue to work on our offensive execution, continue to try to gel and continue the effort we had tonight,"" said Vogel, whose team dropped to 3-6. TIP-INS Jazz: Point guard George Hill missed his third straight game due to a thumb injury. Dante Exum started in his place. Magic: Forward Damjan Rudez entered into the rotation earlier than he has all season, coming for Vucevic with 2:01 left in the first quarter. VETERANS DAY Vogel downplayed the shift in his starting lineup that saw Green replace Gordon at small forward. He also dismissed point guard Augustin playing more minutes than starter Elfrid Payton. He said it was about relying his veterans more than demoting the two younger players. Augustin was certainly more productive than Payton on Friday, converting 6 of 10 from the field for 19 points off the bench while shooting 6 of 10 from the field and turning in three assists in 24:23 minutes. Payton had two points on 1-of-5 shooting and had no assists in 23:37 minutes.","400899574"
"BOSTON --  Isaiah Thomas didn't hold his tongue earlier this week in describing what he said was a Celtics team he thought was void of its all-around toughness from years past. He thinks they took steps toward finding it on Friday night. Thomas scored 23 of his 29 points in the first half, and Boston snapped a three-game losing streak with a 115-87 victory over the New York Knicks. ""We played hard. And when you play hard you give yourself a chance,"" Thomas said. ""We've got to figure out how to continue to do this and then get our swag back a little bit."" Kelly Olynyk added 19 points and seven rebounds. The Knicks have still yet to post consecutive victories this season, and played without Carmelo Anthony in the second half after he was ejected after picking up back-to-back technical fouls. Anthony was tossed with 4:44 left in the second quarter by referee Tony Brothers. He received the first technical when he said something to Brothers following a loose ball foul call. Brothers walked away, but Anthony trailed behind and kept talking. He was then hit with the second technical. Anthony finished with 12 points and two rebounds. ""I was surprised,"" guard Derrick Rose said. ""He was still talking quietly. I didn't get it. They have a history, I guess."" Brandon Jennings was also ejected late in the fourth quarter after receiving consecutive technical fouls. Without Anthony, the Knicks had a difficult time finding an offensive flow. New York never led in the game, and trailed by as many 30 points in the fourth quarter. The Knicks have now given up 100 or more points in seven of their eight games. The Celtics entered Friday looking for a faster start after struggling to score points in the first quarter during their three-game skid. Brad Stevens made changes to his starting lineup in hopes of injecting some energy, going with Olynyk and Marcus Smart in place of Jaylen Brown and Tyler Zeller. The moves paid off. Coming off an eight-point first quarter in their loss to Washington on Wednesday, Boston scored 31 in the opening 12 minutes. Smart had eight points in the period, and Olynyk added five points and two assists. Stevens liked the progress, but said there is still work to do -- particularly on the glass, where his team was outrebounded 57-53. ""I'm just saying we have to get better,"" he said. ""I know you don't re-find something and then it's there to stay...we need to defend with the same intensity at all times like we did tonight."" TIP-INS Knicks: Were called for a total of six technicals in the game. .. Committed 25 turnovers, leading to 27 Boston points. ... Prior to his ejection, Anthony was New York's most efficient player in the first half, shooting 5 of 8 from the field. Celtics: Al Horford (concussion protocol) sat for the fifth straight game. Jae Crowder missed his fourth straight game with a sprained left ankle. ... Boston had 13 assists on 17 made field goals in the first half. TALKING TECHS In a pool report after the game Brothers said that both technical fouls issued on Anthony were because of ""bad language."" He said the initial common foul that was called on him was because Anthony dove on top of Amir Johnson. ""You can't dive on top of a player to go after a ball,"" Brothers said. ""That's a foul."" He said there is no ""history"" between him and Anthony. INJURY UPDATE Horford said he will accompany the Celtics on their two game road trip, and is hopeful that he could see action. He worked out prior to Friday's game said it included most positive signs he's had since entering the concussion protocol on Nov. 1. ""I feel good,"" Horford said. ""I'm very encouraged by the progress that we've made. So I'm excited. We're working on being back as soon as possible.""","400899575"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  After four straight blowout victories, the Los Angeles Clippers learned they can handle business in a close game. Blake Griffin scored 25 points, and the Clippers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 110-108 on Friday night to improve the league's top record and the best start in franchise history to 8-1. Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook missed what would have been a game-winning 3-pointer in the closing seconds. The Clippers had won their previous four games by an average of 24.5 points, so coach Doc Rivers wasn't sure how his team would handle a game with a tight finish. Los Angeles focused on slowing Westbrook, who burned them for 35 points in Oklahoma City's 85-83 win in Los Angeles earlier in the month that gave the Clippers their only loss so far. Even though Andre Roberson and Domantas Sabonis found their shooting strokes as the Thunder made 16 of 28 3-pointers, the Clippers stuck to their defensive game plan. ""This is one of those games you can lose your trust in,"" Rivers said. ""Roberson was making 3s, Sabonis was making 3s, and we're telling our guys to stay and clog the paint. And they're looking at me like, `Why?' We did it, and it worked out for us."" Jamal Crawford scored 19 points and Chris Paul added 17 points and 10 assists for the Clippers. Westbrook had 29 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, but he made just 9 of 25 shots. Victor Oladipo scored 18 points, Enes Kanter had 13 points and 11 rebounds and Roberson added 13 points and nine rebounds for Oklahoma City (6-3). The game was tied at 50 at halftime. The Clippers went on an 8-1 run early in the third quarter, highlighted by a spinning layup and 3-pointer by J.J. Redick, to go up 65-56. Griffin had 15 points on 7-for-8 shooting in the period to help the Clippers take an 82-74 lead in the fourth. ""I think our offense, spacing-wise, was really good,"" Griffin said. ""We attacked more, got out in transition, got some rebounds. Defensive stops led to some easy buckets."" Westbrook tied the game at 102 with a 3-pointer with just over 2 minutes remaining, but the Clippers responded with a dunk by DeAndre Jordan and a 3-pointer by Crawford. The Thunder rallied again, but Westbrook's 28-footer was just off in the final seconds. ""Yeah, I probably should have drove it, but it was all right,"" Westbrook said. --- TIP-INS Clippers: Committed just five turnovers in each half. ... Jordan had 12 points and 13 rebounds. ... Jordan was called for a technical foul early in the third quarter. Thunder: Held the Clippers to 22.7 percent shooting in the first quarter to take a 24-16 lead. ...

Roberson set a new career high with three 3-point goals. ... Sabonis made 4 of 5 3-pointers. HAPPY HOMECOMING Griffin, an Oklahoma City native, has been booed in the past because he's been a thorn in the Thunder's side. Now, with Kevin Durant gone, the fans have dreams of landing him in free agency. They showered Griffin with cheers during pregame introductions, which surprised him. ""A little bit, but it's always nice to come back home,"" he said. QUOTABLE Paul, on how he guarded Westbrook: ""I did a lot differently tonight guarding Russ,"" he said. ""I didn't. It was Luc Mbah a Moute. That was the difference. I only guarded him a few times tonight.""","400899576"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Pau Gasol signed with San Antonio because he believes the Spurs can win the NBA championship. He knows the Spurs cannot achieve that goal if they keep playing lethargically at home, so the 16-year veteran helped change that. Gasol had season highs with 21 points and six assists, and San Antonio snapped a three-game home losing streak with a 96-86 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. ""I think he got tired of losing,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. Gasol was 10 for 16 from the field as San Antonio snapped its longest home skid since dropping three straight in December 2014. After winning their home opener against New Orleans, the Spurs lost to Utah, the Los Angeles Clippers and Houston. San Antonio went 40-1 last season to match the league record at home. ""You just can't afford to lose at home, period,"" Gasol said. ""We just needed to snap out of that bad streak at home and start playing with some fire."" Gasol, who also had nine rebounds and two blocked shots, had 13 points in the opening quarter. It was the most points he has scored in any half this season and was his second-highest total this year. ""(San Antonio was) definitely much more aggressive from the beginning,"" Gasol said. ""Established a good pace and we needed to as a team collectively to get off a good start because we haven't done that lately at home."" Kawhi Leonard had 17 points and LaMarcus Aldridge added 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Spurs. Tony Parker added seven points and four assists in 21 minutes after missing the previous three games with a sore right knee. Andre Drummond matched his season high with 20 points and added 17 rebounds in Detroit's third straight loss. ""I'm not upset at anybody,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""I thought we played the game well. As a matter of fact, in terms of both defense and ball movement, putting both ends of the floor together, that's one of our best games of the year."" After trailing by 13 points in the fourth quarter, Detroit held San Antonio to two points in a four-minute span to pull within 89-84 with 2 minutes remaining. Leonard's 3-pointer ended the drought and helped seal the victory. ""The team is still trying to improve,"" Parker said. ""We have a lot of guys to try and put in our team like Pau. Everybody is trying to find their role in this team. And so, we'll be fine. It's going to take some time."" TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit is winless in five road games this season. ... Former Spurs Aron Baynes, Beno Udrih and Boban Marjanovic are all reserves for the Pistons. Marjanovic did not play, but received a rousing ovation when he was shown on the video screen. A huge fan favorite during his one season in San Antonio, Marjanovic was showered with shouts of ""Boban!"" in the final minutes. Spurs: Gasol's previous season high was 20 points against Miami on Oct. 30. Aldridge did not play in that game for rest. ... Spurs G Danny Green sat out for rest after playing 26 minutes in his season debut Wednesday. Green missed the team's first six games with a strained left quadriceps. ... The Spurs have yet to play a game with their projected starting five of Parker, Green, Aldridge, Gasol and Leonard. . San Antonio, which plays Saturday in Houston, is 3-1 in back-to-back games this season. The Spurs won both road games.

GOT YOUR BACK Leonard had his second-lowest point production of the season, shooting 6 for 14. The 6-foot-7 forward has scored 30-plus points in four games after entering the season with four games of 30-plus in his career, including the playoffs. Leonard scored 34 points in San Antonio's 101-99 loss to Houston on Wednesday, attempting a career-high 26 shots. ""He shouldn't need to get 30 to 34 every night,"" Gasol said. ""We have enough guys on this team, enough talent on this team that he shouldn't have to have that responsibility or pressure.""","400899577"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard thinks his Portland Trail Blazers lack that ""killer instinct"" to put away games when they should. Lillard had 36 points and CJ McCollum scored 31 to lead Portland past the Sacramento Kings 122-120 in overtime Friday night. The victory could have come easier, though. The Blazers were up 106-101 with 1:19 to go in regulation, yet nearly let this one slip away. ""It comes down to just manning up,"" Lillard said. Still, he'll take the win after the teams traded the lead over the final 2 1/2 minutes in the extra period. Meyers Leonard made two free throws to give Portland a 121-120 edge with 32 seconds remaining, and Rudy Gay missed a jumper at the other end. Allen Crabbe hit one of two foul shots for the Trail Blazers with 14.3 seconds left, giving the Kings another opportunity. DeMarcus Cousins missed a jumper and Gay was off target on a 16-foot fadeaway at the buzzer, sealing Portland's seventh straight victory over Sacramento. ""It's just having that killer instinct and being able to lock in for longer spans of time,"" Lillard said about what the Blazers are missing 10 games into the season. Portland coach Terry Stotts agreed: ""I think we've played well in spots. Our goal is to play well for longer periods."" Cousins led Sacramento with 33 points. Gay had 29 points and 14 rebounds for the Kings, who were coming off a 101-91 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers the night before. McCollum's 3-pointer with 1:23 left in overtime gave Portland a 117-115 lead before Gay's three-point play put Sacramento back ahead. McCollum added a 19-footer to put Portland in front, but a loose ball foul on the Blazers gave Sacramento's Darren Collison two free throws. He made both, giving the Kings a 120-119 lead with 33.8 seconds left. Cousins said Sacramento's issues have mirrored Lillard's assessment of his own team. ""Throughout this whole season we've shown flashes of who we can be, but we've got to get past that stage of showing flashes and be the team that we want to be,"" Cousins said. Leonard made his first start of the season for the Blazers, who were without forward Al-Farouq Aminu for the second straight game because of a left calf injury. Aminu started the first eight games for the Blazers, averaging 6.4 points and 6.6 rebounds before he was hurt Tuesday night early in Portland's 124-121 victory over Phoenix. Addressing the media before Friday night's game, Stotts said Aminu would be re-evaluated after two weeks. Leonard's thunderous dunk put the Blazers up 32-27 late in the first quarter, and they led by 12 en route to a 62-57 advantage at the break. McCollum led all scorers at halftime with 16 points. Cousins' fadeaway in the third quarter tied the game at 68, and Gay hit a 3-pointer to put the Kings in front. Lillard nailed a 3 from far outside the arc to give Portland back the lead at 79-76. The Blazers held an 84-83 edge to start the fourth but fell behind 95-88 after a pair of free throws with 6:31 left. Crabbe's jumper put Portland in front before Lillard hit another 3 to make it 99-95. Cousins' 3-pointer pulled the Kings to 106-104 with less than a minute to go in regulation, and his layup tied it with 9.7 seconds left. Lillard's 3-pointer at the buzzer was off the mark, sending the game to overtime. Portland was coming off a 111-80 loss to the Clippers in Los Angeles on Wednesday night. THE TAKEAWAY Kings: Collison returned to the Kings this week after an eight-game suspension to start the season. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic battery after an incident at his Sacramento-area home in May. Trail Blazers: Leonard and Cousins got into it in the first quarter and received offsetting technicals. Cousins has been mentioned in numerous trade rumors of late, including some involving the Blazers. ... Portland is 5-0 when Lillard and McCollum both score at least 30 points. BLOWING THE WHISTLE Cousins can't understand why he's not getting foul calls. ""I don't understand it,"" he said. ""I don't know what I have to do. I just don't understand it. I have to play through a lot. I'm not really rewarded for it, but I'm just trying to stay mentally strong through it."" PERFECT 10 Lillard has 306 points, most by a Trail Blazers player in the opening 10 games of a season. He's also the first to score 30 or more points six times in the first 10 games of a season.","400899578"
"NEW ORLEANS -- If Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams keep scoring like this, opponents are going to have trouble matching up with Los Angeles' second unit this season. Clarkson scored 23 points, Williams added 21, and the Lakers won for the fifth time in six games, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 126-99 on Saturday night. ""Me and Lou are going to be real aggressive coming in. We're trying to do a good job of leading this second group, bringing the energy, scoring the ball, pushing the pace,"" Clarkson said. ""Coach (Luke Walton) gave that to us. That's our role and that's what we're going to do."" D'Angelo Russell scored 22 and Nick Young added 15 points for the Lakers, who shot 55.3 percent (52 of 94) overall and made 16 of 30 3-pointers. Combined, Lakers guards scored 84 points. ""It just shows how much firepower we've got and how deep we can go,"" Clarkson said. ""We've got so many options, it's crazy."" Anthony Davis scored 34 for New Orleans, but left the game for a pivotal stretch with lower back pain after his layup had cut Los Angeles' lead to 63-62 in the third quarter. Davis, who crumpled to the court after his shot fell, went to the locker room and was out of the game for four-plus minutes while the Lakers went on a 14-0 run. ""It just locked up on me,"" Davis said of his back. ""I hate being out, so I tried to do whatever I could to come back."" Davis added nine more points after he returned, but New Orleans never recovered, losing for the ninth time in its first 10 games and dropping to 0-5 at home. New Orleans has been without three top players -- guards Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans, and forward Quincy Pondexter -- so far this season. The lack of depth caused by those absences stuck out against a Lakers second unit that has demonstrated exceptional chemistry lately. ""Their bench totally dominated the game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We couldn't get Lou stopped. I thought Clarkson pretty much scored at will."" Rookie Buddy Hield scored 18 points and Langston Galloway added 12 for the Pelicans. Young was 5 for 7 from 3-point range, while Clarkson went 4 of 6 and Russell 4 of 7. Rookie Brandon Ingram scored 10 points for the Lakers. He left the game in the second half with what team officials said was a sprained left ankle, but Ingram said he might have returned if his team hadn't built such a comfortable lead in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Lakers: Julius Randle had 11 rebounds to go with eight points. ... Williams entered the game as one of the top scorers in the NBA in a reserve role, averaging 15.9 points. He scored 14 in the first half, hitting six of his first 10 shots, including a 3-pointer. His 21 points tied a season high. ... Young, who entered the game 22 of 22 on free throws this season, did not attempt a foul shot -- nor did any Lakers starter. ... The Lakers' 53.3 percent shooting from 3-point range was their best since hitting 14 of 25 (56 percent) in a 111-103 win over Denver on Dec. 30, 2014. Pelicans: Davis reached 30 points for the seventh time in 10 games this season. ... Hield reached double digits in scoring for the fourth time in six games, scoring no fewer than nine points in a game during that span and as many as 18 twice. REMINISCING Walton and Gentry hugged in the hallway outside the locker rooms before the game. They also reminisced about their time as assistants on the same staff with Golden State during the 2014-15 season, when the Warriors were NBA champions. Gentry said he was not at all surprised to see Walton's early success as a first-year head coach of a young team that won only 17 games last season. ""He's got a great feel for the game, but I think more so than that, he's got a great feel for people. He can relate to anyone,"" Gentry said. Gentry also alluded to a couple of Lakers players who've said they would ""run through a wall"" for Walton. ""In our profession,"" Gentry began, laughing as he spoke, ""you've accomplished a lot"" when an NBA player says something like that about his coach.","400899579"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Isaiah Thomas fought through an off-shooting night, then came through for the Boston Celtics when it matter most. Thomas scored 23 points, including Boston's final eight, to lead the visiting Celtics past the Indiana Pacers 105-99 on Saturday night. ""Isaiah did a lot for our team tonight even though he wasn't shooting well,"" Avery Bradley said of his teammate's 12-point fourth quarter. ""That's what the game is all about, the fourth quarter."" Thomas had just four points through 34 minutes before scoring 19 over the final 14 minutes. He hit several clutch shots to keep Indiana at bay and sealed the win at the foul line in the final 30 seconds. With all-star Paul George sitting out the game with a sprained left ankle, the Pacers needed the help Thomas was affording them. After starting hot, the Pacers looked as if they wouldn't miss their leading scorer. In the first half, Indiana was crisp on offense, moving the ball, spacing the floor and getting the shots they wanted. But after halftime, they cooled off from the field and looked scattered at times on both ends of the floor. Boston lingered, and all they needed was Thomas to get involved. With his team struggling to seize control of a tight contest, Thomas surged in the fourth quarter. Nursing a 91-89 lead with 4:04 left, Thomas calmly hit a floater in the lane. After Monta Ellis hit a free throw to pull Indiana within 97-94 with 1:31 left, Thomas hit a pair of free throws, scored on a fastbreak layup with a minute left, and then added four free throws to seal Boston's second road win of the year. Pacers coach Nate McMillan said his team didn't challenge Boston in the final minutes to play to Indiana's strengths. ""We want to make teams defend, get to our second, third, fourth option,"" McMillen said. ""You don't win games when you don't make plays down the stretch."" Kelly Olynyk scored 16 for the Celtics, who were playing the first of two straight road games. Amir Johnson scored 14 and grabbed nine rebounds, while Bradley had 13 points and five assists. Jeff Teague led Indiana with 20 points and 4 assists. Myles Turner scored 17 and had 8 rebounds. Ellis notched 15 points in the Pacers' first home loss of the season. TIP-INS Boston: Al Horford sat out for the fifth straight game due to NBA concussion protocol but did travel with the team on its two-game road trip ... Saturday's win was Boston's second in a row after losing three straight. ... Terry Rozier had a career-high 11 points. ... Isaiah Thomas went 14-for-15 from the foul line. Indiana: Rodney Stuckey sat out for the ninth time in 10 games with a strained right hamstring. ... The Pacers honored their teams of the 1960s during halftime. This season marks the 50th anniversary of the Pacers franchise. ... After hitting 13 of their first 23 shots in the first quarter, the Pacers shot just 36.5 percent over the final three quarters. ... Indiana was held to less than 100 points for just the second time this season. PG SITS BUT SPEAKS George offered his assessment of the team's disappointing loss at home. ""It was really frustrating, especially at home against a good team,"" he said of sitting out the game Saturday. ""I thought our problems were much of the same thing. We were real stagnant on offense once again."" YOUNG SPARK James Young got hot at different junctures of Saturday's game and proved to be a key in Boston's win. He scored 12 points in 16 minutes off the bench on 5-of-6 shooting. In his five appearances before Saturday, Young hadn't scored in the 18 minutes of action he'd seen. His dunk and 3-pointer in the final 30 seconds of the third quarter helped Boston take a 79-76 lead into the final period.","400899580"
"TORONTO --  After watching DeMar DeRozan drop more than 30 points on an opponent for the eighth time in nine games this season, Toronto coach Dwane Casey suggested that the game keeps slowing down for the NBA's leading scorer. DeRozan, who is averaging 34.0 points after scoring 33 in the Raptors' 118-107 victory over the New York Knicks on Saturday night, agreed. ""Yeah, I always find ways I can be better mentally, physically, skill-wise,"" he said following Toronto's fourth straight win over New York. ""I always try to find something in the offseason and during the season as well."" The outburst put DeRozan in an exclusive club. In the last 50 years, only Michael Jordan, World B. Free and Tiny Archibald have started a season registering 30-plus points in eight of the first nine games. In a see-saw game that saw 27 lead changes, DeRozan provided a reassuring presence for a team that started one rookie in Pascal Siakum and a second-year player in Norman Powell, who had 19 points. Point guard Kyle Lowry, who scored what turned out to be the winning points with 1:41 to play on a driving layup, pointed to DeRozan's fourth-quarter, 4-point play. He was serenaded with chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" from the crowd as he put the game out of reach with 26.8 seconds to go. ""We're just going to keep riding that coattail,"" Lowry said. ""We're going to keep letting him do him. We're going to rally around him and keep helping him be great."" Carmelo Anthony scored 31 points, while Kristaps Porzingis and Derrick Rose added 21 apiece. Rose, who seemed to be favoring his shoulder at points in the game, said it was just a ""stinger."" ""Losing, it hurts, period,"" Rose said after the Knicks fell to 3-6. ""I've never been a loser in my life and just got to figure ways out. We're closer, a lot closer and the effort that we had, we need to find that effort for the entire game."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York is 0-2 in the back end of back-to-back games. It has 15 such games this season. . The Knicks haven't won a season series against the Raptors since the 2010-11 season, and are 4-9 against them in their last 13 games. Raptors: F DeMarre Carroll was dropped from the starting lineup for the first time this season to give him some rest. Powell took his place. . Former Raptor Muggsy Bogues was in attendance, throwing signed basketballs into the crowd. . Saturday's game marked the first of 16 Atlantic Division games for Toronto. The Raptors have not lost a season series with their division rivals since 2012-13. OLD IS NEW AGAIN The Raptors wore blue throwback jerseys in tribute to the Toronto Huskies of the old Basketball Association of America, which eventually became the NBA. The Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers on Nov. 1, 1946, at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens in what the NBA regards as the first game in its history, won 68-66 by the Knicks. The Raptors will wear the Huskies blue uniforms and play on a specially designed Huskies court on six occasions this season, and now have a 5-3 record when wearing the throwback uniforms. THEY SAID IT Powell on guarding Anthony: ""I'm a student of the game. I watch a lot of film, especially guys I look up to. I've watched so much Carmelo Anthony in my day, played with him so much in (video game NBA) 2K. The Knicks were my favorite team."" STRO SHOW Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Marcus Stroman watched the game from courtside, and threw a few signed mini basketballs into the crowd, launching a couple of the souvenirs all the way to the back of the lower bowl.","400899581"
"ATLANTA --  Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer was borderline disgusted after watching his team commit nine turnovers in the first quarter. It didn't take long for Budenholzer to get the results he wanted as Atlanta had just seven turnovers over the last three periods. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 20 points, Kent Bazemore added 17 and the Hawks won their fourth straight game with a 117-96 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. ""It was like we're handing them the ball and they're going and scoring,"" Budenholzer said. ""Credit our guys to kind of flip that and just still play with great ball movement and great confidence and reduce the turnovers."" Dwight Howard, the NBA's active leader in double-doubles, had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Hawks. Jahlil Okafor finished with 18 points for the Sixers, who dropped to 1-8 a night after earning their first win. Despite playing with a depleted roster, Philadelphia was within two with 3:50 left in the third. But Howard's follow dunk gave the Hawks an 84-74 lead and Kyle Korver's 3-pointer on the ensuing possession matched the 10-point advantage in the closing minutes of the period. Hardaway hit 3s on consecutive possessions midway through the fourth to give Atlanta a 14-point lead. Dennis Schroder's corner 3 made it 108-89 with 3:17 remaining. Schroder finished with 16 points and Korver had 14. ""We really just couldn't hold on,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""We have to do whatever we do by committee and we just didn't do that. They historically have been a hard matchup for us."" The injury-marred Sixers were without center Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jerryd Bayless and Nerlens Noel. Okafor, who had offseason knee surgery and played just three minutes Friday, was on a 24-minute limit. Embiid was sitting out the second night of the back-to-back. Philadelphia dropped to 1-45 in October and November dating to Nov. 22, 2013. The Sixers have dropped 19 straight on the road. The Hawks took their first double-digit lead on Bazemore's 3 in the closing seconds before halftime. ""On the turnovers, they were able to get some easy baskets,"" Korver said. ""It's been a problem for us all year. It's something we have to clean up. Coach Bud wants us to play free and to make things happen. He doesn't want to take that away, but we have to be better, and that's what he tells us."" Sergio Rodriguez had 13 points for Philadelphia. Dario Saric and Nik Stauskas each added 12. Robert Covington scored all of his 11 points in the third. ""We made the run that allowed us to get back in the game,"" Covington said. ""We have to sustain that. I know we're short-handed but that's part of the situation we'll be in."" TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid had 25 points in Friday's overtime win over Indiana, but the 7-foot, 275-pound center isn't playing both nights of back-to-back games in his rookie season after the No. 3 overall pick in 2014 had to sit out two years with right foot injuries. Hawks: Atlanta began the night ranked second in field-goal percentage, third in assists, first in turnovers forced, second in points off turnovers and seventh in rebounding. ... They ranked 24th in rebounding last season, but the presence of Howard, the NBA's active leader in career rebounds, has paid off in his first Hawks season. IT'S NOT EASY Budenholzer and Brown both took charge of their teams in 2013 after spending nine seasons together as San Antonio assistants. Budenholzer feels for Brown, whose teams have struggled with a staggering number of high-profile injuries. ""I genuinely marvel at him to be honest with you,"" Budenholzer said. ""What he does I don't think many people could do."" Budenholzer is 153-102 with the Hawks with three playoff appearances. Brown is 48-207 and has the most losses in Sixers history. STAR TIME Actors Jason Bateman and model Jasmine Sanders had front-row seats at center court.","400899582"
"CHICAGO --  Whether he had the Chicago Bulls on his shoulders or not, Jimmy Butler couldn't deny this. He sure gave them the lift they needed. Butler scored 37 points, and Chicago beat the short-handed Washington Wizards 106-95 on Saturday night. He took charge when the Bulls needed it, helping them pull away on a night when the Wizards were missing star guards John Wall and Bradley Beal. Butler finished two points shy of a season high he set against Atlanta on Wednesday. He hit all 14 free throws, grabbed eight rebounds and dished out a season-high nine assists. ""I don't consider that carrying,"" Butler said. ""I consider that making some shots and doing what they need me to do. That's being aggressive."" Butler showed it early on and helped the Bulls put away the Wizards in the second half, though he did have some help. Nikola Mirotic came on strong to finish with 17 points. Dwyane Wade scored 14. Taj Gibson chipped in with 13 points, and Robin Lopez added 10 points and 13 rebounds. The Bulls won back-to-back games for the first time since a 3-0 start, but forward Doug McDermott exited with a concussion early in the fourth quarter. Markieff Morris had a season-high 24 points after scoring 20 the previous night. Marcin Gortat added 18 points and 14 rebounds. Sheldon McClellan scored 15 with Beal missing his second straight game because of a sore right hamstring. Tomas Satoransky chipped in with 12 points and nine assists filling in at point guard for Wall, who scored 28 in Friday's loss to Cleveland, and the Wizards fell to 0-4 on the road. ""We got to play better,"" Gortat said. ""We got to compete. We need energy. We need effort. We got to make shots There's a lot of things that we can do better. I mean right now, as far as I know I think we have one of the worst benches in the league right now."" Washington's reserves got outscored 32-18, though McClellan and Satoransky were in the lineup with Beal and Wall out. BUTLER'S LIFT Butler got off to a scorching start with 21 points in the first half and kept it going with 11 more in the third to help the Bulls turn a 56-53 deficit into an 81-70 lead. ""When you've got a guy who is obviously an All-Star in this league but he's right in the prime of his career, my job and (Rajon) Rondo's job and everybody's job is to get the best out of him,"" Wade said. ""Right now, we're seeing it -- and he sees it, too -- how great he can be."" Leading 70-68 with about three minutes left in the third, Butler hit two free throws, a layup and a step-back jumper with 1:19 left. In the closing minute, Wizards coach Scott Brooks jumped off the bench and got called for a technical when Jason Smith fouled a dunking Gibson. McDermott made the technical free throw. Gibson missed his foul shot, but hit a layup to make it an 11-point game. FOUL PLAY McDermott was in the air going for a layup or dunk in the opening minute of the fourth when a rotating Morris hit his left arm and sent him crashing to the floor. McDermott banged his head in a hard fall that quieted the crowd. He walked off the court and headed back into the concussion protocol after missing a game 10 days earlier. Morris got called for a flagrant foul 1, and Mirotic hit two free throws. ""That was a regular old-school foul,"" Gibson said. ""But the way Doug took off, he left himself out in the open. ... I don't think nobody really tries to hurt anybody. It's one of those plays."" TIP-INS Wizards: Wall, coming off surgery on both knees, isn't playing in both halves of back-to-back sets. Coach Scott Brooks said that could change after the Wizards play Philadelphia and New York on Wednesday and Thursday. ... Beal is day to day. Bulls: Coach Fred Hoiberg said that Carter-Williams has not experienced any setbacks in his recovery from a bruised left knee and sprained left wrist. Carter-Williams was expected to miss four to six weeks after taking a hard fall at Brooklyn on Oct. 31.","400899583"
"HOUSTON --  Tony Parker showed why he is so valuable to the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday night. Kawhi Leonard led the Spurs with 20 points in their 106-100 victory over Houston, but Parker's court presence proved to be the biggest difference between this victory and Wednesday's night's 101-99 home loss to the Rockets without him. ""He's a great point guard, very smart, knows where guys' spots are on the floor, and he's been here before,"" Leonard said. ""He knows what (Gregg Popovich) expects, and if one of us gets out of line or if we're doing well, he tells us. He just makes us better."" Parker missed three games with knee soreness last week, and the Spurs lost consecutive home games for the first time since December 2014. On Saturday night, he scored a season-high 16 points and played 27 minutes, his second-highest total of the season. ""He gets us organized,"" Popovich said. ""He hasn't been with us so much this season. He's just a stability factor, and that was a big help."" Parker was not made available to reporters. The Spurs improved to 5-0 on the road, where they have outscored opponents by an average of 12.8 points. James Harden had a triple-double for a second straight game against the Spurs, finishing with 25 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds, but also added seven costly turnovers. A deep 3-pointer by Eric Gordon cut the lead to four with 2 minutes remaining, but Houston struggled to make stops down the stretch. ""Just messed up coverages,"" Harden said. ""They're a really good team. They make you mess up."" Gordon scored 27 points off the bench, going 7 of 12 on 3-pointers. Houston attempted 47 3s in the game, making 15 (31.9 percent). The Rockets have lost three of their last four home games against the Spurs in the I-10 rivalry after winning seven of the previous eight. With the Spurs up 16 early in the fourth, a loud ""Go Spurs Go!"" chant overtook the Toyota Center crowd. LaMarcus Aldridge had 16 points, Pau Gasol scored 15 and Manu Ginobili added 12 off the bench. Harden hit a running 39-footer at the buzzer to cut San Antonio's lead to 26-22 after one. Leonard tried a buzzer-beater of his own to end the second quarter with a deep 3, but it clanked off the front of the rim, and the Spurs led 49-40 at the half. TIP-INS Spurs: Danny Green returned to the starting lineup after resting for Friday night's win over Detroit. Green scored five points in 27 minutes. ... Houston native SF Jonathon Simmons scored six points in 16 minutes. ... San Antonio entered Saturday's game leading the league in free throw percentage (86.3 percent) and ranking second in 3-point percentage (39.6 percent) and finished 19 of 24 from the line and 5 of 18 from 3. Rockets: Houston went scoreless for the first 3 minutes of the game, missing its first eight shots. ... PG Patrick Beverley was inactive as he continues to recover from knee surgery but participated in pregame warmups and plans to play later this week. ... Trevor Ariza had 15 points, and Clint Capela added 12 points and 10 rebounds. HARDEN'S MINUTES Harden entered Saturday ranking fifth in the league with 37.6 minutes per game and played 39 minutes on Saturday night. Coach Mike D'Antoni said reducing those minutes as much as possible is important in keeping Harden healthy down the stretch, and he believes getting Beverley back in the next few games will allow Harden some added rest. ""That's just too many minutes,"" D'Antoni said. ""Pat will be able to alleviate a lot of that."" ANOTHER ONE Harden joined Elvin Hayes as the only players in franchise history to record consecutive triple-doubles. The Rockets fell to 9-2 in the 11 games where Harden has had a triple-double. LIVE BY THE 3. Houston forward Ryan Anderson said Leonard's defense was a factor in holding him to 1 of 7 from beyond the arc. ""Obviously, their main goal is to get me off the 3-point line,"" Anderson said. ""They did a great job of taking away normal shots, but at the same time, I had a lot of open looks that I just missed and that's on me."" ALL TOGETHER NOW With plenty of early season absences from Green, Parker and others, Saturday night was the first time this season where the Spurs had everyone in their usual rotation available in the game.","400899584"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers burst into Minnesota Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau's postgame press conference, hollering ""Can you come on! I'm out here waiting!"" to his longtime friend and former assistant. ""That's what happens when you win,"" a chuckling Thibodeau said. Rivers would know. Blake Griffin had 20 points and 11 rebounds and DeAndre Jordan had 18 points and 16 boards to lead the Clippers to their sixth straight victory, 119-105 on Saturday night. Chris Paul had 19 points and eight assists and J.J. Redick scored 18 points for the Clippers (9-1), who have the best record in the NBA. Los Angeles shot 52.6 percent and outscored the Timberwolves 21-10 in transition. ""This is the best team I've had here,"" Rivers said. ""But we got to keep doing it. We've got to keep getting better and performing. But this is a heck of a basketball team."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 24 points and 10 rebounds and Ricky Rubio had seven points, six assists and six rebounds in his return from a five-game absence for Minnesota. Andrew Wiggins scored 22 points, but shot just 8 of 24. ""We had to work for our shots,"" Wiggins said. ""The clogged the paint up, switching everything, contesting every shot. They made it hard on us."" The Clippers are off to their best start in franchise history and have so far exhibited all the qualities of a team that can make a deep playoff run. Once a weakness, the bench has been a strength this season. And they entered the game as by far the best defensive team in the league, allowing a paltry 90.4 points per game. After slugging it out with Oklahoma City on Friday night, Los Angeles put the clamps on the young and athletic Timberwolves, who entered the game with the most explosive first-quarter offense in the league. The Clippers outscored Minnesota 34-21 in the period, holding the Wolves to 39 percent shooting and forcing four turnovers, and they never looked back. ""There are some good things, but to beat a team that's rolling like that, we have to obviously play a lot better than we did,"" Thibodeau said. TIP-INS Clippers: Defensive stopper Luc Mbah a Moute scored 15 points on 6-for-8 shooting. ... Redick hit 2 of 7 3-pointers, extending his streak to 66 straight games with at least one made from long distance, the longest active streak in the league. ... F Wes Johnson did not play because of a sore heel. He was injured on Friday night in Oklahoma City after a blocked shot. Timberwolves: Thibodeau fell to 8-9 in his career against Rivers. ... F Brandon Rush was inactive and has not played in the last three games. HACK-A-JORDAN The Wolves went to the Hack-a-Jordan strategy just over midway through the fourth quarter, with Cole Aldrich fouling him on three straight possessions to get Jordan to the line. As Aldrich headed to the bench 30 seconds later, Jordan gave his former teammate a playful shove off the court. The strategy did not work, either. The big man hit 10 of 16 foul shots in the never-ending fourth quarter. ""I'm confident up there. I've got a routine,"" Jordan said. ""I've got everything I need and I'm just going to go up there and shoot."" GRIFFIN'S MILESTONE Griffin entered the game needing 17 points to join an exclusive club with 9,000 career points, 4,000 rebounds and 1,500 assists. Griffin got it on a free throw in the fourth quarter. He became the fastest player to reach that plateau since Larry Bird. ""It's an honor to be mentioned in that category, but Larry went on to have quite a bit more,"" Griffin said. ""That's the ultimate goal, having a career like that. It's cool to have a start like that, but that's not the end goal, a goal by any means.""","400899585"
"MIAMI --  The first shot of the game was blocked by Utah's Rudy Gobert, which seemed appropriate. Defense carried the Jazz again. Gordon Hayward scored 25 points, Rodney Hood added 17 and the Jazz added to Miami's miserable start by beating the Heat 102-91 on Saturday night. The Jazz pulled away with a 15-0 run that started late in the second quarter and lasted midway through the third. ""That's who we need to be,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""That's what our strength is with Rudy, and our guys on the ball, and our wings with their size. We're a different type of defense, we're more of a containment defense. But that's who we need to be and we need to make it hard on people."" Hassan Whiteside had 15 points and 14 rebounds for Miami. James Johnson scored 15 points, Rodney McGruder added 14 and Josh Richardson had 12. The Heat missed 13 straight shots in that scoreless stretch, 10 of those to start the second half. ""That's not who we are, that's not who we've been for the last month,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Definitely disappointing."" Utah was without George Hill (right thumb) and Boris Diaw (right knee) again, then lost Derrick Favors to left knee soreness in the first quarter. But a night after holding Orlando to 74 points, and playing for fifth time on a seven-night trip, the Jazz limited Miami to 59 through three quarters -- building enough of a cushion to endure the Heat shooting 61 percent in the fourth. ""It's big with a couple of guys out,"" Hood said. ""It's been a long road trip. We've played a lot of games in a short amount of days."" Gobert had 12 points and 12 rebounds.

"MILWAUKEE --  To pull away from the Memphis Grizzlies, the Milwaukee Bucks went back to their strength. The Bucks scored 18 of their 50 points in the paint in the fourth quarter, using two big runs to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 106-96 on Saturday night. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 27 points, while Michael Beasley added a season-high 19. Despite switching to a zone defense in the second half, Memphis could not slow the Bucks.

""During that stretch late when they went zone, he did what he does best and that's get the ball in the paint."" Memphis pulled to within 95-90 on a basket by Randolph with 4:41 left, but Beasley answered on the other end. Chandler Parsons made a 3-pointer with 2:56 remaining to cut Milwaukee's lead to 99-96.

""We were kind of sporadic and scattered."" In addition to leading the Bucks in scoring, Antetokounmpo bounced back from a pair of down games to fill the stat sheet with six rebounds, five assists, four steals and four blocks. ""My teammates wanted to get me back into a rhythm because they told me from day one that they need me,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I've just got to do whatever it takes to win.

Andre Drummond and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 14 points apiece for the Pistons, who also snapped a seven-game losing streak in Denver a week after beating the Nuggets in their first meeting in Detroit. Emmanuel Mudiay scored 19 points for Denver, which was done in by another slow start after being outscored 36-21 in the first quarter. The Pistons never trailed in the contest and also benefited from 16 Denver turnovers leading to 17 points. ""It is the same old story,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We outscored them 74-70 in quarters two, three and four. But when you spot them a 15-point lead in the first quarter. And we threw the ball over. Our turnovers are an epidemic."" Danilo Gallinari added 18 points for the Nuggets, who remained winless in three games at home this season. Gallinari's mid-range jumper pulled Denver to 97-93 with 3:02 left but Drummond came right back to sink a hook shot for Detroit. Harris' jumper with 1:07 left stretched Detroit's lead to eight points. Denver fell behind by as many as 17 points early on but used an 18-6 run late in the second quarter to get back in the game, pulling to 57-49 at halftime. TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond added 12 rebounds to complete his seventh double-double of the season. ... Caldwell-Pope has scored in double figures in six of his last seven games. ... Detroit also never trailed in its first win this season against Denver. Nuggets: F Darrell Arthur (left knee soreness) and F Will Barton (left ankle sprain) remain sidelined. Arthur and Barton have each missed the past six games. ... F Wilson Chandler was back in action after missing the previous two games with a sore left hamstring. ... Gallinari has scored 10 or more points in each of the first nine games. SECOND THOUGHTS Malone conceded an experimental switch to power forward from his natural position of center has not been working out well for second-year pro Nikola Jokic. The Nuggets coach said he plans to give Jokic more time at the 5 spot going forward. ""He had an unbelievable rookie year playing the 5,"" Malone said. ""I told him I feel like I've done him a disservice almost, exploring playing big. There are some good things with that, but I took a kid who had a great year last year, changed his position on him and it hasn't been easy for him. So my hope is to try to get him more minutes at 5. He will play some 4 at times but we need to get Nikola back.""","400899588"
"PHOENIX -- Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had a little extra energy on the court Saturday. The second-year pro learned just before the game that his mother had been flown in to Arizona to watch her son play. She watched from her second-row seat as Hollis-Jefferson scored a career-high 20 points with 13 rebounds in the Brooklyn Nets' 122-104 victory over the Phoenix Suns. ""Just to have her here, that was more special to me than the 20 points,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. ""I winked at her about three times."" Brooklyn got its first road win of the season, scoring 17 straight points late in the fourth quarter to extinguish the Suns' comeback attempt. The Nets held a 102-100 lead with 4:16 to play when their decisive run began. It included Brook Lopez's 3-pointer with 1:47 to go to make it 113-100, and some tight defense on the Suns' top scorers. ""Defense, it gives you that energy, that joy that you want. When you stop someone and you go down and score, it's like `Woo! That was fun!"" Hollis-Jefferson said. ""We enjoy that whole process, the stop and the score."" Trevor Booker added 19 points and eight rebounds, and Sean Kilpatrick had 19 points and nine boards for the Nets. Joe Harris also scored 19 points. T.J. Warren scored 18 points for the Suns. Jared Dudley added 17 off the bench. The Suns fell apart after Devin Booker's short jumper pulled them within two points with a little more than 4 minutes left and lost for the third time in four games. Phoenix shot a season-low 37.4 percent. The Suns' 107 shot attempts were the highest in an NBA game this season, regulation or overtime. ""This is the first team that played the defense the way they played it,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""They ... made us play out of the weak side, so they did a great job of taking away the paint, taking away the lane."" The Suns took a lot of shots early in possessions. ""We just locked down defensively,"" Trevor Booker said. ""We shut down their transition and made them play half court."" Harris' two free throws gave Brooklyn its biggest lead of the first half at 57-41 with 1:08 to go. The Nets finished the half up 58-45 after leading by double digits for the last 5:19. TIP-INS Nets: G Jeremy Lin remains out with a strained left hamstring. He watched Saturday's game from the bench and is expected to be re-evaluated this coming week. ... F Isaiah Whitehead missed his second straight game with a concussion and was not with the team Saturday. Suns: C Tyson Chandler remains away from the team due to a family matter and missed his third straight game. ... Rookie Tyler Ulis played 11 minutes, the most action he's seen since getting 18 on Halloween against the Los Angeles Clippers and the third game in which he's played this season. ANOTHER COACH, ANOTHER COMPLIMENT Add the Nets' Kenny Atkinson to the list of NBA coaches who have praised Booker's game. ""I'm impressed with the confidence, the swagger he plays with and the attack mentality,"" Atkinson said. Booker, the team's leading scorer at 21.5 points per game coming in, made only 5 of 18 shots and finished with 11 points. CHRISS SHOTS Suns rookie Marquese Chriss got his third start and finished with a career-high 16 points. Chriss eclipsed his high of seven shot attempts before halftime, and took 15 in the game. LOUD FAN HEARS IT A vociferous fan sitting a few rows up from the court yelled at Watson to take Booker out of the game after a missed shot in the fourth quarter. The fan had been critical of the Suns all night, and Watson turned to him and calm but audibly said ""Shut up."" BROOK BLOCKS Nets center Brook Lopez set the season high for blocks for a Nets player with four, three of those in the first five minutes.","400899589"
"CLEVELAND -- LeBron James played with a different supporting cast down the stretch, but the result looked familiar. James, Cleveland's only starter on the floor in the fourth quarter, scored 11 of his 19 points in the final period and the Cavaliers rallied for a 100-93 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday. Check out the team site for more game coverage Channing Frye scored a season-high 20 points and played the entire fourth quarter, along with James, Iman Shumpert, Richard Jefferson and Jordan McRae. ""Our second guys did a great job,"" James said. ""It was good we were able to close the game out. We got stops and we made shots."" Kyrie Irving scored 19 points and Kevin Love added 17, but coach Tyronn Lue stuck with the group that helped Cleveland take control of the game. J.R. Smith, who starts at shooting guard, was sidelined with a sore right ankle. ""They were playing great,"" Lue said. ""Kevin and Kyrie said, `Let it roll.' They understood and we got the win."" The Cavaliers set an NBA record by hitting at least 10 3-pointers in each of the first nine games of the season. James scored eight points on 4-of-15 shooting through three quarters before taking over in the fourth, when he also had five assists. Kemba Walker scored 21 points for the Hornets, who have lost two straight after starting the season 6-1. Charlotte led 72-71 after three quarters, but Frye's 3-pointer off James' assist put the Cavaliers ahead 77-74. James blocked a shot by Frank Kaminsky that led to Jefferson's basket and scored in the lane, putting Cleveland ahead 81-76. He also hit a 3-pointer and found Frye for another 3 that stretched the lead to 89-80 midway through the quarter. Charlotte cut the margin to 94-90, but James hit a 3-pointer and a free throw as Cleveland put away the game. Frye was 7 of 15 from the field, including 6 of 12 on 3-pointers.

Cleveland made 12 of 22 shots in the first quarter. TOUGH ONE TO TAKE Walker sat in front of his locker for more than 20 minutes after the game. ""I think we just let the game get away from us,"" he said. They made some great plays and just found guys when they needed to. We had a few mental mistakes that didn't help, as well."" IT'S OK WITH US Irving and Love jumped off the bench several times in the fourth quarter and didn't have a problem with not returning to the game. ""It's about the growth of the team,"" Irving said. ""The reliance isn't on the normal guys every night. It's an exciting time."" Love scored 15 points in the first quarter. ""Everybody was making plays in different ways,"" he said. ""LeBron always is, but especially with that unit he was the quarterback out there."" Irving averages a team-high 23.9 points while Love scores 20.6 a game, the third-highest total. James is second with a 22.9 average.","400899590"
"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Serge Ibaka showed the Thunder the best of what they let go. The forward, traded from Oklahoma City to Orlando in the offseason, hit a baseline jumper with less than a second remaining to give the Magic a 119-117 win over Russell Westbrook and the Thunder on Sunday night. ""Coach called my name, and I was ready,"" Ibaka said. ""I work on my shot every night and every summer, so I was just ready to make a play."" Though he enjoyed his time with the Thunder and respects the organization and the fans, he said it was an emotional day and it was important for him to play well. He scored a career-high 31 points and added nine rebounds and four blocks. ""I'm not going to lie to you, it feels good,"" he said. With the score tied in the final minute, Westbrook missed a pull-up jumper, and Orlando rebounded and called timeout with 11 seconds remaining to set up Ibaka's winner with 0.4 seconds left. Ibaka pump-faked Steven Adams, got him to bite, then drained the shot. ""He had a special performance,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""A night I'm sure he'll remember for the rest of his career."" Ibaka was cheered loudly during pregame introductions. He acknowledged the fans by twice raising both arms to the sky. ""It shows that the people still love me, and I respect that and appreciate that a lot,"" he said. Westbrook finished with 41 points, 16 assists and 12 rebounds for his third triple-double of the season and 40th of his career. The Thunder had won 20 straight when Westbrook tallied a triple-double. ""We were playing too slow,"" he said. ""The faster we play, the harder it is to guard us, especially when we get the ball moving."" Elfrid Payton scored 23 points and Evan Fournier added 21 for the Magic, who snapped a three-game losing streak. It was the third straight home loss for the Thunder after a 6-1 start. ""We've got a lot we need to work on and continue to work on, and all these guys are working, are trying, are really giving good effort,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Oklahoma City's Victor Oladipo, who came to the Thunder in the Ibaka deal, scored 12 points. The Magic led by 21 in the second quarter and were up 57-47 at halftime. Ibaka scored 19 points before the break to match Westbrook's 19 points. The Thunder rallied late in the third quarter. A putback by Enes Kanter with 1:35 left in the third quarter tied the game at 80. Oklahoma City led 84-82 heading into the fourth quarter.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Andrew Wiggins: 47. All five Los Angeles Lakers starters: 47. Wiggins hit 14 of 21 shots to blow past his previous career high of 36, leading the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 125-99 victory over the Lakers on Sunday night. ""I'm finding myself, finding things I'm good at and things I need to work on,"" said Wiggins, nine games into his third season in the league. ""The game has kind of slowed down for me a little bit. I'm able to read defenses better now and see how the defense is set."" Wiggins hit 17 of 22 free throws and Nemanja Bjelica added a career-high 24 points and eight rebounds for the Timberwolves, who played without starting guard Zach LaVine and reserve forward Shabazz Muhammad. Both missed the game with sore right knees. Lou Williams scored 13 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter for the Lakers, who got 47 points from their starters and 52 from their bench. Julius Randle had 14 points and six rebounds and Jordan Clarkson scored 14. ""You let a player as good as him get an additional 22 free chances on that, one he's going to score a lot and two he's going to get hot because he's in a rhythm from all the free throws he's shooting,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""We couldn't really contain him tonight."" Wiggins was a team-best plus-34 in 41 minutes, and LaVine showered his close friend with Gatorade during his postgame television interview. The Wolves went 13 of 27 from 3-point range, many of them clean shots coming after the defense collapsed on Wiggins. ""I think he's just scratching the surface,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I think he can do a lot more."" The game featured two of the most promising young cores in the league, with Wiggins, LaVine and Karl-Anthony Towns hoping to end Minnesota's 12-year playoff drought and D'Angelo Russell, Randle and Brandon Ingram reviving the Lakers in the post-Kobe era. Entering the season, the Lakers were believed to be a step behind the Wolves in the process, but they won six of their first 10 games while Minnesota got off to a disappointing 2-6 start. Both teams played on Saturday night, but the Wolves were finishing a rare home back-to-back, and appeared to have the fresher legs all night. The Timberwolves scored 21 points off of 17 Lakers turnovers. TIP-INS Lakers: C Timofey Mozgov was in foul trouble all game, playing just 15 minutes before fouling out. ... Ingram played after being listed as questionable with a sprained ankle suffered on Saturday night in New Orleans. Ingram finished with 10 points in 26 minutes. ... The Lakers wrapped up their three-game road trip at 2-1. Timberwolves: Wiggins scored a career-high 25 points in the first half. ... F Brandon Rush missed his fourth straight game, and coach Tom Thibodeau  revealed that Rush has been dealing with a bruised big toe on his right foot. BJELICA STARTS With LaVine injured, Thibodeau inserted the 6-foot-10 Bjelica, normally a power forward, into the lineup at small forward and moved Wiggins to shooting guard. The former Euroleague MVP made five 3s and also had three steals and a block. ""I thought he played a beautiful game tonight,"" Thibodeau said. ""He made really good decisions."" LAKERS BENCH The second unit has been a strength for the Lakers all season, averaging 52.1 points per game in the first 10. The leading scorer from the game has come from their bench in eight of 11 games so far this season. ""No excuse,"" Russell said of playing three games on the road in four nights. ""We just lost.""

"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Nobody will argue the Golden State Warriors have a lineup of reliable, superstar scorers. They nearly had a trio of 30-point performers. Defenders, that's still to be determined. ""We're trying to win a championship, you don't do that simply by outscoring people,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Klay Thompson hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 4:31 left and another with 3:13 remaining to score a season-high 30 points, Stephen Curry also had 30 points with five 3s, and the balanced Warriors held off the Phoenix Suns 133-120 on Sunday night. Kevin Durant added 29 points, nine rebounds and five assists as he Warriors avoided a second home loss at this early stage that would have matched their total of two defeats at Oracle Arena in each of the past two regular seasons. Thompson shot 11 for 18 also with five 3s and scored 14 of his points in the fourth, while Draymond Green finished with 14 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds as Golden State overcame 16 turnovers for 18 Suns points. Eric Bledsoe and T.J. Warren scored 20 points apiece to lead six players in double figures for the Suns, who hardly looked sluggish in the second night of a back-to-back. ""You can't let them shoot 50 percent from the field,"" Thompson said. ""If we want to get where we want to go, we have to pick it up on that side of the ball."" Thompson's 3-pointer with 6:58 to go tied the score at 106 but Leandro Barbosa answered with a 3 against his former team and Brandon Knight's free throws with 6:15 remaining made it 111-96 Suns. Devin Booker added 19 points for Phoenix, while P.J. Tucker kept the Suns in it. His putback with 9:53 left tied it at 101, he made a pair of free throws at 9:18 and a reverse layin with 8:40 to play to make it 104-103. Tucker had eight points and eight rebounds. The Warriors own their longest winning streak against the Suns at nine games, including 10 in a row at Oracle Arena. Still, Green insists Golden State must do more on both ends. ""Fans aren't going to bring energy to a game like this because they're expecting us to come in and beat them by 30,"" he said. Warren had four steals for Phoenix, and the Suns took 90 shots a day after putting up an NBA-high 107 in a home loss to Brooklyn. BARBOSA IS BACK Barbosa returned to Oracle for the first time since joining the Suns following two seasons with Golden State, but blamed himself afterward for several mistakes down the stretch. ""I gave the spark for them, the crowd got into the game and it was tough to shut it down,"" he said. Golden State showed Barbosa highlights on the big screen during a first-quarter timeout and he watched intently with his hands on his hips near one baseline. He smiled and waved in all directions as fans jumped to their feet for a standing ovation. ""We built up something really special with this team,"" Barbosa said. ""Good memories. We built something unique. You can never forget that."" Steve Nash also attended the game with his family -- a reunion of sorts for the guard with his old Suns team as he now works as a player development consultant for Golden State. DISHING AND DASHING The Warriors shot 50 percent or better from the field with at least 30 assists in a fourth straight game, the first time they have done so since 1994.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  A fiery halftime speech from coach Terry Stotts spurred the Trail Blazers over the Nuggets. Portland had fallen behind 57-50 at the break and the defense was struggling. ""He got after us, and pretty much told us what we were doing was not acceptable and we couldn't keep doing it -- putting ourselves in that position and not playing smart as we're capable of and not playing as hard as we need to be to give ourselves a chance,"" Damian Lillard said. Lillard finished with 32 points and Portland handed Denver its fourth straight loss with a 112-105 victory on Sunday night. CJ McCollum added 21 points for the Blazers, who have won five of their last six games. Portland came alive in the second half after Stotts' speech and outscored Denver 36-15 in the third quarter. ""He got on us, he yelled at us a little bit, and it's up to us to go out and answer the call,"" Lillard said about the halftime talk. ""I thought we did a great job responding."" Jamal Murray hit a 3-pointer to pull Denver within 110-105 in the final seconds, but the rally came up short. It was the Blazers' seventh straight victory over the Nuggets at the Moda Center. Murray and Danilo Gallinari led the Nuggets with 19 points apiece and Kenneth Faried added 18. Fourteen of Murray's career-high points came in the fourth-quarter rally. He made five 3-pointers. Denver's Gary Harris, who has started in four games for the Nuggets this season, was out because of a right ankle sprain. Harris started and had 13 points in the Nuggets 106-95 loss at home to Detroit on Saturday night. While he injured his ankle during the game, he returned to play. Jameer Nelson started in his place on Sunday. Reserve forward Wilson Chandler, who has struggled with a left hamstring strain, also played and had 18 points. ""Once we're aggressive and play as a team we can beat anybody, but we didn't do that in the third quarter,"" Chandler said. ""They came out and just flipped it on us. They were the aggressors in the third quarter and they just jumped on us."" The Blazers were coming off a 122-120 overtime victory over the Sacramento Kings on Friday night. Afterward, Lillard said the Blazers needed to play well for longer stretches. Portland went up 13-7 early on Meyers Leonard's alley-oop dunk but Denver wrestled away the lead and went up 28-20 at the end of the first quarter on Nelson's 3-pointer. Jusuf Nurkic's hook shot pushed Denver's lead to 48-31 midway through the second quarter. The Blazers played their way back, with Maurice Harkless' layup pulling Portland within 52-46. Portland trailed 57-50 at the half, but closed to 58-55 on CJ McCollum's layup. Portland took a 61-60 lead on Harkless' 3-pointer and his fast-break layup stretched the advantage to 73-64. Harkless finished with 17 points. Asked about what he said at halftime, Stotts wouldn't reveal much. ""We talked about defense,"" he said. TIP-INS: Nuggets: Chandler has had six games this season with at least 10 points. He had 11 in the first half alone against Portland. ... The Nuggets rank last in the league for turnovers with an average of 18 per game. Against the Blazers they had 18. Trail Blazers: The Blazers beat the Nuggets 115-113 in overtime earlier this season in Denver. With six assists tonight, Damian Lillard surpassed Geoff Petrie for fourth place on Portland's all-time list for assists with 2,058. LILLARD-PROTESTS: There have been protests every night in Portland since Tuesday's election of Donald Trump. At times the demonstrations have turned violent with property damage, a non-fatal shooting and 71 arrests on Saturday. ""I think it's very unfortunate that people have done some of the things they have done during the protest. A lot of harm and damage has been done,"" Lillard told ESPN. ""I do understand their frustration, and I commend people wanting to come together for some kind of change. Tearing apart your own city just isn't the place to begin, and also making your own city less of a safe place isn't the answer."" There has been increased security at the Moda Center since the election. MURRAY'S BIG NIGHT: ""I was getting worried missing them early,' he said about his fourth-quarter surge. "" I was so wide open and I wasn't hitting them so I wanted to make up for that."" In addition to his top game in terms of points and 3-pointers, the rookie out of Kentucky also had a season-best five rebounds.","400899594"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  About 90 minutes before Monday night's game, Pacers coach Nate McMillan wasn't sure if Paul George was going to suit up. Magic coach Frank Vogel knew better. ""I'm expecting him to play,"" Vogel said with a grin. George scored 13 points in his return from a sprained ankle, and the Pacers spoiled Vogel's return to Indiana with an 88-69 victory Monday night. Vogel coached the Pacers for 5 1/2 seasons before he was let go in May. He was quickly scooped up by Orlando, and it looks as if he has plenty of work to do with the Magic. He remains popular in Indiana, and he was cheered when he was introduced before the game. ""I love Frank,"" said Pacers reserve C.J. Miles, who made four 3-pointers and scored 16 points. ""Frank's one of the reasons I'm here. He believed in me and I'll never forget that."" Orlando shot 32 percent from the field and committed 16 turnovers, resulting in 20 points for Indiana. Evan Fournier led the Magic with 14 points on 4-of-15 shooting, and Aaron Gordon had 11. George also had six rebounds and five assists for the Pacers, who pulled away in the second half. Monta Ellis also scored 13 points, and Jeff Teague finished with 11. Indiana led by as many as 21 points during the fourth quarter. George and Vogel exchanged text messages in recent weeks specifically talking about this game, but the coach was focused on his team after its fourth loss in its last five games.

"NEW YORK --  The New York Knicks spent $72 million to make Joakim Noah the anchor of their defense. On Monday, they sat him down and turned around a game. Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis each scored 24 points, and the Knicks rolled after a halftime lineup change and beat the short-handed Dallas Mavericks 93-77. The Knicks benched Noah, their big free-agent signing, starting guard Justin Holiday and moving Porzingis to center in a small lineup. They responded by scoring 31 points in the third quarter after managing just 36 in an ugly first half. ""Second half was really good. Coach made the decision to play small,"" Noah said. ""I didn't get to play, everybody wants to play, but it's good that we won. We found a way. It was much-needed."" Anthony scored 17 in the third quarter and 20 in the second half after shooting 1 for 6 in the first half. Porzingis finished with 11 rebounds, though coach Jeff Hornacek doesn't think his move to starting center is going to be permanent. ""Just because it was good in the second half doesn't mean we're going to change it,"" Hornacek said. Harrison Barnes scored 20 points and J.J. Barea had 17 for the Mavericks, who are still without Dirk Nowitzki and Deron Williams. The remaining lineup was good enough to take a 39-36 halftime lead but got run off the floor once the Knicks returned with a different look. ""This is where everybody has got to be totally together, help each other out, really focus on doing the little things at a high level,"" Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. ""I thought the first half we did that. In the second half we had breakdowns."" Anthony made a 3-pointer to open the half and later had six straight points in the midst of the Knicks' 19-6 run that Holiday capped with a 3-pointer that made it 55-45. New York outscored Dallas 31-12 in the period as the Mavs shot 5 for 20, and it was 67-51 headed to the fourth. Porzingis and Anthony made consecutive 3-pointers that pushed it to 82-64 midway through the period and soon both were on the bench for good. Noah, a defensive-minded center who battled injuries in his final season in Chicago, grabbed six rebounds in 16 scoreless minutes. He didn't play in the second half, while Holiday finished with 16 points. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas had won five straight and 24 of the last 29 meetings. ... Barnes had scored 25 or more in a career-best three straight games. Knicks: The Knicks snapped a two-game losing streak. ... New York won for the first time in five games this season when scoring fewer than 100 points. DIRK WORKS Nowitzki had a lengthy pregame workout on the court, but by then the Mavs had already determined that he would miss his fourth straight game with a sore right Achilles. ""I think he's really close. He's feeling a lot better and we just don't want to rush anything,"" owner Mark Cuban said. ""There's no reason to rush anything with him."" TAKE TIME Dallas was twice called for technical fouls in the fourth quarter for calling timeout when it had no timeouts remaining. HELPING HAND Hornacek asked Carlisle if Nowitzki would work out with Porzingis in September. They couldn't get anything scheduled but both sides hope they can eventually. ""Dirk's a giver, he would love to see every international guy have the same opportunities he's had,"" Carlisle said. ""It's something that didn't work out because I think at the time in September Dirk's travel schedule and Kristaps' health situation didn't match up, but maybe sometime in the future. I know that Dirk would look forward to spending time with him and vice versa.""","400899596"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  Right now, Aron Baynes is probably best known for his samurai-style haircut. If Andre Drummond misses much more time, Baynes could become known for his rugged play. With Drummond sidelined by a sprained ankle, Baynes had 20 points and eight rebounds to help the Detroit Pistons beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 104-88 on Monday night. ""This was because of everyone else,"" Baynes said. ""They got me the ball in great position, and all I had to do is finish. They were drawing the defense and I was left with the easy part."" Baynes came within a point of his career high and played tough defense on Steven Adams, who had just four points in 29 minutes. ""As the president of the franchise, I probably shouldn't promote my own players,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""But Aron is a starting center in the NBA. The only reason people don't know that is because we've got an All-Star ahead of him."" The Pistons (6-5) improved to 5-0 at home despite being without Drummond and Reggie Jackson, who hasn't played this season due to knee tendinitis. ""Our defense at home has been great,"" Van Gundy said. ""I'm not quite sure why we haven't been able to duplicate that on the road yet, but we're locked in at home."" Russell Westbrook had 33 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists for Oklahoma City (6-5), which has dropped four in a row. Victor Oladipo finished with nine points, but he was the only other starter to score more than four. ""I'm not worried about our offense -- that's fine,"" Westbrook said. ""It is our defense. We've got to defend at a high level, and we're not doing that."" Andre Roberson, who finished with four points in 29 minutes, said the Thunder's defensive struggles are being amplified by their inability to hit shots. ""This is a humbling moment for us,"" he said. ""We've got to find a way to get past the lack of jump shots going in."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 17 points for Detroit. The Pistons used their post players to build a 59-47 halftime lead despite Westbrook's 25 points. Oklahoma City missed nine of 10 3-point attempts in the half, and Oladipo went 1 for 7 from the floor. Harris and Baynes each scored 13 points. Detroit led by as many as 19 in the third, but its reserves didn't have as much success as they had in the first half. The Thunder finished the quarter with a 13-2 run to trail 78-68. Despite Westbrook's best efforts, the Thunder couldn't put together a serious run down the stretch. On several occasions, he was able to pull defenders toward him and find an open teammate, only for them to badly miss the shot. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook scored Oklahoma City's last 14 points in the first half. ... Jerami Grant and Enes Kanter combined to hit nine of 16 shots in the first three quarters, helping keep Oklahoma City in the game. ... Westbrook picked up a technical foul in the first half for an accidental low blow against Caldwell-Pope. Pistons: Detroit is the last team in the NBA to be undefeated at home. ... With Drummond sidelined, the Pistons only grabbed one offensive rebound in the first half. ... Baynes got hit on his protective mask by Westbrook late in the fourth, and needed medical attention to stop the bleeding from his previously broken nose. ""Tonight was my last night with the mask, and it was good to have it on,"" he said. JUST TOO LATE Westbrook almost had 28 first-half points, but a replay review showed his 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer was still in his hand when time expired. BACK ON THE ROAD After a four-game road trip, the Pistons were only making a brief stop at home. They play their next two games on the road before coming back to the Palace on Saturday. ""I thought this was an outstanding homestand, and I can't wait to get back on the road,"" Van Gundy joked.","400899597"
"Pelicans forward Solomon Hill rises up on Celtics guard Marcus Smart and throws down an epic dunk on him, but it did not count due to a charge being called on the play. (0:15) NEW ORLEANS -- Anthony Davis wore a supportive strap on his aching back and still managed to carry the New Orleans Pelicans on his shoulders until scrappy guard Tim Frazier could finish it off with clutch plays on both ends of the court. Davis had 25 points, 16 rebounds, four steals and two blocks, and the Pelicans won for only the second time in their first 11 games, 106-105 over the Boston Celtics on Monday night. Frazier made a crucial steal of Marcus Smart's inbound pass near New Orleans' basket with 14 seconds left. He also drew a shooting foul from Kelly Olynyk with 2.5 seconds left, setting up his go-ahead free throw for the final margin. ""He plays big,"" Davis said of Frazier, who finished with 10 points. ""He went in there with all them trees down there and got that steal. ... And then, that was a great job, a high basketball IQ, to draw that foul."" Langston Galloway scored a season-high 21 points for New Orleans, which began the season with eight straight losses. Fellow reserve Terrence Jones added 15 points and a season-high 10 rebounds. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said his concern coming into the game wasn't so much what Davis would do, but whether he'd get more of the help he's been lacking. ""Anthony is going to be Anthony,"" said Stevens, whose team limited Davis to 7-of-22 shooting. ""You can't let Langston Galloway go off. Jones has had great games against us for as long as I can remember. ... They really hurt us tonight."" Isaiah Thomas scored 37 for Boston, including a driving scoop that tied the game with 7 seconds left. Frazier then pushed the ball up the floor and the 7-foot Olynyk picked Frazier up defensively near the perimeter. ""I knew I had a big on me, so I tried to see if I could get him to go, and he went,"" Frazier said. Olynyk said he tried to challenge what initially looked like a shot attempt, and then Frazier ""jumped into me and I picked up the foul."" In part because the Celtics were out of timeouts and unable to advance the ball, they failed to get a decent shot off in the final 2 seconds. Boston's first inbound attempt from its own baseline deflected off New Orleans along the sideline with a tenth of a second left. The Celtics then attempted a long pass in hopes of a tip-in, but the inbound hit the rim and Smart's attempted put-back in a crowd of players was off the mark. Boston's Avery Bradley had 19 points and 10 rebounds. Smart scored 15 points, but Bradley said the Celtics didn't play well and failed to give Thomas help. ""It can't just be Isaiah,"" Bradley said. ""It's got to be other players out there making shots. ... Everybody's upset about it."" TIP-IN Celtics: Al Horford missed his seventh straight game because of concussion symptoms and it remains unclear when he'll return. ""I don't want to put a timetable on it because I think it's about how he feels day to day,"" Stevens said. Stevens added that once the Celtics decided not to play Horford, they got him an early flight back to Boston so he could get more rest. Pelicans: Rookie shooting guard Buddy Hield made his first start in place of E'Twaun Moore. After tip-off, the Pelicans announced coach Alvin Gentry had decided to give Moore the night off to rest a right big toe injury. ... The Pelicans' win was their first at home, where they improved to 1-5. BACK PAIN Davis could be seen lying on the court near the bench when he wasn't playing and said it was to ease stress on his back. ""Every time I sit down it just tightens up, so that was the best way for me to try to keep it loose,"" Davis said. ""You've got to play through it, fight through and try to do whatever you can do to help your team win."" SQUANDERED LEAD New Orleans led by as many as 14 points when Dante Cunningham's 3 made it 65-51 in the third quarter, but the Pelicans briefly lost the lead in the final minutes. ""We've got to continue to eliminate some of the mental mistakes and putting ourselves in harm's way,"" Gentry said. But Gentry also added that he was pleased his team ""hung in and found a way to win.""","400899598"
"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets were determined to get off to a fast start and keep the pressure on Philadelphia after seeing the 76ers rally after trailing big on several occasions this season. They executed that plan perfectly. James Harden scored 23 of his 33 points in the first quarter, and the Rockets cruised to a 115-88 win over the 76ers on Monday night. ""We came in, made shots and defensively really locked in and didn't give them any confidence early in the game,"" Harden said. ""They've had a couple of games where they've lost down the stretch against some really good teams, especially at home. So it was important for us to go out there and take advantage of the opportunity."" Harden, who posted a triple-double in his previous two games, added nine assists and seven rebounds. The Rockets had a three-point lead with five minutes left in the first quarter when Harden took over, scoring all of Houston's points in a 17-9 surge to make it 35-24. Harden, who was named Western Conference Player of the Week on Monday, made a pair of 3s, all three shots after being fouled on a 3-pointer and a nifty reverse layup in that span. He made each of the eight shots he attempted in the quarter to set a career high for points in a period. ""The first quarter was ridiculous,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. The Sixers were led by Joel Embiid and Ersan Ilyasova, who had 13 points apiece. Harden cooled off after his huge first quarter and didn't score in the second period, but the Rockets still had a 65-52 lead at the break. The 76ers made just five of 19 shots in the third quarter, and Houston stretched its lead to 93-68 entering the fourth. ""We felt like it was still in us to make this into a game, but the game got away from us,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""We saw a great player dominate the first period and we dug ourselves a hole from the beginning."" Harden is off to a stellar start this season in his first season in D'Antoni's fast-paced offense. He has scored at least 24 points in each of Houston's first 10 games this season. TIP-INS 76ers:  Embiid, who returned after sitting out the last game to rest, led Philadelphia with 10 rebounds. ... Nik Stauskas scored 12 points, and Dario Saric and Gerald Henderson each had 11. Rockets: The Rockets made 17 3-pointers and have made at least 10 3s in nine straight games, which ties a franchise record. ... Nene had 13 points for his third double-digit game this season. He added a block to give him at least one in six straight games. ... Clint Capela had 13 rebounds. BLOCK PARTY The Rockets had a season-high 10 blocks. Capela led the way with a career-high five and five other players, including Harden, had one apiece. Harden raved about the work of Capela, who took over for Dwight Howard at center this season. ""If he plays like that we're going to be really good,"" Harden said. THEY SAID IT Philadelphia's Robert Covington on the struggles of the 76ers, who have won just one game: ""We are still trying to figure things out. A lot of guys haven't played a lot of basketball together. We see a lot of what we're capable of, it's just a matter of time before all things come together."" BEVERLEY'S RETURN Houston guard Patrick Beverley is nearing a return after missing all season after arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. D'Antoni said he expects him to play sometime this week and there is a possibility he could make his debut as early as Thursday. D'Antoni said he would start when he returns. Beverley averaged 9.9 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.4 assists in 71 games last season.","400899599"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs got knocked around by the Miami Heat, especially in the second half. Some bumps and bruises weren't enough to stop a San Antonio team that finally had its starting five intact, though. Kawhi Leonard had 24 points and 12 rebounds, LaMarcus Aldridge added 18 points and San Antonio held on to beat Miami 94-90 on Monday night. The Heat held the Spurs to 26 percent shooting after halftime but couldn't find enough offense to prevent their fifth straight loss. ""You have to give them credit,"" Spurs point guard Tony Parker said. ""They played great defense in the second half. They played with more energy and they played more physical. We have to find a solution next time."" San Antonio's projected starting five of Leonard, Aldridge, Parker, Pau Gasol and Danny Green made its home debut after injuries to the starting backcourt led to five different starting lineups in the team's first nine games. Despite that, the Spurs committed a season-high 17 turnovers and got roughed up throughout. Gasol tumbled to the floor on several occasions, including crashing into the stanchion after being struck from behind by Dion Waiters on a layup. Green did not play in the second half after taking a knee to the groin in the first half. ""Second half was probably one of our better defensive halves and we've had some really good defensive halves in games this year,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""But that's about as hard as we've competed on that end."" The Heat pulled within 87-83 with two minutes remaining, but the Spurs were able to extend their lead when Patty Mills and Leonard were fouled on consecutive possessions. Waiters, who tormented San Antonio in the playoffs last season while with Oklahoma City, had 27 points. He was 12 for 26 from the field but did not attempt a free throw. ""That's the crazy part about, I'm not the type of guy that would question the referees on anything,"" Waiters said. ""But I look at how many layup attempts I got tonight, like 15, and I haven't gotten to the line one time."" Center Hassan Whiteside had 23 points and 17 rebounds, giving him a double-double in eight of nine games this season. Gasol had 12 points, Parker added 11 points and six assists and Green was limited to three points in 15 minutes. The returning starters sparked a 21-6 run in the first quarter after the Spurs gave up the game's first four points. Aldridge was 4 for 4 in the opening quarter, setting up on the wing and awaiting feeds from Leonard, Green and Patty Mills. Aldridge made his first seven shots before finishing 8 for 14. The Spurs nearly blew that early efficiency with a sloppy third quarter. ""We were out of sync a little bit with our offense, especially in the third,"" Leonard said. ""It starts off with me. I've got to be more patient and run the offense."" TIP-INS Heat: Miami PG Goran Dragic is no longer in a walking boot and is doing light bike work as he recovers from a sprained left ankle. Dragic missed his second straight game. ... F Derrick Williams made his first start of the season. He finished with five points and a rebound in 16 minutes. ... Miami completed its season series with San Antonio, marking the earliest the teams have done so in their history. The earliest series completion previously was Dec. 6, 2003.

ROAD TRIP San Antonio will embark on its longest trip of the season, playing four of its next five on the road starting Wednesday night in Sacramento. The Spurs are 5-0 away from home. ""We've been playing pretty good on the road,"" Leonard said. ""It's the home games that have been bothering us. It's always tough to play on the road. We've just got to focus in as always."" NO. 2 is No. 1 Leonard has the highest career winning percentage of any player in league history that has played in a minimum of 300 games.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Even as the Memphis Grizzlies transition under first-year coach David Fizdale, the old guard of Marc Gasol, Mike Conley and Zach Randolph is still leading the way. Gasol scored a season-high 22 points and the Grizzlies beat the Utah Jazz 102-96 on Monday night. ""I feel like this is the best four quarters we've put together,"" Fizdale said. ""Guys, they want to win. They really want this and we've worked really hard over the past couple days to clean things up."" The Grizzlies used a 9-2 run sparked by Mike Conley's step-back 3-pointer and a three-point play by Gasol to take a 94-88 lead with 1:25 remaining. Memphis led by as many as 13, but the Jazz kept answering with big plays from Joe Ingles and Trey Lyles. ""I always try to lead my team,"" Gasol said. ""I'm trying be more vocal with the guys and keep us stable. ""By my play, I always try to find the right play, the right open guy."" Conley had 18 points and seven assists, and Randolph added 18 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. Ingles scored a career-high 20 points and Lyles chipped in 18. The Grizzlies led 56-48 at halftime behind a 56.8 shooting percentage, their best in any half this season. They also contained Utah's best players -- Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert -- to 13 combined points on 4-of-12 shooting in the first 24 minutes. ""(The defense) was porous in the first quarter, to say the least,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""That was the nuts and bolts of the game -- there were times we got a stop and couldn't secure the ball. ... I didn't think we were as physical as we needed to be to close possessions."" TIP INS Grizzlies: Gasol has extended his range. After making 12 3-pointers over his first eight seasons combined, he made two Monday to bring his season total to 12. ... Vince Carter scored 20 points off the bench. ... Memphis outrebounded the Jazz 44-29. Jazz: Rodney Hood (illness) and George Hill (thumb) did not play. It was Hill's fifth consecutive game out. ... Boris Diaw returned from a right leg contusion after missing eight games. ... Favors left the game in the fourth quarter with left knee soreness and did not return. HOME SWEET HOME The Jazz returned home after a five-game road trip on which they went 4-1. Snyder was asked if he was sure he wanted to return to Salt Lake City? ""You always want to be at home,"" Snyder said. ""The whole thing about any game, and particularly a longer road trip, is hopefully you can get better. In our case, that means getting healthy. Try to learn how to win when you're not at full strength, which has unfortunately been a theme for us so far this year. ""I think guys support each other and sometimes that's the most important thing for guys that are thrust into roles that aren't as permanent and they're able to get confidence and confidence is a big thing. Coach can try to give it to you. You can find it on your own and teammates can help you locate it. I think that's one of the things we've got going."" CULTURE CHANGE The Grizzlies made a coaching change after last season despite making the playoffs for six consecutive seasons. Fizdale said they have to be patient while adapting to a new culture and new roles. However, the days of Grit and Grind from coach Dave Joerger's era aren't all the way over. ""I don't want to subtract from any of that,"" Fizdale said. ""I still want it to be gritty. I just don't want our offense to be in a grind. I want to be able to get the ball up the court and score more points. Our field goal attempts are where they need to be, we just aren't shooting the ball great. ... A lot of that is chemistry and sometimes the shots just don't fall."" QUOTABLE ""We rely on our older guys for leadership,"" Conley said. ""We have guys that have played 15-plus years in the league and have done everything. We use that to our advantage but we don't want to use them too much. ... So hopefully we can get more out of young guys and let the old guys rest a bit as we go along.""","400899601"
"LOS ANGELES --  Even as their leads expand to 30 and sometimes 40 points, the Clippers swear they're not paying attention to the spread. For the NBA's best team, it's all about consistency. Chris Paul had 21 points and nine assists and Blake Griffin added 20 points in a 127-95 rout of the Brooklyn Nets on Monday night that improved the Clippers to 10-1 with their seventh straight victory. ""We have a singular focus,"" Paul said. ""No excuses, we said we're going to come out the same way every night. It's all about playing the right way. We got to keep building."" Los Angeles came in having outscored opponents by an average of 15.1 points, largest in the league. Brooklyn quickly found itself relegated to the Clippers' growing scrap heap. ""It's actually good for our guys to see a team like this,"" new Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""They can see how well they are playing and their cohesiveness. They've been together for a while and they're executing well. They turned us over and got us out of our game."" Bojan Bogdanovic led the Nets with 18 points and Sean Kilpatrick added 14. Brooklyn's season-high 22 turnovers led to 35 points by the Clippers. J.J. Redick added 18 points, Luc Mbah a Moute scored 11 points and DeAndre Jordan had 14 rebounds for the Clippers, who shot 53 percent from the floor while extending the best start in franchise history. Their 127 points were a season high. ""The defense is so good right now our offense is allowed easy baskets,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""They're angry when the other team scores."" Los Angeles raced to a 35-7 lead to start the game, highlighted by Jordan's reverse dunk off Griffin's alley-oop pass. The Nets didn't score the rest of their 14 first-quarter points until the last two minutes of the period and finished with their lowest point total in a quarter this season. Brooklyn went on its only run of the game in the second, scoring 10 straight points to close to 51-34. Paul re-entered and hit a 3-pointer that launched a 20-13 spurt to give the Clippers a 71-47 halftime lead. Leading 89-59 in the third, Griffin and Jordan energized the fading crowd with consecutive one-handed jams. Griffin stuffed a pass from Redick , and on their next trip up the court, Jordan dunked in front of Justin Hamilton, whose only defense was to stick his arms straight up in the air. The starters' work was done after that, with Griffin and Jordan joining Paul, Redick and Mbah a Moute in sitting for good. The Clippers' bench increased the lead to 102-71 heading into the fourth, when Griffin was on his feet laughing and pumping his arm in the air.

"CLEVELAND -- The Cavaliers are far more focused on how they'll finish. They are not complaining about their start, though. With Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson sitting courtside, LeBron James came up one rebound shy of a triple-double and Kyrie Irving scored 24 points to lead Cleveland to a 121-117 win over the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday night, making the Cavs 9-1 to match their best start after 10 games. James had 28 points and 14 assists as the Cavs improved to 2-0 this season against the Raptors, the team they beat in last season's Eastern Conference finals and the one they could meet there again in 2017. The Cavs last went 9-1 in 1976-77. ""I don't really pay attention to the records,"" said James. ""But I do pay attention to the teams we're playing, and what they bring to the table."" The Raptors bring a lot, and are one of the only teams in the East capable of going to toe-to-toe with the defending NBA champions. However, Toronto came up short against Cleveland just as it did in last year's playoffs. ""I'm not encouraged by any loss,"" said Raptors guard Kyle Lowry, who finished with 28 points and nine assists. ""We want to win every single game. Every time we touch the floor we want to win games."" Channing Frye's 3-pointer from the top of the key with 59 seconds left put the Cavs up by one. Cleveland then buckled down on defense, holding the Raptors scoreless until letting Lowry make a layup with 2.8 seconds left. Kevin Love added 19 points and 13 rebounds for the Cavs, who have already had their share of tight games. ""We're one of the teams at the top that's going to get every team's best shot,"" Love said. ""That's a team we have history with. They're well-coached. They know how to play and you saw them fight back tonight. That's the kind of tension in playing those type of teams early that's going to be good for us. We've had certain lapses in our first 10 games that we need to clean up. But we're getting teams' best shots home or away and we'll be a better team for it."" DeMar DeRozan added 26 for the Raptors, who complained about fouls called against Lowry and Jonas Valanciunas in the final two minutes and a possible goaltending violation against the Cavs that wasn't called in the closing seconds. Toronto came in 5-0 in games where Lowry and DeRozan combined for more than 50 points. Lowry was also whistled for a technical in the final two minutes. ""The ball bounced of my foot,"" Lowry said. ""I wasn't trying to slam it. I dribbled the ball and it bounced of my foot. It's not like it went far. Coach (Dwane Casey) caught the ball. Whatever, keep my money."" The Cavs made 13 3-pointers and have dropped at least 10 in all 10 games, extending their league record to start a season. TIP-INS: Raptors: With so many shooters, and James' passing ability, the Cavs can stress defenses to the max. ""They have that extra point guard on the floor in LeBron,"" Casey said. ""He finds people the normal human being doesn't see."" Cavaliers: Coach Tyronn Lue is hopeful J.R. Smith can return for Wednesday's game at Indiana. Smith needs three 3-pointers to pass Dirk Nowitzki for 15th place on the career list. ... G/F Mike Dunleavy is off to a rough start in his first season with Cleveland. Acquired from Chicago over the summer, Dunleavy is shooting just 29 percent (8 of28) on 3-pointers. ""We're not worried about Mike,"" Lue said. ""He's going to find his way."" ON THE BENCH The Raptors played without starting forward DeMarre Carroll, who was given the night off to rest his surgically repaired knee. He also sat out Saturday's game against New York as he continues to recover from right knee surgery. Smith missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle, leaving Cleveland without one of its top outside threats and defenders. FINALS TEST On consecutive nights, the Raptors are taking on the league's top two teams in Cleveland and Golden State, last season's finals participants. ""It should be fun,"" Casey said. ""It should be exciting for our players to go against the champion and the runner-up from last year. It's not going to make or break our season.

Dennis Schroder scored 18 points, Paul Millsap and Tim Hardaway Jr. each had 15 and the Hawks pushed their winning streak to five games by beating the reeling Heat 93-90 on Tuesday night. The Hawks were held nearly 17 points below their season scoring average, and prevailed despite shooting just 35 percent in the fourth quarter. ""To find a way to win on the road against a team that competes every night in Miami, I think it's a positive,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Mike Muscala scored 14 and Kent Bazemore added 12 for the Hawks.

""We're obviously not playing our best basketball yet,"" Millsap said. Hassan Whiteside scored 19 points and grabbed an NBA season-high 25 rebounds for Miami, which has now dropped six straight. The eight Heat losses so far this season have come by an average of 6.9 points -- with three of the last four coming by four points or less. All of the teams that have beaten Miami so far are currently over .500. ""We're not losing to bad teams,"" Whiteside said. ""We're right there. It makes no sense to get down on ourselves.

Josh Richardson also scored 19 for Miami, which got 14 points from Tyler Johnson, 13 from James Johnson and 11 from Dion Waiters. Miami got within one twice in the final 13.6 seconds, but the Hawks held on with free throws. Schroder swished a pair with 5.9 seconds left to put Atlanta up by three, and the Heat -- with no timeouts -- lost when Waiters' 3-pointer hit the rim and bounced away as time expired.

Kemba Walker scored 30 points and the Hornets blitzed the Timberwolves in the third quarter on their way to a 115-108 victory on Tuesday night. Frank Kaminsky scored 12 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter for the Hornets (7-3), who snapped a two-game skid. Nicolas Batum had 16 points and seven assists, and Charlotte outscored Minnesota 36-17 in the third quarter to wipe out a 12-point halftime deficit. ""It was perfect timing, and we needed it,"" Walker said of Clifford's speech. ""We just (weren't) ourselves, and he got into us a little bit. It worked out for us, because we needed to pick our energy up."" Andrew Wiggins scored 29 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and eight rebounds for the Timberwolves, who fell to 1-2 on their four-game homestand. Minnesota turned the ball over 18 times, which led to 20 points for Charlotte. The teams entered the game on opposite ends of the spectrum in the third quarter this season. Charlotte leads the league in scoring differential coming out of the break, while Minnesota is dead last. The Timberwolves have built double-digit leads in the first half in eight of their first 10 games, but have lost six of them thanks to the failings in the third. That trend continued on Tuesday, with Charlotte opening the third with a 15-2 run and closing it with a 21-4 surge. ""Very concerned,"" Thibodeau said. ""It tells you we're not learning. That bothers me."" Wiggins rallied the Wolves in the fourth, giving them a 92-91 lead with a 3-pointer. But Kaminsky responded with a 3 and a three-point play, and Clifford got the best of his longtime friend. ""We've got guys who have been in the league for a while now,"" Thibodeau said. ""We're making mistakes that never should be made."" WALKER'S BACK A scary moment happened at the end of the first quarter when Walker, who scored 12 points on 6-for-7 shooting in the period, went to the locker room. The team said his back tightened up and he went back to get stretched out. Walker was able to return to the game midway through the second quarter and played the rest of the game with no visible issues. ""My training staff, they're the best,"" Walker said. ""They did a great job at looking out for me when I came out the game with the heat pack, good massages, things like that. But I'm feeling good though."" BADGERING TOWNS Kaminsky was on the Wisconsin team that stunned Towns and previously undefeated Kentucky in the Final Four two years ago. After ruining Towns' shot at history in college, Kaminsky helped spoil the reigning Rookie of the Year's 21st birthday on Tuesday. ""I don't have anything against him. He's a great player,"" Kaminsky said. ""I just want to go out there and compete."" LAVINE RETURNS Timberwolves shooting guard Zach LaVine missed the win over the Lakers on Sunday with a sore right knee, something he said he's been dealing with for more than a week. He looked just fine on Tuesday, hitting his first four 3s and finishing with 19 points in 33 minutes. TIP-INS Hornets: They shot 53.8 percent from the field and made 11 of 24 3s, including eight of their last 14. ... Clifford said G Jeremy Lamb, who has missed the last seven games with a strained left hamstring, practiced on Monday and will work out on Wednesday and Thursday back in Charlotte with the possibility of playing on Friday night against Atlanta. Timberwolves: F Shabazz Muhammad (right knee) and G/F Brandon Rush (right big toe) both were out. Rush said he hopes to be ready to play on Thursday. ... After shooting 22 free throws on Sunday, Wiggins was just 6 for 9 on Tuesday.","400899605"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  A pregame chat with teammate Dwyane Wade inspired Jimmy Butler against the Blazers. Butler went on to have 27 points and 12 rebounds, and the Chicago Bulls opened a six-game road trip with a 113-88 victory over Portland on Tuesday night. Wade had 19 points for Chicago, which extended its modest winning streak to three games. Former Blazers center Robin Lopez added 13 points and 11 rebounds. ""I was talking to D-Wade before the game and he tells me to go out with a killer instinct, make them adjust to you -- go out with a full head of steam and show them why you are one of the best players in the league,"" Butler said. ""That's what I try to do. Having D-Wade tell me that makes me think there is some truth to it."" The Blazers, who had won five of six, were cold from the start, falling behind by as many as 26 points. Damian Lillard, who made just two shots from the field in the first half, finished with 19 points. Chicago, coming off a 106-95 victory over Washington on Saturday, was without Rajon Rondo because of a left ankle sprain. Jerian Grant made his first start of the season and had 18 points. The Blazers played their third straight game without starting forward Al-Farouq Aminu, who has a sore left calf and is expected to be re-evaluated next week. Meyers Leonard has been inserted into the lineup in his absence, but he struggled and played 15 minutes with no points. The Bulls built a 20-7 lead to open the game as Portland struggled, hitting just two of 13 shots. The Blazers were outscored 35-14 in the first quarter. Butler led the way with 11 points. Lillard, who was ranked third in the league with an average of 30.7 points a game, went 0 for 7 from the floor and didn't make his first basket until midway through the second quarter. ""Once we got in that hole we couldn't dig out,"" Lillard said. Butler finished the half with 19 points and the Bulls led 56-37. Wade had a two-handed dunk to extend Chicago's lead to 66-42. ""We believe in ourselves, we are buying into the system, everyone is working on their game,"" Butler said. ""We are actually paying attention to the scouting reports and doing what we're supposed to do to win."" Blazers coach Terry Stotts was asked if it was just one of those nights for Portland. ""I don't know, I think it's difficult to evaluate. You ask about effort? When you shoot 20 percent (in the first quarter) I don't think that's effort,"" Stotts said. ""So that's why it's a little difficult to evaluate when you're struggling on the offensive end."" TIP-INS Bulls: The Bulls lead the league with an average of 13.6 offensive rebounds per game. They had 19 against Portland. ... Doug McDermott was also out because of a concussion. ... Lopez and LaMarcus Aldridge, Nicolas Batum and Wesley Matthews all left the Blazers prior to last season, leaving Lillard as the lone starter to return. Trail Blazers: The Trail Blazers hosted the team's first Pride Night to celebrate diversity and inclusion. Proceeds from special sweatshirts and a raffle will go to the Q Center, a local LGBTQ community center. ... At the half, the Blazers also honored athletes who participated in this summer's Rio Olympics with Oregon ties, including hurdler Devon Allen and marathoner Galen Rupp. JERIAN'S START: Grant made his first start a memorable one. In addition to his 18 points he also had five steals. ""Jerian stepped in big tonight, guarding one of the best point guards in the league,"" Wade said. ""He just found out right before the game that he was starting and he played big for us tonight."" BULLS IN PORTLAND: Chicago has won two consecutive games in the Rose City for the first time since 1995-98, when it won three straight.","400899606"
"LOS ANGELES --  Coach Luke Walton claimed his Los Angeles Lakers never really got into an offensive flow, even if the 125 points they dropped on the Brooklyn Nets suggested otherwise. Imagine what might happen if Walton's surprising young squad actually finds its groove. D'Angelo Russell scored 32 points and Julius Randle added 17 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists for his second career triple-double in Los Angeles' 125-118 victory Tuesday night. Timofey Mozgov had 20 points and six rebounds for the Lakers, who maintained a steady lead down the stretch of their fourth win in five games at Staples Center this season. With six wins in eight games overall, the Lakers (7-5) are two games above .500 for just the second time since April 2013. ""We all love to play this game together, even on nights when it isn't all clicking,"" said forward Tarik Black, who had 12 points and nine rebounds in just 13 minutes. ""We didn't care what people were saying about this team before the season started. It's about this locker room. We knew what we had."" Russell hit seven 3-pointers and had eight rebounds for the Lakers, who didn't win seven games until New Year's Day last season, the worst in the 16-time NBA champion franchise's history. Russell had the highest-scoring individual performance by any player this season for the Lakers, whose 10-deep player rotations and balanced production have made them particularly tough to play. Russell lit up Brooklyn again after scoring a career-high 39 on the Nets last year, including eight 3-pointers that prompted his now-famous ""Ice in My Veins"" celebration of big shots. While Mozgov had his highest-scoring game for his new team, Randle added another balanced floor game in his first triple-double since March 25. ""He is continuing to get better and really realize what he is capable of doing,"" Walton said of Randle. Brook Lopez had 30 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 29 points as Brooklyn rebounded solidly from a 32-point thrashing delivered by the Clippers in the same building one night earlier while Lopez sat out to rest. ""We bounced back from last night's tough loss,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We just have to sustain it a little longer and do a little better on the defensive end."" But the Lakers shot 43 free throws to the Nets' 20, and Los Angeles solidly controlled the boards. ""Down the stretch, I don't want to comment too much on the calls, but we did foul too much and put them on the line,"" said Lopez, who hit four 3-pointers. ""That made it tough for us. We still had great looks. I want our guys to take those shots. They just didn't go down."" BENCH BATTLE The NBA's two most productive benches had big games. Led by Jordan Clarkson's 13 points, the Lakers' reserves outscored the Nets' bench 43-40. Yogi Ferrell led the Brooklyn bench with 11 points. BLOCK PARTY Lopez became the Nets' franchise leader in blocked shots, passing George Johnson's 863 blocks with three against the Lakers. Johnson played for the franchise from 1977-80 and 1984-85. Lopez has blocked at least three shots in four consecutive games. He has accomplished that feat in five straight games just once, in November 2012. STEEP SCHEDULE The Lakers just returned from a road trip that showcased their young roster's potential and limitations. They won at Sacramento and New Orleans, but were then routed by Minnesota on Sunday after their third long-distance flight in four nights. The Lakers will have to get used to learning on the court: Starting Friday, they will play 18 games in 30 days with five back-to-backs and no consecutive days off. TIP-INS Nets: Former Lakers G Jeremy Lin missed his sixth straight game with a hamstring injury. ... Former Nets forward Andrei Kirilenko watched the game from courtside. Lakers: Clarkson had a career-high five steals. ... LA has beaten Brooklyn three straight times. ... The Lakers scored 120 points for the fourth time this season after managing the feat just three times in the previous two seasons combined.","400899607"
"PHILADELPHIA --  After helping the Philadelphia 76ers build an eight-point lead down the stretch, Jahlil Okafor could only watch from the bench as the lead dwindled. Okafor scored 19 points on 8-for-11 shooting before fouling out with 2:56 left and Richaun Holmes made a key 3-pointer with just over a minute remaining to help the 76ers beat the injury-plagued Washington Wizards 109-102 Wednesday night. Okafor went to the bench with the Sixers holding a 101-93 lead. Washington then made a run, pulling to 103-100 with 1:29 to play. However, after a timeout, Holmes made a 3-pointer from just in front of the Wizards' bench to extend the lead to six points with 1:10 remaining. ""That was big,"" Okafor said. ""I was excited. I know how hard he works every day, so for it to go in for him and for the team, it was a big win for us."" Holmes added: ""I tried to get out there as fast as I could and get ready to shoot the ball. We've talked about picking my spots and that was pretty good spot to pick."" Ersan Ilyasova had 16 points, Nik Stauskas scored 15 points, and Gerald Henderson 14 to help the 76ers win for just the second time in 11 games this season. Dario Saric added 13 points and 12 rebounds. The 76ers were without leading-scorer Joel Embiid, the third pick overall in the 2014 NBA draft, who has been brought along slowly after missing two seasons because of two foot surgeries. ""We're scratching and clawing for wins,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""I think there's something to be said for being able to get a win without Joel, and (Okafor) was a major contributor."" The Wizards, who were held to just one basket in their final three possessions, fell to 2-8. John Wall scored 23 of his 27 points in the second half and Markieff Morris had 19 points for the Wizards, who were without second-leading scorer Bradley Beal. Otto Porter Jr. had 15 points and 13 rebounds, Marcin Gortat added 10 points and 14 boards, and Marcus Thornton also scored 10. ""We're too good to be losing,"" Morris said. ""No disrespect to the Sixers or any other team we lost to. The coach should never have to coach effort, especially when you're 2-7."" Morris was referring to coach Scott Brooks, who said his team came out too slow against the team with the NBA's worst record. The Sixers opened the game with an 11-4 run, thanks in part to Ilyasova's eight points in the opening quarter. The Wizards responded by scoring the next six points, but the Sixers went on an 11-2 run to end the first quarter with a 29-15 lead. Wall, meanwhile, saw just 7:28 in the first half and managed just four points on 1-for-4 shooting. ""I was frustrated, basically the whole first half, only playing 7 minutes,"" said Wall, who is also on minutes restriction after having surgery on both knees in the offseason. ""The game starts getting closer and it's frustrating not being out there to help my guys win the game."" TIP-INS Wizards: Beal sat out his third straight game with a right thigh injury and is questionable for Thursday night's game against the Knicks. ""Every day he is feeling a little better,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We just want to be cautious about it."" Sheldon McClellan started his second game in a row in place of Beal, while Marcus Thornton came off the bench. 76ers: With the Sixers visiting Minnesota on Thursday night, Embiid, who is leading the team with 18.0 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.3 blocks, sat out his fourth game of the season. Embiid, who last played on Monday against Houston, is expected to be limited to 24 minutes through Christmas. ""I follow the instruction (of our medical staff),"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""It's really that simple. It's completely designed to what is best for Joel Embiid."" BACK-TO-BACKS Okafor played in his ninth game and has been cleared to play in Thursday's game against the Timbervolves, although he is likely to haveminutes restrictions. WAITING ON MAHINMI Ian Mahinmi, sidelined since undergoing left knee surgery on Oct. 15, could be back on the practice court for the Wizards next week, according to Brooks. He was expected to miss 4 to 6 weeks but appears to be ahead of schedule.","400899608"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  After giving up a 12-point halftime lead, the Orlando Magic recovered with enough baskets and key stops down the stretch to grind out a big win. Serge Ibaka scored 16 points and Nikola Vucevic broke out of his shooting slump with 10 points and 14 rebounds to help lift the Magic to an 89-82 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night. After Terrence Jones' basket pulled New Orleans to 84-82, Vucevic made back-to-back shots in the waning moments for the win. ""We are going to keep fighting, keep trying to find a way,"" said Vucevic, who finished 10 points and 14 rebounds. ""We're not playing really good basketball right now, it's not easy to get stuff going and get into the flow but we just have to find ways to get wins until we figure that out."" At times in the second half it appeared the Magic were headed to a second straight defeat as their offense tanked and they couldn't get stops against Pelicans' team that found out late that Anthony Davis wouldn't be available because of a thigh injury. Jones, who replaced Davis in the starting lineup, scored a game-high 26 points for the Pelicans. Jones had 12 points in the third quarter to help the Pelicans comeback from a 12-point first-half deficit to pull within one point late in the period. The Magic held on to a 65-63 lead at the end of the third. New Orleans completed its comeback with 9:23 in the game when Buddy Hield knocked down a baseline jumper to put his team up briefly 70-69. But Augustin and Rudez countered with a combined 10 points during a stretch to put the Magic back ahead, 79-73. The Magic shot just 39 percent from the field with all of the starters struggling to hit shots consistently. But without Davis in the lineup, the Pelicans offense was stagnant at times, too, and finished shooting 37 percent. Serge Ibaka and Evan Fournier led the way with 16 points each. ""We talked the whole night that nothing is easy in the NBA,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""It's just one of those things where one guy goes down and everybody else has an opportunity. You are going to work and earn everything."" After a sluggish start, the Magic got going in the second quarter. They came up with stops and Ibaka and Fournier both hit big shots to build Orlando's lead to 15 before heading into halftime with a 52-40 advantage. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry was pleased to see his team fight the way it did in Davis' absence but he still felt they let a winnable game slip away. ""I thought our defense was fantastic, played the whole game,"" said Gentry, whose team slipped to 2-10. ""You just have to find a way offensively to get a few baskets."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Langston Galloway, a free agent signee last summer, followed up his breakout game against Boston on Monday with 15 points off the bench against the Magic. He scored 21 points against the Celtics. ... The Pelicans came in having lost two of three. Magic: Vucevic came in shooting 5 for 32 from field in the Magic's last three games and had not attempted a free throw in any of the three games. ... Jeff Green has struggled since being inserted into the starting lineup for Aaron Gordon. Green went 0 for 9 from the field for zero points on Wednesday night. ANOTHER JONES DOUBLE-DOUBLE (ALMOST) After not getting 10 rebounds in any of his 50 games with Houston last season, Jones came one rebound short of his second straight double-double. Jones had 15 and 10 off the bench Monday in a win over Boston. COLD STARTS The Magic came into the game as the NBA's lowest-scoring (92.6) and worst-shooting (.410) team, and missed their first five shots while the Pelicans were missing their first eight. Orlando shot .386 for the game to New Orleans' .370.","400899609"
"INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indiana Pacers are more than familiar with facing the Cleveland Cavaliers when LeBron James rests, so they didn't get distracted by the four-time NBA MVP's absence Wednesday night. The Pacers beat the LeBron-less Cavaliers 103-92 to improve to 3-1 at home in the past two years when James sits. ""I found out when Coach (Nate McMillan) came in and said, `LeBron's not playing,"" said Pacers point guard Jeff Teague, who had 20 points and eight assists. ""I didn't know, but we needed a win. We weren't worried about who was playing or who was going to be on the floor, we were just going to go out and compete."" Jeff Teague added 20 points and eight assists, and Thaddeus Young had 16 points to help the Pacers improve to 6-1 at home and 6-6 overall. James sat out for the first time this season. Averaging 23.4 points and 8.9 rebounds, he rested after playing Tuesday night in a home victory over Toronto. Guard J.R. Smith also missed the game because of a sprained right ankle. ""It doesn't matter about LeBron not playing,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""We just lost the game."" Kevin Love led Cleveland with 27 points and 16 rebounds, and Kyrie Irving had 24 points and seven assists. The Cavaliers dropped to 9-2 after matching the best start in franchise history with the victory over Toronto on Tuesday night. ""We had our chances,"" Love said. ""We cut the lead to four or five a couple times, and it just felt like we either had a bad possession, had a turnover, and then that lead went to eight or nine points, having to fight kind of uphill to claw back and try to win the game, and it was too little too late."" Indiana led 80-68 lead after three quarters. The Cavaliers cut it to four points midway through the fourth, but the Pacers put it away with a 9-2 run. C.J. Miles hit a 3-pointer for the game's largest lead -- 97-84 with 5:10 remaining. ""Of course it's different,"" Miles said about facing the Cavaliers without James. ""We're talking about him still and he didn't even play tonight. He's arguably the best player in our game. (But) we can't disrespect anybody. They've got guys who can play basketball."" TIP-INS: Cavaliers: Smith has missed the last three games. The last time James skipped a road game at Indiana, the Pacers prevailed 123-109 on April 6, 2016. The Cavaliers extended their NBA-record streak of games with at least 10 3-pointers to start a season to 11 games. Pacers: G Rodney Stuckey (right hamstring strain) was scratched for the 10th consecutive game. Thanks in large part to C Myles Turner's 2.3 blocks per game, Indiana is No. 1 in the NBA with a 6.4 average. HICKORY NIGHT RETURNS: Friday's Indiana home game against Phoenix coincides with the 30th anniversary of the classic 1986 basketball movie ""Hoosiers"" and will be the first of six Hickory Nights, in which the Pacers will wear Hickory Huskers replica uniforms from the movie. Hoosiers screenwriter Angelo Pizzo, director David Anspaugh and some of the film's actors, including Maris Valainis (who played Jimmy Chitwood) will be in attendance. SEE YA DOWN THE ROAD: The Eastern Conference rivals don't play each other again until Feb. 8 at Indiana, then Feb. 15 at Cleveland and April 2 at Cleveland. The Cavaliers have won five in a row at home against the Pacers, who have a 93-88 series edge.","400899610"
"BOSTON --  The Celtics don't want to rely solely on Isaiah Thomas to win. But on some nights, putting the ball in the All-Star guard's hands is simply the best option. Thomas scored 22 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter in Boston's 90-83 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night. He scored 20 of Boston's final 24 points to help the Celtics beat back a late Mavericks' surge. Avery Bradley added 18 points and 13 rebounds. After the Mavericks took a 70-66 lead, Thomas scored Boston's next 13 points to put the Celtics back in front 79-76. They never trailed again. After one of the baskets late in the run Thomas ran down the court and flashed two thumbs up. ""I guess I just like that quarter,"" Thomas said. ""Sometimes guys get a little tighter, and then the pressure gets a little tougher for them. I guess I like the pressure."" Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 28 points. Wesley Matthews added 22. Dallas, which was already missing several players because of injuries, lost two more. Starter Deron Williams exited in the second quarter with a left calf injury, and J.J. Barea was helped off the court in the fourth quarter after straining his left calf as well. Coach Rick Carlisle said it appears Barea will ""be out for a while"", but added that he didn't think it was real serious. He said it's his understanding that Williams just experienced some tightness. The Celtics outrebounded Dallas 53-32, which coach Brad Stevens said is a welcomed sign for a team that struggled in that department early in the season. ""Maybe it's the law of averages, and some just bounced our way,"" Stevens said. ""But we're defending at a better rate than we were."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Have lost three straight. ... Had a season-low 31 points at the first half. ... Dirk Nowitzki missed his fifth straight game with a right Achilles strain. Celtics: Thomas has scored 20 or more points in each of the first 11 games of the season. ... Scored a season-low 90 points. ...Tied their season high with 19 turnovers. ... Boston's 10-point second quarter was its lowest scoring output in a second quarter this season. ... Al Horford remains in the NBA concussion protocol and sat out his eighth straight game. Jae Crowder missed his seventh consecutive game with a sprained left ankle. TEAM MEETING Celtics guard Marcus Smart said the team held a meeting after its blowout loss to the Wizards on Nov. 9 to help refocus its commitment on the defensive end. ""It was no coaches, just us,"" Smart said. ""We had to look ourselves in the mirror and come to the conclusion that it is on us and we're the ones playing and that we have to get it together."" Bradley said the conversation was frank and honest. ""Just that we need to hold each other accountable,"" he said. ""We weren't playing to our ability. We had two or three guys playing hard at the defensive end, but the other three guys weren't. And we needed everyone playing hard consistently as a team. Tonight I feel like was one our best defensive games."" NO FREEBIES There weren't many trips to the free throw line in the first half for either team. The Celtics were just 2 for 6 in the half, and the Mavericks missed their lone attempt in the first quarter. Neither team attempted a free throw in the second quarter. INJURY UPDATE Stevens said Crowder would practice Friday, but that he does not expect him to play Saturday against Golden State. Stevens said his last report on Horford was that the big man had ""a great workout"" on Wednesday. Carlisle said Dirk Nowitzki is making progress as well. ""It feel likes he's getting close,"" he said.","400899611"
"NEW YORK -- Kristaps Porzingis heard the roar of the fans and looked up at the scoreboard to see why they were cheering. The board showed that Porzingis had his first 30-point game in the NBA, and the New York Knicks think it could be the first of many. ""He's figuring everything out,"" point guard Derrick Rose said. ""Like, he's going out here scoring 30 and he really don't know the NBA yet."" Porzingis scored a career-high 35 points and the Knicks held on for a 105-102 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. The 7-foot-3 forward from Latvia hit three 3-pointers and converted a dazzling three-point play in the first half after dunking a lob pass on the fast break. ""You see the whole package tonight,"" coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""He was inside, he was outside. I thought he was great."" Carmelo Anthony added 22 points to help the Knicks win their second straight. Joakim Noah bounced back nicely with seven points and 15 rebounds after he was benched in the second half of the Knicks' victory over Dallas on Monday night while Porzingis moved to center in a smaller lineup. Porzingis played some more center Wednesday and everywhere else on the floor, drawing ""MVP! MVP!"" chants while also grabbing seven rebounds. ""It was just happening, and a lot of stuff that I worked on during the summer came out,"" he said. It almost wasn't enough, as Detroit pulled within two in the final minute and had a chance to tie but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a 3-pointer on the last possession. He finished with 21 points and Tobias Harris added 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Pistons, who had won two straight. Porzingis was 4 for 5 for nine points in the first quarter, then had 16 more in the second quarter, highlighted by his slam that broke a 33-all tie. Kyle O'Quinn had blocked a shot to trigger a fast break, with Porzingis running ahead to catch Brandon Jennings' lob and slam it down while being fouled by Jon Leuer, landing awkwardly but getting up quickly as Knicks players from the nearby bench spilled onto the floor in celebration. ""The guy had a great night and some of what he did is unstoppable,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""But when he outruns you down the floor for a dunk off a missed shot, not a turnover, that's inexcusable."" TIP-INS Pistons: Andre Drummond had 15 points and nine rebounds after missing a game with a sprained right ankle. ... Detroit is 5-0 at home but 1-6 on the road. Knicks: Jennings averaged 14.1 points and 6.6 assists in 144 games with Detroit from 2013-16. ... New York has won three straight and 12 of the last 14 meetings at Madison Square Garden. STAN SPEAKS A day after LeBron James criticized Knicks President Phil Jackson for using the word ""posse"" in an interview to describe James' friends and business partners, Van Gundy was reflective Wednesday when thinking about his own words, calling on people to be aware of their language and attitudes. ""I'm going to be perfectly honest here, I've used that word before, OK,"" Van Gundy said , ""and when that all came out I had to ask myself, have I ever used that word before with a white player, and the answer is no. So, I think, look, you have to be aware of the language and you have to be aware a little bit of your own biases if you're going to overcome them and so I took that seriously.""

"ATLANTA --  Paul Millsap was proud of how well the Atlanta Hawks adjusted with Dwight Howard and Thabo Sefolosha unable to play because of injuries. ""We have a deep team,"" he said. ""It says a lot about our bench and what they bring, that they came in and did a great job and really set the tone for us, especially in the second quarter."" Millsap scored 21 points, Mike Muscala added 16 and the Hawks won their sixth straight game, a 107-100 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 26 points and 15 rebounds, and Jabari Parker scored 15 of his 23 points in the third quarter for Milwaukee. Muscala started in place of Howard, who was sidelined with a left quadriceps contusion. The Hawks improved to 6-1 at home and tied Cleveland for the best record in the Eastern Conference at 9-2. Atlanta's bench, led by 13 points from Tim Hardaway Jr., outscored the Bucks' 35-25. ""The defense was amazing,"" Millsap said. ""The second group came in and moved the basketball. We played how we're supposed to play."" The Bucks, who have lost three of four, pulled within four points on Antetokounmpo's dunk with 37 seconds remaining, but Millsap hit a layup on the next possession to make it 104-98. Milwaukee ended the first quarter with a 26-21 lead but missed their next 11 shots and didn't score until the 5:50 mark of the second. They were outscored 31-9 in the period and went 3 for 27 from the field. Atlanta took its biggest lead at 24 points on Dennis Schroder's 3-pointer early in the third, but Milwaukee scored 35 points in the third quarter and pulled within six with 9:06 remaining on Mirza Teletovic's third 3 of the period. ""It was definitely a character game for a young team to come back and put themselves in that position on the road,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""With 4 minutes left, it was anybody's ballgame. Again, tip your hat to Atlanta. They made the shots and got the stops when they had to."" Antetokounmpo's layup cut the lead to three a couple of possessions later at the 6:24 mark. That was as close as the Bucks could get. ""Our backs were on the wall, so we had no other choice but to be aggressive if we wanted to try to make it close,"" Parker said. ""Those are still good habits to have leading into the next game. But we know from our mistakes that we can't play the first half like we did."" The Hawks improved to 8-1 when leading after three quarters. Schroder and Kent Bazemore scored 12 points each for Atlanta. NEED THE REST Howard was injured in the third quarter Tuesday at Miami, banging knees with Heat center Hassan Whiteside. He did not return and was unable to watch Wednesday's game from the bench. Howard, the active career NBA leader in double-doubles, is averaging 14.8 points and 12.3 rebounds. The eight-time All-Star in his first season with Atlanta. Sefolosha, a reserve forward and the team's best defender, did not play because of a strained right hamstring. His and Howard's absence helped the Bucks outscore Atlanta 50-28 in the paint. SHOWING POTENTIAL During a 6-minute stretch of Atlanta's 19-0 run in the second, rookie forward Taurean Prince was the catalyst. He blocked two shots, drew a foul, made two free throws, had three rebounds, a steal and a hard baseline dunk. Prince, the NBA's No. 12 overall draft pick out of Baylor, finished with eight points and five rebounds in a career-high 19 minutes. ""I thought Taurean was great,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Just the physicality he plays with, the aggressiveness he plays with, he really gave us a big boost on both ends of the floor.""","400899613"
"OKLAHOMA CITY -- As Russell Westbrook took off, he saw Clint Capela as a mere obstacle to victory rather than an athletic 6-foot-10 shot blocker. In the blink of an eye, Westbrook uncorked a vicious left-handed hammer dunk over Capela in the closing seconds to help the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Houston Rockets 105-103 on Wednesday night. Oklahoma City led by three when the 6-3 Westbrook threw it down with 5.5 seconds left to put the Thunder up five. Westbrook said Capela's reputation -- he had already blocked three shots on the night and ranks among the league's leaders -- didn't deter him. ""It don't matter, man,"" Westbrook said. ""Game on the line. If you get blocked, or you make a dunk -- it's one or the other. Fortunately, it went in and it closed the game for us."" Oklahoma City center Steven Adams, who isn't easily impressed, cracked a smile when asked about Westbrook's jam. ""Just happy it's not me,"" he said. ""That's pretty much like the only thing is `Thank goodness he's on my team.' That was crazy. Honestly, he did a good job, Capela. Nice little bit of defense, honestly. Verticality, avoided the foul, and obviously, he's (Westbrook) just a really athletic dude. Just caught him."" Westbrook finished with 30 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. Victor Oladipo added season highs of 29 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder, who snapped a four-game losing streak. James Harden, the league's assist leader and No. 4 scorer heading into the night, finished with 13 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds. He made just 4 of 16 shots while being harassed by Andre Roberson. ""Dre did an amazing job, like he's been doing all season,"" Westbrook said. ""James is a tough player, obviously, and he (Roberson) did a great job of making him shoot over his length. He needs to get credit for what he's been doing defensively all year."" Capela added 13 points and 14 rebounds for the Rockets, who went scoreless for more than six minutes in the fourth quarter to help the Thunder position themselves for the win. ""We didn't play well,"" Harden said. ""We didn't shoot the ball well, and we still had an opportunity to win."" Oklahoma City led 65-63 at halftime as Westbrook had 20 points and Oladipo 17. The shot 61 percent before the break. The Rockets' offense worked, despite just five points from Harden on 1-for-6 shooting. The Rockets started strong after the break, and a 14-5 binge put Houston up 77-70 and led to an Oklahoma City timeout. The Rockets stretched their lead to 11, but the Thunder pulled to 90-85 by the end of the period. Oladipo's 3-pointer with just under three minutes to play tied the score at 100, then Roberson's alley-oop dunk on a lob from Westbrook finally put the Thunder ahead. Westbrook made a free throw to extend Oklahoma City's lead to three with 28 seconds remaining. Houston missed an opportunity when Harden and Trevor Ariza failed to connect while Ariza was open in the corner. That set up Westbrook's game-clinching dunk. ""I still wasn't able to make a couple of passes,"" Harden said. ""Normal game, just didn't make shots, especially down the stretch when we needed to. That was it."" TIP-INS Rockets: G Patrick Beverley, one of Oklahoma City fans' most hated players, was out with a left knee irritation. He hasn't played this season. ... Eric Gordon shot 5 for 20 from the field and scored 13 points. Thunder: It was the second straight home game in which the Thunder faced a core member of its team that reached the 2012 NBA Finals. Serge Ibaka scored 31 points and made the game-winner for Orlando on Sunday. ... The Thunder shot 75 percent in the first quarter to lead 38-32. ... Oklahoma City made 13 of 14 free throws. STAT LINES Oklahoma City's starting guards, Westbrook and Oladipo, combined to make 21 of 38 shots. Houston's starting guards, Harden and Gordon, shot a combined 9 for 36.

He has 68 catches this season for 1,254 yards and 14 touchdowns in 10 games. The eighth-ranked Sooners will play at No. 10 West Virginia on Saturday.","400899614"
"TORONTO --  Drake Night or not, the Golden State Warriors pushed aside the Toronto Raptors. Though the Canadian rapper and Toronto Raptors' global ambassador had never had to witness his hometown team losing on his special night the first three years it had been held, he was powerless to stop the star-studded Warriors leaving town with a 127-121 victory Wednesday night. It didn't stop him chirping the Golden State bench at various points, particularly in the first quarter when the Raptors were up by 10 points. ""He's been talking junk for a couple weeks now, talking about they were going to beat us and that it's Drake night,"" Draymond Green. ""He may be a little disappointed."" Stephen Curry had 35 points and Kevin Durant added 30 in the victory, the Warriors' fifth straight overall as well as their fifth consecutive win over Toronto. While Golden State coach Steve Kerr was a little upset at how the first quarter unfolded, giving up 38 points to the Raptors, he termed the second quarter, ""one of the best quarters we've played."" Case in point, the Warriors restricted the Raptors to 5-for-24 shooting, outscoring them 32-15 and ending the half on a 21-4 run to seize a 66-53 lead at the break. The 66 points were the most the Raptors have given up in a first half at home since surrendering 71 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Jan. 25, 2014. While incorporating Durant into the offense remains a work in progress, the team continued to share the ball around the likes of former most valuable players Curry and Durant, with the team finishing with 33 assists on 44 baskets. It was the seventh time this season that the team has had 30-plus assists. ""Offensively we're moving the ball, no one is in each other's way and we're making shots,"" Durant said. ""We could have had 40 assists tonight."" DeMar DeRozan had a team-high 34 points for the Raptors, while Kyle Lowry added 24 as Toronto lost back-to-back games for the first time this year. Toronto lost 121-117 in Cleveland against the NBA-champion Cavaliers Tuesday night. DeRozan, who was 17 for 17 from the free-throw line, is the first NBA player with nine 30-point games in his team's first 11 games since former Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan in 1987-88. It was scant consolation for the NBA's leading scorer, who is averaging 33.3 points per game. ""We played both of the best teams in the NBA,"" he said. ""We were right there with them and had a couple stretches where we could put it away. We gave it away."" TIP INS: Warriors: Kerr is one win away from the 150th coaching victory of his career. With 33 assists and a 50.6 success rate from the field, the Warriors set a franchise record with a fifth straight game with at least 30 assists and shooting over 50 percent. ... With 10 field goals made, Curry moved past Joe Barry Carroll (4,010) for eight place on Golden State's career list. Raptors: Along with Brooklyn, Toronto is the only team to face Cleveland and Golden State in back-to-back games. ... The Raptors out-rebounded Golden State 46-35. The Raptors dropped to 5-2 this season when DeRozan and Lowry combine to score 50 or more points. ENJOYING THE VIEWS: Drake wore a shirt bearing the likeness of ESPN's Doris Burke as well as the words ""Woman Crush Everyday,"" Drake explained that he's a big fan of Burke. He then sat courtside as the Raptors wore their Drake-inspired black-and-gold uniforms. IT'S GOTTA BE THE SHOES: ""The shirt was really nice but his boots were so bad and I was a little disappointed in his outfit overall. It's Drake Night; you've got to bring better boots that that."" -- Green on the all-black clothing and footwear Drake chose to wear on his special night.","400899615"
"DENVER --  Kenneth Faried was animated about losing his spot in the Denver Nuggets' starting lineup earlier in the season. He looks to have a hold on it now. Faried had a season-high 20 points and 15 rebounds, Wilson Chandler also had a season-high with 28 points and 11 rebounds, and the Nuggets won for the first time at home this season, 120-104 over the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night. ""That's my spot,"" Faried said of his third straight start. ""I don't like people taking my spot. I didn't take kindly to that -- Coach knew that, my teammates knew that. I was outspoken about it, I was really upset. ""When I came out of my starting spot it kind of gave me a wake-up call that `Hey, you need to get back to who you are."" The Nuggets got back to their winning ways at home, too. Danilo Gallinari had 18 points for Denver, which snapped a four-game losing streak. Jameer Nelson added 17 points and Emmanuel Mudiay had 15. The banged-up Nuggets played their second straight game without starting shooting guard Gary Harris. He's expected to be out until mid-December with a foot injury. ""We need every win we can get right now,"" Chandler said. ""Close games, blowouts, no matter how we can get them we need to win."" Brandon Knight scored a season-high 32 points for Phoenix, and Devin Booker had 24 before he was ejected with 17.8 left after receiving his second technical foul. The Suns have lost five of six. Tyson Chandler returned to the Suns' starting lineup after missing the last four games because of his mother's death. He had five points and five rebounds in 21 minutes. ""We are 3-9,"" Knight said. ""Our goal was to be a playoff team, so we have a lot (of major) issues."" The Suns never led, but cut a 20-point deficit to seven in the fourth quarter before Denver pulled away. Malone singled out Faried as a key reason the Nuggets held on and ended their recent slump. ""He has been amazing with his energy and game-changing type of plays,"" Malone said. The Nuggets built an early double-digit lead with a pair of 8-0 runs. They led 12-4 thanks in part to a Mudiay's jumper and layup, then pushed it to 25-10 on the back of five straight points from Chandler and a 3-pointer from Nelson. Gallinari hit a 20-foot jumper to push it to 63-43 early in the third. Knight rallied Phoenix with 10 points in the fourth, and Jared Dudley's 3 cut the lead to 100-93 with 6:18 left. TIP-INS Suns: Booker cut it to 89-76 at the end of the third when grabbed an offensive rebound and hit an off-balance 17-foot jumper at the buzzer. .. Phoenix was outrebounded 49-35. Nuggets: G Will Barton (ankle) missed his eighth straight game. ... The Nuggets waived little-used F/C Jarnell Stokes and signed F Alonzo Gee, who was waived by the New Orleans Pelicans earlier this season. The seven-year veteran had one assist in four minutes. ""In the past I've always admired him from afar,"" Malone said before the game. ""I like his approach."" BOOKER EJECTED After he was fouled by Faried late in the game, Booker received his second technical. He lined up for a free throw anyways, before the official pointed him off the court. ""I didn't know I was ejected,"" he said. ""It was my first ejection, it's something new."" NO TURNOVERS The Nuggets have struggled to take care of the ball through their first 10 games, so Mudiay's zero turnovers on Wednesday was reason enough for praise. ""Thank the lord,"" he said. ""It's about time I had no turnovers.""","400899616"
"LOS ANGELES --  In his ninth NBA season, Marc Gasol is becoming a 3-point shooter. The 7-foot center hit a go-ahead 3 from the left corner with 14 seconds left , and the Memphis Grizzlies hung on to beat the Clippers 111-107 on Wednesday night, snapping Los Angeles' seven-game winning streak. Mike Conley scored 30 points , Gasol added a season-high 26 and Memphis equaled a season high with 15 3-pointers, including a career high-tying seven by Conley. ""They are the best team in the league right now, so for us to get a signature win like this is huge,"" Conley said. Gasol made four 3-pointers, the same number he hit in helping Memphis rally for a win over Washington last month. He's made 16 3s this season after hitting just 12 in his first eight seasons. ""We stay in the moment and it's been good so far,"" Gasol said. ""We made the right plays and we are lucky the ball went in."" J.J. Redick scored a season-high 29 points, Blake Griffin added 25, and DeAndre Jordan had 14 rebounds for the Clippers, who still have the NBA's best record at 10-2. Both of their losses have come at home. ""I don't like that,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said about the home defeats. ""We had enough points, we didn't have enough defense."" Los Angeles came in outscoring opponents by an average of 16.6 points, fourth-highest in NBA history, but the Grizzlies built a 16-point lead in the first half and were ahead by seven going into the fourth. In the end, it was the Grizzlies' defense that preserved the victory. With 23 seconds left, Griffin inbounded to Jamal Crawford, who got blocked by Gasol. After Gasol's 3-pointer put Memphis ahead 109-107, Redick had the ball stolen by Conley, who got fouled and made both free throws to close out the win. Jordan blamed himself for not being in the right spot when Gasol shot from the left wing. ""I made a bad read, saw Mike turn the corner and thought I needed to help,"" Jordan said. ""I should have stayed on the corner."" Redick's seventh 3-pointer gave the Clippers a 101-100 lead in the fourth, their first since early in the second quarter. But Conley answered with his seventh 3 and Zach Randolph hit a turnaround bank hook, putting the Grizzlies back in front 105-101 and forcing the Clippers to call a timeout. Los Angeles regrouped and scored six unanswered points for a 107-105 lead. Crawford put back his own miss, Jordan tipped in Paul's miss and Paul hit a pullup jumper while the Grizzlies missed on consecutive possessions. Randolph added 18 points off the bench and Vince Carter had 12. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Conley scored 30 against the Clippers in a 99-88 home loss on Nov. 4. ... G-F Tony Allen missed his fourth straight game with a right groin injury. Clippers: F Wesley Johnson sat out his third game in a row with a left heel contusion. HE SAID IT ""He's too far gone for me to teach him how to dance, but now every time he makes one he has to dance."" -- Conley on Gasol's shimmy moves after hitting the game-winner. HUSTLE PLAY In the third, Paul had the game's best hustle play even though the Clippers failed to score. He got blocked by Harrison on a running layup and Conley grabbed the rebound. But Paul stole it back and fed Redick, who missed a 3-pointer. Green rebounded, but Conley lost the ball to Paul again and Griffin missed a layup. AGELESS CARTER At 39, Vince Carter is the league's oldest active player. He scored 20 points on Nov. 8 against Denver, becoming the oldest in league history to score 20 or more off the bench. He also had 20 against Utah on Nov. 14. He had 12 points in 26 minutes Wednesday. ""He was a superstar in this league and now he still wants to play,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""He's a teacher and a leader. He's still playing because he's smart."" Memphis coach David Fizdale called Carter ""one of the great guys"" in the NBA. ""You should see his house in Orlando; it's like a workout factory,"" he said. ""He takes it serious.  He takes pride in his physique and his diet, so I'm not surprised how well he is playing.""","400899617"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  After struggling in the first few weeks of the season to find their patented offensive rhythm, the San Antonio Spurs are once again making it miserable for opposing teams. Pau Gasol had 24 points and nine rebounds to lead a balanced offense for the Spurs in a 110-105 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 21 points and Kawhi Leonard added 20 for the Spurs, who won their fourth straight and improved to 6-0 on the road this season. Tony Parker had 14 points and seven rebounds. ""We didn't have that level of awareness and we weren't moving the ball as much as we should have been early in the season,"" Gasol said. ""We're at our best when we're moving the ball, creating an energy and flow that carries over to the defensive end. That's been the staple of this team for so long."" Sharing the basketball and frequently finding the open man for a good look, the Spurs had a season-high 29 assists and shot 49 percent. San Antonio has recorded 20 or more assists during its winning streak. Perhaps it's no coincidence the winning streak has taken place after Parker returned from a sore right knee that caused the veteran point guard to miss three straight games. He was directing the offense against the Kings and frequently finding an open teammate. ""The key for us is moving the ball and making sure everyone is involved offensively,"" Parker said. ""The last four games we're really been finding our rhythm. We have a lot of weapons."" An offseason free-agent signing, Gasol is definitely one of those options. The crafty veteran center scored nine points in the opening quarter and had 16 by halftime, helping the Spurs take a 57-46 lead at the break. ""It's not something I try to do, I just take the shots when they come to me,"" said Gasol, who shot 10 for 17. ""Teammates found me early tonight and I was able to be effective."" DeMarcus Cousins had 26 points, 17 rebounds and six assists for the Kings, who dropped their third straight game. Matt Barnes had 15 points and Ben McLemore, Willie Cauley-Stein and Rudy Gay each added 11. ""We're making it hard on ourselves right now,"" Cousins said. ""We gotta come out with better energy and a better effort. It's on us if we want to turn this around. It's nobody's fault but ours."" Guarded much of the game by Leonard, Gay shot just 3 for 11 after entering the game averaging 22.3 points. The Spurs took the lead for good in the second quarter and led by as many as 18 points before going to the reserves late in the fourth quarter. The Kings eventually cut the lead to four points on Cousins' two free throws with 8.7 seconds remaining. However, Davis Bertans made a free throw and the Kings missed two shots to end the game. TIP INS Spurs: Danny Green was back in the starting lineup despite a groin injury Monday against Miami. He made three 3-pointers and had nine points... Reserve center Dewayne Dedmon sprained his left knee and will also miss Friday's game. Kings: Cousins picked up two fouls in the game's first four minutes. ... Lawson came in shooting 4 for 25 the previous five games. He was 1 for 2 for three points against the Spurs. ... The Kings had 17 turnovers that resulted in 16 Spurs points. POPOVICH STILL ANGERED BY ELECTION Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has been an outspoken critic of President-elect Donald Trump. He has spoken openly about his feelings on the election and held nothing back again in a pregame interview. ""Somebody asked me and I told the truth of what I felt. I still feel the same way,"" Popovich said. ""It's still a disorienting situation when you thought you lived in a certain kind of country with certain values and find out those values aren't important to half the country. ""I thought with all the divisiveness in the election, all the groups that President-elect Trump disparaged the best way to start was not to worry about Obamacare or talk about Wall Street or anything else. But that didn't happen. That was my hope.""","400899618"
"WASHINGTON --  For the first time since his knee surgery in May, John Wall played in back-to-back games, and the result was a rare win for the Washington Wizards. Wall scored 23 points and had 11 assists and Otto Porter added 21 points as the Wizards won for just the third time in 11 games, beating the New York Knicks 119-112 on Thursday night. Wall sat out games in the first two Washington back-to-backs this season, and the Wizards lost both times. After Wednesday night's disheartening loss to the 76ers where Wall played 24 minutes, Washington coach Scott Brooks felt his star guard was ready to go again. ""There was going to be a time during the season where he was going to have to play back-to-back,"" Brooks said. ""The way he was progressing during the last four or five weeks, we felt that it was a good time."" Brooks didn't want to play Wall more than 32 minutes, and when the Wizards opened up a 27-point lead late in the third quarter, it looked as if Wall could play much less than that. But New York scored 47 points in the fourth quarter, and Brooks put Wall back in the game in the final minutes. Once the Knicks went on a 12-0 run to cut the lead to 108-98 with 2:37 to play, Wall secured the win with two late baskets and four free throws. New York was led by Derrick Rose with 27. Carmelo Anthony scored 19, and Kristaps Porzingis, who had a career-high 35 against Detroit on Wednesday night, was held to 16. Brandon Jennings had 15 of his season-high 17 points in the fourth quarter. WHAT WALL BRINGS Brooks liked much about Wall's game. ""He had a major impact in the first half, and I think he only had two points,"" Brooks said. ""There are a few players in the league that can impact a game with passing and defense, and he's one of them."" Wall had been eager to test himself, and was confident he passed the test. ""I don't like to miss games. I felt like I could have played earlier, but it was just part of what the doctor's plan was,"" Wall said. LACK OF EFFORT Despite the late fourth quarter charge, Rose didn't necessarily like what he saw from his teammates. ""Tonight was effort,"" Rose said. ""When we see someone down or we see someone where things are not clicking, that's when we've got to come together as a team. So it's still early in the year. We've still got a lot more games to play. It just takes time."" DEFENSE LACKING New York allowed a season high in points and Washington shot 54.3 percent. ""Some of that is guys are wide open. There's a few of them that were contested, but we looked like we were a little tired from last night and we weren't getting all the way up on the guys.

"MIAMI --  Hassan Whiteside likes when teams challenge him inside. The reigning NBA blocks leader piled up seven to go with 12 points and 17 rebounds and the Miami Heat beat the Milwaukee Bucks 96-73 on Thursday night to end a six-game losing streak. ""There's two different types of coaches and teams,"" Whiteside said. ""There's coaches that say, `Hassan Whiteside is down there, don't attack him.' And then there are coaches that say, `Hassan Whiteside is down there, let's attack him,' God bless those teams. Long live those teams. I need more of those teams."" Dion Waiters led Miami with 23 points, and Josh Richardson added 18. The losing streak was the Heat's longest since 2008. ""It's just another game, we can't get too happy about one win,"" Richardson said. ""We're glad we won, but we've got to move on to the next game."" Point guard Goran Dragic returned for the Heat after missing three games with a sprained left ankle. He had 16 points in 35 minutes. ""Rusty a little bit,"" Dragic said. ""I didn't feel quite fast enough. The first half I struggled a little bit and then I finally got my legs under me a little bit and in the second half I felt great."" Giannis Antetokounmpo and Tony Snell each had 14 points for Milwaukee. The Bucks shot 32.9 percent (28 of 85) from the field and have lost four of five. ""As a team we struggled on the defensive end,"" Bucks head coach Jason Kidd said. ""We couldn't guard the ball. We couldn't grab rebounds when we had to. We gave them second opportunities. On the offensive end, we just lost our patience."" Richardson hit a corner 3, Whiteside blocked a layup attempt by Antetokounmpo, and Dragic hit a 3 in a flurry of big plays to give Miami an 80-69 lead with 7 minutes left. ""That was a big sequence for us,"" Richardson said. ""Hassan, when he gets blocks like that it energizes everybody and we're running I think we're a dangerous team."" The Heat held on the rest of the way, with a 3 by Waiters making it 88-73 with 3:31 left. Miami outscored Milwaukee 29-11 in the fourth quarter. The Bucks entered the game leading the NBA in points in the paint, averaging 49.8 a game after leading the league a year ago, but were held to 34 and just 10 in the second half. ""They cover so much ground in particular G.A. and (Jabari) Parker,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""They really have a way of cutting and attacking, and catching and going into the paint. You have to have guys who are willing to compete, be physical, and do it with technique and discipline. And then when you get beat it helps to have a great eraser back there (with Whiteside)."" Milwaukee jumped out to a 20-6 lead, which included three impressive dunks by Parker, including taking one around-the-back on a dribble to avoid Richardson, and holding the Heat to 3-for-18 shooting. Miami quickly bounced back as Tyler Johnson's 3 gave the Heat a 30-27 lead and the teams were knotted at 48 at the break. Josh Richardson hit a pair of 3-pointers for the Heat during a 13-4 run in the third quarter to give Miami a 65-54 lead. Miami led 67-62 to start the fourth quarter. ""Our best basketball was in the second half,"" Spoelstra said. BUCKS STARS STRUGGLE Antetokounmpo and Parker, who entered the game averaging over 41 points, combined to score 25 on 10-of-35 shooting (28.6 percent). ""(Whiteside) did a good job of contesting shots, but I go to the basket, and I didn't get nothing the whole game,"" Parker said. ""I didn't get no calls."" McGRUDER, COACHES RECEIVE RINGS Miami's Rodney McGruder and assistant coaches Dan Craig and Octavio de la Grana received their NBA D-League championship rings for winning the title last season with the Sioux Falls Skyforce, Miami's affiliate.

"HOUSTON --  In the postgame locker room after the Houston Rockets' 126-109 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday night, James Harden teased teammates, laughed about excess shower water caught in his beard and joked with reporters. It was a stark contrast from the more solemn and stern version of Harden from last season. ""I've been having fun all year, even in games we lose,"" Harden said. ""This is a special group of guys, coaching staff included, and this locker room is definitely enjoying this ride right now."" Harden had 26 points, 14 assists and 12 rebounds for his third triple-double of the season to help the Rockets overwhelm the Trail Blazers in their highest-scoring game of the season. Harden completed the triple-double in the third quarter. The Rockets rebounded a night after scoring just three points in the final 6 minutes of a 105-103 loss in Oklahoma City. ""It's the chemistry,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Everybody is feeling good about themselves. We're going to make mistakes, and we still have some improving to do, but as long as they come with that attitude every day and work at it and fix their mistakes, good things will happen."" C.J. McCollum led Portland with 26 points, Maurice Harkless had 19, and Damian Lillard 18, his second-lowest output of the season. ""We kind of suck right now -- it's that simple,"" Lillard said. ""We're usually a pretty good offensive team. We've been bad on offense and bad on defense. We're trying hard, but we're not making the smartest plays -- just not good enough. We're not very good right now."" Blazers coach Terry Stotts was much less harsh in his assessment of his team's second straight loss. Portland outscored Houston by a combined 12 points in the second and fourth quarters but was ultimately doomed by a 29-point deficit in the first and third quarters. The game was tied at 62 at halftime, but Houston took a 100-83 lead into the fourth quarter. ""They're very good at what they do and Harden is key to that,"" Stotts said. ""Houston is a very good offensive team -- it's a challenge to guard them."" Rockets point guard Patrick Beverley made his season debut after missing the first 11 games following arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. Limited to 25 minutes, Beverley had 11 points, three assists and three blocks. ""Our defense is getting a lot better with him out there because of his toughness,"" D'Antoni said about Beverley. ""He is smart and plays with an edge. You've got to have that."" Playing without backup center Nene, Houston frequently featured smaller lineups with Montrezl Harrell filling in with interior defense while starting center Clint Capela was on the bench. Capela had 15 points, seven rebounds and two blocks, while Harrell added nine points and eight rebounds off the bench. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: McCollum made his first six field-goal attempts and had 19 points at the half. ... Portland was outrebounded 54-41 and outscored 56-48 in the paint. ... Mason Plumlee had eight rebounds and seven assists. ... Al-Farouq Aminu (calf) missed his fifth straight game. Rockets: Despite posting a season-high 41 points in the first quarter, Houston was scoreless for the first 2 minutes. ... In the second game of a back-to-back veteran center Nene was given the night off for rest. ... Houston made 14 of 32 3-pointers (43.8 percent). BEVERLEY'S NEW LOOK In his season debut, Beverley sported a shorter haircut and a slightly leaner frame than he did at the end of last season. ""Losing a lot of weight really helped me change my body,"" Beverley said. ""I felt strong, I felt fast and my wind is going to come. I felt really good and felt confident, too."" WHOSE HOUSE? COOG'S HOUSE The Toyota Center crowd erupted for the loudest ovation of the game early in the fourth quarter when highlights from the University of Houston's Thursday night game against No. 8 Louisville were shown on the videoboard alongside an up-to-date score showing the Cougars up 31-0. The games were played simultaneously three miles apart.","400899621"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  The Philadelphia 76ers and Minnesota Timberwolves had a combined record of 5-16 heading into their game on Thursday night, which may not seem an ideal matchup to be featured on TNT. But the network folks understand that these two long-suffering franchises boast some of the most intriguing young talent in the league. And the Timberwolves showed just how much further along they are in the rebuilding process. Andrew Wiggins had 35 points, 10 rebounds and four assists to lead the Timberwolves to a 110-86 victory over the 76ers. Karl-Anthony Towns had 25 points and 10 rebounds and Gorgui Dieng added 12 points and 10 boards for the Wolves (4-7). The Wolves shot 50.6 percent and avoided the poor third quarter that had plagued them this season. ""I think that they're a lot further ahead for all the obvious reasons, and it's not a lack of respect or disservice to our guys at all,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""This group that you're looking at played with each other all last year, many, many, many, many games together."" Joel Embiid had 10 points and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes after sitting out the front end of Philadelphia's back-to-back on Wednesday night. Dario Saric led the way with 16 points, but the 76ers lost their 21st straight road game. ""They're young and they're still going to get better, and that's where we've got to get to,"" Embiid said. ""When you learn how to play with each other, it's easier to play."" Wiggins made 14 of 20 shots, including 3 of 6 3-pointers. The Wolves had been outscored by a league-worst 91 points in 10 third quarters this season, but they led by 28 at halftime on Thursday night, rendering a minus-1 in this game moot. ""At times last year I would drift to the corner and stay there,"" Wiggins said. ""I'm just being more active. My awareness is higher. I'm doing more."" In a matchup of two of the best young big men in the league, Towns blew past Embiid to throw down a ferocious dunk in the fourth quarter to get the crowd on its feet. He made 12 of 18 shots. TIP-INS 76ers: The last time the Sixers won a road game was Jan. 20 at Orlando. ... Nik Stauskas had 13 points and five rebounds. ... Philly scored just 33 points on 31 percent shooting, tied for its lowest scoring output of the season. Timberwolves: Wiggins entered the game leading the NBA in 3-point shooting at 55 percent. ... F Shabazz Muhammad (sore right knee) and G/F Brandon Rush (right big toe) were both out again. NERVOUS FANS Embiid missed the first two seasons after being drafted because of foot problems, and even in visiting arenas there is an audible gasp every time the 7-foot center falls to the court. He got tangled with Ricky Rubio early in the first quarter and appeared to be clutching his left ankle as he went to the bench. He was able to return in the second quarter, much to the relief of NBA fans everywhere. ""He waited so long to actually play and now he's dominating,"" said Wiggins, who was college teammates with Embiid at Kansas. ""He's playing short minutes, but he's still getting numbers and playing really good."" Embiid hit the deck again in the fourth when Wolves forward Adreian Payne threw him down while wrestling for a rebound. Payne was given a technical foul. GOOD CROWD The Wolves announced attendance of 16,866, easily the largest of the year. It came one game after the arena was half-empty for a game against Charlotte. The low attendance early has been a troubling sign for an organization that was hoping to turn the corner this season. The Wolves targeted this game and select others to cluster their group tickets in hopes of padding attendance. They also offered season ticket holders two free additional tickets to the game to try to get more fans, which have been slow to spend their money this season thanks to Minnesota's 3-7 start, out to the game.","400899622"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Offense was hard to come by from both the Bulls and Jazz on Thursday night, but when Chicago needed baskets down the stretch, they turned to All-Star Jimmy Butler and future Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade. Butler scored 20 points and grabbed 12 rebounds as the Bulls defeated the Jazz 85-77. ""We found a way. We hung on,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""On offense, you're going to have games like this over an 82-game schedule. It's going to come and go. Your constants have to be defense and rebounding. We did that all game long to give us a chance to win."" The Bulls have won four straight, including three on the road. Chicago used 9-0 runs to start the third and fourth quarters that Utah never recovered from. Nikola Mirotic had a dunk, a steal and an assist during the fourth-quarter run that put the Bulls up 75-58. The Jazz cut the lead to 80-75 late, but Wade and Butler hit jumpers to put the game away. Wade scored 18 points for the Bulls and Robin Lopez posted his second double-double of the season with 10 points and 12 rebounds. ""The way we're playing right now, man, it's fun,"" Butler said. The Jazz have lost two straight at home after going 4-1 during the preceding road trip. Rudy Gobert finished with 16 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks for the Jazz as Gordon Hayward added eight points and 12 rebounds. The Jazz led 43-41 at halftime despite the Bulls shooting just 28.8 percent from the field. What the Bulls lacked in accuracy, they made up in volume -- taking 52 shots to Utah's 38 in the first half as the Jazz turned the ball over nine times. ""I don't know if it's a one-game thing,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said of the offense. ""We weren't very good, that's clear. We've had bad games before offensively. We had some open shots, we didn't make them. ... Sometimes when you're missing shots you let it impact everything. You just get stagnant. ""I don't see any reason, because we played this way tonight, that sirens are going off for our offense. ... I'm not despondent. ... We didn't play well tonight and lost to a really good team."" TIP-INS Bulls: Doug McDermott missed his second consecutive game due to a concussion. ... Rajon Rondo missed his second consecutive game with a left ankle sprain. ... Butler scored at least 20 points and had five assists in his previous five games. He only had three assists Thursday. Jazz: Rodney Hood returned to the starting lineup after missing last game with an illness and scored 12 points. ... Boris Diaw started in place of injured Derrick Favors. ... George Hill missed his sixth consecutive game with a sprained right thumb. FAVORS OUT Favors had an MRI on Wednesday and is out for an undetermined amount of time with a left knee bone contusion. The knee has been bothering him since the preseason and he's been in and out of the lineup, missing all but one preseason game. Snyder doesn't think he returned too quickly. ""It's been a challenge for him,"" Snyder said. ""The main point is, you reach a point where you're not effective.  That is where he has been, or you're less effective to the point where you need to address the situation in a different way."" QUOTABLE ""We just didn't push the pace enough,"" Hood said. ""I think we defended well. They're a good team, they're playing well right now. But we just didn't play with enough energy offensively.""","400899623"
"Kemba Walker cuts through the Hawks' defense and finishes with the acrobatic layup to put the Hornets up three in the fourth quarter. (0:17) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Dwight Howard lost his cool, and the Atlanta Hawks lost a potentially key Eastern Conference game. Howard was ejected with 5:38 left and his team leading by three when he threw an elbow at the head of Charlotte center Cody Zeller and received a Flagrant-2 foul. The Hornets scored the next nine points -- seven by Kemba Walker -- and snapped Atlanta's six-game winning streak with a 100-96 victory Friday night. Nic Batum had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Zeller matched his career high with 23 points on 9-of-10 shooting for the Hornets (8-3), who earned their biggest win of the season. Walker overcame a slow start to score 19 of his 21 points in the second half for his 10th straight 20-point game. Howard said afterward the contact wasn't intentional and he didn't think it cost his team the game. ""It wasn't like I tried to hit him in the face, but my job is to protect my house -- at all costs,"" said Howard, who finished with 10 points and 18 rebounds. ""I am making no apologies for it."" Paul Millsap, who led the Hawks with 22 points and 13 rebounds, said the ejection fueled the home crowd. ""Plays like that are momentum shifts,"" Millsap said. ""It kind of sparked them. They took that and added fuel to the fire."" The ejection revved up the crowd -- and apparently Walker, too. The 6-foot point guard drove baseline and made a reverse layup to give the Hornets the lead for good. Walker added another layup off a hesitation dribble and then connected on a 3-pointer from the top of the arc to push the lead to six. Zeller said after the game he didn't think Howard's elbow to the face was a dirty play. ""I have taken a lot of hard hits with two older brothers,"" Zeller said. ""I knew it was going to be a physical game. But it was a huge play in the game because they couldn't go to him late in the game and we went on a run."" TIP-INS Hawks: Howard had 11 rebounds at halftime, while the rest of the starting lineup had two combined. ... The Hawks shot just 3 of 17 from the field in the fourth quarter. Hornets: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist did a nice job guarding Kyle Korver, limiting him to two points through the first three quarters. ... Jeremy Lamb was close to returning to the lineup but is still bothered by a hamstring injury. STRONG SECOND HALF Walker, who came in averaging 25.8 points per game -- the third-best mark in the Eastern Conference -- missed all seven of his shots from the field in the first half but was 8 of 13 the rest of the way. ""There wasn't anything different,"" Walker said. ""I was aggressive all night, I just stayed aggressive. At one point shots just weren't falling for me like they have been lately. I stuck with it, my teammates just kept telling me `stay with it, it's going to fall.' I just tried to play the game and pick my spots and I was able to come up with some big plays."" HORNETS COMEBACKS In six of Charlotte's eight wins the team has come back from 10 points down. Now, the Hornets have a busy stretch coming up with 18 games in 32 days. ""If we're a good team, the kind of team we need to be, then we have to get on this plane with the right attitude and find a way to play a good game tomorrow night on the road and win,"" coach Steve Clifford said. ""That's what the good teams do."" SUPPORTING DWIGHT Korver threw his support behind Howard after the game. ""He's just kind of a safety net for us,"" Korver said. ""He's back there with all that size, I think he had 18 rebounds tonight, and he's back there to protect the paint. That's his job. That's what he's great at.""","400899624"
"LeBron James says he didn't like the effort the Cavaliers put forth to start the game, but the team turned it around to play what LeBron describes as the Cavs' best performance of the season. (0:41) CLEVELAND --  Kyrie Irving had a big game. LeBron James returned to the court. And the Cleveland Cavaliers put it all together Friday night. Irving scored 25 points and James, returning to the lineup after sitting out a game, added 21 to help the Cavaliers rolled past the Detroit Pistons 104-81. ""Offensively and defensively it was the best we've played all year, as far as close to 48 minutes,"" said James, who rested Wednesday night in a loss at Indiana. James, made 9 of 14 shots and played only 28 minutes. Irving was 11 of 15 from the field with 11 assists --  one short of his career high -- in 29 minutes. Following a slow start that saw Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue call a timeout less than 2 minutes into the game after the Pistons hit a pair of wide-open 3-pointers. Lue only smiled when asked for specifics about what he told the players, but he was clearly unhappy. ""He didn't like our effort to start the game,"" James said. ""We got the message and we were able to change it around."" ""He didn't need to tell us much,"" Irving said. ""We all understood."" Cleveland led by 11 at the end of the first quarter, took a 56-39 lead into halftime and continued to dominate. The Cavaliers built the lead to 33 points in the fourth quarter, allowing Lue to rest his starters for the entire final period. The defending NBA champions don't play again until Wednesday night. J.R. Smith, who returned after missing three games with a sprained right ankle, hit three 3-pointers and moved past the Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki into 15th place on the NBA's career list for 3s. Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy, who was unhappy with his team's defense and rebounding in Wednesday's loss to New York, benched his starters for the fourth quarter. ""There is no takeaway from tonight, we got crushed,"" Van Gundy said. ""We were just awful."" Cleveland was 11 of 25 on 3-pointers and has reached double figures in all 12 games, an NBA record to start the season. Kevin Love scored 12 points and had 14 rebounds, and Tristan Thompson also had 14 rebounds. Lue's early timeout paid off when Smith hit three 3-pointers, and James and Tristan Thompson scored on dunks. Jon Leuer led Detroit with 15 points. The Pistons' starting five of Tobias Harris, Marcus Morris, Andre Drummond, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Ish Smith combined for only 37 points. ""Their guys all played really, really hard,"" Van Gundy said. ""We need to find people that play that hard."" TIP-INS Pistons: Harris was hit with a technical foul in the second quarter. ... Van Gundy plans on sticking with a nine-man rotation until his team is at full strength. G Reggie Jackson is still rehabbing from surgery on his left knee and hasn't played this season.

G Mike Dunleavy, who didn't play against Indiana, entered the game in the second quarter. He scored five points. TAKE A BREAK The Cavaliers won't practice the next two days, which will provide a much-welcome rest. ""I can't remember when I had it like this in a season,"" James said. ""We're going to take full advantage of it."" ""It's very important for our team,"" Lue said. ""Guys should feel refreshed and healthy.""","400899625"

""Every day is like a blank canvas for us,"" coach Earl Watson said. ""The good thing is, we're the artists of that blank canvas. The mindset in getting our guys to learn to bring it every night is the process, the journey for us."" Myles Turner led the Pacers with 22 points, and Jeff Teague had 21 points and seven assists. ""We went through the motions. We were on our heels,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""It was bad out there. The game should fire you up. When they toss the ball up, you should be ready to go and (on Friday) we weren't."" The Pacers rallied to take their first lead with 7:46 left in the third quarter on Turner's basket. But the Suns pulled ahead again, with Knight scoring all 12 points of his points in the period in a 2 1/2-minute stretch. Phoenix outscored Indiana 27-14 in the fourth. ""Basketball is a game of runs and we were able to get stops eventually,"" Knight said. ""They started making a lot of shots and when we got consecutive stops, it led to us getting baskets."" Pacers All-Star Paul George did not play for the second time in four games. He's battling soreness in his left ankle after turning his ankle in Indiana's overtime loss at Philadelphia on Nov. 11. He's scheduled for an MRI on Saturday to assess the severity of the injury. TIP-INS: Phoenix: The game was the fourth back-to-back Phoenix has played through 13 games ...

"NEW ORLEANS -- It's Holiday season in New Orleans all right. One of the Pelicans' primary players is back and already helping them win. Jrue Holiday scored 21 points in his first action this season, Anthony Davis had his latest stellar outing with 38 points, nine rebounds and four blocks, and the Pelicans beat the Portland Trail Blazers 113-101 on Friday night. ""I head a great first game,"" Holiday said. ""The thrill was there. It felt good, being a part of a team."" Holiday made his season debut after missing the first 12 games to care for his wife, retired soccer star Lauren Holiday, who had brain surgery last month only weeks after giving birth to the couple's first child, a daughter. He wound up playing just more than 23 minutes hitting an array of jumpers, including a 3, as well as driving floaters and layups. He finished with seven assists, none more crowd-pleasing than his crisp bounce-pass to a cutting Davis, who finished the play with a thunderous two-handed dunk. Holiday had been in constant contact with coaches and studying game video while on leave, so he wasn't surprised that he quickly got into the rhythm of the offense. ""There are some new faces around here, but at the same time it's the same system,"" Holiday said. ""The part that I was really worried about was conditioning. I really thought that I was behind. Maybe I was just excited for this game. I felt like I could play forever."" Terrence Jones added 15 points, and Tim Frazier had 12 for the Pelicans. New Orleans built the lead up to 20 in the fourth quarter and cruised to the finished. They've won three of five after an 0-8 start. Damian Lillard scored 27 points, and CJ McCollum 24 for Portland, which has lost three straight to fall to 7-7. Mason Plumlee added 13 points and 12 rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who never got closer than eight points in the second half. ""We obviously are not playing the best basketball right now, but we are still .500,"" said Portland forward Ed Davis, who had 11 rebounds in a starting role that required him to attempt to defend his Pelicans namesake. ""It's not like we are on an eight-game losing streak. ""We are not in panic mode,"" he added. ""We'll be all right, man.""

Center Alexis Ajinca sat out with a sore left shoulder. HOLIDAY CHEER The crowd bellowed, ""Jruuuuue!"" as Holiday checked in, and he wasted no time getting involved, assisting on Jones' layup the first time he handled the ball on the offensive end. Within four minutes on the court, Holiday scored five points to go with a rebound and assists, and even a block on Noah Vonleh's dunk attempt. Anthony Davis called Holiday ""instant offense."" ""He comes in, makes great reads, makes plays for himself or others -- and also does it on the defensive end,"" Davis said. ""In my eyes, he's one of the top point guards in the league and it showed."" DOMINANT DAVIS Davis was making shots from all over the court, hitting a pair of 3s to go with usual leaners, floaters, layups and mid-range jumpers. The Pelicans made their first significant push in the final three minutes of the first half. Portland was down 51-47 after Plumlee's 16-foot jumper, but Davis responded with a 16-footer of his own that sparked a 13-4 run to close out the half. Davis added six more points during the spurt, hitting a jumper, floater and spinning a reverse layup off the glass with McCollum climbing on his shoulders. Davis also rejected his third Lillard shot of the half, and New Orleans led 64-51 as the horn sounded to end the second quarter. NEW LOOK Holiday wore goggles as a precaution after missing the last nine games of last season because of an inadvertent elbow he took to the head, fracturing his orbital eye wall. He said he hasn't decided yet how long he'll wear them. ""We won so I'm probably going to play in them"" Saturday night, he said. ""I think I look dorky.

It was the 41st triple-double of Westbrook's career. He attacked relentlessly, making 13 of 21 shots while taking just one 3-pointer, even with the Nets packing the paint on defense. ""Too many paint attempts, too many rim attempts,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""A bunch of them came in transition, unfortunately, where you've really got to try to keep him out of there.

Brooklyn scored 40 points in the first quarter but never managed more than 23 in a period the rest of the way. ""They hit some shots early,"" Westbrook said. ""Honestly, they played harder than us to start the game, and we turned the page. We did a good job of making them take tough shots and getting out on the break and finishing."" The Thunder led 64-61 at halftime behind Westbrook's 20 points, eight assists and six rebounds. Oklahoma City began pulling away early in the third quarter.

"BOSTON --  Kevin Durant deflected a Boston pass, tipped it ahead to Stephen Curry and ran to the basket to finish off an alley-oop. The next time down, Curry stole the ball and pulled up for a 3-pointer. What had been a seven-point Golden State halftime lead was now a 22-point blowout. And the fans who booed Durant before the game for spurning their city were turning against their own team. ""That was incredible to start the half off that way,"" forward Draymond Green said after the Warriors went on a 24-3 run to start the third quarter and held on for a 104-88 victory over Boston on Friday night. ""That was amazing."" Klay Thompson scored 28 points, Durant had 23 points and 10 rebounds and the Warriors scored 18 in a row in the third quarter to blow the game open. Curry had just 16 points -- his second-fewest of the season -- while sitting out much of the fourth as Golden State held on for its sixth straight victory. ""They're really good, and we all know that. But you just can't have droughts against them,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""They can make it a landslide quickly. Going six straight possessions without scoring, that just crushes you."" The Celtics signed Al Horford over the summer and courted Durant, too, even bringing along Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to meet with the free agent in the Hamptons. But they were unable to land the former Oklahoma City star, and the Boston fans remembered. Durant was greeted with loud boos before the game and often when he touched the ball. ""It's just the beer talking,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""They come to enjoy the show. There's no hard feelings,"" Durant said. ""I've still got love for Boston, I still love playing here. You have one of the best crowds in the league. That's what they're supposed to do."" Avery Bradley had 17 points and 10 rebounds and Isaiah Thomas scored a season-low 18 for Boston, which challenged the Warriors last season while they were on their way to a record-breaking 73-9 regular season. After losing in double overtime in Boston, the Celtics beat the Warriors on April 1 to hand them their first home loss of the season. But this one was over during a third quarter in which Golden State outscored the home team 31-9. Boston shot 2 for 17 in the period and turned the ball over five times. THE RUN Thomas hit a 3-pointer early in the third quarter to make it a 10-point game, but the Warriors scored the next 18 points. They made it 86-57 at the end of the third and opened a 30-point lead in the fourth. ""I guess we just gave up, coaching staff as well,"" Thomas said. ""We started subbing. It was bad. Especially ... I only played 27 minutes. We gave up."" THE `COMEBACK' Boston chipped it down to 11 points in the final 90 seconds. But Curry, who had re-entered the game midway through the fourth, hit a 3-pointer, Jaylen Brown missed one for Boston, and then Curry added a finger roll to clinch it.

"DALLAS -- Chandler Parsons swished a 3-pointer just a few feet from Dallas owner Mark Cuban and turned in the direction of his former boss. Maybe that was Parsons simply trying to say, `That's what I can do when I'm healthy."" Parsons scored 12 points in his first game against his former team, helping the Memphis Grizzlies to an 80-64 victory Friday night over the injury-plagued Mavericks, who flirted with franchise worsts for scoring and shooting percentage. Cuban waited out Parsons' postgame TV interview before sharing a brief moment with a player who had both his seasons in Dallas shortened by knee surgery, part of the reason he landed in Memphis on a max deal. ""He just said, glad I'm playing and good to see me back out there,"" Parsons said. ""Obviously, he's frustrated with how their season's going, but they'll bounce back."" Parsons is on a minutes restriction, just as he was a year ago with the Mavericks. He was 3 of 5 from 3-point range and added a couple of rebounds in 23 minutes. ""I wish I would have played more, honestly, if it wouldn't have been a little out of hand there,"" Parsons said. ""I feel like every game I'm getting better, I'm getting more legs."" Dallas was without Dirk Nowitzki (strained Achilles tendon) and its top three options at point guard in Deron Williams (left calf strain), J.J. Barea (torn left leg muscle) and Devin Harris (right toe sprain). The Mavericks avoided the franchise low of 62 points from 1997 when Argentine rookie Nicolas Brussino made a 3-pointer with 24 seconds remaining. Dallas (2-9) matched its worst start since going 2-9 during Nowitzki's rookie season in 1998-99. ""If you're looking for me to make some kind of a crazy statement about how bad things are, that's not how I do business,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""I'm going to keep stressing the positives, and we're going to keep working to get them better."" Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 15 points on 5-of-17 shooting. Seth Curry, the starting point guard because of all the injuries, scored 11 while shooting 4 of 14 from the field. Marc Gasol scored 11 for Memphis, as did Tony Allen after missing four games with a right groin injury. FLIRTING WITH DISASTER The Mavericks were shooting 25.4 percent through three quarters -- the franchise low is 27.4 percent from the expansion season of 1980-81 -- after going 8 1/2 minutes without a field goal in the second quarter and adding a 6 1/2-minute drought in the third. Dallas, which matched a franchise low for the second quarter with 10 points, shot 43 percent in a 23-point fourth to finish at 28.8 percent. A FRIENDLY REMINDER The Mavericks led 27-23 in the second quarter before a 17-minute stretch in which they scored just six points. The Grizzlies, who have another former Dallas player in Vince Carter, led 51-33 at that point. They were sluggish early two nights after handing the Los Angeles Clippers just their second loss, and in the finale of a four-game road trip. ""We stopped being friendly,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""If you watched the first quarter, everybody was having conversations with the other team like they were all pals. And we don't have the luxury to be buddies."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Zach Randolph scored 10 points, and JaMychal Green had a game-high 12 rebounds. ... Point guard Mike Conley had a season-low eight points but led the Grizzlies with two blocks. Mavericks: Jonathan Gibson, a training-camp cut who re-signed Friday because of the injuries at point guard, had 11 points and a team-high three assists. ... Barea told a Spanish-language newspaper that he expected to miss four to six weeks with a muscle tear. He said he feared he had a more serious Achilles injury.","400899630"
"DENVER --  DeMar DeRozan is quick to point out that his stunning scoring spree to start the season is no one-man show. DeRozan had 30 points, including four in overtime, and the Toronto Raptors held off the Denver Nuggets for a 113-111 victory Friday night. It was the 10th time in 12 games this season that DeRozan, the NBA's leading scorer, has reached 30 points -- most of any player in the league. ""I've had a lot of help,"" DeRozan said. ""People have looked for me within the offense. Tonight it was JV (center Jonas Valanciunas) setting screens for me. When the defense packed it in on him, he got me the ball for shots."" DeRozan also gave credit to Terrence Ross, who hit a 3-pointer with 37.6 seconds left in the extra period to put Toronto up by two. ""Terrence has heart and he is more than capable of making a big shot,"" DeRozan said. ""You know when you have another threat like that out there who is going to play extremely hard on both ends, it's great."" Denver's Emmanuel Mudiay was short with a desperation heave from halfcourt at the final buzzer. Kyle Lowry added 18 points and 13 assists for the Raptors, who swept the two-game season series. Mudiay and Wilson Chandler each scored 25 points to lead the Nuggets, who have lost five of six. Denver also was plagued by turnovers, including two in overtime. ""It's the story of the game and the story of our short season,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""Emmanuel throws it out of bounds and Jameer (Nelson) steps out of bounds. Unfortunate timing for those turnovers."" After trailing by five going into the fourth quarter, Toronto took an 87-86 lead on a 3-pointer by Ross with 7:57 left. No more than three points separated the teams during the remainder of regulation. DeRozan hit a jumper to put Toronto up 99-98, and Valanciunas added one of two free throws moments later. Nelson answered with a 3 to put Denver back up by a point, but DeRozan hit a jumper with 15 seconds left as the Raptors regained the lead. Chandler was fouled on a drive to the basket and made one of two free throws to tie it. DeRozan's baseline jumper at the end of regulation went in and out, sending the game to overtime tied at 102. Behind a 38-point second quarter, their second-highest output in any period this season, the Nuggets took a 57-52 lead at halftime after trailing by as many as 12. Chandler fueled the outburst, scoring 12 points in the quarter. QUOTABLE ""We fought to get to overtime but we had too many turnovers. As a team, we didn't make the screens, we didn't make the good passes. I think that's the reason we lost the game."" -- Nuggets center Nikola Jokic. TIP-INS Raptors: C Lucas Nogueira did not travel with the team to Denver to remain at home with his wife, who gave birth to their baby girl on Thursday. Nogueira is expected to rejoin the team in Sacramento, where the Raptors play the Kings on Sunday. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  Gregg Popovich emerged from his first look at the revamped Los Angeles Lakers with enormous respect for the work of fellow coach Luke Walton. Popovich's veteran San Antonio Spurs also showed Walton's Lakers just how far they've still got to go. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 23 points and Kawhi Leonard added 23 points and 12 rebounds in the Spurs' fifth straight victory Friday night, 116-107 over the Lakers. Tony Parker had 16 points and seven assists for the Spurs, who improved to 7-0 on the road this season. They've won six straight over the Lakers, but this back-and-forth victory bore little resemblance to San Antonio's regular demolitions of the Lakers over the previous few seasons. ""Luke has done a great job of making them believe and playing aggressively, and you can really see it,"" said Popovich, who earned his 1,099th win to pass Larry Brown for seventh place on the NBA's career list. ""They came back and stuck it to us. ... We got after it and executed better, but I am just so impressed with what (Walton) has done with this group."" Pau Gasol scored 16 points in his first trip to Staples Center with the Spurs, who went 18 for 19 at the free throw line to hang on after the Lakers rallied late. Parker hit a clinching 17-foot jumper with 33.6 seconds left. ""They're talented,"" Parker said of the Lakers. ""They play hard for Luke. They play with great energy, and they have a lot of pieces. Now it's all about chemistry and how they're going to gel."" Lou Williams scored 24 points and Nick Young added 20 for the Lakers, who played without injured leading scorer D'Angelo Russell for the first time this season. Los Angeles still kept it close until the final minutes, when Aldridge and Leonard took turns hitting big shots before Parker's big bucket. ""We cooled off a little bit (in the third quarter), and they just continued to go, which is what they do,"" Walton said. ""The important thing to take away is how we come back from this, how we respond."" BENCH CHARGE Jordan Clarkson scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half while the Lakers rallied. Williams also came off the bench in another enormous game by the team's reserves, who lead the league in bench points per game. They'll need all that depth: The Lakers began a stretch of 18 games in 30 days with only their third loss in nine games. BIG RALLY The Spurs blew an early 13-point lead, but took control in the third quarter while making 11 consecutive shots. San Antonio stretched its lead to 91-76 while scoring 39 points in the third quarter on 14-for-19 shooting, but the Lakers chipped it down to four points before succumbing. ""Last year, we would have been out of this game if we were down by that much,"" Clarkson said. ""We're out here to compete every night now. We're not OK with any loss."" D-LO OUT Russell has a sore left knee, and the Lakers elected to rest their point guard out of caution. He won't practice Saturday, either. Walton doesn't expect the injury to be a long-term problem, although the Lakers' brutal schedule over the next month won't help. The second-year pro leads the Lakers' balanced lineup with 16.8 points and 4.7 assists per game. Jose Calderon started in Russell's place, scoring five points while playing only 14 minutes. TIP-INS Spurs: Gasol got another warm ovation in Los Angeles, where he won two NBA championships as Kobe Bryant's right-hand man in 2009 and 2010. The 7-foot Spaniard was booed late in his Lakers career, but has been welcomed back enthusiastically since his departure as a free agent to Chicago. ... Former USC big man Dewayne Dedmon has a sprained left knee and didn't make the trip with San Antonio. Lakers: Los Angeles recalled center Ivica Zubac from its D-League affiliate, but the rookie didn't dress for this game. ... Lakers rookie Brandon Ingram had a rough night. The No. 2 pick missed his first seven shots before finishing with four points on 1-of-9 shooting.","400899632"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  A veteran team that sees the big picture, the Los Angeles Clippers were a bit subdued following their latest victory. Blake Griffin had 29 points, seven rebounds and six assists as the Clippers built a large lead and then held off the Sacramento Kings 121-115 on Friday night. The Clippers (11-2) have won eight of nine and own the NBA's best record. They led by 26 points in the opening half and are unbeaten in six road games this season. But no one in the Los Angeles locker room felt good about letting the struggling Kings back in the game. ""A win is a win, but it's kind of frustrating,"" Chris Paul said. ""We expect more from each other."" Trailing by 19 points entering the fourth quarter, the Kings cut the margin to 117-115 on Matt Barnes' free throw with 2:03 remaining. Los Angeles responded with a dunk by DeAndre Jordan before Paul made two free throws to push the lead back to six. Sacramento never scored again. ""They went small and it felt like they scored every time down,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""It felt like we were in the North Carolina four-corner offense. It's great to win, but we want to be better than that."" DeMarcus Cousins helped fuel the comeback with 38 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists for the Kings. Barnes had 10 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter, when Sacramento outscored Los Angeles 30-17. ""Once again, we're just waiting at the last minute to play with energy,"" Cousins said. ""It's all fun and exciting in the end, but these games are going to continue to get harder for us if we wait until the last quarter."" Ty Lawson added 18 points, eight assists and seven rebounds for the Kings, and Darren Collison scored 16. Barnes had 10 fourth-quarter points and made four of Sacramento's 10 3-pointers to finish with 15. J.J. Redick hit six 3s and scored 22 of his 26 points in the first half for the Clippers. Jordan had 16 points and 12 rebounds, Austin Rivers finished with 12 points and Paul added 11 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds. Redick, who connected on his first six 3-point attempts, has made a 3 in 69 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NBA. ""J.J. got it going (in the first quarter) and we did whatever we could to get it back to him,"" Rivers said. It was the fourth straight loss for the Kings. They are 2-4 at home, where they face Toronto, Oklahoma City and Houston the next three games. Kings coach Dave Joerger experimented with a smaller lineup that featured Lawson and Collison in the backcourt. ""I'm going to play small going forward. I've seen enough,"" Joerger said. ""DeMarcus is going to play center. I don't know who else is going to play with him, but it gives us more zip."" TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles shot 5 of 18 in the fourth quarter, yet still wound up shooting 52.6 percent overall. ... Playing his first game of the season, Paul Pierce made his first two shots, a pair of 3-pointers in the second quarter. ...

The Clippers had 17 assists and went 10 of 13 from 3-point range. They got superior play from their starters -- and the reserves were productive as well, contributing 23 points. ""That first half was beautiful. I don't know if we can play any better than that,"" Rivers said. MAIN MAN Griffin was too much for the Kings, shooting 7 of 15 from the field and making 15 of 16 free throws. He also had two steals and a block in just under 37 minutes.","400899633"
"HOUSTON --  With the Utah Jazz attempting a late comeback, James Harden casually tossed an alley-oop to Clint Capela from just inside the halfcourt line for a thunderous dunk. Harden had 31 points and 10 assists, and Capela scored a career-high 20 points to lead the Houston Rockets to a 111-102 victory over the Jazz on Saturday. ""I knew where he was going to be,"" Harden said of the pass. ""That's the kind of chemistry we're trying to build, to knowing where guys are going to be at so everything works easy and it's fluent."" Eric Gordon added 20 points and fellow reserve Nene added a season-high 16 as the Rockets won for the third time in their last four games and improved to 4-1 at home. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said Capela is growing more comfortable and confident on the floor every game. ""He had a monster game, and I don't think he did anything that he can't keep repeating,"" D'Antoni said. ""As long as he runs the floor and screens and rolls, we have guys that will find him."" The injury-plagued Jazz dropped their third straight game following a 6-2 start to November. Besides Gordon Hayward, the four other Jazz starters had a combined seven years of NBA experience. Rodney Hood led Utah with 25 points and Trey Lyles had 21. Rudy Gobert added 12 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks. Harden shook defender Dante Exum and buried a 3-pointer with less than a minute remaining to give Houston an 11-point lead and put away the game for good. Jazz coach Quin Snyder said Harden is ""doing everything,"" and seems to be a great match with D'Antoni. ""Clearly, he has taken it upon himself to help them execute the way coach D'Antoni wants,"" Snyder said. ""They are very, very good."" The Rockets took advantage of Utah's smaller lineup by outscoring Utah 52-46 in the paint and shying away from the 3-point line a little more than usual. Houston entered the game leading the league with 13.7 3-pointers made and 36.5 3-pointers attempted per game (37.4 percent), but made 12 of 32 against Utah. ""I think we were flat on both ends in the first half,"" Gobert said. ""We did not attack them on the offensive end and had too many mistakes on the defensive end."" Houston led 55-44 at the half and maintained the 11-point lead through the third quarter, entering the fourth with an 81-70 lead. TIP-INS Jazz: Lyles started in place of veteran Boris Diaw (rest) ahead of the team's trip to Denver on Sunday, Utah's fourth back-to-back of the season. ... Derrick Favors missed his second straight game with a left knee bone contusion, while George Hill (sprained right thumb) missed his seventh straight game. Rockets: Backup PF Montrezl Harrell was out with a left calf contusion. ... Harden passed Robert Reid (8,823 points) for seventh on the franchise's career scoring list. ... Patrick Beverley had five points, six assists and three steals. REVENGE REMATCH Capela recalled playing against Gobert in France and being overwhelmed by his talent as a 16-year-old just getting into basketball. Gobert, 24, is two years older than Capela, 22, who got a late start at the sport. The two conversed in French throughout Saturday's game, with Gobert even sending Capela a friendly warning at one point. ""He told me to never try to dunk on him again,"" Capela said with a grin. ""I just told him, `Next time I go to dunk, just get out of the way."" MAD MAX As part of the ongoing celebration of the franchise's 50th season, the Rockets honored former shooting guard Vernon Maxwell after the third quarter with a video tribute. Maxwell, who played on both of Houston's championship seasons in 1993-94 and 1994-95, was given a standing ovation following the video. ZERO TURNOVERS Harden became the first Rockets player since Sleepy Floyd in Orlando on April 8, 1990, to have at least 30 points, 10 assists and zero turnovers. Prior to Saturday, the last Rocket to record at least 10 assists without a turnover was Jeremy Lin at Golden State on Feb. 2, 2013.","400899634"
"NEW ORLEANS -- Anthony Davis spent much of the final seven minutes of New Orleans' game against Charlotte around the rim, cleaning up missed layups and jumpers from teammates. He was only doing what he was told to do. Davis had 38 points and 16 rebounds, Jrue Holiday added 22 points and nine assists, and the Pelicans beat the Hornets 121-116 in overtime Saturday night for their second straight win. ""Those guys usually make those shots but you never know,"" Davis said afterwards. ""Jrue even told me, `If I'm going to the basket, just follow behind me."" New Orleans (4-10), which hadn't won back-to-back games all season, overcame a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit and found unlikely bench scoring from guard Langston Galloway to keep Charlotte (8-4) from tying its best franchise start through 12 games. Galloway finished with 23 points, including 18 in the fourth quarter. Tim Frazier added 17 points and eight assists for New Orleans. ""He was really good and he's capable of doing that,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said of Galloway, who has had at least 15 points in three of New Orleans' past four games. Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 25 points, while Marco Belinelli added 22 points and 10 rebounds. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added 10 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte. Davis, though, was the biggest difference down the stretch. He had his ninth 30-point game of the season and scored 11 of the Pelicans' final 16 points. He tied the game with 18 seconds to play in regulation with a follow shot, and his tip-in of Holiday's miss in overtime gave the Pelicans the lead for good. ""When AD is in the game and you're attacking the basket, just know that he's around the rim somewhere and getting a hand on it,"" Holiday said. Not that Charlotte made it easy. Nicolas Batum hit three free throws after Galloway fouled him beyond the arc with 42 seconds to play, cutting New Orleans' lead to 116-115. Out of a timeout, though, Davis again came through, delicately rolling in a right-handed floater for a 118-115 lead. Holiday and Frazier then both sank free throws to safely keep the Pelicans ahead. ""They just made the right plays,"" Walker said. ""As a team we just made so many mistakes and they capitalized on every mistake we made."" TIP-INS Hornets: Starting center Cody Zeller sat out Saturday night's game with a sore shoulder. ... Charlotte held New Orleans to 21 first-quarter points, a season low for a Hornets opponent. Pelicans: New Orleans trailed by 11 points heading into the fourth quarter and has led after three quarters only four times this season. ... The Pelicans have won four of their past six games after starting 0-8. GALLOWAY'S GREAT NIGHT Galloway's previous season high of 21 points came Monday. He also tied his career high with six made 3-pointers. Galloway was one of the last free agents signed by New Orleans this offseason. BIG THIRD FOR CHARLOTTE The Hornets seemingly took control of the game in the second half, tying a season-best for third quarter points with 39. Charlotte was 12 of 23 in the quarter and hit 7 of 10 3-pointers. Heading into the fourth, the Hornets led 85-74. DIMINISHING MINUTES FOR HIELD Buddy Hield went to New Orleans with the sixth overall pick in April's draft. But after averaging just 9.2 points and 20 minutes per game to open the season, he has played only 13 minutes in the past two games combined. He shot 1 for 4 Saturday.","400899635"
"WASHINGTON --  For the new-look Miami Heat, a high-scoring victory over the Washington Wizards proved winning is possible on a bad defensive night. Goran Dragic scored 22 points, Hassan Whiteside added 18 and 18 rebounds and the Heat beat the Wizards 114-111 despite some rough moments on the defensive end. James Johnson had 17 points off the bench for Miami, which both scored and allowed its most points all season to register its first back-to-back wins. ""It's a huge game for us,"" said Dragic, whose team entered Saturday ranked third in the league in average points allowed. ""We're not a team that runs a whole lot. ... But we just need to grind. And we did that tonight."" Miami got its first road victory since its season opener despite 34 points each from Washington's John Wall and Bradley Beal, both good for season highs. Dion Waiters scored 16 points for Miami, and Josh Richardson hit four 3-pointers among his 15 points as Miami went 13 for 27 (48.1 percent) from beyond the arc. In all, six Heat players scored in double figures. ""We try to get to the paint and attack,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""But teams have been really loading up on that, and so we're trying to develop some more trust, some more ball movement to make teams pay for that."" Miami shot 57.7 percent from the floor, almost 16 full points above its season average entering Saturday. ""They had some guys that usually don't make shots that made shots because they were basically workout shots -- there was nobody there to contest them,"" Wall said. ""I think we came out with intensity. I just think our one-on-one defense was terrible."" Behind Wall and Beal, center Marcin Gortat scored 10 points and grabbed 16 rebounds. But no other Wizards hit double figures on a night Washington lost starting forward Markieff Morris to a sprained right ankle in the second quarter. After Dragic's jumper gave Miami a 60-59 lead to end the first half, the Heat opened the third quarter on a 10-4 run, stretching their lead to 70-63 on Whiteside's bank shot. Later in the third, Miami built its lead to 13 after a 12-4 stretch. Dragic drove inside for the last four points, his latter layup making it 89-76 with 2:41 left in the quarter. ""Man, the first half, nobody played defense,"" Dragic said. ""But we figured it out. The third quarter was good for us."" Washington trailed by as many as 17 in the fourth, before closing the game on a 10-1 run. That was a little deceiving, with Wall's second 3-pointer in that stretch coming with 0.9 seconds left. TIP-INS Heat: Improved to 3-0 when scoring 100 or more points ... Waiters started after testing a minor groin injury in pregame warm-ups ... F Willie Reed left early in the second quarter with a hyperextended right knee. Wizards: Sank to 1-8 when opponents score 100 or more points, and 3-5 in games when both Wall and Beal start. ... C Ian Mahinmi (knee surgery) will participate in his first practice of the season Sunday. ... Morris said he expects to practice Sunday. BOARDS IN BUNCHES Whiteside extended his season-opening, double-digit rebound streak to 12 games despite waiting until 3:34 left in the second quarter to pick up his first. By halftime, he had six. ""He's a monster,"" Dragic said. A SECOND HOME With the victory, Miami is now 24-14 all-time at the Verizon Center.

"ORLANDO, Fla. -- <U+FFFD><U+FFFD> Orlando Magic coach Frank Vogel doesn't have one go-to player he can count on every night. What he has are a collection of proven veterans who are capable of getting hot on any given night. On Saturday night against Dallas, it was D.J. Augustin's turn. The point guard came off the bench to score a team-high 18 points to lift the Magic past Dallas, 95-87, at Amway Center. Augustin, playing the final 17.5 minutes in place of starter Elfrid Payton, came through with 10 points and four assists in the fourth quarter to rally Orlando past a short-handed but dangerous Mavericks' team. ""I was planning on coming back to Elfrid but D.J. got going,"" Vogel said. ""I'm typically going to ride the hot hand. They had two really small quick guards so I liked our defensive matchups on top of the fact D.J. was going."" In a game that was tied eight times and had six lead changes. Around the midway point of the fourth quarter, Augustin came through with back-to-back 3-pointers to deliver the Magic from a one-point deficit to an 82-77 lead with 6:29 remaining in the game. Orlando would not trail again. ""Those were two big plays and we made mistakes that led to it,"" said Mavs coach Rick Carlisle. ""We have no margin for error."" With Dirk Nowitzki and Deron Williams out for the night, the Mavericks (2-10) had to rely on rookie point guard Jonathan Gibson, who scored a game-high 26 points off the bench after being signed by the team as a free agent on Friday. Gibson was certainly an offensive spark but his inexperience defensively was often exploited by Augustin, who consistently beat him with crossovers and pull up jumpers on the perimeter. ""I'm able to sit there and watch what's going on in the game, the flow of the game and try to figure out what we need at the time when I come in,"" Augustin said. ""If it's just to calm things down or play with a lot of energy."" Augustin, who was 6 of 11 from the field and four of four from the free throw line, gave the Magic (6-7) a spark on a night when shooting guard Evan Fournier struggled, shooting 3 of 13 from the field and Nikola Vucevic was 5-for-16 in the paint. ""We needed that,"" forward Jeff Green said of Augustin's performance.  ""We were missing shots and he came in and was efficient knocking down shots and getting us in a good offensive pace and making plays."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Both Nowitzki and Williams were held out of Saturday night's lineup due to nagging injuries. ... Harrison Barnes, who was third option at best with Golden State, is averaging a career-high 22.2 points per game this season. Magic: Coming into Saturday night's game, Orlando was allowing 100.9 points per game, which ranks 11th in the NBA. The Magic had held opponents to under 100 points five times, under 90 four times, which includes Wednesday's season-low of 82 points against the New Orleans Pelicans. IMPACT PLAYER Gibson just joined the Mavericks on Friday and was playing in just his second game with the team but he showed his ability to take over as a scorer. With the injuries at the point guard position, Gibson came off the bench to score 26 points and at times personally keep the Mavs in the game. He shot 8 of 16 from the field and 5 of 9 from 3-point range but he also had six turnovers and five personal fouls.","400899637"
"AUBURN HILLS. Mich. --  Al Horford got the winning basket, though it was Marcus Smart who made the biggest play. With the game tied at 92, Jae Crowder missed a go-ahead 3-pointer, but Smart came from the corner to tip the ball back at the basket. His shot didn't go in, but it gave Horford time to set himself for the follow shot with 1.3 seconds left that gave the Boston Celtics a 94-92 victory over the Detroit Pistons. ""The credit goes to Marcus, because that was a championship-level play,"" Horford said. ""He crashed the glass hard."" Said Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy: ""We just stood there and watched. They missed and no one moved or blocked out."" Isaiah Thomas had 24 points and eight assists for Boston, while Horford added 18 points and 11 rebounds. ""We didn't call a timeout in the last four minutes, because I just wanted to let them play,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""Our guys were making the right reads and the right plays."" Marcus Morris led Detroit with 24 points and Andre Drummond had 20 points and 17 rebounds. The Pistons became the last NBA team to lose at home. The teams traded the lead for most of the fourth quarter, and Kentavious Caldwell Pope's 3-pointer -- his first basket of the game -- gave the Pistons an 87-86 lead with 1:54 left. The teams traded dunks, and Thomas hit a layup over Drummond with 1:10 to play to make it 90-89. Caldwell-Pope missed an open 3, making him 1 for 7 on the night, and Drummond fouled Thomas on another drive. He made both free throws with 30.5 seconds left to give the Celtics a three-point lead, but Tobias Harris hit a tying 3-pointer. ""We were in position to come out of here with a victory, but we let them get off two extra shots,"" Harris said. ""Nobody, including myself, turned around to keep someone off the glass."" Boston, realizing that Drummond was on the bench, didn't call a timeout and it ended up being the difference in the game. ""I'm kicking myself right now, because if we have Andre on the floor, we get that rebound and we're in overtime,"" Van Gundy said. ""We had Aron on the floor to run the play that led to our 3-pointer, but when they didn't call a timeout, we couldn't get Andre back out there."" The Celtics were 6 of 10 on 3-pointers in the first quarter, including Thomas' buzzer-beater, to take a 30-23 lead. Boston led 50-47 at halftime. Detroit got 37 points from its starting frontcourt in the half, but guards Ish Smith and Caldwell-Pope had three points on 1-of-5 shooting. Boston's backcourt of Avery Bradley and Thomas combined for 18 points and nine assists. The Pistons used a 10-0 run to take the lead midway through the third quarter, and still had a 73-71 advantage at quarter's end. TIP-INS Celtics: Thomas started the second half with a four-point possession. He hit a free throw after the Pistons were called for a defensive three-second violation, then knocked down his second 3-pointer of the game. Pistons: Stanley Johnson, normally one of the Detroit's top bench players, didn't play. Van Gundy said that Johnson will only be used as a backup small forward, and he wasn't needed with Morris and Harris both playing well. DRUMMOND MILESTONE Drummond pulled down his 4,000th career rebound in the third quarter. At 23 years and 101 days, he is the second-youngest player to reach the milestone, trailing only Dwight Howard (22 years, 129 days). CELTICS PLAY SMALL Stevens wanted to keep a smaller lineup on the floor to try to give Drummond and Baynes matchup problems. Smart played 30:36 while starter Amir Johnson only got 20:22. ""We were trying to stretch those guys as much as we could,"" he said. ""It is hard to do that, because of Morris and Harris, but we thought it went well.""","400899638"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Up until the start of Saturday's game, it seemed unlikely that Joel Embiid would play at all. He ended up having the best game of his short NBA career. Fighting through a sprained left ankle, Embiid scored a career-high 26 points in 20 minutes, and the Philadelphia 76ers routed the Phoenix Suns 120-105 for their most convincing win of the season. ""I felt great,"" Embiid said. ""When you play, you don't really pay attention to those kind of things. During the game, I was fine. Even now, it's fine."" Nik Stauskas added a season-high 21 points on 8-for-9 shooting for the Sixers, who have split their last six games after starting the season with seven straight losses. Sergio Rodriguez had eight points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. Eric Bledsoe led Phoenix (4-10) with 27 points. The Suns have lost three of their first four on their six-game road trip. ""You give any team confidence at home and they can get rolling,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""They have a lot of confidence here. The crowd was energetic and Embiid in limited minutes was more than effective."" Embiid was 3 for 5 from 3-point range and 9 for 14 from the field overall. He also grabbed seven rebounds and blocked two shots, including a ferocious one on Devin Booker in the second quarter that got the crowd roaring. The 7-foot-2 center, playing in just his ninth NBA game after a pair of foot surgeries sidelined him for his first two seasons, reached his career high on a jumper with 8:30 left. After a three-point play from Bledsoe got Phoenix within six midway through the third quarter, the Sixers reeled off a 10-0 run to open an 82-66 lead. They led by double figures the rest of the way against a banged-up Phoenix team playing the second end of a back-to-back. ""We got stops, we made some shots and we took off again,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. Embiid and Booker were game-time decisions due to sprained ankles. Each of them started and Embiid, hurt two nights earlier, jumped all over the Suns, scoring Philly's first eight points and 10 in the first three minutes, including a pair of 3-pointers. Later in the first quarter, Embiid had eight points in a 10-0 run that helped Philadelphia to a 31-17 advantage, capping the spurt with his third 3 from the top of the key. ""That's what makes him so tough to stop,"" Stauskas said. ""Obviously he's a dominant force down low but sometimes the bigs aren't willing to step up to the line to guard him. And he's making people pay right now with that top-of-the-key 3-pointer."" Booker finished with 10 points on 4-for-13 shooting. TIP-INS Suns: The Suns were without T.J. Warren (illness) and Tyson Chandler (mother's funeral). ... Phoenix recalled rookie forward Derrick Jones Jr. from D-League affiliate Northern Arizona before the game. 76ers: After shooting 1 for 5 from the field, slumping sharpshooter Robert Covington has missed 27 of his last 31 shots, leading to plenty of boos from the crowd. ... The Sixers have won three straight at home, but dropped their last 21 on the road -two away from matching a franchise record. THE EMBIID PROCESS Embiid, who already has missed four games this season as the Sixers slowly ease him back, was limited to 24 minutes or less. Jahlil Okafor, who platoons with him at center, was under the same minutes restriction because of knee surgery last season. ""I hope to play those two together,"" Brown said. ""With the minutes restriction, it's kind of impossible right now."" BOOKER GUTS IT OUT Watson said Booker ""struggled"" after returning from his own ankle injury. But the Suns coach was impressed that the second-year rising star was able to play at all. ""He gave us all he had,"" Watson said. ""He knew he wanted to play because we didn't have T.J. He sacrificed his body. That's just the type of person he is. You could see he could barely move."" BOMBS AWAY The Sixers matched a franchise record with 17 3-pointers.","400899639"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The Memphis Grizzlies are on a four-game winning streak and relying on their reputation of hard-nosed defense. For the second straight night, Memphis held its opponent under 75 points, sending Minnesota to its worst offensive performance of the season and capturing a 93-71 victory over the Timberwolves on Saturday. The 71 points were a season-low for Minnesota, which was limited to 39 percent shooting on the night, also a season-low. Memphis held Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota's leading scorer at 27.4 points, to seven points as he missed nine of his 11 shots. ""Battle, fight him and try to make everything impossible for him,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""He missed some shots that he normally makes."" JaMychal Green had 19 points and eight rebounds, while Zach Randolph added 18 points and seven boards for Memphis, which ended a four-game road trip with an 80-64 win at Dallas on Friday night. ""That's what we do. That's what we've been doing,"" Randolph said of the defense. ""That ain't no surprise."" The Grizzlies forced 19 turnovers, leading to 27 points. ""Their defense was terrific,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. "".We like to think that we are a pretty good offensive team. We didn't move the ball the way we needed to."" Mike Conley and Andrew Harrison added 13 points apiece for Memphis, while James Ennis finished with 11 points. Zach LaVine led the Timberwolves with 22 points, providing a third-quarter push when Minnesota tied the game. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 17. LaVine kept the Timberwolves within striking distance to open the third, collecting Minnesota's first eight points, including a pair of 3-pointers. The game was deadlocked at 48 when Memphis clicked off 14 straight points to build its largest lead of the game at that point. Memphis would stretch the advantage to as many as 25 in the fourth. ""I just didn't like the way we played,"" Thibodeau said, adding: ""With 19 turnovers, we can't win on the road. (The Grizzlies) are going to make you pay for your mistakes, and they did."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota's 39 first-half points were a season-low for a first half. ... Minnesota's previous low for points this season was 92 against Oklahoma City on Nov. 5. ... Minnesota is now 0-7 when shooting under 45 percent and 0-8 when trailing after three quarters. Grizzlies: F Chandler Parsons did not play on the second night of the back-to-back. Parsons, still nursing offseason right knee surgery, had played in all six games since he returned to action Nov. 6. ... Vince Carter played in his 1,287th game, moving past Sam Perkins for 23rd on the career list. ... Memphis was 33 of 38 from the free throw line, season highs in both categories. MILWAUKEE MOTIVATION Memphis' four-game winning streak began after a poor performance in a 106-96 loss at Milwaukee on Nov. 12. ""We had a team meeting, and Coach got on us about our effort in the Milwaukee game,"" Green said. ""It looked bad on film, and it opened all our eyes."" WIGGINS WOES Wiggins' seven points matched his season low. He also had seven at Oklahoma City on Nov. 5. Thibodeau said the poor shooting impacted other aspects of Wiggins' game. "".You can't allow that to take away from other things you can do to help the team win,"" Thibodeau said. ""You can do things without shooting well. That's an area we have to grow in."" NO REST. NO PROBLEM Memphis has won all three of its games on the second night of back-to-backs this season.","400899640"
"MILWAUKEE --  Draymond Green knew what was coming. Golden State was up by two and had to defend an inbounds pass from the Milwaukee Bucks with 10.1 seconds left on the Warriors' side of the court. Green had the assignment of guarding Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks' athletic 6-foot-11 forward. Green tipped away the pass, Klay Thompson secured the loose ball before hitting two critical foul shots, and the Warriors held on to beat Milwaukee 124-121 on Saturday night for their seventh straight victory. ""That's what Draymond does. He sees the game. He knows what's coming,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""All I saw was that he got a hand on it and Klay ended up with it. I've seen that before. Draymond is unbelivable in those situations."" Kevin Durant scored 33 points, while Thompson had 25 of his 29 in the second half. But they had to hold off a late charge by the Bucks after leading by as much as 14 points. Jabari Parker and Antetokounmpo led a 13-4 run in the fourth quarter that cut it to 122-120 with about 2  1/2 minutes left on Parker's three-point play. ""The guys fought for 48 minutes,"" coach Jason Kidd said. Rowdy Bucks fans had designs of an upset of Golden State at the Bradley Center, just like last season. The teams exchanged empty possessions before Green's sparkling defensive effort with 10 seconds left. ""Once Giannis was down on the block, I already knew what they were running. I was just waiting on them to pass the ball in,"" Green said. Antetokounmpo finished with 30 points, while Parker had 28. ""There's no satisfaction, we've got to keep getting better,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""As a team we're not a finished product yet."" TIP-INS Warriors: Durant gave the Warriors a brief scare after he got up slowly after bumping into Parker with 9 minutes left in the third quarter. Trainers appeared to be looking at Durant's leg during a timeout, and Durant stayed in the game. He looked fine after running down the lane for a dunk that gave the Warriors an 85-78 lead with 5:58 left in the period. Durant had 25 points in the first half on 8-of-10 shooting. ... Golden State won its third straight road game despite a subpar shooting night for Stephen Curry, who was 1 of 11 from behind the arc. Curry finished with 20 points. Bucks: The Bucks trailed 69-66 at halftime in spite of a season-high offensive output in the first half. It was also a season-high points allowed in the first half for Milwaukee. Antetokounmpo had 16 before halftime, when the Bucks shot 59 percent. A 37-point first quarter was also a season-high for that quarter for the Bucks. FRIENDLY CHALLENGE Kerr issued a good-natured, last-minute challenge to Bucks fans before the game. Kerr said that if a fan showed up with a ""10-3"" shirt, he would give that fan two tickets to a Golden State home game, though there were several other stipulations, too. First and foremost, the Bucks had to win. The Warriors were 10-2 entering Saturday night's game. Kerr's dare was in reference to how Bucks fans confidently wore ""24-1"" shirts ahead of the Warriors' visit last season to Milwaukee on Dec. 12. ""I am not giving them a plane ticket, or a place to stay, but I'll give (them) a couple tickets to a game,"" Kerr said. He never had to follow through. QUOTABLE ""You feed off that energy. You need that as a team ... Whoever believes in us and wants us to be great, hopefully they can come to the arena and watch us play."" -- Antetokounmpo about the energetic fans in the fourth quarter.","400899641"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers needed more offense and Mo Buckets delivered in the clutch. Maurice Speights scored 11 of his season-high 16 points in the fourth quarter, rallying Los Angeles past Chicago 102-95 on Saturday night to snap the Bulls' four-game winning streak. ""You can take losing in this league, but you don't want to lose that way,"" Chicago's Dwyane Wade said. Even with all the offense, Speights' biggest play came on an assist with 49 seconds left . Jamal Crawford missed a 3-pointer and Speights grabbed the offensive rebound. He fed Crawford for a driving reverse layup that restored the Clippers' lead to five points. ""I was in position to get it and he didn't expect it so I surprised him,"" said Speights, who was yanked after going scoreless during a brief stint in the first half. Clippers coach Doc Rivers said, ""It was a great example where you just got to figure it out."" Blake Griffin had 26 points and 13 rebounds and Chris Paul added 19 points for the Clippers, whose only two losses have come at home to Oklahoma City and Memphis. Rallying from a 19-point deficit for the victory moved them to an NBA-best 12-2. Wade led Chicago with 28 points, hitting five 3-pointers. Jimmy Butler added 22 points, making 11 of 12 free throws. ""They had to dig deep into their bag to pull this one out at home,"" Wade said. ""That's what we want to do, make teams walk away scarred up. Feeling like that got away with one, and that's what they should be feeling."" The Bulls made just one field goal over the final 6:30, keeping it close on seven consecutive free throws, including five by Butler. Isaiah Canaan hit a 3-pointer to draw them to 97-95 with 44 seconds left. Butler fouled Griffin with 20 seconds to go and he made both for a 99-95 lead. Wade missed a pullup jumper before Taj Gibson and coach Fred Hoiberg were hit with technical fouls in the closing seconds. Hoiberg was ejected. ""That's a great team, playing the best basketball in the league,"" Hoiberg said. ""We fought them and we gave ourselves a chance."" Wade scored 10 of the Bulls' first 12 points to start the second quarter, pushing their lead to 19 points before the Clippers suddenly awakened. They outscored Chicago 21-7 to head into halftime trailing 52-47. Griffin scored eight points, highlighted by his dunk over Robin Lopez off a bounce pass in the lane from Paul. Griffin elevated, with his left hand on Lopez's shoulder, and slammed the ball down, drawing a foul. Wade's wife, Gabrielle Union, grimaced from her fourth-row seat while the crowd roared. TIP-INS Bulls: They shot 68 percent in the first quarter, their best in a quarter this season. ... They are 0-3 in the first game of a back-to-back and 1-1 in the second game. Clippers: Griffin has scored 20-plus points in seven straight games. ... Since their home opener on Oct. 30, they have played 12 games in 20 days, most in the league in that span. They don't have two days off in between games until Dec. 5-6. ... C Diamond Stone was assigned to the Santa Cruz Warriors of the D-League after appearing in three games for the Clippers. Stone was the 40th overall pick in the June draft after playing one season at Maryland. ... F Wesley Johnson missed his fifth straight game with a left heel contusion. HE SAID IT ""He proves you can be a gentleman and a killer at the same time."" -- Rivers on Butler. RONDO RETURNS Rajon Rondo returned to Chicago's starting lineup after missing two games because of a sprained left ankle and bronchitis. He just missed a triple-double, finishing with nine points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Hoiberg said the team missed Rondo's energy. ""He's done a nice job of throwing the ball ahead, getting the ball to our wings where we can attack or getting the ball to the post,"" Hoiberg said.","400899642"
"Carmelo Anthony throws up a contested shot and banks it in as time expires in the first quarter against the Hawks. (0:17) NEW YORK -- Joakim Noah's illness made it an unsettling morning for the Knicks' backup centers. Carmelo Anthony made sure it was a smooth afternoon. Anthony matched his season high with 31 points and New York beat the Atlanta Hawks 104-94 on Sunday for its fourth straight home victory. Anthony has never been a morning person, but he wanted to come out aggressively Sunday after the Knicks followed a loss Thursday in Washington with a lengthy meeting Saturday featuring players, coaches and even team president Phil Jackson. ""Some nights like today calls for me to get it going early,"" Anthony said. ""My mindset was just to come out and get it going early."" Kristaps Porzingis added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Knicks, who led most of the way against one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference. Dwight Howard had 18 points and 18 rebounds, but point guard Dennis Schroder missed all eight shots as the Hawks dropped their second straight following a six-game winning streak. ""I feel like we didn't play well enough on the road. You have to bring a better game but give the New York Knicks credit,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Carmelo played a heck of a game, hit a lot of tough shots."" The Knicks didn't have Noah to defend Howard after doctors sent him home because of an illness. Kyle O'Quinn was told during pregame he would start, and rookie Marshall Plumlee had to rush into the city by train and then taxi after he received a morning phone call and was told he would be called up from Westchester of the NBA Development League to make his NBA debut. ""Opportunity knocked and we were all ready as a team defensively,"" O'Quinn said. Howard bounced back nicely after he was ejected for a flagrant foul Friday in the Hawks' 100-96 loss in Charlotte, while Paul Millsap led Atlanta with 19 points and Kyle Korver scored 17. Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee both scored 14 points and O'Quinn had eight points and eight rebounds. The Knicks led by two with 7 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter before Anthony's jumper started them on a 12-0 burst. Willy Hernangomez's three-point play extended New York's lead to 65-51. Atlanta never made a serious dent in the lead, as the Knicks repeatedly hit 3-pointers every time it seemed the Hawks were building momentum. Anthony banked in a long jumper from the right side to end the first quarter, giving the Knicks a 24-20 lead that they expanded to 46-41 at halftime. TIP-INS Hawks: Howard had his 10th double-double of the season by halftime. ... Thabo Sefolosha was active after missing the last two games with a sprained left knee but didn't play. Knicks: Plumlee was scoreless in 5 1/2 minutes after getting out of his cab in traffic and sprinting to the arena. ""When I got here they said, `Hey, do you need a warm up?"" he said. ""I said, `No, I'm already warm. I ran here."" ... The Knicks beat the Hawks for the third straight time. SCHRODER'S STRUGGLES Schroder finished with one point and three assists, sitting out the entire fourth quarter. ""Personally didn't feel good,"" he said. ""I didn't hit my shots. I didn't play like I did before but I got to do a better job of being ready to prepare myself."" HOWARD'S HACK Howard was tossed Friday when he elbowed Cody Zeller midway through the fourth quarter. Budenholzer said he talked to Howard about the play but wants him to keep providing toughness. ""Hopefully he can find ways to be physical, let the other team feel him but still do it within kind of the confines of what's appropriate,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think to be ejected was probably the right thing and he knows it, but he also knows he wants to continue to play physical and be a presence on the boards.""","400899643"
"NEW YORK --  C.J. McCollum took over in the third quarter for the Portland Trail Blazers to victory. McCollum scored 33 points, Evan Turner had 19 and the Trail Blazers beat the Brooklyn Nets 129-109 on Sunday. Portland snapped a three-game losing streak and extended Brooklyn's skid to four. Damian Lillard added 18 points for the Trail Blazers, and Allen Crabbe had 14. Crabbe signed a four-year, $75 million restricted free-agent offer sheet with Brooklyn before Portland matched in the offseason. Brook Lopez had 21 points for the Nets. Trevor Booker had 16, and Bojan Bogdanovic 15. McCollum made four 3-pointers and scored 12 points in the third quarter to help the Trail Blazers take a 99-84 lead into the fourth. McCollum extended Portland's lead to 22 by making a driving layup and then sinking a free throw to give the Trail Blazers a 110-88 lead with 8:08 remaining in the fourth quarter. Portland never looked back. ""I had some good looks,"" McCollum said. ""Guys did a great job moving the ball and finding the weak side. It was like throwing rocks in the ocean."" Poor third quarters are becoming a trend, according to Lopez. ""I think one of the things that is difficult for us is the third quarters,"" Lopez said. ""I think there are usually games where we've come out and teams have made a run and come out and hit first. It is tough to come back from that playing behind the rest of the night."" ""I just think we come out flat. I think it's on us 100 percent. I mean, I don't think you can look at the other teams. We've had a variety of different guys, and they play differently. I think that one is on us for sure."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Coach Terry Stotts praised the growth of Mason Plumlee as a playmaker. ""What we use the most is his playmaking ability, his passing. We give him the freedom to get a rebound and take it up. We play through him out on the perimeter because he's a good passer. He sees the game. I think he helps our perimeter guys get better shots because of his playmaking, passing and rolling, rolling to the weak side."" ... Al-Farouq Aminu (left calf) and Festus Ezeli (left knee) were inactive. Nets: Coach Kenny Atkinson left the door open for former No. 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett to have an expanded role going forward. ""That was a pleasant surprise to see Anthony come in and help us out. We'll keep looking at it. We're going to keep looking at our rotations and, really, we want to give guys opportunity.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Indiana coach Nate McMillan wrote an instruction on the white board in the Pacers' locker room Sunday: ""Scrap."" Jeff Teague did just that, scoring eight of his 30 points in overtime, harassing Russell Westbrook defensively all night and lifting the short-handed Pacers to a 115-111 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was Indiana's first road victory of the season and it came without star forward Paul George, who missed his second straight game with a sore left ankle. ""You've got to fight for everything,"" McMillan said. ""I thought the guys tonight, we did that. We were without a couple of players, but the guys in uniform came out and played the game the right way. They played hard and we got our first road win."" Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook had his fifth triple-double of the season -- as many as the rest of the NBA combined -- with 31 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds, but went 13 of 34 from the field. Westbrook calmly used an expletive to describe the way he played. ""We just wasn't ready,"" he said. ""Just wasn't ready tonight, starting with myself. ... I could have did a lot of things better, man. Got to come out and be ready to play. Tonight I felt like I let my guys down all around. I've got to be better."" Teague matched his season scoring high and added nine assists and six steals. He hit two free throws with 4.6 seconds left in regulation to put the Pacers up three. Westbrook hit a 3-pointer with 2.4 seconds left to tie it for the Thunder and Glenn Robinson III missed a well-guarded 10-footer at the buzzer, forcing overtime. Teague's 3-pointer in the opening minute of overtime put the Pacers ahead for good. With 1:09 left, he converted a three-point play to make it 113-107, and he hit two free throws with 19.1 seconds left to put Indiana up 115-111. He said the Pacers weren't flustered after Westbrook's tying 3-pointer at the end of regulation and that McMillan told his team ""just to go win the game. ""We had nothing to lose there,"" Teague said. ""We knew they were going to make some plays, so we just have to go out and win the game."" Six Pacers scored in double figures and two of them had double-doubles -- Robinson with 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Thaddeus Young with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Myles Turner just missed another with 15 points and nine rebounds. Enes Kanter added 16 points for the Thunder. Oklahoma City rallied from a 15-point second-half deficit to force overtime but wasn't able to recover from a dismal third quarter in which it missed 12 of its first 13 shots and went 4 of 17 from the field. TIP-INS: Pacers: Robinson III made his first start of the season in place of George (ankle) and C.J. Miles (knee), who also sat out due to injury. ... Another forward, Kevin Seraphin, also missed the game with a sore left knee ... Teague matched his career high with six steals. Thunder: Oklahoma City saw its Northwest Division lead shrink to a half-game over Portland. ... The Thunder ended a stretch during which they played eight out of nine games at home. ... The overtime was the second of the season for Oklahoma City, which beat Phoenix on Oct. 28 after an extra period. GEORGE, MILES OUT: George missed his third game, and his second in a row, since spraining his left ankle against Philadelphia on Nov. 11, while the player who's started in his place, Miles, sat out with a sore left knee that he hurt on Friday in a loss to Phoenix. Both players underwent MRIs on Saturday and while the results were negative for structural damage, McMillan said George and Miles would also be out for Monday's home game against Golden State, and then will be reassessed to determine their availability for Wednesday's game against Atlanta. QUOTABLE: ""I have been waiting on my opportunity, just working hard the whole offseason. This guy (Seraphin) told me a couple of days ago, literally, `Be ready. You never know.' Then I walk in the gym and (George) is out, C.J. is hurt and I got to step up. I am just proud of this whole team for sticking together and fighting even though we are a couple of men down."" -- Robinson on his performance.","400899645"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Rudy Gay and the Sacramento Kings were glad to benefit from a rare bit of good fortune. Gay had 23 points and nine rebounds, and the Kings beat Toronto 102-99 on Sunday night after waiting out a video review to see if the Raptors had forced overtime on Terrence Ross' 3-pointer at the buzzer. Following a timeout with 2.4 seconds left, Ross grabbed a deflected pass, took two dribbles and made a 33-footer -- but the officials ruled time had expired. Official Mike Callahan said a replay review showed the clock didn't start when DeMarcus Cousins deflected the ball. The actual elapsed time was 2.5 seconds, resulting in no basket and a celebration at Golden 1 Arena. ""I've got to hear another explanation better than that because we reviewed it about 10 times in there,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""Even if the clock started once DeMarcus Cousins deflected it, T-Ross caught it, shot it, and still had shot it at .5 (seconds) with plenty of time."" The only explanation the Kings cared about was the disputed shot didn't count. ""We never get these kinds of breaks,"" Gay said. ""It felt good to get off the court and celebrate this win."" While the Kings were ecstatic, the Raptors bemoaned their fate. ""I'm going to save my money and say no comment,"" Kyle Lowry said. The NBA's scoring leader, DeMar DeRozan was defended tightly by Gay for much of the game and missed 12 of 15 shots while finishing with a season-low 12 points for Toronto. The Kings snapped a four-game losing streak and beat the Raptors for the second time this season. DeRozan, who entered averaging 33 points per game, missed all eight shots and had three second-half points as Toronto was outscored 44-36. ""We gave up 36 in the second half. That's fantastic, because the first half wasn't so nice defensively,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Sacramento defeated Toronto for the second time this season. In the first meeting, DeRozan shot 7 of 20 and had 23 points. He has reached 30 points in 10 of 13 games this season. ""I can say it was a bad shooting night or I could be humble and say that I played good defense,"" said Gay, an ex-teammate of DeRozan's. ""He's a friend of mine."" Lowry had nine of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and finished with eight assists and seven turnovers. Jonas Valanciunas added 23 points and 14 rebounds, DeMarre Carroll scored 17 points, and Patrick Patterson 11. Cousins had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Kings. Darren Collison added 15 points and nine assists, and Aaron Afflalo scored 14. Sacramento had dropped eight of 10. Lowry made two free throws to cut the Kings' lead to 102-99. A shot-clock violation gave the ball back to Toronto for one more possession. Collison converted a three-point play to break a 97-all tie with just more than 3 minutes remaining. He found Gay for a dunk off a fast break, giving the Kings a 102-97 lead with 1:37 left. TIP-INS Raptors: Reserve center Lucas Nogueira was back with the team after missing Thursday's game to be with his wife, who gave birth to a baby girl. ... Valanciunas had 19 points in the opening half and benefited from Cousins being in foul trouble. Kings: The struggling Kings went to a smaller lineup, moving Matt Barnes and Collison into the starting lineup. The results were mixed, and Toronto led 36-28 after one quarter. ... The Kings are 17-3 at home against the Raptors.","400899646"
"DENVER -- <U+FFFD><U+FFFD> Sharp-shooting rookie Jamal Murray showed why he could one day become Denver's go-to guy late in games. Murray scored 16 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter, and the Nuggets closed out the Utah Jazz 105-91 on Sunday night in a matchup of struggling Western Conference teams. It certainly was a welcome sight for a Denver squad that is 1-4 in games decided by three points or fewer. ""Great to see Jamal Murray go off in the fourth quarter and make big shots,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Jamal, he continues to grow up in front of our eyes. When he gets confident and puts the ball up, I think it's going in every time he shoots it."" Jusuf Nurkic had 16 points and 11 rebounds to help Denver improve to 2-4 at home. Wilson Chandler added 17 points, and Danilo Gallinari had 13 points, five rebounds and eight assists. Gordon Hayward had 25 points for Utah, and Dante Exum, Rodney Hood and Joe Johnson each scored 10. The Jazz have lost four straight. ""It's been a long two weeks, but that's no excuse,"" Hood said. ""Offensively, we started out real sluggish. We're not getting stops, that's the biggest thing. They played at a really good pace tonight and it had us on our heels."" Will Barton started for the banged-up Nuggets after missing his previous nine games with an ankle injury. He made a 3-pointer on his team's first attempt from the field and finished with seven points. The Nuggets led by double digits most of the night and trailed only once, 2-0. Utah stayed within striking distance until the fourth quarter thanks to Denver's 13-for-30 free throw shooting. Murray got going late, making five of his six shots in the fourth. He finished 3 for 4 from 3-point range and has hit 11 of 20 from long distance in his last four games. ""I love playing with a shooter,"" said Nuggets point guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. ""He's playing with a lot more confidence. I think he's figuring out himself and things are slowing down for him as well."" The Jazz struggled early and often in their fourth back-to-back of the season, shooting just 5 of 22 in the opening quarter. They trailed by 19 in the second before finding any consistency. TIP-INS Jazz: PF Derrick Favors missed his third straight game with a bruised left knee, while PG George Hill missed his eighth consecutive game with a sprained thumb. ""Hopefully the band will be back,"" coach Quin Snyder said of his team's early-season injuries. ""We haven't really established a band, so I don't even know what that sounds like."" ... Veteran C Boris Diaw (rest) came off the bench after sitting out Saturday against Houston. He had two points. Nuggets: G Gary Harris missed his fourth consecutive game with a right foot injury and is not expected to return until mid-December. 'NO OFFENSE' Happy about the win, Malone said he still addressed his team's season-low 43.3 percent free throw shooting after the game. ""I said, 'Great game, but no offense, we were like team Shaq tonight,'"" Malone said. ""We got there a lot but I couldn't believe we were missing as many as we were missing."" TIES THAT BIND A plethora of injuries have hindered early expectations for the Nuggets and Jazz, two teams looking to get back to the postseason. Snyder said he hopes injuries won't link the Northwest Division rivals for long. ""We don't really want to be cousins in that one,"" he said.","400899647"
"LOS ANGELES --  Even when Dwyane Wade takes a night off to rest, Jimmy Butler gets the benefit of his new Chicago Bulls teammate's veteran experience. Not that Butler needed a whole lot of help while he carved up the Los Angeles Lakers. Butler scored a season-high 40 points and Isaiah Canaan added a season-high 17 in the Bulls' fifth victory in six games, 118-110 over the Lakers on Sunday night. Nikola Mirotic had 15 points and 15 rebounds and the Bulls held off Los Angeles' late rally for their third win in four stops on their annual circus road trip. They also bounced back solidly after blowing a 19-point lead in a loss to the Clippers on Saturday night. ""It was a quick turnaround from last night to today, but I saw everybody working on their body and everybody watching the film,"" Butler said. ""That's how it's supposed to be."" Chicago got a vintage game from Butler, its two-time All-Star and gold medal-winning Olympian. He destroyed a series of Los Angeles defenders with his usual flair, scoring inside and on the perimeter without hitting a 3-pointer. ""He was attacking all night,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""He told me before the game, `Coach, I'm going for 40 tonight,' and he did it."" Even on the second half of back-to-back road games, Chicago outrebounded the Lakers 56-37 -- including 16 offensive boards -- and constantly outhustled Los Angeles to loose balls. The Bulls did it all without Wade, who rested for the first time this season. He scored 28 points on Saturday, but the Bulls are monitoring their 34-year-old guard's long-term health. ""Even though D-Wade is out, he's still helping me through this process and letting him know what I should be doing, helping me read the game,"" Butler said. ""It's great to have him in my corner."" Lou Williams scored a season-high 25 points and Larry Nance Jr. had a career-high 18 for the Lakers (7-7). ""Jimmy Butler had a pretty fantastic game,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""He's a pretty fantastic player, but if he's going to do that, then we have to shut down the rest of the guys. We let him get his, and the role players all chipped in and did their part as well. You either take away the star or take away the role players. You can't let everyone have a night."" RONDO'S RETURN Rajon Rondo had four points, nine rebounds and 12 assists despite a sore left ankle. He hit a floater in the lane with 28.6 seconds left to secure the Bulls' win after Los Angeles trimmed a 15-point lead to five. LONG SEASON The Lakers' young stars mostly struggled in their second straight loss. D'Angelo Russell had only eight points and seven assists while playing cautiously on a sore left knee. Jordan Clarkson managed just five points on 1-of-12 shooting, and Julius Randle had 14 points. The Lakers also got a lesson in hard work from the dogged Bulls, particularly in the paint. ""There was a stretch in the second quarter when they just bullied us on the glass,"" Nance said. ""I don't know what was the cause of it."" LAST GASP Even on a bad night, the young Lakers made a late rally to trim Chicago's lead to 115-110 with 1:12 left on back-to-back 3-pointers by Nick Young and Russell. Young and Russell then missed 3-pointers that would have trimmed Chicago's lead to two, and Butler won a jump ball before Rondo's clinching floater. TIP-INS Bulls: Rondo played his second straight game on that balky ankle. ... They'll host the Lakers in the rematch on Nov. 30. The Bulls have only two games before then, while the Lakers have five. ... German C Paul Zipser sat out with a lower back strain. Lakers: Walton got his first technical foul of the season from referee Kane Fitzgerald in the second quarter after a no-call. ... Luol Deng scored six points. He spent his first 9 1/2 NBA seasons with the Bulls.","400899648"
"PHILADELPHIA --  If Joel Embiid and Hassan Whiteside have their way, centers are going to be big in the NBA again. Embiid had 22 points, including four late free throws, to lead the Philadelphia 76ers over Whiteside and the Miami Heat 101-94 on Monday night in a matchup between two of the top big men in the Eastern Conference. Neither disappointed. Whiteside set a career high with 32 points while reaching double digits in rebounds for the 13th consecutive game to start the season. Whiteside, who entered leading the NBA with 16.2 boards per game, finished with 13. ""Around the league there's a lot of young big men, and I think we're starting to come back,"" said Embiid, who played 23 minutes. ""So one thing I told him is keep killing it. As big men, we all want each other to do good. I've always studied him in the past. It's always been a big man league, so I want it to stay like that."" Gerald Henderson added 19 points and Jahlil Okafor had 15 for the 76ers, who won their fourth straight home game. Philadelphia (4-10) has lost 21 in a row on the road. ""I feel we're moving in the right direction,"" coach Brett Brown said. Embiid has made an early case for Rookie of the Year despite missing two seasons with a foot injury. He set a career high with 26 points in Philadelphia's 120-105 win over Phoenix on Saturday night and followed that up with yet another strong game. He was serenaded with chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" late in the game from the home crowd, which hasn't had much to cheer about in the last few seasons during Philadelphia's rebuilding process. But Embiid has given Sixers fans reason to hope. ""Philly loves that guy,"" Whiteside said. ""I've never seen excitement like that. They love that dude. I was amazed."" Embiid came up big again Monday, especially down the stretch. The teams were close throughout the second half. Henderson's corner 3-pointer gave Philadelphia an 85-80 cushion with 8:16 remaining. Whiteside re-entered shortly after that shot and helped Miami tie it at 89 with 4:43 left on a tip-in. Philadelphia responded with nine of the next 11 points, capped by Embiid's two free throws with 2:27 left that gave the 76ers their biggest lead to that point, 98-91. ""There's a spirit he has at the end of games and on the bench that reflects toughness and a growing desire,"" Brown said of Embiid. PITCHING IN Robert Covington also came up big during the late Sixers run, scoring on a reverse layup and a 3-pointer. Covington was booed upon entering the game in the fourth quarter due to his recent shooting struggles. He entered having missed 27 of his last 31 shots and finished 4 for 13 against Miami. ""It goes in one ear, out the other,"" Covington said. ""I've been here two years. I see the ups and downs of how Philly fans are, and it doesn't affect me. Just keep playing."" The 3-pointer eased Covington's mind. ""It was a big relief,"" he said. ""My teammates just kept telling me to keep shooting. I was like, I'm going to have one good shot."" KEEP ME IN, COACH Whiteside, plagued by foul trouble, played 32 minutes. He ended the night with five fouls, but would have liked to have seen more time on the court. ""One day he is going to trust me with the five fouls,"" Whiteside said of coach Erik Spoelstra. BIG SHOT Embiid is the rare big man who has a feathery touch from outside. He shot 7 of 13 from the field and hit one of his two 3-point attempts. For the season, Embiid is shooting 49.2 percent from the floor and has drained 11 of 21 3-pointers. TIP-INS Heat: Shaquille O'Neal's No. 32 jersey will be retired by Miami on Dec. 22 during a ceremony at halftime against the Los Angeles Lakers. ... F Willie Reed (knee) didn't play after leaving Saturday's game at Washington. 76ers: Offseason acquisition Jerryd Bayless made his season debut for Philadelphia and scored four points in 16 minutes. Bayless missed the first 13 games with a left wrist injury. . Embiid's minutes are restricted in the wake of his foot injury.","400899649"
"WASHINGTON -- Scott Brooks is still getting to know Bradley Beal and the rest of the Washington Wizards. The team's new coach likes what he sees out of his shooting guard. In the last two games, Beal has scored 76 points -- and 30 or more in consecutive games for the first time in his five-year career. Beal had a career-high 42 points and John Wall shook off an awful shooting night with seven key points down the stretch as the Wizards beat the Phoenix Suns 106-101 on Monday night. Beal, who scored 34 points in Saturday's loss to Miami, had nine in the first quarter, seven in the second, 12 in the third and 14 in the fourth. He shot 14 for 22 and hit five of his 10 3-point attempts. ""He can be one of the best two-way players in the league, and my job is to continue to push him to strive for greatness,"" Brooks said. ""It takes a lot of energy. It takes a lot of inner drive and determination, but I think he has the ability to be that player."" Beal said he's simplified his approach. ""Not thinking, not worrying about if I miss or if I make it. I just have the same mentality that it's on to the next shot. That shot's over,"" Beal said. Devin Booker had 30 points and Eric Bledsoe scored 29 for Phoenix (4-11), which has lost five of six. Booker and Bledsoe scored 18 of the team's 21 points in the fourth quarter. The Wizards improved to 4-10. All four of their wins have come at home. BEST FOR LAST Wall, who also scored 34 points on Saturday, finished with 18 this time. He shot just 6 for 24 but converted a three-point play with 1:08 remaining to give Washington a 102-101 lead. Wall added a jumper with 38.1 seconds to go and two free throws with 21.2 seconds left. ""I think I just impacted the game other ways,"" he said. Wall had a season-high 15 assists and added three blocked shots. ON GUARD The Suns were impressed with Beal's performance. ""I didn't defend him, so I don't know what was so tough, but he played really determined tonight,"" coach Earl Watson said. Beal and Wall combined to score 23 of the Wizards' 31 fourth-quarter points. ""You need to shut them down, make somebody else do it, and we didn't do that today,"" Booker said. TIP-INS Suns: F T.J. Warren (illness) missed his second straight game. C Tyson Chandler (personal reasons) sat out for the third consecutive game. ... G Leandro Barbosa became the 11th player in franchise history to appear in 500 games. Wizards: Recalled F Danuel House Jr. from Delaware of the D-League. ... Brooks said C Ian Mahinmi, who has yet to play this season due to knee surgery, is progressing well. Brooks wasn't sure, however, when Mahinmi will be ready to play. ""I like what he did yesterday in practice. He really moved very well. Obviously, he's a little rusty and conditioning is going to be a factor early on,"" Brooks said. PORTER HURT Washington's Otto Porter left with about 7 minutes to play in the third quarter and did not return. Porter, who finished with nine points, was diagnosed with inflammation in his right hip. Brooks said Porter was day to day.","400899650"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  On the first day of workouts, new Memphis Grizzlies coach David Fizdale approached point guard Mike Conley and told him he wanted him to be more aggressive scoring the ball this season. That's all Conley needed to hear. The 10-year NBA veteran continued his high level of play Monday night, scoring 31 points as the Memphis Grizzlies got off to a fast start and defeated the Charlotte Hornets 105-90 for their fifth straight win. Conley came in averaging a career-high 18.3 points per game. He had five 3-pointers and shot 11 of 21 from the field, including a long 3 with 4 minutes left that thwarted Charlotte's fourth-quarter rally and sent the crowd streaming toward the exits. ""He wanted me to be much more aggressive,"" Conley said of Fizdale. ""I believe I'm one of the better point guards in the league and he does, too. He's given me the opportunity to go out there and show it."" Marc Gasol was dominant in the first half and finished with 13 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. The Grizzlies controlled the tempo from the start, jumping out to a 16-4 lead. They pushed their advantage to 24 at halftime, shooting 58 percent from the field, including 10 of 16 from 3-point range. ""It started with our defense,"" Fizdale said. ""Our guys are really taking pride in trying to build a championship defense. We all know the saying. They're really digging in and really taking it to heart that we have to get stops. We also said our defense will travel. And it traveled tonight and it led to being unselfish on the offensive end."" The Hornets simply had no early answer for Gasol, who controlled the game with his shooting and passing. Gasol had 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting in the first half along with seven assists and six rebounds. He repeatedly got Roy Hibbert off his feet with pump fakes near the top of the key, drove the lane and either scored or set up teammates with easy shots. ""We didn't have the readiness we need to play against a good team and they jumped on us,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""Frankly that is two games in a row that we didn't play like the same team that got to 8-3. That's part of learning and evolving into the team I think we can be. It's a long season and everyone is going to have nights like this."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Tony Allen was listed as questionable with a groin injury, but looked just fine and finished with 12 points on 5-of-9 shooting. Hornets: Cody Zeller missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Zeller is day to day but is still having trouble lifting his arm. ... Hornets owner Michael Jordan, who will receive the Presidential Medal of Honor on Tuesday, sat courtside. FRANK THE TANK HURT Frank Kaminsky turned in perhaps his best game as a pro for Charlotte, tying a career high with 23 points on 9-of-11 shooting. But his night ended badly when he left with less than 3 minutes to play with a sprained left ankle. Clifford said he wasn't sure the extent of the injury. STREAK IS OVER Kemba Walker had 17 points for the Hornets, snapping a string of 11 straight games with 20 or more. NEW ORLEANS HANGOVER Charlotte's Nic Batum and Marvin Williams were a combined 2 of 13 from the field, and the Hornets missed 11 of 31 free throws in losing their second straight game. Batum suggested the Hornets were still dwelling on coughing up a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter and losing to New Orleans last weekend. ""We had no energy,"" Batum said. ""We didn't get into this game. It might be a hangover from New Orleans because it was a tough one for us. I think we thought about that game too much tonight."" GRITTY GRIZZLIES Fizdale wasn't thrilled with his team's defense in the second half -- and he let the players know it. ""We got casual,"" Fizdale said. ""We got cool. I said, `Guys, we're from Memphis. There's nothing cool about us. We're gritty.' We couldn't lose that edge. They knew exactly what I meant and we got our bearings back.""","400899651"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Klay Thompson kept his shooting touch in sync Monday night. All he needed was a trip to his second home. The All-Star guard again dazzled Indiana Pacers fans with a knockout performance. He scored 25 points in 26 minutes and took the entire fourth quarter off, leading the Golden State Warriors to a 120-83 rout for their eighth consecutive victory. It was the worst home loss for Indiana in its NBA history. Breakout games at Bankers Life Fieldhouse are becoming the norm for Thompson. He scored 16 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and made a last-second shot to beat the division-leading Pacers 98-96 in March 2014. The next two times he came to town, Thompson scored 39 points in each game. This time, he went 10 of 18 from the field and 4 of 10 on 3-pointers. ""He's a professional shooter,"" teammate and two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry said. ""There's no two ways around it. It's the same process -- getting in the gym, getting shots up, never losing confidence and sticking with it."" Especially when Thompson plays in Indiana. Curry finished with 22 points. Kevin Durant, the 2013-14 MVP, had 14 points, 11 rebounds and six assists for the Warriors. Indiana (7-8) looked tired after earning its first road win Sunday night in overtime at Oklahoma City. The Pacers also played short-handed, with three-time All-Star Paul George, starting center Myles Turner and backup forward C.J. Miles all out with injuries. The difference showed in Indiana's most lopsided home defeat as an NBA franchise, breaking the previous mark set by the Los Angeles Clippers in a 102-68 rout. Rodney Stuckey led the Pacers with 21 points, Thaddeus Young had 14 and Indiana was never close after the first quarter. ""Tonight we just didn't have it,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""It seemed like our legs were gone and we basically couldn't keep up with them."" Golden State took control with an early 15-4 run, pulled away with a 13-4 spurt late in the second quarter and extended its 61-42 halftime lead to 100-71 after three. All the Warriors starters stayed on the bench in the fourth. THE HALFTIME SHOW After starting the game with four consecutive misses, Curry put on quite a show. He scored 12 in the first half and the rest of his points in the third quarter. But it was the 3-pointer that didn't count that drew the loudest roars from the crowd. A 70-footer dropped through the net as the buzzer sounded at the end of the first half. The shot prompted a replay review that showed the original call was correct -- the ball left Curry's hands after the horn. UNWELCOME WAGON A couple of Pacers fans provided a not-so-warm welcome to the Warriors -- with some help from Reggie Miller. As one person held a sign using an altered version of Miller's No. 31 jersey, which read ""Y'all blew a 3-1 lead (hash)Dudnation,"" the fan next to him gave the choke sign Miller popularized during one of the Pacers' memorable playoff series against the New York Knicks. TIP-INS Warriors: Finished 13 of 36 on 3-pointers, with six players making at least one. ... Golden State had 31 assists on 40 baskets. ... The Warriors grabbed a season-high 60 rebounds. ... Former Pacers forward David West drew a few boos when he made his first basket, early in the second quarter. Pacers: Point guard Jeff Teague left in the third with a sprained right ankle. McMillan said Teague could have played but the team opted to hold him out. ...

"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  James Harden has made a living at the free throw line in recent years. This time, his touch was off when it mattered most. Harden, who entered the game shooting 82 percent from the line, missed five free throws in the final 3 minutes against the Detroit Pistons. Fortunately for the Houston Rockets, they were able to hold on in a 99-96 victory Monday night. Harden finished with 28 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. He went 14 of 19 at the foul line, but only 4 of 9 in the fourth quarter. ""I had to laugh it off. It's funny,"" Harden said. ""But we all have games like this. I can't let it happen. I have to take my time, go up there concentrating on the free throw."" Clint Capela added 15 points and 12 rebounds for the Rockets, who won their third straight game. ""We did not play well all night. I didn't think we were sharp, but we found a way to win,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It's just a good win for everyone."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 26 points and Andre Drummond had 13 points and 16 rebounds for Detroit, which has lost four in a row. With the Rockets clinging to a one-point lead and less than 10 seconds left, Harden made a free throw and missed the second, leaving Houston up 98-96. Drummond rebounded the miss and was immediately fouled by Capela with 4.6 seconds to go. Drummond missed both free throws and the Pistons fouled Harden, who again made one of two, giving Detroit a chance. ""I've got to make free throws -- that's all,"" Harden said. ""Make free throws, win the game. It's pretty simple."" Caldwell-Pope missed a halfcourt heave at the buzzer, handing Detroit its second straight close loss at home. ""We're going to have to toughen up to be able to accomplish what we want to accomplish,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. Detroit led by 12 in the first quarter and took a 29-18 lead early in the second on Jon Leuer's dunk. The Rockets, however, chipped away and tied it 43-all on Capela's alley-oop dunk from Harden with 4:11 left in the period. The Pistons regained a two-point edge, but Harden scored the final seven points of the first half to put Houston ahead 51-46. Houston stretched its lead to 11 in the third quarter and settled for a 79-75 advantage heading into the final period. The Pistons used an 8-0 run early in the fourth quarter to open an 85-82 lead. The teams went back and forth the rest of the way, and neither led by more than four points. Detroit, trailing 96-95 with 55 seconds left, had a chance to take the lead, but Ish Smith missed a layup. Harden made one free throw to leave Houston ahead 97-95 with 15.4 seconds left, and Caldwell-Pope answered with a free throw to get Detroit within one. TIP-INS Rockets: Nene was assessed a Flagrant 1 foul in the third quarter after tripping Detroit's Aron Baynes. The play was originally called a common foul, but after review it was changed to the Flagrant 1. Detroit: Marcus Morris nailed a 33-foot 3-pointer over Harden's outstretched hand to beat the third-quarter buzzer and cut Houston's lead to 79-75. The play was reviewed and replays showed the ball left Morris' hands just in time. NO HOME COOKING After starting the season 5-0 at home, the Pistons lost their second straight at the Palace. They lost Saturday to Boston 94-92 on Al Horford's last-second shot. Detroit is just 1-7 on the road. ""It's tough, especially coming off (the Boston loss),"" said Morris, who finished with 13 points. ""We've got to find a way to play harder or just get rebounds."" OFF TARGET The Rockets were held under 100 points after surpassing the century mark in their previous seven games. Houston shot 44.9 percent from the field, including 32.3 percent from beyond the 3-point arc. ""We just have to continue to get better and continue to do good things down the stretch and win,"" Harden said. ""That's all that matters.""","400899653"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo's sixth career triple-double put him in elite company. Antetokounmpo had his first triple-double of the season to lead the Milwaukee Bucks over the Orlando Magic 93-89 on Monday night. ""It was a good one,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We got the win, so it feels great. It feels even better."" Milwaukee snapped a three-game losing streak as Antetokounmpo finished with 21 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, five steals and three blocks -- a line matched only by Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon. ""I think we all know he can fill up a stat sheet, but now the next thing is filling up a stat sheet in a way that leads to wins,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""Understanding that we ask a lot from him and expect a lot, but he's only 21 years old."" Jabari Parker also had 22 points and made five 3-pointers -- he began the night with a total of 10 -- for the Bucks, who beat Orlando at home for the eighth time in nine tries. The Magic were led by Serge Ibaka's 21 points, and Elfrid Payton added 18 but had five of Orlando's 24 turnovers. The team was averaging 13 turnovers per game but had 19 in the first half. ""We've done a great job with that all year,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""We're a good ball-security team, one of the best in the league. This team plays a unique defense where they're going to trap and rotate. They play differently than most teams. And we didn't handle it well."" The score was tied at 85 before Matthew Dellavedova sank a 3-pointer and Antetokounmpo added a dunk for a five-point lead with 2:38 remaining. Shortly after Antetokounmpo blocked a shot by Ibaka, Parker missed a desperate 3-point try as the shot clock was about to expire and was fouled by Ibaka. He made one free throw for a 91-87 lead with 17.9 seconds left. Parker then stole the ball from Ibaka and sailed in for another dunk and a 93-87 lead with 8.7 seconds to go. Orlando opened the game with a 16-2 run but trailed at halftime 49-44 after Parker's layup at the buzzer. The Magic led by five, however, at the end of the third quarter thanks to a 12-0 run to end the frame. Milwaukee opened the fourth by scoring 16 of the first 18 points and took its biggest lead, 85-76, on two free throws by Malcolm Brogdon with 7:52 to go. Orlando responded by scoring the next nine points to tie the score at 85 with 4:24 left. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando is 0-5 against Central Division opponents and all five games have been on the road. ... The Magic began the night 29th in the NBA in scoring with 92.5 points per game. Bucks: Michael Beasley scored 10 points in the first quarter -- he entered the game averaging 8.0 points per game. ...

Isaiah Thomas scored 29 points and Boston rallied from 13 points down in the fourth quarter to beat the Timberwolves 99-93 on Monday night. Al Horford added 20 points, six rebounds and five assists for the Celtics, who trailed 81-68 after three. Boston opened the fourth on a 17-0 run to take the lead and held on down the stretch for its second straight win. ""I think give us credit for playing a little harder than them and making them think a little more and getting them uncomfortable,"" Thomas said. Karl-Anthony Towns had 27 points and 18 rebounds for the Timberwolves. Gorgui Dieng added 20 points and 10 rebounds, but Andrew Wiggins was just 5 for 18 and Minnesota scored three points in the first 9 minutes of the fourth. ""We laid a damn egg,"" said Zach LaVine, who was 4 of 12 from the field and 0 for 7 on 3-pointers. Terry Rozier added a career-high 12 points off the bench and keyed the Celtics' surge in the first 6 minutes of the fourth. The Timberwolves have normally reserved their meltdowns this season for the third quarter, when they have the NBA's worst point differential. But they won that period 29-26 on Monday night, just the second time this season they have outscored their opponent in the third. Jonas Jerebko and Rozier opened the fourth with 3-pointers, and Rozier added another long ball and a steal and dunk to push the Celtics in front. Towns was the only player who scored for the Wolves in the first 11 minutes of the fourth quarter, converting a three-point play with 5:18 to go for their first bucket and hitting a 3-pointer with 2:38 remaining. Boston outscored Minnesota 31-12 in the fourth as the Timberwolves shot 5 for 25. ""They were definitely pressing,"" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. ""Guys were into guys, we were making everything hard. You could definitely tell they were pressing to find a great shot."" The Wolves outscored Boston 58-34 in the paint and outrebounded the Celtics 51-39, including 16-6 on the offensive glass. But Minnesota missed eight free throws. ""I think we have to play tougher with a lead,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""And the big thing for us is to improve and learn."" TIP-INS Celtics: Horford also had three blocks and reached 20 points for the first time with the Celtics. ... Boston was issued a rare delay of game warning coming out of a timeout late in the third quarter. ... Jerebko was a plus-20 in under 19 minutes. Timberwolves: Minnesota entered the game leading the NBA in 3-point shooting, but was 4 for 24. ... Towns has blocked a shot in 20 straight games. ... F Brandon Rush was active after missing the previous seven games with a sore big toe on his right foot. He played 2 minutes in the fourth quarter. TEMPERS FLARE One of the biggest guys on the court and the smallest got into it in the third quarter when the 6-foot-11, 240-pound Dieng leveled the 5-9, 185-pound Thomas with a screen. Dieng was called for an offensive foul because he was moving while he set the screen, and Thomas took exception. The All-Star guard got up and shoved Dieng, and the two exchanged words while being separated by teammates. ""It was the heat of the battle,"" Thomas said. ""We talked about it after, and he loves my game, I love his, so we're good."" CROWDER AILING Jae Crowder missed eight games with a sprained left ankle before returning on Saturday against Detroit. He made life difficult on Wiggins, who was 0 for 5 from 3-point range. But Crowder had to leave the game in the third quarter because of soreness in that left ankle and did not return. ""Hopefully he'll be OK,"" Stevens said.","400899655"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle found plenty of positives in his team's performance against San Antonio. His counterpart, Gregg Popovich, could not stomach the Spurs' ""awful"" and ""pathetic"" play. Oh, by the way, San Antonio won. Kawhi Leonard had 24 points and nine rebounds, and the Spurs escaped with a 96-91 victory over the struggling Mavericks on Monday night for their sixth straight win. Dallas (2-11) is off to its worst start since 1993-1994, when the Mavericks opened 1-23 in a 13-win season. But they put a scare in San Antonio, which had to keep Leonard on the floor for much of the fourth quarter. ""This was a pathetic performance on the part of the Spurs,"" Popovich said in a 30-second postgame interview. ""You know, they had some guys out, we had some guys out, but they had a lot more out than we did. I thought we showed a lack of humility, a lack of respect for the opponent, a very pathetic performance at both ends of the court. It was an awful performance. Oh, and they deserved to win the basketball game, I forgot to say that."" Dallas almost did. With the Mavericks trailing 92-91, Harrison Barnes missed a step-back 17-footer with 15 seconds left that Manu Ginobili rebounded before being fouled. Ginobili hit a pair of free throws to extend the lead to three, and Seth Curry missed a 3-pointer with 6 seconds remaining. Curry matched a career high with 23 points, shooting 5 for 10 on 3s. Barnes and Wesley Matthews each had 20 points in the Mavericks' sixth consecutive loss. ""It's tough, but the guys were fighting their (rear ends) off and there's a lot of positives,"" Carlisle said. ""We've got to build on positives."" San Antonio has won six straight against Dallas and 12 in a row at home. The once-heated rivalry between the Texas teams has cooled considerably with the Spurs' sustained success and the Mavericks' injuries and free-agent troubles. Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki and starting point guard Deron Williams both missed the game with injuries. San Antonio starters LaMarcus Aldridge and Tony Parker were in uniform but neither played as Popovich opted to rest his veterans. Spurs rookies Dejounte Murray and Davis Bertans made their first starts in place of Parker and Aldridge, respectively, and fellow rookie Bryn Forbes also saw extended playing time early. Barnes took advantage of the inexperience, making all but one of his six attempts in scoring 10 points in the opening quarter. Dallas shot 8 for 27 on 3s. ""I think we really did an awful lot of good things,"" Carlisle said. ""There's going to be missed shots, but it was one of our better shooting nights this season so far, so that's a positive."" The Spurs enjoyed greater success when their veterans took the court. ""We let ourselves down in terms of bringing the energy and effort that we usually are pretty solid at,"" said Spurs reserve Patty Mills, who had 17 points. ""I don't think we were consistent throughout tonight. We win them together and we lose them together. We get better together."" Leonard drove the lane and dropped a bounce pass between Dwight Powell and Dorian Finney-Smith that David Lee dunked ahead of a foul by Salah Mejri to pare the lead to 63-62. After Ginobili missed a 3-pointer, Lee tipped out the rebound to Mills for a 3 that gave San Antonio a 68-65 lead. Dallas had eight turnovers in the fourth quarter, which resulted in 12 points for San Antonio. Pau Gasol added 16 points and eight rebounds for the Spurs. TIP-INS Mavericks: Nowitzki (strained right Achilles), Williams (strained left calf) and G Jose Juan Barrera (strained left calf) did not travel with the team. ... The last undrafted player to score 26 points in his first or second game prior to the Mavericks' Jonathan Gibson doing so Saturday in Orlando was Spurs guard and New York playground legend Lloyd Daniels. He had 26 points on Nov. 7, 1992, at Denver. Both players hit the mark in their second game. ... Curry also had 23 points Nov. 8 in a 109-97 victory at the Los Angeles Lakers. Spurs: Leonard has scored in double figures in 48 straight games, the longest streak of his career. He is 95 for 100 on free throws this season. ... Gasol has played 37,565 career minutes, moving him past Clyde Drexler (37,537) for 49th in NBA history. ... G Nico Laprovittola missed the game with what Popovich described as a ""tooth-extraction thingy."" ... The Spurs have established the longest home winning streak in series history. Dallas won 11 straight matchups at home from 1986-89. WINNING WAYS Popovich became the second-fastest coach to 1,100 career wins, doing so in 1,588 games. Phil Jackson collected his 1,100th victory in 1,560 games with the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. Popovich is the seventh coach in NBA history with 1,100 wins. INJURIES MOUNT Mavericks players have missed 31 games due to injury this season. Devin Harris (12), Nowitzki (nine) and Williams (six) have all missed at least a half dozen. Barnes said Dallas doesn't believe a return to health will cure all that ails the team on the court. ""We just have to stay vigilant and just continue to keep fighting the way we do,"" Barnes said. ""We just can't assume once we get Player X, Player Y, Player Z, the wins will start falling in place. We've just got to keep plugging away.""","400899656"
"LOS ANGELES --  The streaking Clippers are playing with purpose. Even after handling a quality opponent, they hardly sounded satisfied. Chris Paul had 26 points and 12 assists, Blake Griffin also scored 26 and Los Angeles beat the Toronto Raptors 123-115 on Monday night in a matchup of early-season division leaders. ""We got stops early in the beginning of the second half and got in transition and got buckets,"" Griffin said. ""We haven't been as good in the last three games in my opinion, but it's still great to start out like this."" DeAndre Jordan added 17 points and 15 rebounds for the Clippers, who improved the NBA's best record to 13-2 with their 10th victory in 11 games. J.J. Redick scored 20 points as Los Angeles snapped a four-game losing streak to Toronto. Jamal Crawford had 12 and Luc Mbah a Moute chipped in with 10. ""We still have to be better. There was a lot of turnovers, fouls, and we gave up easy buckets for Toronto down the stretch,"" Paul said. The Clippers led by 17 in the second half but the Raptors cut the margin to 119-115 on a 3-pointer by Kyle Lowry with less than a minute to play. Redick made four free throws down the stretch to seal it. ""We scrapped and fought and didn't lay down even after what happened to us last night,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said, referring to a close loss at Sacramento that ended with a disputed call. ""We got enough offense but until we improve on defense and get stops, we aren't going anywhere. It seems like every game we play lately is an offensive slugfest."" Lowry led Toronto with 27 points and DeMar DeRozan, averaging 31.4 per game, added 25. Jonas Valanciunas scored 15 for the Raptors. The Clippers outrebounded Toronto 42-32. ""Blake is doing everything for us. The fact that he can bring the ball up and make decisions gives us another dimension offensively,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. It was the second time this season Toronto (8-6) dropped both ends of back-to-back games. The Raptors, who played for the fifth time in seven nights, have lost four of five. The teams traded 10-0 runs late in the second quarter. Redick's three free throws with less than a second remaining gave the Clippers a 54-45 lead at halftime. TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry, DeRozan and Jordan were teammates on the 2016 USA Olympic Men's Basketball team that won the gold medal in Rio. Clippers: Entering the game, Los Angeles led the NBA with a plus-13.7 points per game differential over its opponents and was second in the league in scoring defense, giving up 95.4 points per game. ... F Wesley Johnson returned after missing the previous five games with an injured left heel. He played 12 minutes and had three rebounds. ... Jordan shot 9 of 14 on free throws and has made 1,007 in his career. CAMEROON CONNECTION Mbah a Moute and Raptors F Pascal Siakam are two of the three active NBA players from Cameroon. The game marked the first time in league history two players from Cameroon faced each other. CONTROVERSIAL CALL At the end of Sunday night's Toronto-Sacramento game, Terrence Ross' 3-pointer at the buzzer off an inbounds play would have sent the game to overtime, but after a replay review the basket was disallowed and the Raptors lost 102-99. The play was ruled a clock malfunction because the inbounds pass was deflected, and officials said the clock should have started once the ball was touched. ""I thought it was unfair. I think the game is human error. I don't think you should be able to go over and look at the clock and do that,"" Rivers said. ""I thought it was awful. I really do. I know they, meaning the league, came back and said it was the right call, but I still disagree. If they reviewed every play, our games would take 16 hours."" Casey wasn't seeking any sympathy. ""Sometimes bad things happen in life to you. It's how you bounce back after a game like that that counts. There are 29 other teams that don't feel sorry for us,"" he said. UNMATCHED PRODUCTION Paul is the only NBA player since 1983-84 with 120 assists, 42 steals and only 28 turnovers in the first 14 games of a season.","400899657"
"NEW YORK --  Derrick Rose had a red-hot Kristaps Porzingis and an ice-cold Carmelo Anthony, and he chose neither. Down the stretch, Rose called his own number. Rose made the go-ahead basket with 3:15 remaining and hit the jumper that clinched it with 6.8 seconds left as the New York Knicks beat the Portland Trail Blazers 107-103 on Tuesday night. ""I'm not here to bust or brag but I'm used to being in positions where I have the ball in my hand, playing in Chicago,"" Rose said. ""I've really played like that my entire life, through grammar school, high school, college and here."" Porzingis had 31 points and nine rebounds and Rose scored six of his 18 points down the stretch. Brandon Jennings had 11 assists off the bench as the Knicks won their fifth straight at home. ""That's why we came here,"" Jennings said. ""We came here to win."" Anthony finished with 17 points after going scoreless in the fourth quarter and shooting 2 for 12 in the second half, but tipped out the rebound of Rose's miss with about 30 seconds left, allowing the Knicks to keep possession before Rose's jumper that clinched it. ""There's other ways to impact the game if your shots not falling and he did it another way and that was defense and rebounding,"" guard Courtney Lee said. Damian Lillard scored 22 points for the Trail Blazers but fell to 4-1 at Madison Square Garden. CJ McCollum added 16 points. The Blazers were trying for a New York sweep, having routed the Brooklyn Nets 129-109 on Sunday. They managed just a pair of free throws from Lillard after taking a three-point lead with 3:58 to play. ""We've got to go out there and get after it. We've got to play hard, understand who they are and what they're capable of,"" Lillard said. ""At the end of the day it's the NBA, anybody can be beat."" Rose made consecutive baskets, with his reverse layup giving the Knicks a 102-101 lead. It appeared he was going to lose possession on their next trip, but the ball came out to Mindaugas Kuzminskas for a 3-pointer that made it 105-101 with 2:37 to play. Lillard's free throws cut it to two with 1:22 left, but the Blazers turned it over, then couldn't grab the rebound after a Knicks miss. Rose hit a jumper as the shot clock was winding down to put away the victory. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland had won four straight at MSG, with its last loss in March 2012, a few months before drafting Lillard. ... Coach Terry Stotts remained with 190 wins, tied with Mike Dunleavy for fourth on Portland's career coaching list. Knicks: The Knicks played without starting center Joakim Noah (illness) for the second straight game. ... Jennings cramped up and didn't play in the fourth quarter. ... New York won for just the second time in the last nine meetings. NEW YORK, NEW YORK Stotts, on the Blazers' lengthy stay in New York, where they arrived Saturday for their two-game stint: ""It's actually nice not to have to travel for that extra game. It makes the road trip a little more tolerable, but to be able to stay in New York four days is pretty nice,"" he said. SIBLING RIVALRY Knicks backup center Marshall Plumlee didn't get into the game to play against his older brother Mason, the Blazers' starting center. Marshall Plumlee made his NBA debut on Sunday, a day after Mason surprised him by showing up to watch him play for the Westchester Knicks of the NBA Development League.","400899658"
"ATLANTA --  New Orleans overpowered the Atlanta Hawks in the first quarter and kept piling on. The outcome was never in doubt. ""We just came out hungry,"" Tim Frazier said. ""We jumped on them from the start. We continued to fight the whole game and we have to credit everyone who stepped on the court."" Frazier had 21 points and 14 assists, Terrence Jones added 17 points and the New Orleans Pelicans won their third straight game with a 112-94 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night. Pelicans forward Anthony Davis returned to begin the fourth quarter after bruising his right knee and missing the second and third periods. Davis, a three-time All-Star and the NBA's leading scorer, finished with 13 points. New Orleans led by 20 at the end of the first quarter and never let up. Dennis Schroder and Kyle Korver each scored 14 for the Hawks, who have lost three in a row. Atlanta was tied for the Eastern Conference lead last week but now begins a five-game road trip playing its worst basketball of the young season. ""I think it will be great for us,"" center Dwight Howard said. ""These early tests are only going to make us stronger."" The Pelicans have won five of seven and are 3-0 since Jrue Holiday returned after missing the first 12 games to be with his sick wife. Holiday had 15 points, four rebounds and four assists in 27 minutes. X-rays were negative on Davis, who banged his leg against a chair while chasing the ball out of bounds. He lunged into the fourth row of chairs near the Atlanta bench and came up limping. Davis walked slowly off the floor and into the locker room, but seemed to move with ease while playing 9 minutes of the fourth. ""We've just got to do the little things, diving on the floor -- obviously not into the stands -- but rebound the basketball, boxing out and all the little things that matter that probably a lot of the teams overlook,"" Davis said. ""When you do the little things, it will take care of everything else."" Since beating Milwaukee on Nov. 16, the Hawks lost Friday at Charlotte when Howard was ejected for a flagrant foul in the fourth quarter and Sunday at New York when Schroder had his worst game in his first season as the starting point guard. There was nothing marginal about this loss. New Orleans led by 34-14 after the first quarter and went up by 30 twice in the second. Jones' hook shot made it 51-21 at the 8:09 mark and the Pelicans had a 22-point lead at halftime. They were up by 35 midway through the third on Frazier's 3-pointer and began the fourth with a 24-point lead. ""Every time it got a little closer they made a big shot or got a stop,"" Hawks forward Kent Bazemore said after scoring one point in 18 minutes. ""They kept us at arm's length tonight."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Jones was sick earlier in the day and didn't know how much he'd be able to play, but he made his first five shots and had no turnovers in 28 minutes.

"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets defense was absent for most of the night. They got a stop with the game on the line and sent Chicago to another loss in Colorado. Rookie Jamal Murray scored a season-high 24 points, Will Barton hit two free throws with 9.5 seconds left and the Nuggets beat the Bulls 110-107 on Tuesday night. It was Denver's 10th straight home win over the Bulls and its 16th in the last 17 meetings at Pepsi Center. The Nuggets survived a 35-point, eight-rebound night from Jimmy Butler to keep Chicago winless in Denver since Feb. 8, 2006. Dwyane Wade had 22 points after sitting out Sunday's game against the Lakers. Butler insisted the streak wasn't weighing on the team's mind. ""It's a basketball court with two rims, two backboards and a ball,"" he said. ""At the end of the day put the ball in the basket, do everything you can do in every other city and win the game."" Chicago had a chance to end the streak but with the game tied Barton was fouled by Wade on a drive to the basket, and he hit two free throws left to give Denver a 109-107 lead. ""We are going to put the ball in Will Barton's hands, let him attack downhill,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""If he draws a crowd, let him get the ball to Murray, who had been shooting the ball light's out, on the back side to make a shot."" The Bulls called timeout and Fred Hoiberg drew up a play for Butler, but Denver shut it down. ""Kenneth Faried was standing in the paint so I didn't have nowhere to go,"" Butler said. Wade got the ball to Isaiah Cannon, coming around the defense but shot an airball on a 3-point attempt and the Nuggets got the ball. ""We got a shot from a very good 3-point shooter. We're fine with it,"" Wade said. ""We had a chance to come in and get one and we didn't."" The Bulls were in control early but the Nuggets used a 22-0 run at the start of the second quarter to take a 41-31 lead. Murray had 15 of his 17 first half points in the period and Wilson Chandler scored 12 of his 16 in the second quarter. ""It just takes one shot to have confidence,"" Murray said. ""It doesn't take me long to get hot. I think every shot is going in. If I miss I don't worry about it."" TIP-INS Bulls: Butler was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week after averaging 27.3 points, 9.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists in four games. He scored a season-high 40 Sunday. ... Michael Carter-Williams is still out with a left knee bone bruise and left wrist sprain. ... Doug McDermott (concussion protocol) missed his fifth game. Nuggets: Mike Miller is away from the team for family reasons. He is expected to rejoin the team later in the week. ALWAYS THE BRIDESMAID The Nuggets courted Wade as a free agent this summer but he ultimately chose his hometown Bulls. He came away impressed with his meeting with Denver. ""Those guys, I was sold on them,"" Wade said. ""They made it a lot tougher than people think."" Even though he didn't sign with the Nuggets, they felt good about the process. ""To have a chance to sit down with a first-ballot Hall of Famer who was giving us serious considerations showed our fans of the positive vibes about this team, around the NBA,"" Malone said. RESERVE CLAUSE The Nuggets' bench scored 39 of their 41 points in the second quarter and outscored the Bulls reserves 61-13 for the game. Three of Denver's double-digit scorers came off the bench. ""Our bench was phenomenal tonight,"" Malone said.","400899660"
"LOS ANGELES --  Nick Young's thievery prevented Russell Westbrook from pulling an even bigger heist during the Los Angeles Lakers' latest win. Young hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 5 seconds to play, and the Lakers blew a 14-point lead in the final minutes before snatching a 111-109 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night. With the dramatic flair and boundless confidence that have characterized his entire unique career, Young improvised one of his biggest moments in a Lakers uniform. ""The play was designed to ... someone else,"" Young said with a sheepish grin. ""Yeah, I think they should have given me a steal for that."" Lou Williams had just come free on the perimeter and set up to catch Brandon Ingram's pass so he could take the Lakers' final shot, but Young slipped in front of him, swiped the ball and drained a 3-pointer in one fluid move. ""I told him, `If you're going to steal a pass, you better make the shot,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""It was a pretty incredible shot by him. Obviously one of the reasons we like Nick on the court at the end of the game is because he is not afraid of the moment. He loves the moment."" Young finished with 17 points and Jordan Clarkson had 18 as the Lakers (8-7) somehow withstood a monster performance by Westbrook, who scored 17 of his 34 points in a 5-minute span of the fourth quarter to trim the Lakers' big lead to one point. Steven Adams scored on a go-ahead putback of Westbrook's miss with 13.9 seconds to play to put Oklahoma City up 109-108, setting the stage for Williams to get upstaged. ""If he missed the shot, the narrative would have been different,"" said a smiling Williams, who had 13 points. ""He's never serious, but he made a big shot, apologized, and we're going to move on."" BIG RUSS While taking over the NBA's scoring lead with his sixth consecutive 30-point game, Westbrook also had 13 assists and eight rebounds. He barely missed the sixth triple-double of his amazing season, but he also missed five of his final six shots while attempting to drag the Thunder to another win. Westbrook missed a long shot right before the buzzer, and the Los Angeles native sat motionless at his locker for a long time after the game. ""We get down by 14 points, and we get two quick scores and cut it to 10 and all of a sudden he goes crazy and gives us a chance to win the game,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""We were a little bit dead there, and his 3s gave us a chance."" Adams had 20 points, including two baskets in the final minute, for the Thunder, who have lost six of eight. TEAMWORK Timofey Mozgov scored 16 points for the Lakers, who ended a two-game skid with their seventh win in 11 games overall. Jose Calderon hit four 3-pointers and scored a season-high 12 points while filling in for D'Angelo Russell, who will miss at least two games to rest his sore knee. D-LO SIDELINED Russell sat out for the second time in three games to rest his knee, which prevents him from playing at full speed. He won't play Wednesday, and the Lakers aren't sure whether he'll return Friday or Sunday or later. Calderon has played sparingly in his first season with Los Angeles, but the Spanish guard excelled in this spot start. TIP-INS Thunder: G Semaj Christon missed his second straight game with a concussion. ... Westbrook committed a flagrant-1 foul in the second quarter, hitting Luol Deng around the head and neck. The veterans exchanged words and had to be separated. Lakers: Young also hit a long 3 at the halftime buzzer. ...

"PHILADELPHIA --  The Grizzlies proved again they can win close games. It didn't hurt that they didn't have to face Joel Embiid in the second overtime. Marc Gasol scored 27 points, Mike Conley had 25 and the Grizzlies beat the Philadelphia 76ers 104-99 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight victory. Conley added nine rebounds and nine assists for the Grizzlies, who came back from an 11-point, second-half deficit for their eighth consecutive win against Philadelphia. ""Most of the games we play are close, so we're used to it,"" Gasol said. ""We feel very comfortable in those situations."" Ersan Ilyasova had 22 points and 12 rebounds for Philadelphia, which was looking for its first three-game winning streak in nearly three years. The 76ers had their four-game home winning streak snapped. Embiid had 12 points and 11 rebounds but didn't play in the second overtime. The rookie center is on a minutes restriction after missing the last two seasons with a foot injury. He finished with 27 minutes. ""There's a human side to all of this,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""There it is 10 feet from you. It's tempting but not wise. That's the discipline we have to have."" Embiid lobbied to enter in the second overtime but was denied. ""It was frustrating but those guys care about me and are looking out for me,"" he said. Asked if he was looking forward to having free rein with his minutes, Embiid said, ""I can't wait for that day to come."" Zach Randolph scored the first four points of the second overtime to give Memphis a 95-91 lead. Philadelphia cut it to 99-98 after Jerryd Bayless' layup with 23 seconds remaining. Conley's two free throws pushed Memphis' lead back to three and Philadelphia never got closer. ""When you get to April, these are the games you look back on,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""You preach to your team they have another level to go to. It becomes habit."" The teams were a combined 1 for 11 from the field in the first OT before Randolph put Memphis ahead 91-88 with 49 seconds left when he converted over Embiid on a drive. Bayless tied it with a 3 from the top of the key with 43 seconds left before Conley's turnover gave Philadelphia the ball back. Bayless misfired on a midrange shot that would've won it, and Embiid couldn't convert on a baseline jumper after an inbounds play with 1.3 seconds left. Embiid had the final shot of regulation, but his over-the-head try against the defense of Gasol went off the backboard. ""I don't know if I'm going to get fined for this but I thought I got fouled,"" Embiid said. RESPECT GIVEN The Grizzlies lauded the play of Embiid and the 76ers, who don't resemble the sad-sack bunch that won 47 games combined the previous three seasons. ""You know you're going to have a tough night, no matter what, because they don't stop playing until that final whistle,"" Conley said. ""They scrap and claw for every little bit. We're thankful to get away with a win tonight."" Of Embiid, Fizdale said, ""The whole league will have to deal with him a long time. He's a special, special talent.""

After losing just one game at home last season, the Spurs have started this season 8-0 on the road after a 119-114 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night. Kawhi Leonard scored 30 points, LaMarcus Aldridge added 23 points and seven rebounds, and Danny Green had 16 points as the Spurs won their seventh straight game overall. Hornets coach Steve Clifford has a pretty good idea why the Spurs have been so tough to beat on the road. ""They have a guy who is an MVP candidate (in Leonard), Pau Gasol and Tony Parker who are probably Hall-of-Famers, Aldridge, who is a perennial All-Star and Danny Green who has been a starter on two championship teams. Plus they have a guy who is maybe the best coach of our time -- except for all that they're just OK,"" Clifford said. In other words, as Clifford added, the Spurs have ""a pretty good recipe for success."" San Antonio's win didn't come without a fight, though. The teams entered the fourth quarter tied at 84 in a tightly contested game that included 28 lead changes in the first three quarters. Aldridge gave the Spurs the lead for good with 2:53 left on a pair of free throws. Green knocked down two crucial 3-point shots in the closing minutes and Parker made four free throws in the final 10.2 seconds to seal the win. ""It's a weird year,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""We've lost three in a row at home and last year we lost one the whole year. Now we're undefeated on the road, so don't ask me. That's why they call it a game because you never know what's going to happen."" Added Green: ""The losing (at home) has helped us on the road. For some odd reason, I think we just have more focus on the road. We're coming together as a group and trusting each other."" TIP-INS Spurs: Aldridge has scored in double digits in all 15 games this season. ... Leonard came into the game with the top spot in NBA history for best winning percentage in his first 300 starts (235-65). Hornets: Jeremy Lamb was active after missing the last 10 games with a hamstring injury. He played only six minutes. ... Cody Zeller missed his third straight game with a shoulder injury, but coach Steve Clifford said there is a chance he could return to action this week. WALKER JUST `NOT EVEN FAIR' Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 26 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Frank Kaminsky had 13 points and eight rebounds off the bench. ""Kemba's really fast. It's not even fair,"" Popovich said. FOUL SHOOTING It may not garner much attention, but the Spurs are winning games with their foul shooting. They came into the league first in the NBA in free throw shooting percentage and made 18 of 20 against the Hornets, including the four clutch shots by Parker in the closing seconds to put the game away. JORDAN HONORED Hornets owner Michael Jordan tipped his cap to the crowd after the scoreboard showed a highlight of the former NBA star receiving the Presidential Medal of Honor from Barack Obama on Tuesday in Washington. GOOD INTENSITY Despite his team's third straight loss, Clifford was happy with his team's overall intensity. ""I just felt like we're back to playing with a normal intensity level that you're going to have to play at to play well,"" Clifford said. ""That can't be something that comes and goes so much. I feel like until these last two games we have been playing with good energy, good focus.""","400899663"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Phoenix Suns coach Earl Watson views his team as young and still a work in progress. The Suns, however, seemed to take a critical step on the defensive end Wednesday night in a 92-87 victory over Orlando that concluded an otherwise disappointing road trip. With Devin Booker, Eric Bledsoe and Alex Len leading the way, Phoenix limited the Magic to just 36 percent shooting from the field and only 28 percent shooting from 3-point range. Our defensive presence was on point tonight,"" said Watson, whose team snapped a two-game losing streak and finished the six-game trip 2-4. ""We got two wins, we could have gotten more. We're not content with anything. ""We're a young team, we're working, we're headed in the right direction. That was a total team effort tonight."" Len had 17 points and 12 rebounds to go along with two blocked shots in the paint. Bledsoe had 16 points as all five starters finished in double figures -- and P.J. Tucker came off the bench to put 10 points. The victory didn't salvage the road trip but it certainly allowed the Suns to feel like they have momentum as they head home. ""This was a must-win for us,"" Bledsoe said. ""We came up short in Washington and Philly. This one we had to cap off before heading back home."" The most impressive part stepping up on defense, where Phoenix (5-11) has been among the NBA's worst. But Wednesday night they had solid help defense and gave Orlando's shooters few open shots. Evan Fournier led the Magic (6-9) with 25 points and Nikola Vucevic added 21 points, but none of the other starters hit double figures. Jeff Green went 0 for 7 from the field and Serge Ibaka was just 2 for 5 from the field and finished with only five points. ""I'm very pleased with how unselfish we were,"" Watson said. ""They played selfless and it showed on the defensive end."" For the Magic it was another frustrating night shooting the ball. With Green now in the starting lineup in place of Aaron Gordon, the only consistent scoring off the bench has come from D.J. Augustin, who had 12 points Wednesday. ""We just had a number of guys have bad nights,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. TIP-INS Suns: Forward T.J. Warren missed his second straight game with what coach Earl Watson described as a head injury. ... Chandler is still missing from the team after the death of his mother. ...The Suns will now play their next three games at home. They don't hit the road again until Dec. 3 when they face Golden State. Magic: Coming into Wednesday night's game, the Magic had held their previous six opponents to a combined 92.3 points per game and 41 percent shooting from the field. .. .With the addition of center Bismack Biyombo this season, the Magic are averaging 5.57 blocks, which ranks sixth in the NBA. DOMINATING THE PAINT Len had a particularly strong performance for the Suns in the paint. He was 6-for-10 from the field, hit 5 of 6 free throws and four of his 12 rebounds came on the offensive end. ""He's amazing,"" Watson said. ""He's growing every game. We absolutely love him."" MISSING THE POINT For second straight game, Magic point guard Elfrid Payton was sitting on the bench for much of the critical fourth quarter while Augustin played the bulk of the minutes. Payton logged just 4:30 minutes in the final quarter. ""We needed some shooting out there, so I left D.J. in there longer than usual,"" Vogel said.","400899664"
"CLEVELAND -- Kevin Love didn't think anything unusual was going on Wednesday night. The scoreboard told a different story. Love scored 40 points, including an NBA-record 34 in the first quarter, and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Portland Trail Blazers 137-125. Love fell three points shy of the league record for points in any quarter, set by Golden State's Klay Thompson, who scored 37 in the third on Jan. 23, 2015. As his point total grew on every possession and the Quicken Loans Arena crowd was on its feet each time shot the ball, Love just went about his business. ""I'm not trying to be nonchalant about it, but sometimes when you're in it you don't necessarily feel it,"" he said. ""There was nothing out of the ordinary as far as our play-calling and our flow of the game. I just felt like guys were finding me."" LeBron James recorded his 44th career triple-double with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists, but thought Love owned the night. ""Obviously we had a huge hot hand,"" James said. ""That was lightning. We just kept giving him the ball and he kept knocking them down."" Cleveland also set a franchise record with 20 3-pointers and showed no signs of being rusty in its first game since Friday. Love, who set a team record for points in a period, made 11 of 14 field goal attempts, including 8 of 10 on 3-pointers in the first quarter. He made his first six shots with five 3-pointers. Love didn't realize he was closing in on Thompson's milestone. ""I didn't know that was the record,"" he said. ""I wasn't really aware of it."" Damian Lillard scored 40 points for Portland, including 25 in the second half. ""LeBron James coming downhill is a handful by himself, then you have K-Love on the opposite side -- and somehow, he got lost -- and he ended up getting a wide-open shot,"" Lillard said. ""You can't have that."" James had his second triple-double this season. He also passed Guy Rodgers for 17th place on the career assist list. Cleveland, which made its first nine 3-pointers, led 46-31 after one quarter and scored 81 points in the first half, two short of the franchise record. Love was 1 for 6 and scored six points the rest of the game, all in the third quarter. He made 12 of 20 shots, including 8 of 12 3-pointers. ""To get 34 points on this team, it says a lot,"" said Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue. ""The thing I liked the most was when he got going, our guys really looked for him."" Love recorded his first 40-point game since April 14, 2014, with Minnesota. He scored a career-high 51 points while playing for the Timberwolves on March 23, 2012. STAR-STUDDED CROWD Indians manager Terry Francona, voted the American League Manager of the Year last week, and Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown were in attendance. Entertainer Wayne Newton was also at the game and congratulated Love as he came off the court. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland finished 1-4 on a five-game road trip. ... F Al-Farouq Aminu (left calf strain) missed his ninth straight game. Coach Terry Stotts said there is no update on his status. .... Stotts has 190 victories with Portland, tying him with Mike Dunleavy for fourth place in team history. Cavaliers: Love's highest-scoring game with Cleveland was 34, which came on Nov. 23, 2015, against Orlando. ...Cleveland's record for points in a half is 83, set on Jan. 15, 1993. ... Tristan Thompson and Portland's Maurice Harkless received double technical fouls after getting tied up under the basket in the second quarter.","400899665"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  If the opening tip-off was any indication as to how the game would go, it was clear the Indiana Pacers didn't have anything for Dwight Howard and the Atlanta Hawks. As the referee tossed the ball between Myles Turner and Howard, Turner opted against jumping, conceding the tip-off to Howard and the Hawks. It was indicative of how the rest of the game would play out Wednesday night. ""The effort and energy (tonight) started with me and I have to make sure that every night I bring the same effort and energy,"" Howard said. ""When I'm able to get in there and crash the boards, just get a feel for the game, it makes everything easier."" Howard had 23 points and 20 rebounds to help the Hawks beat the Pacers 96-85. Paul Millsap added 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Hawks. ""I thought (Dwight) came out with a mindset from the beginning of the game,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It felt like he was getting every rebound, going to the offensive board and getting put backs. He had something to say before the game to the team. I think starting the right way was important and I think he did it with his actions, he did it with his play,"" Indiana rallied to cut Atlanta's lead to a point with 3:42 left in the third quarter, but the Hawks pulled away with a 19-2 run. The Pacers failed to make a basket in the first 4 minutes of the fourth quarter. Budenholzer noted it was Atlanta's finish to the third quarter, extending its lead to eight points, that was ultimately what gave the Hawks enough to keep the Pacers at a distance. Thaddeus Young led the Pacers with 24 points and had seven rebounds. Monta Ellis added 19 points, and Paul George had 18. The Hawks outrebounded Indiana 56 to 37, and outscored the Pacers 48 to 34 in the paint, and 19 to 11 in second chance points. Indiana had just seven offensive rebounds. ""We just didn't squash down on Howard. I think he had nine offensive rebounds and that's huge when playing a team like the Hawks. You can't let them get offensive rebounds and extra possessions,"" Young said. AN IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY: The Pacers are third in the NBA in turnovers created, forcing their opponents into 16.2 mistakes per game, ranking fourth with an average of 9.2 steals per game. On Wednesday night, the Hawks turned the ball over 21 times, and of those 15 were the result of an Indiana steal. LOCKED UP: The Hawks are second in the NBA in fourth quarter defense, allowing opponents 21.8 points per game in the fourth quarter. On Wednesday night, the Hawks held Indiana to 19 points. It was the eighth time this season Atlanta has held it opponent to fewer than 20 points in the fourth quarter. The Hawks are 6-2 when achieving this milestone. TIP INS: Indiana: Jeff Teague has scored in double figures in each of the last nine games. ... Young's 24-point effort was just the second time this season he has scored 20 points or more. Atlanta: The victory was the Hawks' 100th over Indiana ... The Hawks have held at least a 10-point lead in 12 games this season and have six double-digit wins.","400899666"
"NEW YORK --  Boston's backcourt was too good for a Brooklyn one still missing Jeremy Lin. Isaiah Thomas scored 23 points, Avery Bradley had 22 and the Celtics beat the Nets 111-92 on Wednesday night. Al Horford added 17 points for the Celtics in their third straight victory. Jae Crowder had 15. Boston improved to 5-1 when Horford is in the lineup. ""Al can score the ball,"" Bradley said. ""But it's all the little things that he does and how he gets the ball moving, it's so contagious. During the timeouts he's telling guys, `We need to move the ball.' He's a leader, speaks up and he really helps our team with that because sometimes the ball sticks and for Al to step up and say something and us moving the ball and it start with him, that means a lot."" Sean Kilpatrick scored 23 points for the Nets, who have lost five in a row. Trevor Booker had 18 points and 12 rebounds, and Bojan Bogdanovic added 14 points. Boston raced to an 11-2 lead and was ahead 30-16 after one quarter, but the Nets answered with a 21-6 run and 12 points from Bogdanovic in the second quarter. The Nets came all the way back to tie it at 60 in the third, but the Celtics then went on a 19-6 run to regain control. ""For the most part, I feel like we were sharing the ball tonight and getting open shots for our teammates and that's how we pulled away in the first quarter and that's how we pulled away at the end of the game,"" Bradley said. Third-quarter struggles have become a theme for the Nets thus far. ""I don't know if our mindset collectively is right,"" center Brook Lopez said. ""I mean, I guess it's not. We just need to find a way to all be on the same page and come out the way we've been coming out most games, and again just sustaining that effort and energy. That's the bottom line."" Kilpatrick scored 13 points in the fourth, but it wasn't enough for Brooklyn. TIP-INS Celtics: Guard Marcus Smart has made an effort to add the floater to his game. ""He's worked on it quite a bit,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""It was a major focus going into his second year and he got better at it and then he's continued that focus now going into his third year. The best part about a floater is it's got a chance of going in, but it also leads to a shot block attempt so you've got a chance to get a rebound."" ... Demetrius Jackson and Jordan Mickey were inactive. Nets: Lopez is now the only player in the league with 20 or more 3-pointers and blocks. ... Booker has matched his single-season career high with his fifth double-double of the season. ... Chris McCullough became the fourth player in history to appear in an NBA game and a D-League game in the same day. ... Lin (strained left hamstring) and Caris LeVert (left foot rehab) were inactive. LIN UPDATE Coach Kenny Atkinson said there was ""no specific time frame"" for Lin's return after he missed his ninth straight game. ""He's just progressing as scheduled,"" Atkinson said. ""He's anxious to play. We're anxious to get him back, but we also understand the big picture long-term and, definitely, I think in these situations I know collectively we're airing on the side of being cautious and smart.""","400899667"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  Andre Drummond and the Detroit Pistons turned what was supposed to be a matchup of two of the NBA's best young centers into a blowout. Drummond had 18 points and 15 rebounds, while Hassan Whiteside finished with six points and eight rebounds as the Pistons routed the Miami Heat 107-84 on Wednesday night. Drummond also blocked four shots and had four steals. ""I know he wasn't happy with himself after our last game, but whatever he did to get ready tonight worked,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""He did a hell of a job. That might be the best defensive game he's played here."" Whiteside had set a franchise record with 10-plus rebounds in each of the season's first 13 games. ""I just wasn't closing out, and he got some rebounds,"" Whiteside said. ""They got some offensive rebounds, and I even knocked one into the wrong basket. It was that kind of night."" Detroit snapped a four-game losing streak. The Pistons, who got 22 points from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, are 6-2 at home and 1-7 on the road. ""We were desperate for a win,"" Marcus Morris said. ""We really needed this one, and we set the tone early. That's something we've needed to do for a while now."" Tyler Johnson had 17 points for Miami, which has lost eight of 10. Dion Waiters was the only Miami starter to reach double figures, scoring 11. ""I have no explanation for that,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Our second group made a run in the second quarter, but that was the only time we were competitive all night. Our offense wasn't there and we didn't make an effort on defense."" Miami's Udonis Haslem got into a confrontation with a Pistons fan with 5:11 left in the game. The pair had a face-to-face shouting match during a timeout until Haslem was pulled away by teammates. Auburn Hills police removed the fan. ""You can cheer for whichever team you want, but don't be disrespectful,"" Haslem said, adding that there was no racial aspect to the taunting. The Pistons led by 15 in the first quarter and 56-42 at halftime. Drummond dominated his post matchup with Whiteside, putting up 12 points and nine rebounds to his opponent's two points and six boards. ""It was just effort and energy,"" Drummond said. ""He's the type of player that will hurt you if you don't pay attention when he's on the floor."" Detroit shot 68.1 percent in the paint in the half, and kept things going at the start of the third, with Drummond dunking on the first possession. The Pistons led 86-64 going into the fourth. Miami never threatened in a final quarter that saw both coaches empty their benches. ""I don't know what just happened,"" Johnson said. ""They outplayed us, and we didn't respond."" TIP-INS Heat: Johnson lost a tooth in a third-quarter scramble for a loose ball, but stayed in the game. ""It was a temporary tooth, so I didn't even know it was gone until I noticed the empty space,"" he said. ... Waiters picked up a third-quarter technical for arguing a call. Pistons: Guard Reggie Bullock left the game in the second quarter with a left-leg injury and did not return. ... Jon Leuer recorded his 1,000th career rebound in the third quarter. FAREWELL TOUR The game was the first played at the Palace of Auburn Hills since Tuesday's announcement that the Pistons will join the Red Wings at Little Caesars Arena next season. The team will spend the rest of the season celebrating the franchise's history at the Palace, which opened in 1988. DEFENSIVE LESSONS The Pistons scored 28 points in the first quarter, and point guard Goran Dragic wasn't happy with the defensive effort put forth by his teammates. On separate occasions, he was frustrated enough to demonstrate proper techniques to Whiteside and Johnson after they missed assignments. HEAT MEETING The Heat locker room was closed for 30 minutes after the game. Spoelstra said there was a brief team meeting where multiple players spoke up. ""We need to be better than this,"" he said. ""They all know that.""","400899668"
"HOUSTON --  High-scoring DeMar DeRozan knows he's going to start getting some new looks and will have to find ways to make an impact when defenses are focusing on him. On Wednesday night, he found that opening in the third quarter, scoring 21 of his 24 points in the period to help the Toronto Raptors beat the 115-102 to snap a two-game skid. DeRozan ranks second in the NBA behind Russell Westbrook by averaging 30.5 points a game. He discussed the adjustments he made after scoring just three points in the first half. ""Just be aggressive. Just take it from how they were playing me,"" he said. ""I was trying to be a passer, get everybody else involved. Pick them apart. Just me understanding that teams are going to play me differently than they would have a week ago. Just me being more conscious of that and picking and choosing my spot. Raptors avoided losing three in a row for the first time since last November, and ended a nine-game losing streak in Houston. James Harden had 29 points and 15 assists for Houston, but also had 12 turnovers. The Rockets lost for the first time in four games. The Rockets trailed by 15 entering the third quarter before using a 9-2 run to open the second half and get to 56-48. That run was powered by a pair of 3-pointers by Trevor Ariza and a third by Patrick Beverley. DeRozan got hot soon after that, scoring all of Toronto's points in an 11-7 run that extended the Raptors' lead to 72-57 midway through the third quarter. DeRozan had a two-handed dunk during that stretch and capped it with a 3-pointer. He made 8 of 12 shots in that period, including both of his 3-point attempts and also had four assists and three rebounds in the frame. He finished with nine assists, five rebounds and two steals. ""When you're down (big) at halftime and he has not done anything you know you might be in a little bit of trouble because he's going to do something,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""He's that good of a player."" The Rockets cut into the lead with an 18-8 run, highlighted by 3-pointers from Ryan Anderson and Harden, to get within seven points with about 2 minutes remaining.  But DeMarre Carroll hit a 3-pointer before a turnover by Harden led to a dunk by him to thwart the comeback attempt and extend the lead to 111-99 with 90 seconds left. The Raptors led by two early in the second quarter before going on 16-6 run to make it 46-34 with about 2 1/2 minutes in the first half. Kyle Lowry started that spurt with a 3-pointer and had six points in that span. TIP-INS Raptors: DeRozan received a technical foul in the third quarter. ... Carroll finished with 20 points and three blocks. ... Lowry had 17 points and nine assists. ... Jonas Valanciunas had 15 points and 16 rebounds. Rockets: Houston finished with 14 3-pointers, to give the team at least 10 in 14 straight games. ... Montrezl Harrell got a technical for taunting late in the second quarter. ... Wednesday was the first time Houston has lost since Beverley returned after missing the first 11 games after arthroscopic knee surgery. He had 10 points and 10 rebounds and four assists. TURNOVER AND OVER The Rockets had a season-high 28 turnovers after averaging just 13.1 in their previous seven games. The Raptors converted those miscues into 33 points. ""I just think we didn't make characteristic plays,"" Ryan Anderson said. ""We didn't play like we really have been. I don't know what the reason was but ... we were just a little flat."" SUPER SIMONES Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles and Simone Manuel were honored on the court during a timeout in the second quarter. Manuel was born in the Houston area and Biles now lives in the city. Biles won four gold medals and one bronze in gymnastics at the Rio Olympics this summer. Manuel two gold and two silver medals in swimming in Rio.","400899669"
"DALLAS --  Chris Paul had to be reminded that the Los Angeles Clippers are up to an NBA-leading 14 wins. They won't get much easier than this one over the injury-plagued Dallas Mavericks. Paul scored 18 points, DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and eight rebounds and the Clippers cruised past the Mavericks 124-104 on Wednesday night in a matchup of the teams with the best and worst records in the NBA. ""I honestly didn't know we had 14 wins,"" said Paul, who added four assists and four steals. ""I know we have two losses. But for us, when you've been in this league for a while, it's not necessarily about the wins. It's about how you're playing and about the spirit."" Dirk Nowitzki scored 10 points on 3-of-10 shooting in 20 minutes in his return for Dallas after the 13-time All-Star missed eight games with a strained left Achilles tendon. Austin Rivers added 22 points -- half of them in a meaningless fourth quarter -- for the Clippers. They had a 30-6 run in the second and third quarters on the way to their fourth straight win and 11th in 12 games. Harrison Barnes had 22 to lead the Mavericks (2-12). They lost their seventh straight game to match their longest skid since February 1999, during Nowitzki's rookie season. Dallas, missing its top three point guards and facing a trip to defending champion Cleveland, is off to its worst start since going 1-23 in 1993-94. The Mavericks started the week with a valiant effort in a loss at San Antonio. ""This is obviously as tough a week as you can get in the NBA,"" Nowitzki said. ""So hopefully we'll fight through this and grind out a win here and there. And when the schedule turns in our favor hopefully get more healthy and run off some wins. That's the only way to do it."" Blake Griffin had 12 points, seven assists and six rebounds, all in the first three quarters along with the rest of the starters. The Clippers led by 31 in the third. Rivers scored 11 points in the first half, including 3-pointers just four seconds apart after he hit one, stole the inbound pass and made another. He was 6 of 7 from long range. TIP-INS Clippers: LA shot 61 percent in the first half and made 9 of 14 from 3-point range. ...

Paul jumped up and went at Bogut, and the pair kept jawing as the referees prepared to review the play. ... Bogut had 12 rebounds and six assists after missing a game with a sore right calf. COWBOY UP The Clippers will stay in the Dallas area to attend the Washington Redskins-Dallas Cowboys game on Thanksgiving before continuing a six-game trip Friday at Detroit. Paul is a well-documented fan of the Cowboys, who have the NFL's best record at 9-1. He wore the jersey of rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott, the NFL's rushing leader, on the flight from Los Angeles. Paul has attended Cowboys training camp in the LA area. While acknowledging that his team has a bevy of Dallas fans, Clippers coach and Chicago Bears fan Doc Rivers had a parting shot for reporters. ""I'm not going to call you any of you guys bandwagon, OK, but this is the first time you guys have mentioned the Cowboys in like four years,"" Rivers said. LOSING THE LUSTER The boos were still there for Jordan, who spurned the Mavericks in free agency in the summer of 2015 after agreeing to join them. But they weren't quite as loud or persistent as the 6-foot-11 center's two visits last season.","400899670"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Utah Jazz were embarrassed in a 14-point loss to the Denver Nuggets on Sunday, but exacted a little revenge Wednesday with the return of their starting point guard. George Hill scored 22 points in his return from an eight-game absence and the Jazz snapped a four-game losing streak with their 108-83 victory. Hill had tape and a protective pad covering the strained thumb on his shooting hand and the nine-year veteran showed no signs of rust. ""Felt pretty good,"" Hill said. ""Any time you can get back there and help the guys try to win a game is fine. ""My team did a great job of helping me get some easy ones where I'm just catching and shooting and playing my game."" Rudy Gobert posted his eighth double-double of the season with 19 points and 13 rebounds, while Gordon Hayward added 22 points and seven assists. Rookie Jamal Murray led the Nuggets with 23 points off the bench. Kenneth Faried finished with eight points and 10 rebounds. ""Obviously having George back makes a difference,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""It's hard not to improve on the effort we had the other night. (The Nuggets) got free throws, offensive rebounds and points in the paint, numbers that would have led the league in all categories. ""We were better. We've got a long way to go. You can see that with the inconsistency we had in the first half."" The Jazz put away the game with a 17-3 run to start the third quarter to take a 70-50 lead, punctuated by Hill's 3-pointer from the right corner. Utah shot 49.4 percent and the Nuggets struggled to just 31.5 percent. Utah led just 53-47 at halftime after jumping out to a 19-3 lead to open the game. The Jazz started 6 of 8 on 3-pointers but then missed their next 10. The Nuggets, a night after beating Chicago at home, climbed back into the game with a heavy dose of Faried and a 16-2 stretch to tie the game at 45. ""Most young teams forget why you have success,"" Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. ""They get bored with success. We were winning basketball games because of how we played. Tonight, even though we are banged up, three games in four nights -- all excuses. We just didn't bring it."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Danilo Gallinari missed his first game of the season with right knee soreness. ... Mike Miller missed his fourth consecutive game due to personal reasons. Jazz: Joe Johnson played despite dealing with an illness. ... Boris Diaw had his best game as a Jazz player with 11 points, three rebounds and three assists. BACK ON THE COURT Hill averaged 20.4 points and 4.9 assists in the first seven games of the season and fit in with the Jazz immediately. The team is 3-5 without him. ""He and I know and knew each other pretty well,"" Snyder said. ""So some of the conversation that we had, I'd like to think framed what the fit would be and I think that's something he was truly excited about. When you have that fit, it generally has a way of accelerating a player's comfort level."" CUT IT Malone explained how his offense emphasizes back-cuts, especially against teams like the Jazz. ""We have guys that are willing and capable playmakers,"" Malone said. ""... It's something we really emphasize, whether it's practice, shootaround, film sessions. The Utah Jazz shrink the floor. They collapse. When they do, sometimes they get caught ball-watching. ""So any time your man turns the head, you should be cutting to the basket. And if you don't get it, you're probably generating a wide open shot for a teammate behind you."" QUOTABLE ""It was huge, a lot of guys were tired and banged up from all those games,"" Faried said. ""Banged up from last night's game, it was a grind-it-out game. We were able to pull through, but a lot of knick-knack injuries that carried over to today and guys weren't able to hit the shots that they usually are.""","400899671"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis exuded an unmistakable swagger as he strode slowly toward the charged-up crowd behind the basket where he'd just rolled in an off-balance scoop while being fouled. Then, he exchanged a congratulatory five with Arcade Fire singer Win Butler, who was sitting along the baseline. The Pelicans star wasn't going to be denied -- and neither, for that matter, was the rest of his recently resurgent team. Davis finished with 45 points and 10 rebounds, and the New Orleans Pelicans won their fourth straight game, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 117-96 on Wednesday night. ""We're just playing great and when our crowd is into it like they were in it tonight, it gives us juice,"" said Davis, who hit 17 of 27 shots that included thunderous dunks, 3-pointers and just about everything in between. ""My teammates are doing a great job of just finding me and vice versa. We're all just locked in, playing well together, clicking."" Terrence Jones scored 17 points for New Orleans, which trailed early in the second half before Davis scored eight points during a 13-2 run that gave the Pelicans the lead for good. ""I'm amazed every time at the shots he makes. You know, he's able to do it with double-teams and triple teams -- MVP performance,"" guard Tim Frazier said. ""He just came out there and he led us."" New Orleans led by as many as 23 points in the fourth quarter and cruised to its sixth victory in eight games. E'Twaun Moore added 12 points, and Tim Frazier had 11. Zach LaVine scored 26 for Minnesota, but the Timberwolves lost their third straight. ""We have to play tougher,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We are not playing any defense, and if you are not doing that, you can't win."" Andrew Wiggins and Gorgui Dieng each had 13 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns grabbed 11 rebounds for Minnesota, which did not shoot well. Wiggins was 2 for 19 and the Wolves hit only 38 percent (33 of 86) of their shots. New Orleans shot 54 percent (45 of 83). ""We have to change something,"" said Minnesota guard Ricky Rubio, who did not score and had five assists. ""We have to change our mentality."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: The Timberwolves opened a three-game road trip by dropping to 1-6 on the road this season. ... Minnesota shot 3 of 17 from 3-point range. Pelicans: The Pelicans are 4-0 since Jrue Holiday's return. After scoring at least 15 in each of his first three games, he had seven points and eight assists against Minnesota. ... F Dante Cunningham left the game early in the second quarter. Team officials said he had a left knee bruise. STAR POWER The game featured a pair of dominant former Kentucky big men in Davis and Towns, but it was the Pelicans who owned the paint, where New Orleans outscored Minnesota 66-44. The Pelicans also outrebounded the Wolves, 45-41. ""I just tried to get into him and be physical,"" Davis said of his approach against Towns. ""I know it's tough for me when teams get physical with me. It's tough to get into a groove and get into what you like. So that's all I tried to do, knowing he's a big key to their offense, just try to take him out as much as possible and have other guys beat us."" MOMENTUM SWINGS Davis had 12 points in the first seven minutes, including a 12-foot jumper that gave New Orleans a 21-9 lead. But the Timberwolves closed the gap late in the third quarter and surged in front in the second period with a 11-0 run capped by Dieng's foul-line jumper as he was fouled by Omer Asik, putting Minnesota up 46-38. New Orleans, however, closed the half on a 10-0 run during which Jones hit two free throws and dunked twice -- once on a put-back of Davis' miss -- to put the Pelicans back in front, 53-50.","400899672"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  The pass-happy Golden State Warriors put on a spectacular offensive show for their former coach, and Luke Walton had to watch the onslaught against his Los Angeles Lakers from the other bench this time. Stephen Curry had 31 points with seven 3-pointers and nine assists, Kevin Durant scored 28 and Golden State discovered an astonishing first-half offensive flow to run away from the undermanned Lakers 149-106 on Wednesday night. The Warriors' franchise-record 47 assists -- on 53 baskets -- are the most in the NBA this season and topped their previous best passing night more than 35 years ago. ""That's pretty crazy. We almost have more assists than rebounds. That's sick,"" Durant said. ""That shows we're getting more comfortable with each other."" It was the most assists in the NBA since Phoenix also had 47 on Nov. 29, 1991. Golden State had 26 assists on 29 baskets before the break, as in sync as the Warriors have been since adding Durant during the offseason and far better than when they took a 20-point beating at Los Angeles less than three weeks ago. Klay Thompson added 26 points with four 3s and Ian Clark scored 21 off the bench, while Draymond Green dished out 11 assists to go with nine boards in the Warriors' ninth straight victory since losing at L.A. earlier this month. Golden State took care of the ball, too, committing just 10 turnovers. ""That's ridiculous -- 47 and 10,"" Thompson said. Rookie No. 2 overall draft pick Brandon Ingram scored a career-best 16 points in his first start for Los Angeles, which had no answers defensively as Golden State shot 61.6 percent with 19 3-pointers. Warriors coach Steve Kerr has repeatedly noted it might take time for his team to really click, yet at 15 games in Golden State was in top form -- at least for one spectacular night of basketball. ""I mean 47 is a shocking number but getting 30 every night is not surprising,"" Kerr said. ""We don't have to do anything spectacular, just keep the ball moving."" Walton, the former top assistant for Golden State , returned to Oracle Arena and saw his old guys thoroughly dominate a young, beat-up Los Angeles squad that got more bad news regarding point guard D'Angelo Russell's knee injury. ""That was a beautiful exhibition they put on us out there,"" Walton said. Walton spent the first 43 games last season as Golden State interim coach while eventual Coach of the Year Kerr took a prolonged leave of absence dealing with complications following two back surgeries. Walton guided the Warriors to a record 24-0 start and 39-4 overall record while in charge. Golden State had 46 assists on Nov. 7, 1981, against Denver. Curry shot 11 of 18 and 7 for 12 from beyond the arc. The two-time reigning MVP already set the single-season 3-point record with 13 on the way to 46 points in a Nov. 7 win against New Orleans -- three days after going 0 for 10 from long range against the Lakers to have his streak with at least one 3 snapped at 157 regular-season games. MORE MILESTONES The 149 points and margin of victory -- 43 points- set new highs for the Warriors, topping marks set in November 1966. WALTON'S WARM WELCOME Walton waved and smiled as fans cheered and jumped to their feet for a standing ovation when he was introduced before tipoff. They brought back their chant of ""Luuuuuuuke!"" that kind of sounds like boos. ""It is a little weird. It's more strange tonight than it was in L.A., walking into this building, pulling up on a bus, seeing the fans, seeing some of the same security guards, being in the other locker room,"" Walton said. He and Kerr connected earlier in the day in Berkeley, where Kerr attended daughter Maddy's final home college volleyball game at Cal. TIP-INS Lakers: Russell will be out for at least two more weeks after getting a platelet-rich plasma injection in his sore left knee. Jose Calderon started for the third time in Russell's absence. In addition, F Julius Randle was out with a hip pointer. Warriors: Green sustained a corneal abrasion to his left eye but is expected to play Friday. ... The Warriors have a franchise-record nine straight games with 30 or more assists and 11 of 15 this season. It's the longest consecutive game streak with 30-plus assists since Charlotte's NBA-record 13 in 1989. ... Golden State has a winning streak of at least nine games for the fourth straight season.","400899673"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  While the Sacramento Kings enjoy a modest two-game winning streak, the Oklahoma City Thunder are wondering what happened the past two weeks. DeMarcus Cousins had 36 points and 13 rebounds, leading the Kings to a 116-101 victory over the slumping Thunder on Wednesday night. The Kings had a 36-point third quarter and gradually pulled away in the fourth in dealing the Thunder their third straight loss and seventh in nine games. The Thunder opened the season with a 6-1 record, ""We've got to be ready to play. That's plain and simple. Figure it out,"" Russell Westbrook said. Going to a smaller lineup the last two games, it appears the Kings may have figured something. But they're still making sure their All-Star center gets plenty of touches. Cousins made three 3-pointers, hit 14 of 28 shots and proved a handful for the Thunder to contain. ""DeMarcus is one of the best, if not the best center in the game,"" teammate Kosta Koufos said. ""He can do it all, shoot the 3, post up, put it on the floor. You name it, he can do it."" Cousins received considerable help, especially in the second half from Darren Collison and Rudy Gay. Gay said he fought through a stomach virus in scoring 15 of his 17 points in the final two quarters. Collison scored 10 of his season-high 21 points in the fourth quarter and added six assists. Both Gay and Collison connected on three 3-pointers after intermission. The Kings had 12 3-pointers in evening their home record at 4-4. ""I think it was just finding our spots (in the second half),"" Gay said. ""I don't know, maybe I was more aggressive. I know Darren was more aggressive, I can tell you that. We were stagnant in the first half. I felt we pushed through in the second half."" Westbrook nearly had his sixth triple-double of the season, getting 31 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. Victor Oladipo made three 3-pointers and scored 18 points. ""It's not necessarily one player. We just got to keep working,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I think we got a great group of guys in the locker room that are trying and working. We just got to continually understand the importance of a lot of the little things in the course of 48 minutes."" Koufos led the productive Sacramento reserves with nine points and 10 rebounds. Ben McLemore scored all nine of his points during a productive first-half stretch and Ty Lawson added eight and four assists. ""I thought our bench in the first half was fantastic,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""They picked up the pace, the ball was moving, slinging around the floor. It's fun to play (like that.)"" Cousins scored on a variety of shots in the third quarter and had 13 points in helping Sacramento build its lead to 87-65 heading into the fourth. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook made all 11 of 12 free throws and had 20 points in the opening half. ... The Thunder are 2-4 on the road. .. Oklahoma City committed only nine turnovers, but shot 42 percent. Kings: The Kings went to Cousins early and he responded with 16 first-quarter points. .. Gay, the Kings' second-leading scorer, didn't have a basket until making a 3-pointer early in the third quarter. RAPTORS PROTEST KINGS' VICTORY The Toronto Raptors filed a protest with the league office regarding a controversial 3-point shot that was disallowed following a video replay in Sunday's loss to the Kings. The shot by Terrance Ross would have sent the game into overtime. ""I've been through it before. There are advantages and disadvantages of the replay system,"" Joerger said. ""But at the end of the day what it's there for is to get it right. You can argue one side or the other, but whatever side you're on, whether it benefits you or it doesn't benefits you, the biggest thing is that our league can get it right.""","400899674"
"BOSTON --  The trade that brought Kawhi Leonard to San Antonio was already a success for the Spurs, even before throw-in Davis Bertans began contributing. The Latvian rookie set a career high in scoring for the second straight game, pitching in 15 of the Spurs' 56 bench points on Friday to help San Antonio beat the Boston Celtics 109-103 for their eighth straight victory. ""Our first group was still in bed,"" Spurs coach Greg Popovich said after watching his team fall behind 14 points in the first quarter in the matinee start. ""That's why I took them off the court. It was hard to watch."" Leonard had 25 points and 10 rebounds for San Antonio, but that's not surprising from an All-Star who was second in NBA MVP voting last season. Less expected was the contribution from Bertans, who was selected 27 picks later in the 2011 draft and then dealt to San Antonio with Leonard in the trade that sent George Hill to Indiana. ""Bertans was amazing,"" Popovich said. ""Kawhi is Kawhi, but we start to take him for granted. I think overall the bench was the key."" Patty Mills scored 19 off the bench, sinking a 3-pointer with 45 seconds left after the Celtics made it a one-possession game. David Lee had 15 points and 12 rebounds as the Spurs reserves outscored their starters 56-53. The Spurs fell behind by 14 points in the first quarter but scored 12 in a row -- seven from Leonard -- in the second to get back in the game and improve to 9-0 on the road this season. ""You know what you're getting from Kawhi, and he played great,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""But I thought those guys really changed the complexion of the game."" Isaiah Thomas finished with 24 points with eight assists and Avery Bradley had 19 points and eight rebounds for the Celtics. Al Horford had 12 points and 10 rebounds in his second home game since signing a four-year, $113-million contract with Boston this summer. Jae Crowder scored 10 of his 18 points in the first quarter. The Celtics had won three in a row, but they lost to San Antonio for the 10th straight time. ""Home, road, 20 years, whatever it's been: they finish,"" Stevens said. LOOKING BACK A 6-foot-10 forward, Bertans spent much of the last five years playing in Europe and recovering from ACL injuries. He signed with San Antonio this summer and has played in 13 of 16 games so far this season. Leonard, who was the No. 15 overall pick by the Pacers in the 2011 draft, said he had no memory of Bertans' name from that night. ""I was just thinking of myself,"" he said. RUNS Boston used an 18-2 run to turn a two-point deficit into a 24-10 lead. But the Spurs were just as impressive in the second, when they scored 12 straight points to make it a one-point game. ""We gave up the whole first quarter, and after that we knuckled down and played pretty good,"" Popovich said. ""And the starters came back in and played better after that too."" The Celtics led 74-69 with 25 seconds left in the third quarter before Bertans hit a 3-pointer and Mills made a 34-foot 3-pointer just before the buzzer to give the Spurs the lead. Bertans also hit a 3 to start the fourth. TIP-INS Spurs: Improved to 5-0 vs. Eastern Conference teams. ... Bertans, who set his career-high with 11 against Charlotte on Wednesday, broke it in the first three quarters against Boston. ...

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  John Wall put up big numbers against the Orlando Magic, but coach Scott Brooks never mentioned them in discussing his team's third win in four games. Brooks was all about the Wizards' defense, especially early in the first quarter when they ran off to a 19-point lead. Wall had 26 points and 10 assists, and scored the Wizards' final eight after they blew that big lead to help Washington to a 94-91 victory on Friday night. ""Defense won this game for us,"" Brooks said. ""John set the tone defensively for us in the first quarter. His pressure on the ball and keeping (Elfrid) Payton out of the paint . he just did a good job of orchestrating our team."" Otto Porter Jr. scored 19 points and Bradley Beal had 14 as all five Washington starters scored in double figures. However, the Wizards needed their defense -- and Wall -- in the final six minutes after Orlando went up 83-79 on a 3-pointer from reserve point guard D.J. Augustin. ""I told everybody, `Hey, let's calm down,"" Beal said. ""They went on their little run, but the game is about momentum and what turned it around was we got stops and convert. If we realize defense is going to win us games, we're going to be a good team."" Washington got stops on the next five possessions and went on a 7-0 run that included a 3-pointer from Porter and back-to-back layups from Marcin Gortat, who also had nine rebounds. Wall kept the Magic at bay in the last 2 minutes with a driving layup, a three-point play and 4-for-4 shooting from the free throw line. Serge Ibaka led Orlando with 19 points, while Nikola Vucevic contributed 17 points and 17 rebounds. Payton scored 15, all in the second half, and Evan Fournier had 11 as Orlando lost its third straight. Orlando used its defense to fuel the comeback from a 26-7 first-quarter deficit. The Magic didn't let the Wizards inside the paint without a fight and had a hand in the face of nearly every Washington perimeter shooter. Augustin made a three-point play and then hit a 3-pointer that gave Orlando an 83-79 advantage with 5:47 left in the game. Washington quickly regained the lead and though Orlando cut the deficit to one on two occasions, the Wizards made the lead stand up the rest of the game. ""I was disappointed in our guys that got us down, but to their credit we battled back and made it a game,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""We showed good competitive spirit, but you can't get down 19."" TIP-INS Wizards: Washington has won 13 of its last 14 games against Orlando. . The Wizards bench contributed just 12 points and nine rebounds. . This was the 36th time a game between the teams was decided by five points or less. Washington is 19-17 in those games. MAGIC: Starters Payton and Jeff Green didn't score in the first half and played only 16 minutes between them. Green had seven points. . Orlando had 15 turnovers in the first half, but only four the rest of the game. ... Fournier has scored in double figures in 15 of 16 games this season. . During the last eight games, the Magic have limited opponents to just 92.5 points and 41.7 percent shooting.

""Sometimes your record doesn't indicate that, but I know we're a better team. I like where we're going."" LONG DROUGHT The Magic are last in the NBA in scoring (91.9 ppg) and last in shooting percentage (40.7), but it's not for lack of good shots, Vogel said. ""There have been plenty of what I call `no payoff, good possessions,"" Vogel said. ""We miss a layup at the rim or an open 3 on the perimeter. Just too many dry possessions for my liking.""","400899676"
"CLEVELAND --  LeBron James pulled down a full-court pass from Kevin Love, threw down a dunk and gave the touchdown signal on his way up the court. Times are good for the defending NBA champions. Love scored 27 points, Kyrie Irving added 25 and the Cleveland Cavaliers led by as many as 45 points in a 128-90 rout of the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. Love hit seven 3-pointers while Irving, who made his first 10 shots, scored 19 points in the first quarter. Irving's big quarter came two nights after Love scored an NBA-record 34 in the first against Portland. James, playing in his 1,000th regular-season game, had 19 points and 11 assists. The game's signature moment came when Love found James streaking down the right side of the court for the play that thrilled the crowd. ""I've been in that position quite a lot,"" said James, who played wide receiver in high school. ""Kev's been doing those outlet passes. It's up to him. He's the quarterback. I'm just the receiver."" The highlight-reel play came the day before the entire Cavaliers team will attend the college football game between Ohio State and Michigan. The Cavs faced little resistance from the team with the league's worst record. Dallas scored the game's first basket before the Cavaliers turned the game into a rout. Cleveland led 36-16 after one quarter and was ahead 68-28 late in the second. ""It was a horrible performance by us and a great performance by them,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We simply must be better and compete better. It's very disappointing."" Cleveland led 110-65 early in the fourth quarter.

Dirk Nowitzki, who appeared in only his fifth game of the season because of an injured right Achilles, scored 15 points for Dallas. The Mavericks (2-13) have lost eight straight. Mavericks guard Deron Williams (strained left calf) returned after missing the last four games. He scored four points in 15 minutes and didn't play in the second half. Cavaliers forward Channing Frye has been excused from the team following the death of his father, Thomas, on Thanksgiving. Frye's mother, Karen Mulzac-Frye, passed away last month following a battle with cancer. TIP-INS Mavericks: The game marked only the third time this season Dallas has started its projected lineup. ... G Seth Curry was booed when he entered the game in the first quarter.

""Honestly, I wanted that shot,"" Anthony said. ""I wanted that moment to be honest with you. I felt like I had an ample opportunity to close it in regulation."" Derrick Rose added 16 points and blocked Kemba Walker's 3-pointer that would have won it just before the buzzer. ""I rushed it,"" Walker said. ""I could have gotten a better shot I think. I should have taken my time more. They made a great defensive play."" Kristaps Porzingis also scored 16 points in the Knicks' sixth straight home victory. Former Hornets guard Courtney Lee finished with 12 points in the opener of a home-and-home series. Marco Belinelli scored 19 points, Nicolas Batum had 18 and Walker added 17 for the Hornets, who have lost four straight games. Porzingis' 3-pointer from the corner gave New York a 111-109 lead before Michael Kidd-Gilchrist tied it on a backdoor layup. Anthony then made a fadeaway jumper after previously missing a potential game-winning elbow jumper in regulation. ""When I missed that one, I had a good look at it,"" Anthony said. ""I felt like I could get that same look again off of a different move rather than facing up, put the defender on my back and make him make a decision after that.""

Walker passed Alonzo Mourning for third place on Charlotte's career free throws made list. ... Marvin Williams sustained a hyperextended left knee in the third quarter and didn't return. Knicks: Coach Jeff Hornacek attributed Porzingis' rising shooting percentage to natural growth and playing within the system: ""I like what KP is doing. He's not trying to force a lot of things. He's playing within the game,"" Hornacek said. ""When he's rolling then there's a time when he may take one that they call `heat checks' or ill-advised shots, but a lot of times he's making those. He's really growing in his game and he's finding out where he can get his opportunities."" ... Lance Thomas (sore left ankle) and Marshall Plumlee were inactive. LOSING LEE Clifford, on Lee's departure as a free agent: ""Our problem was, frankly, we had six free agents and they all played well. When we sat down by the time, which was the first day we signed Nicolas (Batum), the second day we signed Marvin (Williams), there was no way we were going to have enough money for those guys. We had really enough for two and Al (Jefferson), Jeremy (Lin) and Courtney all made a lot more money. We couldn't have gotten any of those guys. He played great for us.

"PHILADELPHIA --  After a long, six-game road trip, the Chicago Bulls are heading home with a winning record and an infusion of confidence. Jimmy Butler and Dwayne Wade had 26 points apiece to lead the Bulls to a 105-89 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday night. Taj Gibson added 12 points for the Bulls, who finished a six-game road trip with a 4-2 record. Butler rested for the entire fourth quarter of the blowout. ""On this trip, the way we performed, we started to understand we're a good team and can play with anyone in any building,"" Wade said. ""It was a very successful trip and we finished it off right."" Chicago led from start to finish against the short-handed 76ers, who played without center Joel Embiid. ""I like the way we're playing,"" Butler said. ""If we keep guarding, rebounding and doing what we're supposed to do, we're going to win a lot of games. Now we have to go home and win a couple more."" Ersan Ilyasova had 14 points to pace Philadelphia, which certainly could've used Embiid. ""You saw an NBA team that's good,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""That's a good team, a really good team."" The Bulls ran away from the 76ers with a dominant third quarter in which they outscored Philadelphia 33-17 to enter the fourth quarter ahead 90-64. ""To come out with this type of effort was terrific,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We had good urgency out of the gate."" Butler had nine points in the period as Chicago did damage inside and outside. Wade's fastbreak dunk early in the period helped the Bulls match their largest lead to that point at 67-52. And the advantage was 20, 79-59, with 4:35 left in the period after a pretty sequence that featured a Wade layup from Rajon Rondo followed by a Butler layup from Wade. Chicago ended the quarter with consecutive 3-pointers from Denzel Valentine and Nikola Mirotic. The lead was 28 points with just over seven minutes left in the game when Hoiberg emptied his bench. ROAD BLISS Hoiberg said a long road trip can test a team's mettle. ""You either come out of it loving each other or hating each other, and I think our guys grew,"" he said. ""Now we have to go home and play with the same type of urgency and effort."" MISSING EMBIID A leading candidate for Rookie of the Year, Embiid missed his fifth game as part of his rehab plan for a foot injury that cost him the last two seasons. Embiid is averaging 17.8 points and 7.6 rebounds in just 22.6 minutes as he is on a minutes restriction. That restriction caused him to sit out the second overtime of Philadelphia's 104-99 loss to Memphis on Wednesday night. Embiid could return for Sunday's home game against the Cleveland Cavaliers though Brown was noncommittal. During the third quarter, fans chanted ""Free The Process! Free The Process"" in reference to Embiid's nickname, ""The Process."" WADE'S IMPACT Butler spoke afterward about how Wade helps the Bulls on and off the court. On the court, the double-teams Wade draws gives everyone open looks. Off the court, Wade's contribution may be more significant. ""He gives everybody confidence because he knows what it takes to win,"" Butler said. TALKING TRASH Wade seemed to thrive on back-and-forth talk with Philadelphia's Jerryd Bayless. ""Friendly banter,"" Wade joked. TIP-INS Bulls: G Michael Carter-Williams, out since Oct. 31 with a left wrist and left knee injury, had a cast placed on his left wrist.

The Pistons blew an 18-point lead in the third quarter, but rallied down the stretch to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 108-97. Detroit had lost 11 straight to the Clippers, including a 114-82 rout at the Staples Center on Nov. 7. ""We got embarrassed the last time we played that team, and I knew these guys didn't want that to happen again,"" Van Gundy said. ""But beating that team is going to take 48 minutes of effort and we haven't been able to do that many times this season."" Detroit won its second straight and improved to 7-2 at home, as opposed to 1-7 on the road. ""I'm very happy with the way we played tonight, but we have to be able to take this level of effort on the road,"" Van Gundy said. ""We've got four road games in the next seven days against really good teams. We can't keep giving those games away."" The Clippers lost for just the second time in 13 games, falling to 7-1 on the road. ""Give the Pistons credit; Stan really had them ready to play,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""They came out with so much more energy that we did in the first 10 minutes, and it is tough to dig yourselves out of a big hole on the road."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 16 points and a career-high 10 assists for Detroit and Andre Drummond had 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Pistons got at least 15 points from all five starters and Jon Leuer added 11 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. ""We are really starting to come together,"" Drummond said. ""We are more in sync defensively, and the offensive is starting to come around."" J.J. Redick and Blake Griffith each had 24 points for the Clippers, while Chris Paul had eight points to go with 15 assists. ""This wasn't a lack of effort,"" Paul said. ""We were energized, but they made shots."" The Pistons trailed by as many as 43 earlier this month in Los Angeles, but jumped out to a 31-14 lead in Friday's first quarter. However, with Drummond limited to 8:19 in the first half by foul trouble and Morris playing just 3:42, the Clippers were able to pull within 57-48 at halftime. The Pistons built the margin to as many as 18 early in the third, with Caldwell-Pope finding Drummond for several alley-oops. However, Redick took over the game, scoring 10 points in the final 1:27 of the quarter. His back-to-back 3-pointers pulled the Clippers within 82-80 at period's end. ""We cut into their lead at the end of the third quarter, but we were still making mistakes,"" Rivers said. ""When you are that far behind, you have to play perfect basketball or you use up everything getting it close."" Redick finished with 18 in the quarter. ""He did all that against a really good defender in KCP,"" Van Gundy said. ""I was sitting on the bench wondering how I didn't win 65 games a year when I was coaching him in Orlando."" Los Angeles scored the first four points of the fourth to take the lead, but stopped hitting shots. That let the Pistons respond with a 15-2 run, capped off by Caldwell-Pope's 3-pointer to make it 97-86 with 5:14 to play. ""We didn't panic,"" Caldwell-Pope said. ""We just kept doing what we had been doing all game, and kept trying to make J.J. work."" TIP-INS Clippers: Paul didn't score in the second half, but put up 10 assists. ... With the Pistons moving to Little Caesars Arena for the 2017-18 season, this was the Clippers' final regular-season visit to the Palace of Auburn Hills. Pistons: Guard Stanley Johnson was suspended for one game after an unspecified violation of team rules. That left the Pistons without three rotation guards, as both Reggie Jackson and Reggie Bullock missed the game with left knee injuries. PLAY MAKER With Jackson not expected to play his first game until next week, Caldwell-Pope was the first Detroit player to reach double figures in assists in a game. VISITING CELEBRITY During a timeout, the Palace scoreboard showed Darius Slay's interception of Sam Bradford's pass that helped the Detroit Lions beat the Minnesota Vikings 16-13 on Thanksgiving. Slay, one of several Lions in attendance, then autographed a football and tossed it to the crowd.","400899680"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder wants his team to be great defensively and was looking forward to testing that against one of the best defensive teams in the league. The Jazz were elite on that end of the floor Friday night. Gordon Hayward scored 24 points as the Utah Jazz beat the Atlanta Hawks 95-68. The 68 points were the fewest the Jazz have allowed this season and the fewest the Hawks have scored by 24. It was also the second lowest total in the NBA this season. ""We were focused on being disciplined, that was the main thing,"" Snyder said. The Hawks have now lost four of five after starting the season a red-hot 9-2. Hayward was unstoppable early and started the game making his first six shots. Utah used a 23-2 run early in the fourth quarter to put the game away as George Hill hit a pair 3-pointers and Rudy Gobert converted a three-point play. Hill finished with 23 and Gobert notched double-double No. 8 with 10 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks. ""The defensive end really helped us on the offensive end, too,"" Hayward said. ""Anytime you can get out to good starts like we've done the past couple nights, it gives you a boost of energy. It gets the crowd into it. It makes the game a lot easier. ""When we get easier shots at the rim, cuts and wide-open layups, it gives the team some juice. Gets that energy going. And gives you a bounce down on the other end, too."" Dennis Schroder scored a team-high 16 for the Hawks (10-6) and Paul Millsap added 11. Atlanta shot just 31.3 percent from the field. The Jazz (9-8) won the second quarter 24-11 to push its lead to 48-34 at halftime. They used a 20-3 run to build the cushion, highlighted by a behind-the-back dribble, pull-up jumper by Hill followed by a 3-pointer from the veteran. Atlanta struggled offensively and simply couldn't get stops for long stretches. ""They are good at protecting the paint and protecting the rim,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""At some point you might want to maybe suck them in and hit some guys for some open shots then you have to make them. ""Whether it is four out of five (losses) or, I think we got beat pretty handily a couple of nights ago, so we need to figure out a way to get out of this quickly."" Millsap added, ""(Gobert) had a part to do with it, but that is probably the worst layup display we've had for a while."" TIP-INS Hawks: Kyle Korver returned to the lineup after taking last game off to rest. ... Dwight Howard was held to four points on 2 for 9 shooting. Jazz: Boris Diaw made his fifth start of the season at power forward. Trey Lyles had started at the position the last two games. ... Utah won the rounding battle 55-40. THE DEAL The Jazz traded the No. 12 pick of the 2016 draft to the Hawks in a three-team deal that moved Hill from the Pacers and sent Jeff Teague to Indiana from Atlanta. The Hawks selected Taurean Prince with the pick. Hill entered the game averaging a team-high 20.6 points and 4.6 assists while the Hawks handed the keys to third-year point guard Schroder, who entered averaging 14.1 points and 5.5 assists. ""It doesn't take a genius to figure out that we can get better with a point guard,"" said Snyder about the trade. ""You saw that early this season with what George has been able to do."" Budenholzer said he's happy with Schroder, but wants more consistency from the young player. QUOATABLE Gobert was asked about Howard saying he played a prank on his mother, telling her he signed with Utah as a free agent instead of the Hawks. Howard said his mom cried at the news. ""I don't know, maybe she cried because she was happy,"" Gobert said with a smirk.","400899681"
"MILWAUKEE --  When DeMar DeRozan finds his spot, the Milwaukee Bucks learned just how hard he is to stop. DeRozan scored 26 points, including a contested jumper with 16 seconds left over Tony Snell and Giannis Antetokounmpo, to lead the Toronto Raptors to a 105-99 victory over the Bucks on Friday night. ""The mid-range, that's his hot spot,"" Snell said. ""It was a tough shot (against) good defense."" DeRozan again tormented Milwaukee and Kyle Lowry scored 19 as Toronto hit a season-high 14 3-pointers to continue its dominance against the Bucks. The Raptors have won 11 of the last 12 meetings, and six straight in Milwaukee. ""I'm not concerned about our offense,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""But until we commit to the defensive end, we're kidding ourselves."" Antetokounmpo scored 29 points and added 11 assists, while Snell had a season-high 16 points. But with the game on the line, Lowry hit from 27 feet out with 1:06 left and DeRozan knocked down a 16-foot jumper over Snell and Antetokounmpo to make it 101-97. ""We tried to throw different bodies at him, show him different looks, and he made the shot that counted,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. What did DeRozan see with two defenders bearing down? ""The basket,"" he said. TIP-INS Raptors: DeRozan, who has scored 25 points or more in 13 of 16 games, also finished with four assists, the eighth straight game he's had at least four. . . . Toronto also hit six 3-pointers in the first quarter. Bucks: Milwaukee recalled guard Rashad Vaughn from the NBA Development League, but did not play. ""The D-League didn't have practice for three days, so we had to bring him back,"" Kidd said. ""It was not a vacation."" . . . It was the first of four `Fear the Deer' games this season, featuring black jerseys and an alternate court design. . . . Milwaukee's last lead came at 29-27 in the second quarter. THREE-POINT PROWESS Two nights after the Raptors made 12 3-pointers in a win at Houston, they went 14 of 31 from behind the arc against the Bucks, who came in with the No. 1 defensive 3-point percentage in the league at 30.6 percent. ""We aren't forcing anything,"" DeRozan said. ""We have guys who can penetrate and kick, and guys who can make wide open shots."" GREAT TRIP The Raptors completed their longest road trip with a 3-2 record, also including wins at Houston and Denver. ""We need to get all the wins we can on a road trip,"" said Terrence Ross, who finished with eight points. ""It is going to feel good to be back in front of the home crowd, getting to sleep in our own beds."" MONROE SIGHTING Rarely seen Bucks big man Greg Monroe, who signed a $50 million, three-year max deal in 2015, scored eight points and adding 10 rebounds in 19 minutes of play. He had received just 20 minutes in the previous four games combined, scoring just eight total points and grabbing eight rebounds.","400899682"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Erik Spoelstra took the first matchup with his former assistant. Tyler Johnson matched his season high with 22 points, Dion Waiters added 15 and the Miami Heat snapped their two-game losing streak with a 90-81 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night. The game was the first that matched Spoelstra against first-year Memphis coach David Fizdale. With a number of Heat players on the injury list, Johnson provided a boost for Miami, particularly in the first half. ""He's being aggressive where we need him to be aggressive,"" Spoelstra said. ""He's an example of the ball finding energy, but the ball has to move to find that energy."" James Johnson added 13 points and Josh Richardson finished with 12 for Miami. Mike Conley, who came off the bench, led Memphis with 16 points but shot only 5 of 15 from the field. JaMychal Green finished with 14 points for Memphis, which played without reserve Zach Randolph following his mother's death and had its six-game winning streak snapped. The Heat played without a number of players due to injuries. The latest was point guard Goran Dragic, who missed the game because of a sore left elbow. He joined Wayne Ellington, Willie Reed and Justise Winslow on the Miami injured list. Miami made up for the personnel shortage by hitting 12 of 31 outside the arc and forcing 18 turnovers, leading to 23 points. The Heat jumped to an early lead, built it to as many as 17 and led from start to finish. ""We were a little behind the eight-ball with Goran being out,"" Tyler Johnson said. ""Everybody did what they were supposed to do in order for us to get out of here with a win."" Miami used 3-point shooting in the third quarter, hitting six of its first nine long-distance shots. That helped the Heat build their biggest lead to 17 before a 71-57 lead into the fourth. Meanwhile, the Memphis offense, which seemed out of sync most of the night, continued to sputter. Memphis never got closer than eight points in the final quarter. ""Their speed really impacted us,"" Fizdale said. ""We never got organized. We never had a toughness about us. We didn't play with the attitude that we've had over the last six games, especially defensively."" TIP-INS Heat: In announcing Dragic would not play, Spoelstra said the guard's elbow ""is just not getting better."" ... C Hassan Whiteside recorded a block in the first quarter, his 44th consecutive game with a block. He finished with two blocks. Whiteside, who had 12 rebounds, has led the Heat in rebounding in all 15 games this season. Grizzlies: Conley not starting was because of minutes management, not disciplinary or injury-related. ... Rookie G Andrew Harrison, who started his third game of the season, missed all eight of his shots in the game, but finished with seven assists. ... Marc Gasol had a season-high five blocks, but only one rebound. PLAYING THROUGH PAIN Waiters was questionable with a lingering right groin injury, but started. ""To be honest, I'm about 60 percent out there. I feel like my team needs me,"" he said. ""If the injury's not killing me . I'm going to battle through it. I'm going to fight. That's who I am."" NO Z-BO The team granted Randolph an indefinite leave of absence after the death of his mother, Mae Randolph, on Thanksgiving Day. ""Zach and his mother had an inseparable bond,"" Grizzlies General Manager Chris Wallace said in a statement released by the team. ""Mae was so fiercely proud of her son, his accomplishments and his truly special place in the hearts of Memphians and the Grizzlies family."" Conley said: ""I called (Randolph), and we cried on the phone together. It was emotional, and that doesn't leave you in 24 hours."" HELLO OL' FRIEND Fizdale served as a Miami assistant for eight years. There were plenty of hugs, handshakes and receiving lines of well-wishers for Fizdale, including after the game.","400899683"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers knew they would need to reach deep into their bench Friday night in order to get a win. With three players sitting out due to injuries -- including Paul George, who is nursing a sore left ankle and a nagging back injury -- Indiana not only relied on its depth, the Pacers used it to dismantle the Nets 118-97, Brooklyn's sixth straight loss. Eleven Pacers dressed Friday night, and nine played at least 18 minutes. Glenn Robinson III got his second start of the season and finished with 20 points and five rebounds. ""I just came in ready. I had the right mindset. (Coach) Nate (McMillan) talked to me before the game, told me I was starting, I was going to play big minutes,"" Robinson said. ""I thought we brought the energy. We were intense defensively. We're just starting to get our chemistry and we've just got to keep going."" After losing two of their last three games, the Pacers were in sync, clicking and gelling on the court. Following Indiana's practice on Thursday, George gathered the Pacers for a players-only meeting, addressing some of Indiana's shortcomings and kinks that needed worked out. Robinson noted that the Pacers needed to gather and discuss some of the problems that have hampered a team that had a lot of preseason hype. ""For us, we have to establish who we are. We need to establish our identity,"" McMillan said. ""Tonight, I thought they set the tone. We can't go back. We've been up and down. We have to move forward and build off this game, have intensity on both ends of the floor."" Rodney Stuckey scored 18 points, and Al Jefferson and Myles Turner each finished with 16 points. After an 11-0 Nets run in the first quarter, Indiana trailed by seven points. But the Pacers finished the quarter with a 6-0 run to lead 28-23.

Turner finished with eight rebounds and four blocked shots. And Jeff Teague finished with nine points, eight assists and nine rebounds. Indiana scored 27 points off Brooklyn's 20 turnovers. Trevor Booker finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds, recording his sixth double-double of the season for the Nets while Brook Lopez finished with 20 points and Sean Kilpatrick added 16 points and seven assists. ""I think it came down to competitiveness. They outworked us, and they were more focused than us for the majority of the game,"" Lopez said. ""We were lax on both ends of the floor. We need to fight. We need to grind every possession to give ourselves a shot. The guys in the locker room right now are the ones that can fix it.""

"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets contained Russell Westbrook for three quarters, but he took over with the game slipping away from Oklahoma City. Westbrook had 36 points, 18 assists and 12 rebounds for his sixth triple-double, and the Thunder beat the Denver Nuggets 132-129 in overtime on Friday night. Westbrook scored 24 points in the fourth quarter and overtime to help the Thunder rally from 13 down and end a three-game losing streak. His 18 assists were a season high and the most in an NBA game this season. ""It's happened a couple of games. It's happened at different points throughout the year,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""It's his will, his competitiveness and get our team in a position where we had a chance."" Victor Oladipo had 26 points for the Thunder and a couple of key buckets late in the fourth, one off a steal. ""He did a great job, using his size, his length, getting out in transition and getting steals,"" Westbrook said. ""That helped us a lot, got us easy buckets."" Westbrook scored 17 points in the fourth quarter to start the comeback. His two free throws with 9.5 seconds left made it 122-119, but Denver tied it when Steven Adams fouled Jamal Murray on a 3-point attempt and the rookie hit the free throws. Kenneth Faried blocked Westbrook's layup at the horn to send it into overtime, but the Thunder felt confident after rallying. ""We've got to win,"" Westbrook said of the mood on the bench. ""Very simple."" Wilson Chandler finished with a season-high 30 points and 11 rebounds. Jameer Nelson had 21 points and 13 assists, both season highs, for the Nuggets. ""I thought we played well enough offensively for sure to win the game,"" Nelson said. ""We just couldn't get stops when we needed them."" Oladipo hit two free throws to put the Thunder ahead 128-126 in overtime. The Nuggets had a chance to tie in the final 20 seconds but Chandler missed a layup and Westbrook hit two more free throws with 13.7 seconds left. ""We lost a shootout,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""My biggest disappointment is that we were never able to consistently get stops. We knew Westbrook at some point was going to go off."" TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook finished an assist shy of his career high. He also had seven turnovers. ... Oklahoma City has used the same starting lineup in all 17 games. Nuggets: Murray finished with 20 points and seven rebounds. ... Denver had just 10 players active. Mike Miller and Will Barton were away from the team for personal reasons. Danilo Gallinari (right thigh), Juancho Hernangomez (right ankle sprain) and Gary Harris were all out. ... Denver Broncos Hall of Famer and current team executive John Elway was sitting courtside. SCARY MOMENT Murray took a hard fall when he was fouled on a dunk attempt. He was on the floor for a few minutes but got up and hit the two free throws. OLD SCHOOL Malone expressed plenty of admiration for Westbrook before the game. Malone likened the NBA's leading scorer to a bruiser from the days when the league was known for its rough play. ""I think he's a throwback player,"" Malone said. ""I think he's a guy that would have excelled back in the `80s, which is my favorite period of the NBA when (there wasn't) all this lovey-dovey, hug-and-kissing and no hard fouls.

"PHOENIX --  A furious fourth quarter made Minnesota a winner on the road for just the second time this season. Andrew Wiggins scored 25 points, Karl-Anthony Towns added 22 and the Timberwolves rallied from a 10-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Phoenix Suns 98-85 on Friday night. Eric Bledsoe scored 23 for the Suns, who were just back from a six-game road trip. Minnesota used a 27-6 outburst to quickly erase the Phoenix lead and pull away, snapping a three-game losing streak. The Timberwolves outscored Phoenix 31-10 in the fourth quarter. ""I think that was our best fourth quarter of the year,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. Phoenix's last field goal was Bledsoe's driving layup with 9:06 to play. The Suns committed a season-high 26 turnovers, resulting in 23 Minnesota points.  Phoenix also was just 6 of 26 from 3-point range. ""Turnovers, defense, you know, the whole nine,"" Bledsoe said. ""We did everything possible to lose this game tonight."" All five Timberwolves starters reached double figures. ""They searched and they searched until they found something that worked,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said, ""and they stayed with it, which was Wiggins in pick-and-roll coverage."" Brandon Knight added 15 points for Phoenix but only two in the second half. Devin Booker scored 11. For much of the game, it looked like the Timberwolves were headed for another loss in what has been a disappointing start to the season. ""I think it's just us coming to a point where we didn't want the same story written about us,"" Towns said. ""I think we're all tired of reading the same articles and hearing the same chatter from everyone how our third and fourth quarters are a problem."" Phoenix led by as many as 11 in the third quarter and was up 77-67 early in the fourth. But the Suns missed four of six free throws while the Timberwolves went on a 16-3 run. Towns grabbed a loose ball and scored inside to cap the surge and give Minnesota an 83-80 lead with 5  1/2 minutes to play. The Timberwolves stretched it to 90-83 with 3:58 remaining when Wiggins' string of 15 consecutive missed 3-pointers came to an end. ""Things weren't going well in that game,"" Thibodeau said, ""but the fight was there and we just kept working the game and the game turned."" Phoenix had been in control, although never by much, until its fourth-quarter collapse. Knight scored the last five points of the half to put Phoenix up 52-47. He made a 3-pointer from the corner as the shot clock expired with 34 seconds left and sank two free throws with 10.6 seconds to play until halftime. Bledsoe scored all of the Suns' points in a 9-1 third-quarter run. His driving reverse layup capped the spurt and put Phoenix ahead 69-58 with 5:01 left in the quarter. The Suns led 75-67 entering the fourth.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Defense was the difference for the Trail Blazers. After struggling for the past half-dozen games, Portland had more of a complete effort in a 119-104 victory over New Orleans on Friday night. Damian Lillard scored 27 points and CJ McCollum added 24 to snap the Pelicans' four-game winning streak. ""I think what we did on the defensive end allowed us to get out in transition and move the ball, and play at the pace that we wanted to be at. It worked in our favor, once we did it consistently,"" Lillard said. Lillard added 11 assists for the Blazers, who were coming off a 1-4 road trip. It was the 2,000th win in franchise history. Anthony Davis, who went into the game ranked second in the league with an average of 31.3 points a game, led the Pelicans with 31 points and 13 rebounds. The Blazers led by as many as 17 points in the third quarter, but the Pelicans closed to 105-101 on Terrance Jones' dunk and Jrue Holiday's jumper. Portland responded with an 8-0 run, capped by Maurice Harkless' reverse layup that made it 113-101, and New Orleans couldn't catch up. ""Obviously it's really good to get a win,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""We've been struggling a little bit. I thought offensively we were pretty good for most of the night. Defensively, after about two minutes into the second quarter, we were good the last three quarters."" The Pelicans have rebounded after an eight-game losing streak to start the season and were coming off a 117-96 victory at home over the Timberwolves. But the win was costly because New Orleans lost Dante Cunningham in the first half because of a non-displaced right proximal fibula fracture. He will miss four to six weeks. The four-game winning streak coincided with the return of Holiday, who missed the start of the season to care for his wife, Lauren Holiday, following the birth of their child and surgery to remove a tumor on the right side of his wife's brain. Lauren Holiday was a standout on the U.S. women's national soccer team for eight years until her retirement last year. Holiday finished with 16 points. Portland, coming off a 137-125 loss in Cleveland, led by eight points in the first quarter but New Orleans pulled in front by the second, taking a 38-32 lead on Holiday's 3-pointer. Portland reclaimed a 47-43 lead on consecutive baskets from Jake Layman and McCollum. McCollum led all scorers in the first half with 19 points and the Blazers led 66-57. The Blazers went on an 8-0 run to open the third quarter, capped by McCollum's 3-pointer that made it 74-57. Meyers Leonard's dunk and Lillard's long 3-pointer extended Portland's lead to 94-78. ""If you're going to be content to exchange baskets with this team you're probably going to struggle because they're really good offensively,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans players and coaches had Thanksgiving dinner at the family home of Jones, who grew up in Portland. ""His family was terrific to us,"" Gentry said. ... The Pelicans have four players on the injured/inactive list: Tyreke Evans (right knee), Quincy Pondexter (left knee), Cunningham (right leg) and Cheick Diallo (D-League assignment). Trail Blazers: It was Stotts' birthday. ... There was no update on the status of Al-Farouq Aminu, who has a strained left calf. ... Mason Plumlee finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds. ... Portland has won 11 straight over the Pelicans at the Moda Center. SECOND CHANCES The Blazers had 23 second-chance points compared to two for New Orleans, something that was a concern to Gentry: ""You give up 12 offensive rebounds and they get 23 second-chance points,"" he said, ""that means they're scoring every time they get a rebounds and that puts way too much pressure on your offense."" MILESTONES Besides his birthday, it was also Stotts' 191st win as coach of the Blazers. He ranks fourth in franchise history behind Jack Ramsay (435), Rick Adelman (291) and Nate McMillan (266). Portland is the 15th NBA team to hit 2,000 wins.","400899687"
"LOS ANGELES --  Steve Kerr and Luke Walton remained close friends and daily confidantes after their coaching careers sent them to opposite ends of California this summer. Although they've enjoyed the chance to spend time together while the Warriors and the Lakers played each other five times in the past 43 days, they'll both be grateful for a little space in this rivalry. Particularly after a game that neither coach enjoyed at all. Kevin Durant had 29 points, nine assists and six rebounds, and Golden State beat injury-depleted Los Angeles for the second time in three days, 109-85 on Friday night. ""It looked like a Thanksgiving food hangover,"" Walton said. Stephen Curry scored 24 points and Klay Thompson had 18 in the Warriors' 10th consecutive victory. Golden State followed up its 43-point win in Oakland on Wednesday with another comfortable victory in these clubs' third regular-season game in three weeks, although Kerr and Walton didn't see much to like about a sloppy post-holiday contest. ""It was one of the worst basketball games I've seen in my life,"" Kerr said. ""We were awful, and they were awful. The people who bought tickets should get their money back, honestly."" It almost got worse for the Warriors: Draymond Green had 12 points and eight rebounds before leaving in the third quarter with a bruised left ankle from a collision with teammate Ian Clark. Green is cautiously confident his injury isn't serious. Jordan Clarkson scored 20 points for the Lakers, who played without injured starters Julius Randle, Nick Young and D'Angelo Russell. The Lakers gave up 149 points to Golden State on Wednesday, and they never made it close Friday with three of their top five scorers sidelined. ""They're the best team in the league,"" Clarkson said. ""I don't think we see them for a little while, so (we can) get that game out of our head and get our swag back.""

Curry missed a breakaway dunk in the second quarter, drawing laughter throughout the arena. Staples Center's video board replayed the miss after the next timeout and then cut to Curry, who was grinning broadly. ""I've missed dunks before,"" the two-time MVP said. Lakers: Clarkson moved back into LA's starting lineup with Young sidelined. Jose Calderon had seven points in his fourth start in Russell's place. ... Walton said he didn't review tape of Wednesday's loss: ""I told our film guy I would throw him out of our room if he put that game on my laptop."" ON A ROLL The Lakers were the last team to beat the Warriors, notching a 20-point blowout on Nov. 4. Since then, Golden State has found the rhythm necessary to become the powerhouse expected when Durant abandoned Oklahoma City to join up with the two-time defending Western Conference champions in July. ""It's nice learning lessons in wins, but I think we're a better team since the last time we stepped foot in this building,"" Curry said. ""We're still trending in the right direction. You don't take anything for granted, but it's nice we put together consecutive good performances."" INGRAM'S ACTION Brandon Ingram had eight points on 3-for-18 shooting in his second NBA start, getting valuable experience as the Lakers' offensive focus in the absence of Russell and Randle, his fellow blue chip youngsters. Ingram, the No. 2 pick in last summer's draft, went 1 for 10 in the first half, but kept firing while grabbing nine rebounds. LAKERS HURTING Russell is out for at least two weeks after missing three of the previous four games with a sore left knee, while Randle missed his second straight game with a hip pointer. Young missed his first game all season after spraining his toe earlier in the week during a game against Oklahoma City in which he hit the game-winning 3-pointer. GREEN SCREENED Clark was prone under the basket when Green fell and tripped over his head. Clark was hit in the throat, but showed no sign of a concussion, the Warriors said. Green rolled his ankle and didn't realize he had stepped on his teammate. After skipping the fourth quarter and putting ice on his leg, he hopes to play Saturday back home in Oakland.","400899688"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Three weeks ago, Ryan Anderson scoffed at the idea of Houston becoming the first team in NBA history to attempt 50 3-pointers in one game. Now that it happened, Anderson is fully convinced the Rockets can and will do it again. James Harden had 23 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in his fourth triple-double of the season, and the Houston Rockets set an NBA record with 50 3-point attempts in a 117-104 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Friday night. ""That's this style of play that we built around James . and we have shooters,'' said Anderson, who made three 3s and scored 13 points. ""The great part about it, it didn't seem like we took 50. They were in rhythm, they were good looks and those are shots we normally take.'' The Rockets went 21 of 50 from beyond the arc and came within two makes of matching the single-game record they already share with the Orlando Magic. The Rockets made eight 3s in the first quarter, six in the second, three in the third and four in the fourth. ""I don't mind it but I'll like to get the record for the most makes, not just the most attempts,'' Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ``If that's what they're giving us, that's what we'll take. We had good looks, and if a guy has a good look then he's free to shoot it.'' Trevor Ariza added 18 points and nine rebounds, while Clint Capela scored 17 points to lead Houston to its eighth win in the last nine games between the teams. DeMarcus Cousins had 32 points and nine rebounds for Sacramento despite being hindered by foul trouble much of the second half. Cousins made four consecutive 3-pointers late in the fourth quarter when the Kings pulled within 112-104. ""If we want to be the team that just lets teams come in here with automatic 'W's . that's just what's going to happen if we continue to play this way,'' Cousins said. ""We've got to hold ourselves accountable, take responsibility for it and change these mistakes. This probably won't be the last time we see a team get hot like that.'' Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said the Kings' slow start was too much to overcome. ""We didn't come in and bring enough force early in the game,'' Joerger said. ``They came in very focused, we came in definitely too slow. They got too many loose balls (and) made 3s.'' Ariza led Houston's 3-point barrage, going 6 of 11. Eric Gordon added four while Ryan Anderson and Harden added three apiece. Gordon finished with 14 points, one of seven Rockets in double figures. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston led by as much as 29 but had to hold off Sacramento's late surge to win in the opener of its five-game road trip. . Ariza made four 3s in the first quarter. . Anderson grew up just outside of Sacramento and was a big Kings fan. . Nene had three fouls in the first half. Kings: Coach Dave Joerger juggled his lineup after halftime and replaced Ty Lawson with Arron Afflalo. Afflalo started 14 of Sacramento's first 15 games but Joerger has been experimenting with a smaller backcourt at times. ... Joerger was given a technical foul in the fourth quarter. ROCKETS' DEEP STREAK Houston has made at least 10 3-pointers in its last 15 games, one shy of the NBA record set last year by Golden State and matched later in the season by Cleveland. The Rockets last failed to reach double digits beyond the arc in the season opener, when they made seven.","400899689"
"Danny Green double clutches while in the air and still is able to hit an incredible 3-pointer with a hand in his face. (0:33) WASHINGTON --  The San Antonio Spurs have been so good on the road, it's almost a disappointment they have to return home. The way they're playing right now though, it probably doesn't matter where the game is. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 24 points, Tony Parker added 20 and the Spurs beat the Washington Wizards 112-100 on Saturday night for their ninth straight victory. The Spurs (14-3) swept a three-game road swing and are 10-0 away from home. ""I do want to go home. I don't want to play at home,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich joked after the game. ""You've got no choice, no choice."" Kawhi Leonard scored 19 for San Antonio, which shot 53.3 percent (40 of 75) from the field. The Spurs led by 10 at halftime and as many as 19 in the second half. San Antonio's bench outscored Washington's reserves 35-18. ""Last game was rough. Starters didn't have a great start,"" Aldridge said of Friday's win in Boston, when the reserves supplied 56 points. ""Today we focused on trying to come out and have both units be solid and be locked in."" Bradley Beal led Washington (5-10) with 25 points and John Wall scored 21. Marcin Gortat had 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Wizards got within 69-62 on a three-point play by Wall late in the third quarter, but the Spurs soon pushed the lead to 12 on Aldridge's 3-pointer and it was 90-76 after three quarters. San Antonio was 23 of 29 from the free throw line while the Wizards were 10 of 14. ""They're so disciplined and (have) so much experience, and a lot of guys can make shots,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""But we put them on the free throw line 29 times and we couldn't get there. That's definitely a big part of their win."" Parker scored 11 points in the second quarter as the Spurs opened a double-digit lead. ""At the end of the day, it's about defense and we didn't play it at the end of the day,"" Beal said. TIP-INS Spurs: Improved to 6-0 vs. Eastern Conference teams. ... G Manu Ginobili was rested as the Spurs played the second of back-to-back games and C Dewayne Dedmon (sprained left knee) missed his sixth straight. ... Have won 19 of their last 21 games against the Wizards. ... Are 7-0 with the starting five of Leonard, Aldridge, Pau Gasol, Danny Green and Parker. ... Gasol had eight points and 10 rebounds after being held scoreless Friday. Wizards: F Markieff Morris received a double technical and was ejected for arguing after picking up two quick fouls in the third quarter. ... It was the first of four straight games against Western Conference teams for Washington. ... The starters shot just one free throw in the first half. ... Wizards fell to 5-6 with Wall and Beal in the lineup. PLEASANT SURPRISE For a team with a lot of new faces, the Spurs haven't missed a beat. ""The fact that a lot of the new guys have caught on so quickly,"" Popovich said when asked what surprised him about his team's start. ""Kyle Anderson and John Simmons haven't played much before and David Lee and Davis Bertans and Dwayne Dedmon and Pau just all got here, so they've blended in very well pretty quickly. That's what's most surprising about it."" MAHINMI MAKES HIS DEBUT Washington's bench got a boost with the Wizards debut of center Ian Mahinmi. Signed as a free agent in July, Mahinmi, 30, missed the first 14 games while recovering from left knee surgery. He played 15 minutes, scored one point and grabbed a rebound. ""I knew going into the game that he was going to be rusty, and he was, but he gave us good effort,"" Brooks said.","400899690"
"Frank Kaminsky III knocks down two big 3-pointers for the Hornets to maintain their lead over the Knicks. (0:32) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- It felt like those old college days for Jeremy Lamb. Starting in the same backcourt as Kemba Walker for the first time since Connecticut beat Butler in the 2011 NCAA championship game, Lamb turned in one of his best games since joining the NBA. Walker scored 28 points, Lamb added 18 points and a career-high 17 rebounds and the Charlotte Hornets snapped a four-game losing streak with a 107-102 victory over the New York Knicks on Saturday night. ""It's always good to play with Kemba,"" Lamb said. ""He's a great leader and carried us tonight. We definitely needed that win tonight."" Lamb got the first start since joining the Hornets last season because Nicolas Batum was out with an eye injury. He made the most of the opportunity, joining Russell Westbrook as the only guards this season with at least 15 rebounds in a game. Lamb had missed 10 games this season dealing with a hamstring injury, which coach Steve Clifford said made his performance all the more remarkable. ""He literally hasn't done anything with contact for close to a month,"" Clifford said. ""His game is based on skill. He's a skill-based player and he showed that tonight. He's always been a good offensive rebounder. Tonight he was both."" Walker called Lamb's effort ""incredible."" ""We needed rebounding bad and the bigs did a great job of boxing their man out and he came out of nowhere to snatch every rebound,"" Walker said. ""He played awesome."" The Hornets (9-7) avenged an overtime loss to the Knicks on Friday night at Madison Square Garden in which Carmelo Anthony hit the go-ahead jumper with 3.1 seconds left and finished with 35 points. Anthony didn't fare as well the second time around, limited to 18 points on 7-of-24 shooting. Kristaps Porzingis had 25 points and Derrick Rose added 18 points, eight assists and eight rebounds for the Knicks. The Knicks battled back from a 21-point, first-half deficit to take the lead briefly with 7:36 left in the game when Anthony drilled a turnaround jumper from the baseline. But the Hornets regained control behind Walker, who made an underhand layup and two free throws to put the Hornets up 105-99 with 21 seconds left. Justin Holiday's 3-pointer cut the lead to three with 11.2 seconds left, but Lamb made two free throws to help seal the game. ""We have to get off to better starts,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""That start, I think they had 24 points in the first six and a half minutes of the game. That's kind of probably where the game was lost right there. We battled back, but it takes a lot of energy."" TIP-INS Knicks: Porzingis has tallied 20-plus points in nine contests this season. ... Joakim Noah was held without a point in 13 minutes of action. Hornets: Forward Marvin Williams is expected to miss about a week after an MRI revealed a bone bruise in his left knee. ... Walker recorded his 13th game with 20-plus points this season. ... Marco Belinelli's minutes were limited by a hamstring injury. CLIFFORD'S COMMENTS Clifford ripped into his players during a pregame press conference for a lack of hustle and his team seemed to get the message. ""Coach just really pushes us because he has high expectations for us,"" Lamb said. ""He just told (us) we're better than how we're playing and that if we played together and played like a team that nobody could beat us."" SHOOT THE BALL Hornacek was pleased that Brandon Jennings and Courtney Lee shot the ball more. ""We're trying to encourage them, `Hey, when you have the open shot, shoot it,"" Hornacek said. ""Both of them I think took a step forward at least with that tonight."" FRANK THE TANK Frank Kaminsky added 14 points, including two clutch 3-pointers late in the fourth quarter as the Hornets snapped the Knicks' three-game winning streak. POINT GUARDS UP At one point, the Hornets had three point guards on the floor in Walker, Ramon Sessions and Brian Roberts to combat the Knicks' small ball lineup.","400899691"
"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Russell Westbrook recorded his second straight triple-double and NBA-best seventh of the season with 17 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Detroit Pistons 106-88 on Saturday night. It was Westbrook's 44th career triple-double, tying LeBron James for sixth all time in the league. It took Westbrook 605 career games; James did it in his 1,000th game. Westbrook shot just 8-for-22 from the field after scoring at least 30 points for eight straight games. It was just the second time this year Westbrook failed to score 20. Anthony Morrow scored 21 points off the bench to lead the Thunder (10-8), who were playing their fourth game in six nights in four different cities. Victor Oladipo added 18 while Steven Adams had 16 points and nine rebounds. It was just the fourth time in 18 games this season that Westbrook did not lead the team in scoring. Tobias Harris scored 21 points for the Pistons, who have lost five of their past seven. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. Reggie Miller surprises Steph Curry to congratulate him for moving into second place on the NBA's all-time 3-pointer list.

"MIAMI --  Memphis coach David Fizdale offered a one-word assessment about being on the visitors' bench in Miami. ""Weird,"" Fizdale said. Suffice to say, Fizdale and Miami coach Erik Spoelstra are both thrilled their matchups for the season are over. Marc Gasol scored a season-high 28 points, Mike Conley had 11 of his 21 in the final 3:06 and the Grizzlies beat the Heat 110-107 on Saturday night. Troy Williams added 18 for the Grizzlies, who earned a split of the home-and-home with the Heat and gave Fizdale a win in the building where he served as a Miami assistant for the past eight seasons. ""It's just hard to compete against your brothers like that and fight like that,"" Fizdale said. ""I can only imagine if we both ever make it to the finals, how tough that would be. But I'm glad it's over. It worked out how it's supposed to -- he won on my spot, I won on his spot, we break even and now we root for each other again."" Dion Waiters scored a season-high 28 for Miami, which got 15 points and 12 rebounds from Hassan Whiteside, and 15 points from Josh Richardson. But after winning in Memphis on Friday, the Heat fell short against a Grizzlies team that's now 5-0 this season in games decided by five points or less. ""You've got to tip your hat to that team,"" Spoelstra said. ""Every time they've been in a close game this year, they've found a way to gut it out and get a win."" Conley was under no minutes restriction on Saturday, and that was big for Memphis. The Grizzlies led 99-98 when he checked in with 4:01 left, and he scored their last 11 points -- the first salvos in that flurry being a 3-pointer, then a three-point play, and then a deep 3 to put his team up 108-101 with 1:25 left. ""Conley made every ... big ... play down the stretch,"" Spoelstra said. ""It's early right now, but if he's not an All-Star it'll be a crime."" Waiters' 3-pointer in the final minute got the Heat within three, and his layup on the next Miami possession cut Memphis' lead down to 108-107. But Conley made a pair from the line with 11.4 seconds left, and the Grizzlies escaped when Richardson's 3-point try hit the rim and bounced off as time expired. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Gasol's previous season high was 27, set Wednesday in Philadelphia. He was held to nine points by the Heat on Friday, and hasn't posted consecutive single-digit scoring games yet this season. ... Memphis G Vince Carter is now nine games shy of making his 1,300th regular-season appearance. Heat: Spotted on the concourse was former NBA referee Joe Crawford, who's now working for the league (and was seeking a hot dog for halftime). ... Floyd Mayweather's not-very-subtly designed van bearing his The Money Team logos was parked near the Heat player lot. ... This was Miami's first time playing the same opponent on consecutive nights since games with Orlando, Feb. 14 and 15, 2006. MISSING PLAYERS Memphis' Zach Randolph missed his second straight game as he continues to grieve his late mother, and the Grizzlies are also still without former Heat player James Ennis (right calf). Miami was again without point guard Goran Dragic (left elbow), forward Justise Winslow (left wrist) and forward Willie Reed (right knee). 5 FOR 5 Both teams had all five starters reach double figures.

"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Do-everything Draymond Green is fiery, vocal and brings energy on both ends of the court. On a night the Golden State Warriors were without their emotional leader, it took them a while to find a flow. Stephen Curry had 34 points, eight rebounds and six assists, and Golden State overcame Green's absence to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 115-102 on Saturday night for their 11th straight victory. ""It wasn't as loud, obviously,"" Klay Thompson said of missing Green. ""Collectively we had to raise our voices to make up for it."" Curry shot 13 for 19 with four 3-pointers, while Kevin Durant added 28 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and a career-high six blocked shots -- the Warriors' first time ever having someone finish with at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and five blocks. Thompson scored 23 points with four 3s. Durant figured he had to do more. ""Especially tonight. We missed Draymond,"" Durant said. ""We were a little stagnant early."" Green sat out a day after bruising his left ankle at Los Angeles in a collision with teammate Ian Clark, who also missed the game after being hit in the throat on the play. Zach LaVine scored 31 points with five 3s, while Karl-Anthony Towns had 12 of his 18 points in the first quarter on 6-for-10 shooting. He then quieted down and missed five of his next six attempts before a three-point play with 4:03 remaining to make it a 10-point game. Without Green, Golden State lacked offensive flow and an interior defensive presence against Towns until finding some rhythm late in the first half and early in the second. ""It's an All-Star team and you've just got to go up against them, be confident, and that's what we are,"" LaVine said. The Warriors went off for a franchise-record 47 assists in their previous home game three nights earlier against the Lakers, but managed only 25 Saturday. Golden State didn't get its first field goal of the second quarter until 7:41 remaining on Durant's three-point play. ""It's good to see that we can step up in a guy like Draymond's absence and still have contributions from other guys on the floor,"" Curry said. Kevon Looney made his first career start in place of Green and had six points, three rebounds and two assists in 18 minutes. Curry's 17 third-quarter points were his second-most in a quarter this season. Minnesota handed Golden State one of only two home defeats last regular season, 124-117 in overtime on April 5 -- just the Timberwolves' second win in the last 17 meetings, including Saturday. The Warriors won their sixth straight home game since a 129-100 season-opening loss to San Antonio, and ninth in 11 meetings with Minnesota dating to 2013. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Former Warriors G Brandon Rush was welcomed back on the video board during a first-quarter timeout, and he smiled and waved. ... A night after getting 15 steals -- five by Ricky Rubio -- and forcing 26 turnovers, Minnesota managed only nine steals among the 18 turnovers by Golden State. ... The Wolves will host the Warriors on Dec. 11, and Golden State has a nine-game winning streak at Minnesota. Warriors: Curry had his sixth 30-point performance of the season, while he, Durant and Thompson each went over 20 points in the same game for the seventh time. ... Golden State's streak of 10 straight games with 30 or more assists was snapped. ... They shot above 50 percent for the third straight game. ... Golden State wore its slate alternate jerseys for the first time at home, improving to 24-2 all-time in that uniform. THIBODEAU'S INFLUENCE First-year Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau paid the Warriors a couple of visits last season in his year out of NBA coaching, a chance to observe Steve Kerr's practices and catch up with old pal Ron Adams, Golden State's assistant and defensive guru. ""It was fun to pick his brain and share knowledge and insight,"" Kerr said. Thibodeau called the Warriors ""something we aspire to be."" ""Golden State was a good model for us,"" he said of focusing on improvement. ""They went step by step.""","400899694"
"Robert Covington was having nightmares of LeBron James' history chasing down blocks when he missed a wide-open attempt against the Cavaliers. (0:26) PHILADELPHIA -- The Cavaliers have so many ways to beat teams, and this time it was Kyrie Irving's turn to win a game. Irving scored 19 of his season-high 39 points in the fourth quarter and LeBron James had a triple-double with 26 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists, leading Cleveland to a 112-108 comeback victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday. Kevin Love chipped in 25 points and 11 rebounds to help the defending champions (13-2) improve to their fourth straight win. ""When you have great players, it can come from any of us at any given moment,"" Irving said. ""When one of us gets it going, we always continue to go to that person. It can be anybody's night. We're always trusting each other. That fourth quarter was just for me to be aggressive."" Joel Embiid led seven players in double figures with 22 points for the 76ers, who have lost three straight. Embiid also had nine rebounds, four assists and three blocks. ""When those guys are on like that, it's really hard to beat them,"" Embiid said. The Cavaliers never led through the first three quarters, but Irving got hot early in the fourth to put Cleveland in front. He gave Cleveland its first lead on a layup 2:38 into the period and had 10 of the first 13 Cavaliers fourth-quarter points on a variety of jumpers and drives. His layup with 7:51 left gave Cleveland its biggest lead to that point, 90-86. Asked what he liked about Irving's fourth quarter, James said, ""Could you not like everything?"" ""Whoever has the hot hand, we want to continue to get it to him,"" James said. ""Kyrie understands what needs to be done in order for us to win. He showcased that today."" Cleveland trailed by as many as 14 points in the first half. The Cavaliers got as close as 72-70 on James Jones' 3-pointer with 3:53 left in the third quarter. But the 76ers scored nine of the next 10 points, capped by Dario Saric's 3-pointer that made it 81-71. James had four and Love two as the Cavaliers ran off the final six points of the quarter to enter the final period down 81-77. STITCHED UP Love was limited to 28 minutes after receiving five stitches for a cut over his right eye suffered early in the first quarter. SLOW START The Cavs missed their first 14 shots, but Philadelphia couldn't take full advantage and led just 10-2 before James' driving layup with 6:50 left in the first quarter resulted in Cleveland's first field goal. VERBAL EXCHANGE James and Embiid got into a verbal altercation late in the first quarter. Richard Jefferson was whistled for a foul on Embiid's drive, and James questioned the call. Embiid went toward James' direction, but officials stepped between the players. The incident drew a rise in the crowd. James provided a couple of first-half highlights, dunking with 6:03 left in the first quarter and then following a missed free throw with a dunk with 1:17 to go in the first half. He has three triple-doubles this season. OFF NIGHT J.R. Smith went 0 for 11 from the field, including 0 for 7 from 3-point range. ""As a shooter you're not going to make every shot,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Defensively, he was great like he's been all year. His shots are going to fall. When they do, we'll be really tough to stop."" MORE MINUTES? Embiid was limited to 25 minutes, eight of which came in the fourth quarter, as part of his minutes restriction that is part of his rehab plan after missing the last two seasons with a foot injury. ""You come up with some really hard decisions that maybe don't favor me or us or whatever,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""But for the long term lens that we all have, we have to be responsible with Joel Embiid. Winning a game in the middle of November in 2016 sometimes that takes a back seat."" Embiid didn't play in Friday's 105-89 loss to the Bulls and won't play Monday night at Toronto, marking the sixth game he will miss this season. IT MUST BE THE SHOES James was excited about many Ohio State players wearing his shoes in Saturday's Ohio State-Michigan football game, a game in which the Cavaliers attended as a team. ""They looked good in those shoes,"" James said. ""It was a proud moment for me. I don't get too happy about a lot of things, but I was happy about that."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Channing Frye (personal) was not with the team. Frye's father died Thursday. ... Cleveland beat Philadelphia 102-101 on Nov. 5. ...

"PHOENIX --  Poise down the stretch has not always been a virtue of the Denver Nuggets. It certainly was Sunday. It seemed that every time Phoenix pulled close, Denver's Wilson Chandler or Jameer Nelson would make a big shot and the Nuggets held on for a 120-114 victory. ""I am pretty cool all the time. That is just my demeanor, always laid back,"" Chandler said. ""I don't really think about it (taking and making a big shot). It is just another shot, if I miss it or if I make it."" Chandler scored 25 points and Nelson 21. ""The fourth quarter we showed a lot of poise down the stretch,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""Guys stepped up and made big plays, made big free throws and we also got the ball inbounds, which has been an issue sometimes this year."" Denver withstood an impressive second-half scoring onslaught by Suns guards Eric Bledsoe and Devin Booker. Bledsoe led Phoenix with a career-high 35 points, 21 in the second half. Booker added 30, 25 in the last two quarters. Coach Earl Watson benched Marquease Chriss to start the second half after the 19-year-old rookie drew a technical foul from the bench in the first half. ""Bench T's put you on the bench in the second half,"" Watson said. ""It's a teachable moment, it's an accountable moment. But he'll learn. He knows I love him. He'll learn."" With Alex Len replacing Chriss, the Suns had a big lineup and it worked. The Nuggets led by 20 at the half but Booker and Bledsoe led a rally that cut the lead to three early in the fourth quarter. Denver gained a slightly larger cushion from there before the Suns cut it to four in the final minute but could get no closer. Emmanuel Mudiay added 19 points for the Nuggets. The Nuggets used a 16-point outburst that started late in the first quarter and extended well into the second to build their 20-point advantage. They outscored the Suns 34-15 in the second quarter to lead 53-33 at the break. Bledsoe and Booker brought the Suns almost all the way back. Four consecutive Phoenix 3-pointers -- two by Booker, one by Bledsoe and one by P.J. Tucker -- cut the lead to 80-76, and five straight points by Brandon Knight -- a three-point play and two free throws -- sliced the Denver it to 86-83 with 10:49 to play. The Nuggets scored the next eight points, including 3s by Chandler and Jamal Murray, lifted the visitors out of trouble. But Phoenix managed one more threat. Booker's driving layup down the lane cut it to 114-110 with 38.4 to play. The teams traded a pair of free throws to make it 116-112 with 12.4 seconds left before Murray sealed it with two from the line. ""It is very disappointing,"" Bledsoe said. ""At the same time, we came out the second half and played like we are supposed to play."" BLEDSOE'S STREAK Bledsoe is on a roll. The Phoenix point guard had his streak of outstanding performances grow to five. Going into the game, he had averaged 23.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 6.8 assists and 1.5 steals in his previous four games. His previous career high was 34 against Houston on March 21, 2015. Bledsoe has 10 career games scoring at least 30, including a 31-point effort at Portland this season. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver has beaten Phoenix four times in a row. ... Chandler and Nelson were a combined 7 of 13 on 3s, one or the other of them consistently sinking one from long-range when Phoenix crept close. ...

Rudy Gay added 22 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, and the Kings handed the Nets their seventh straight loss. Darren Collison added 18 points for the Kings, who won in Brooklyn for the first time since the Nets moved there in 2012. Sean Kilpatrick scored 22 points, Brook Lopez had 17 and Bojan Bogdanovic added 13 for the Nets. Barnes was ejected for a flagrant foul 2 on Kilpatrick with 9:34 left in the fourth quarter and Sacramento leading 97-79. Brooklyn then went on a 14-2 run to cut the deficit to 99-93. ""I think for the most part (it) woke people up,"" Kilpatrick said. ""I was kind of out of it once that happened. My mindset changed completely. At the end of the day we should react like that a lot more, especially if we want to win in this league. Like I said before, just got to come out with some type of edge."" However, Sacramento responded with a 16-0 run of its own to extend the lead to 115-93. ""I was scared for a second because I think they went on a 13-2 run and I was just like, `Man, did I just cost the team the game?"" Barnes said. ""So I was a little nervous, but we regained focus and went on a run of our own and closed the game out strong."" Everything went Sacramento's way in the third quarter, including a lob attempt from Barnes that went in off the backboard for a 3-pointer with 4:03 remaining. Sacramento led 92-77 heading to the fourth. The third-quarter woes that have plagued Brooklyn all season continued as the Nets were outscored 34-18. Cousins had 12 points in the first, but failed to score in the second quarter. Omri Casspi, who has played sparingly for Sacramento this season, had eight points in the second quarter. Kilpatrick led all scorers with 15 points at the half. TIP-INS Kings: Arron Afflalo returned to the starting lineup after coming off the bench in two of his previous three games. ... Skal Labissiere, Malachi Richardson and Georgios Papagiannis were inactive. Nets: Brooklyn has made 10 or more 3-pointers in 10 straight games. ... Rookie Isaiah Whitehead matched his career high with 11 points. ... Justin Hamilton matched his career high with 10 rebounds. ... Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (sore right ankle), Jeremy Lin (strained left hamstring) and Caris LeVert (left foot rehab) were inactive. MINOR DEVELOPMENT Former No. 1 pick Anthony Bennett and Chris McCullough shuffled between the Nets and their D-League affiliate on Sunday. ""I'm a big believer in the D-League. I've seen it help so many guys,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I remember Jeremy (Lin) when we were with the Knicks and him going down to the D-League and kind of having a big game and coming back. There are many instances of that and it helps guys' confidence."" CENTERS SHOOTING 3S A TREND? ""Sure, because I think it opens up more space,"" Atkinson said. ""I think it just gives teams more room to operate and brings more variety to the offense. You're not just defending one thing. Now you've got to defend DeMarcus Cousins' post-ups, his isolations and now he's popping to the 3-point line, so it's challenge. I think you'll see more and more of it. It's definitely a trend.""","400899697"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Milwaukee and Orlando switched their starting lineups, and changed worked for the Bucks. For the Magic, not as much. John Henson returned to the Bucks' starting lineup and had 20 points and seven rebounds as in the Milwaukee's 104-96 victory on Sunday night. Giannis Antetokounmpo added 18 points and nine rebounds and the Bucks got double-figure scoring from three reserves in beating Orlando for the second time in a week. Michael Beasley scored 13 points, Malcolm Brogdon added 12 and Greg Monroe had 11 points and seven rebounds. Henson, who had started five straight games, didn't play at all in the Bucks' 105-99 loss to Toronto on Friday, but was back in against Orlando and scored his season high. ""That's what we're used to seeing from John when he does play,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""He was great on both sides of the ball. He's the total package both offensively and defensively."" Henson didn't argue with the coach's decision to bench him. ""It's a long season with too many opportunities to get stressed about it,"" Henson said. ""(Kidd) said all the roles are open and you've got to be ready for whatever comes at you. Hopefully, I can keep this going."" Orlando coach Frank Vogel, whose team has stumbled early in games most of the season, tried three new starters -- D.J. Augustin, Aaron Gordon and Bismack Biyombo -- but still lost its fourth straight. Augustin had 11 points and five assists. Biyombo had four points and four rebounds. Gordon had eight rebounds, but was 0 for 12 from the field and didn't score. ""It was an attempt to give us a different feel, create a little bit of a different identity and see if it would work because things have not been working,"" Vogel said. ""There were some things that were good about and some that weren't. We've got to keep looking at ways to get better."" Evan Fournier led the Magic with 27 points and seven assists. Serge Ibaka scored 19 points, Nikola Vucevic added 17 points and 16 rebounds, and Elfrid Payton had 16 points. The last Orlando run came in the middle of the fourth quarter, when Vucevic nailed a 3-pointer to cut the Magic's deficit to 89-86 with 6:38 to play. Henson responded with a layup, Mirza Teletovic contributed a 20-foot jumper and Henson followed with a dunk to make it 95-86 and the rally was over. Orlando never got closer than six points the rest of the game. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee's reserves, led by Brogdon's 10 points, outscored the starters 19-17 in the first period. ... Antetokounmpo is averaging 24.5 points, 7.8 assists and 7.3 rebounds in his last four games. ... SF Jabari Parker already has made more 3-pointers this season (17) than he made in his first two seasons (13) in the NBA. Magic: SF Jeff Green shot 28.8 percent from the field (17 of 59) and 13.2 percent (3 of 22) from 3-point territory in his eight games in the starting lineup. ... Orlando has scored over 100 points only four times this season. The Magic are 3-1 in those games. VUCEVIC RESPONDS Vucevic has started 284 of his 289 games in an Orlando uniform, including all 16 this season, before Vogel's switch Sunday. ""Obviously I wasn't happy with the decision they made,"" Vucevic said. ""I don't think that there was a good reason for me to go to the bench. All I can do is control what I can control, play to the best of my ability, help the team win and stay professional.""","400899698"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Glenn Robinson III and Myles Turner provided the offense and the Indiana Pacers overwhelmed the Los Angeles Clippers with their defense. Robinson and Turner each scored 17 points and the Pacers forced 20 turnovers in a 91-70 victory Sunday night over the Clippers, who have lost two in a row for the first time this season. ""We just tried to have active hands and be aggressive defensively,"" said Jeff Teague, who had 13 points and two steals. ""That's a great team over there, great players that they have. We just did a good job of being active and causing a little havoc on defense."" The Pacers have forced at least 20 turnovers seven times this season and this time it came while the Clippers tried to bounce back from a 108-97 loss in Detroit on Friday. Blake Griffin had 16 points and nine rebounds, and Chris Paul added 13 points. The Clippers shot just 31.4 percent from the field, were 4 of 24 from 3-point range, and couldn't get going offensively for the second straight game. ""It was all bad,"" Paul said. ""We shot bad, we defended bad. We have to sweep it under the rug. We have to fix it and stop the bleeding at some point."" Al Jefferson and Rodney Stuckey created a spark off the bench for the Pacers. Jefferson finished with 16 points and eight rebounds, while Stuckey had 12 points to help Indiana win two straight for just the second time this season. Indiana went on a 12-2 run at the start of the second half and took a 62-44 lead after Robinson's 3-pointer with 6:48 left in the third quarter. Monta Ellis made a 3-pointer at the start of the fourth quarter and Jefferson scored to put the Pacers ahead 79-58 with 10:49 to play.

"DALLAS --  Wesley Matthews shot the Dallas Mavericks back into the win column. Matthews scored 12 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, including eight during a rally that gave Dallas the lead for good, and the Mavericks beat the New Orleans Pelicans 91-81 on Sunday night to end an eight-game losing streak. ""I'm never worried about my shot,"" Matthews said. ""I know the time I put into it. I know the confidence that I have, and I know the team has confidence in me."" He made all four field goal attempts, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range, in the fourth quarter. Matthews made a 3-pointer and another basket to give Dallas a 72-71 edge with 5:39 remaining. New Orleans regained the lead on Anthony Davis' two free throws, but for the last time because Matthews made another 3-pointer. ""His shot-making in the fourth was huge,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He popped the game open and gave us some separation. ""He has an iron will. He just stayed into it."" Dallas improved to 3-13, still the NBA's worst record. ""Games like that, a couple of weeks ago we would have hung our heads, let a lead slip and let the team slip,"" Matthews said. ""But we held our ground, we stayed firm."" Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 23 points. Justin Anderson scored 14 off the bench. The Pelicans, who lost eight straight to begin the season, fell to 6-12. ""They outplayed us. They deserved to win. That's the thought. That's all that needs to be said,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. Davis, who had 36 points and 13 rebounds, was more expansive. ""We weren't doing what our game plan was,"" he said. ""Harrison and Wes got a couple shots. It was our defense that killed us tonight."" Jrue Holiday had 17 points and six assists for New Orleans. Neither team led by more than two points during the game's first 10 minutes. Dallas had an 11-0 run to go from trailing 17-15 to a 26-17 lead.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  James Harden easily exposed Portland's struggles on defense. Harden had 38 points and 10 assists for his seventh consecutive double-double, and the Houston Rockets beat the Trail Blazers 130-114 on Sunday night. It was his 14th double-double this season. His mentality? ""Make the right play, that's all,"" he said. ""As a point guard I'm going to see a lot of defenses, so I've just got to figure out what they're doing and how to attack it and just go from there."" Eric Gordon added 26 points including six 3-pointers for the Rockets, who have made at least 10 3-pointers in 16 straight games to match the NBA record set by the Warriors and Cavaliers last season. They finished the night with 17. Gordon's 3-pointer gave the Rockets a 104-95 lead with just over 10 minutes left in the game. Damian Lillard's 3-pointer and Mason Plumlee's reverse layup closed the gap to 104-100, but the Blazers couldn't get closer and Trevor Ariza hit a 3 from the corner to put the Rockets up 111-100. CJ McCollum scored 28 points and Lillard had 27 for the Blazers, who have lost six of their last eight games. Portland gave up 30 or more points to the Rockets in each quarter. ""They're a difficult team to guard,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""I think James does a great job of playing the game and figuring out what needs to be done."" The Rockets attempted an NBA-record 50 3-pointers and made 21 in a 117-104 victory at Sacramento on Friday night to open a five-game road trip. Harden had 23 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. First-year Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said he feels like the Rockets are finding a groove in his system. ""I think they're getting more comfortable with how we're doing things. They're moving the ball a little better,"" D'Antoni said. ""We can still do better."" The Blazers beat New Orleans 119-104 at home on Friday night after struggling on a 1-4 road trip. Portland is missing starting forward Al-Farouq Aminu, who has been sidelined for more than two weeks with a calf injury. Ed Davis started in his place against the Rockets. Lillard and McCollum combined for 20 points as the teams finished the first quarter knotted at 35. The Rockets went on a 9-0 run late in the second and led 65-62 at the half, paced by Harden's 21 points. Ryan Anderson hit a 3-pointer that made it 83-75 for the Rockets, who led by as many as 10 points in the third quarter. The Blazers pressured, coming within 94-93 late after Lillard made a pair of free throws. Harden finished with five 3-pointers. ""Right now we're not getting it done on the defensive end,"" Lillard said. ""I think that's what it comes down to. You look at the Cleveland game, we scored 120-something points and we lose. That's a lot of points to score and not win the game. Tonight we had 114 and we lose. Obviously we're capable of scoring, we're going to put points on the board, but we've got to find a way to come up with more stops and be more consistent.""

"LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Lakers have the NBA's highest-scoring bench and remarkable balance throughout their roster, as the Atlanta Hawks discovered for the second time this month. Just 18 games removed from the worst season in franchise history, the Lakers are capable of handling the absence of two injured starters without a hitch. Lou Williams scored 13 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, Jordan Clarkson added 18 points and the Lakers beat the Hawks 109-94 on Sunday night without D'Angelo Russell or Julius Randle. Nick Young scored 17 points as the Lakers swept their season series with Atlanta in a confident performance that featured 10 players getting significant minutes and eight players scoring at least seven points. That prolific group of reserves piled up 65 points, but coach Luke Walton was more pleased by its shutdown work in an 18-2 run shortly before halftime. ""The energy that the second unit brought on the defensive end in the second quarter changed the outcome of that game,"" Walton said. ""It's what we've been preaching all year, but it was really the first time that we saw all five guys on the court talking defensively. ... I think we carried the momentum through from that point on."" Kent Bazemore scored 21 points and Dwight Howard added 19 points and nine rebounds amid constant boos for the Hawks, who have lost five of six after a 9-2 start to the season. ""It's not going to happen overnight, but we showed signs of being able to do it,"" Bazemore said. ""That's the task for us now. I understand the ups and downs of it, and it's all about staying positive, staying together. Everybody knows we have the team and the personnel to get it done."" The Lakers won at Atlanta 123-116 earlier this month, with Williams scoring 16 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter in his home state against his former team. In the rematch, the Hawks couldn't match their strong start during the second half when the Lakers rolled out their depth. ""It's no longer a stroll through LA,"" Bazemore said. ""They're playing well. They've got a ton of pieces, and they all fit well together."" UNCLE P RETURNS Randle missed his third game with a hip pointer, and Russell is out for at least two weeks to rest a sore left knee. But Young returned to the lineup after missing Friday's loss to Golden State with a sprained toe, and he immediately made another big impact in his resurgent season. Young scored 12 points in the second quarter, hitting three of his four first-half 3-pointers while the Lakers swiftly turned a 13-point deficit into an 11-point lead. BOOING DWIGHT Although Howard wore a new uniform, he constantly received the same vociferous disdain that will follow him at Staples Center for his entire career. The big center spurned the Lakers in free agency in 2013 after one tumultuous season alongside Kobe Bryant, taking $20 million less than Los Angeles offered him and signing with Houston. Howard scored 13 points in the first quarter, but made little impact afterward. ""I didn't"" hear boos, Howard claimed. ""I closed my ears."" GETTING IT TOGETHER Los Angeles (9-9) won for just the second time in six games during a brutal part of its schedule. The Lakers have a weird road swing with four games in five nights starting Tuesday. ""We are going from the south (New Orleans) to the north (Chicago) to the north (Toronto) back to the south (Memphis),"" Walton said. ""It makes zero sense."" TIP-INS Hawks: Bazemore spent 23 games with the Lakers late in the 2013-14 season after a trade with Golden State. He left as a free agent for Atlanta. ... Atlanta made its third stop on a five-game road trip. Lakers: The club celebrated the 100th birthday of late broadcaster Chick Hearn with tributes throughout the game. ...

"WASHINGTON -- Despite all the turnovers, fouls and general frustration Monday night, Bradley Beal never lost his rhythm. Beal made a career-high seven 3-pointers and finished with 31 points, and the Washington Wizards recovered after giving up a late lead and beat the Sacramento Kings 101-95 in overtime. John Wall added 19 points and 11 assists, shaking off a career-high 11 turnovers to score six points in overtime. Beal had the other three on his last 3-pointer of the night ""John did a great job of finding me (throughout the game),"" said Beal, who took a career-high 13 shots from beyond the arc. ""I'm just shooting with confidence and knocking them down."" Washington had a season-high 24 giveaways, but held the Kings to three points in overtime after seeing an eight-point lead evaporate over the final 5:12 of regulation. The Wizards won their third out of four despite allowing 36 points and a season-high 20 rebounds to Sacramento's DeMarcus Cousins. They also survived committing 15 fouls before halftime, including technicals given to Wall, Marcin Gortat and coach Scott Brooks. ""It was probably like eight, 10 minutes straight where it was just fouls, fouls, fouls or turnovers,"" Wall said. ""It's hard to get in a rhythm but we did a great job of trying to find Brad."" Rudy Gay added 18 points, including a 3-pointer in overtime for the Kings, who were looking for their first back-to-back game sweep of the season. Cousins missed all three of his field goal attempts and a pair of free throws in the extra period. ""I'm sick about that,"" Cousins said. ""I feel like I just choked the overtime."" Cousins had scored 10 points in the Kings' 12-4 run to close regulation, his last on a tough runner over Gortat to tie it at 92 with 10.1 seconds left. Wall missed a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, but hit a runner early in overtime to give Washington the lead. Beal's seventh and final 3, off Markieff Morris' kickout with 1:57 left in overtime made it 97-92 before Wall hit four free throws to seal the win. ""We're doing a better job of making strides,"" Beal said. ""We have mishaps here and there. You're going to have them in a game. But I think we do a better job of really retaliating and getting a stop when we need to and scoring when we need to.""

Washington had nine of its turnovers in the second quarter. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING Wall's first-quarter technical was his fourth of the season, moving him within one of Cousins, who entered Monday tied for the league lead. Gortat's came midway through the second and Brooks got his just before halftime. TOUGH BASKETS Cousins' 36 points put him within two of his season high. But he shot just 16 of 34 from the floor, and 1 of 6 from beyond the arc. The Kings were 3 of 21 as a team from 3-point range.

The point guard set a club record by hitting all six of his 3-pointers for a game-high 24 points, and Toronto ran its winning streak against the 76ers to 13 straight games with a 122-95 victory Monday. ""I've been working on it and I just continue to keep shooting the ball,"" said Lowry, who topped the previous Toronto mark of 5 for 5 on 3s held by five players. ""It's just catch and shoot. We have a team where no one cares who's the man. On any given night you can go off for 30 and we'll all be supportive for you."" On a night when leading scorer DeMar DeRozan was held to 14 points on 4-for-13 shooting, a host of other Raptors played a supporting role. Terrence Ross had a season-high 22 points, including a trio of 3s among his eight field goals. ""We did a really good job on DeMar DeRozan and that was obviously a major part of our game plan,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""But he did a good job finding his teammates and more importantly his teammates really stepped up."" Lowry added eight assists and four rebounds. Six players scored in double figures for the Raptors (11-6), who took the lead for good late in the first quarter on the way to their third consecutive win. Toronto shot 13 for 19 (69 percent) on 3s and all five starters scored in double figures for the first time this season. Raptors reserves combined to score a season-high 51 points. Robert Covington led the 76ers with 20 points, including 6-for-9 shooting from 3-point range. Jahlil Okafor had 15 points and five rebounds, and Richaun Holmes added 11 points and nine boards for the Sixers (4-14). Philadelphia has dropped four straight overall and has lost all six games on the road this season. The team's losing streak away from home is at 22 games dating to last season. ""They are a really good team,"" Okafor said. ""They were in the Eastern Conference finals for a reason. We saw that tonight. ... But we're looking forward to four home games coming up, so we're going to do our best to protect our home court."" The teams combined to make 27 shots from 3-point range. The Raptors were up 33-26 after the first quarter and led the rest of the way. They were ahead 91-71 through three as all 10 players who saw action scored a basket. By the end of the night, 11 different Raptors hit the score sheet. Toronto finished the opening period on an 8-0 run, capped by Patrick Patterson hitting a 3 from beyond halfcourt as the buzzer sounded. ""I thought our guys came out and competed,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. ""We've got to have that type of defensive effort and focus each night.""

C Joel Embiid, the team's leading scorer, was rested as Philadelphia continues to keep him out of back-to-back games due to an injury rehabilitation program. ... The 76ers shot 14 for 34 (41 percent) on 3s, following up Sunday's performance when they went 15 for 34 (44 percent). Raptors: C Jonas Valanciunas scored 12 points, his 10th straight game in double figures, but left with 6:19 to go in the third quarter after tweaking his ankle. He did not return. ... The Raptors opened a six-game homestand, their longest of the season, after coming off a 3-2 trip. ... Toronto has the most wins against the 76ers since the start of the 2013-14 season (13) and is the only Eastern Conference team with an undefeated record vs. Philadelphia during that stretch.

"NEW YORK -- Russell Westbrook doesn't just do triple-doubles in games anymore. Now he's got one for the entire season. Westbrook raised his averages to 30.9 points, 11.3 assists and 10.3 rebounds through more than a month of play with his NBA-leading eighth triple-double as the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the New York Knicks 112-103 on Monday night. Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson is the only NBA player to average a triple-double for a season, so Westbrook was asked if his current pace is sustainable. ""Winning is sustainable,"" he said. ""That's all I know, man, and my job is to make sure we go out and find the best way to win games and right now we've won three straight and that's the most important part for me."" Westbrook had his third straight triple-double and the 45th of his career and nearly did it by halftime, finishing with 27 points, 18 rebounds and 14 assists. He had 14 points, 10 boards and nine assists at the break. ""He is going to put up numbers because of his ability and just how hard he plays and his gifts, but he's doing a lot of other things that the stat sheet doesn't measure,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I know everybody is focused on that right now and rightfully so. It's historic what he's doing. But he's really a complete point guard all the way around."" Enes Kanter added a season-high 27 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, while Steven Adams had 14 points and 10 boards as the Thunder outrebounded the Knicks 53-40. ""We got manhandled. That's tough,"" Knicks center Joakim Noah said. ""Russ definitely puts a lot of pressure on the bigs when he's going downhill like that. At the end of the day it's always tough knowing that we lost the game on the glass."" Derrick Rose scored a season-best 30 points, but the Knicks had their six-game home winning streak snapped. Kristaps Porzingis added 21 points and Carmelo Anthony had 18, but shot just 4 for 19. Westbrook fell just shy of his third straight 15-assist game, but had his highest rebound total of the season -- and one off his career best -- to keep the Thunder rolling after a recent three-game skid. The Knicks led by 11 in the first quarter and things were coming easily, but the Thunder began to grab control with Westbrook's hustle and Kanter's muscle, getting numerous baskets inside to turn around the game. It happened so quickly that Westbrook nearly had the stat sheet stuffed before the break. Joffrey Lauvergne missed a 3-pointer that would've given Westbrook a 10th assist with 32 seconds left in the half, but the point guard who was MVP of the All-Star Game on this floor two years ago had a shot at the halftime triple-double after grabbing his 10th rebound on the defensive end with a little more than 20 seconds left. He brought the ball up and tried to create, but turned it over on a pass with about 5 seconds to go. TIP-INS Thunder: They are 11-5 against the Knicks since moving to Oklahoma City in 2008. ... Donovan grew up in New York and played one season for the Knicks in 1987-88. Knicks: Coach Jeff Hornacek said reserve F Lance Thomas, who hasn't played since Nov. 12 because of a left ankle injury, has been working on the exercise bike and shooting and could be back at practice soon, though there is no timetable for his return to games. STRANGE SCHEDULE The Thunder are in the midst of a five-game stretch in which they won't play consecutive games in the same time zone. They came to New York for essentially a one-game road trip in between home games Saturday and Wednesday. HE KNOWS NOAH Noah hasn't made a huge impact yet in his first season with the Knicks, but his college coach thinks he will. Donovan, who coached Florida to back-to-back national championships when Noah played there, said the center has ""incredible heart"" and praised him as a team leader who cares only about winning. ""He's going to put his work in, but he's one of those guys in my opinion that's just truly all about sacrifice, team and winning,"" Donovan said. ""So I think he'll bring that to the Knicks throughout the entire season.""","400899705"
"MIAMI --  Isaiah Thomas endured his worst shooting night of the season, and the Boston Celtics still made scoring on Miami look easy. Thomas had 25 points and eight assists, Avery Bradley added 18 points and the Celtics beat the Heat 112-104 on Monday night -- putting up more points on Miami than any other opponent all season. Thomas shot 7 for 23, but the Celtics put six players in double figures and never trailed after the midpoint of the first quarter. ""We took what the defense gave us,"" said Boston's Kelly Olynyk, who had 14 points. ""We just kind of found ways to score however they were guarding us."" Jae Crowder scored 17 points for Boston, which beat Miami for the fourth consecutive time. Goran Dragic had 27 points and 17 assists for the Heat, setting season bests in both categories. Hassan Whiteside added 25 points and 17 rebounds, and Josh Richardson scored 12. ""That is the Goran Dragic we know,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It's my responsibility to get him to that more frequently."" The Heat tied a season low for a quarter with 12 points in the second, going into halftime down 48-31. They established a season best with 42 points in the third, yet Boston maintained a double-digit lead. ""They went on a run in the third quarter, but any way we can get road wins we're going to take them,"" Thomas said. Marcus Smart picked up three fouls -- a flagrant, a personal and a technical -- 51 seconds apart late in the fourth, and that helped Miami get Boston's lead down to nine for the first time since the second quarter. But the Heat still fell to 2-7 at home. ""We just need to continue to grind, to get better,"" Dragic said. ""We have so many times we're not focused enough. ... You cannot win games like that. We need to figure out something, for sure."" TIP-INS Celtics: Al Horford (newborn child) missed the game but is expected to practice Tuesday. ... Shortly before tip-off, Thomas posed for a photo with a soldier who was near the Boston bench. ... Of the 10 Celtics who played, nine had an assist. Heat: Miami missed its first 14 3-pointers before Richardson finally got one to drop midway through the third quarter. A fan actually made one before any Heat player, connecting -- while seated, no less -- during a second-quarter timeout and winning a tablet. ... Whiteside has at least one blocked shot in 46 consecutive games. HEAT INJURIES Wayne Ellington played 27 minutes and scored nine points in his Heat debut after missing 16 games with a bruised thigh. Dragic (left elbow) returned from a two-game absence, though he still has some pain. Justise Winslow (left wrist) missed his eighth straight game, while Tyler Johnson (tooth) and Dion Waiters (groin) also were ruled out. Whiteside had an MRI on his sore left knee earlier in the day, and the results did not show any structural problems. GREEN RETURNS Gerald Green was back in Miami for the first time since his one-season stint with the Heat ended. He greeted former teammates like Udonis Haslem before the game and said he was happy with his second stint in Boston. ""The first time I was there I was the youngest guy on the team. Now I'm the oldest guy on the team,"" said the 30-year-old Green, who is about 5 months older than Horford.","400899706"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Charlotte reserve center Spencer Hawes walked by the lockers of Hornets guards Kemba Walker and Jeremy Lamb with words of praise. ""Way to play, Huskies,"" Hawes said. The UConn duo of Walker and Lamb scored 21 points apiece, helping Charlotte build an early lead and coast to a 104-85 victory Monday night over the Memphis Grizzlies. Lamb provided a boost in the first half with a pair of 3-pointers off the bench to erase an early Memphis advantage, and Walker added steady scoring throughout the night. They were a combined 14 of 25 from the field, including 7 for 13 on 3-point attempts. ""I just tried to bring energy. When you're coming off the bench, you always want to bring energy,"" Lamb said. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had 14 points and Frank Kaminsky added 12 for the Hornets, who won their second straight after a four-game losing streak. Marc Gasol led Memphis with 19 points and eight rebounds. Mike Conley had 14 points before leaving in the third quarter with a lower back injury. ""I was feeling like today was a day we could come in here and get a home win,"" said Memphis guard Tony Allen, who had nine points and two steals. ""This was a winnable game, and it took me by surprise."" The largest scoring discrepancy in the game was at the free throw line, where the Hornets converted 23 of 31. Meanwhile, Memphis was 6 of 13, a difference that agitated the Grizzlies much of the night. Charlotte, which already led by 19 in the first half, extended the lead in the third quarter as Memphis became unhinged complaining about calls and relying -- mostly unsuccessfully -- on 3-pointers to try to get back in the game. And when Conley went to the locker room, it led to more disorganized play from Memphis. ""That hurt them a lot. He just brings so much for their team. He's their leader,"" Walker said. TIP-INS Hornets: G Nicolas Batum, who missed Saturday's win over the Knicks with a corneal abrasion, returned to action and started. He finished with six points. ... After committing five turnovers in the first quarter, the Hornets had nine more the rest of the way. Charlotte has the second-lowest turnover average in the NBA at 11.6 per game. Grizzlies: Their 14 points in the second quarter was a season low in that period for Memphis, and a season low for any quarter except nine points in the fourth against New Orleans in the fifth game of the season. ... Gasol had a four-point play near the midway point of the fourth. ... F Jarell Martin posted his first career double-double with 11 points and 12 rebounds. LAMB NOT SILENT Lamb set a season high in points for the second straight game. He had 18 against the Knicks on Saturday. In addition to his 21 points vs. Memphis, he grabbed nine rebounds. ""(I'm) just trying to lean on my teammates and my hard work. Everybody is encouraging me,"" Lamb said, later adding: ""Over the summer, I really tried to work on my mindset, whether things are going good or bad."" SWEET REVENGE Memphis defeated the Hornets 105-90 in Charlotte on Nov. 21, and Walker remembered the bitter taste after the Grizzlies scored 69 first-half points and held a 25-point cushion at the break. ""They came to our house and beat us, and we wanted to come back and get this win back,"" he said. ""We didn't play the way we were capable of that night, and they brought it to us. They beat us up pretty bad. It was definitely a revenge game in my mind."" CONLEY OUT Conley left with 8:25 left in the third quarter after taking a charge from Kidd-Gilchrist and did not return. Conley was not in the locker room after the game, and team officials said his condition would be evaluated Tuesday. ""We don't know the status just yet,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""We're waiting to hear.""","400899707"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder was asked about the key to his team's defense. Before the reporter could even finish the question, Snyder blurted out, ""Rudy. Gobert."" He was just as impactful on the offensive end against a Minnesota Timberwolves team that looks increasingly lost. Gobert had 16 points and 17 rebounds to lead the Jazz to their third straight win, 112-103 over the Timberwolves on Monday night. Eight of Gobert's rebounds came on the offensive end, and he made life miserable every time young Timberwolves stars Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns got near the paint. ""I tried to be aggressive,"" Gobert said. ""I think I rushed a couple times. I missed and I had to get a rebound."" George Hill had 24 points, eight rebounds and four assists, and Gordon Hayward scored 24 for the Jazz (10-8). Towns had 19 points and 12 rebounds but shot 8 of 18 and struggled with foul trouble much of the night. Wiggins scored 13 points on 6-for-16 shooting. All five Wolves starters were in double figures, including Zach LaVine with 28 points. ""It's very concerning from the standpoint of you want to be making progress,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""That's the important thing. Every day make progress, make progress. We didn't make progress today."" Hayward is still playing with a broken finger on his left hand that caused him to miss the first six games of the season. He has scored at least 20 points in four straight games to help balance Utah's stingy defense. Shabazz Muhammad scored eight of his 10 points in the fourth quarter, tying the game at 78 with a soaring dunk. Tyus Jones hit a 3-pointer to give Minnesota an 83-82 lead, but Utah responded with an 11-0 run and closed it out. ""Obviously, Rudy is formidable at the rim,"" Snyder said. ""People are looking around for him. But when he goes to block shots, that's when everybody else has to contribute on the glass."" TIP-INS Jazz: Gobert had three blocks. ... Derrick Favors missed his sixth straight game with a bruised left knee. ... Utah outscored Minnesota 60-44 in the paint. Timberwolves: Thibodeau started the fourth quarter with Jones at point guard over Kris Dunn, the fifth overall draft pick who has struggled of late. Jones has played the entire fourth quarter of three straight games. ... LaVine also had eight rebounds and eight assists. TOWNS' LAMENT For the second time this season, Towns put all the blame for the loss on himself, saying he has to do more for the team to succeed. ""The more losses we keep accumulating, the more it feels like it's my fault,"" Towns said. ""I've got to look myself in the mirror and I've got to play better. I've got to play a level where we can't lose and help my teammates out the best I can. I didn't do that tonight. I haven't done it recently."" LYLES SHINES The less-celebrated Kentucky product -- Towns was the first overall pick last year -- had quite a night. Trey Lyles scored 13 points and shot 6 of 8, including a 3-pointer and a pretty floater from just inside the free throw line, to give the Jazz a boost off the bench. RUBIO'S SHOT Wolves point guard Ricky Rubio entered shooting just 33.3 percent from the field. He's never been a good shooter, but an injury to his right elbow earlier in the season didn't help things. He hit four of his first five shots Monday night. Rubio was playing so well that Thibodeau stuck with Rubio even after he picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter. He finished with 11 points and did not play in the fourth for the third straight game. When asked if it was hard to watch the entire fourth again, Rubio replied curtly, ""Yes.""","400899708"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Runner-up for Defensive Player of the Year in two straight seasons, Draymond Green desperately wants to prove how good Golden State can be on that end of the floor. Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson can have all the scoring glory. Green takes it personally when people question the Warriors' D. Green blocked two shots in the final 43.4 seconds, Durant had 25 points and 14 rebounds, and the Warriors held off the Atlanta Hawks and their strong bench 105-100 on Monday night for a 12th straight victory that tied the third-longest streak in franchise history. ""I wouldn't necessarily say I have something to prove for that award, more so that people have kind of counted our defense out,"" said Green, back from missing one game with an ankle injury. Curry scored 25 points with four 3-pointers, and Thompson added 20 points as Golden State's Big Three each reached 20 points for the second consecutive game. The Warriors won their seventh straight home game and fifth in a row against Atlanta at Oracle Arena. Durant knocked down a 3-pointer with 2:57 left in the third quarter that pulled Golden State to 76-73. Then, as the period wound down, he dribbled over midcourt and found Ian Clark for a long 3 to beat the buzzer and cut Atlanta's advantage to 81-80. Durant's jumper to start the fourth put the Warriors ahead, and Andre Iguodala followed with back-to-back baskets. Iguodala finished with 12 points, five rebounds and five assists. Dennis Schroder scored 24 points for the Hawks, and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 10 against his father's former team. Dwight Howard added 14 points and 16 rebounds, while Paul Millsap had 14 points and 14 boards. ""We got to 100 and we haven't seen that in a while,"" Millsap said. ""It's a good start. We played a tough team, a good team, so we'll build on the positives."" Durant had a double-double in consecutive games for the second time this season and had his sixth performance with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds. ""Nobody can guard him, that's pretty much it,"" said Iguodala, who spent years trying to stop KD. In the first half, the Warriors hardly looked like their usual efficient selves on either end and trailed at halftime for the fourth time and second at home. They committed 11 turnovers that led to 16 points for Atlanta, got burned on defense while giving up easy baskets and missed their own open looks in shooting just 45.2 percent. Green returned after missing Saturday's hard-fought win against Minnesota because of a bruised left ankle sustained in a collision a night earlier at the Lakers that left Clark with a throat injury. Clark also sat out Saturday. Green quickly made an impact in this one, forcing a turnover on Atlanta's first possession and emphatically pointing to signal it was Golden State's ball. He dished out seven assists and first made a big block against Schroder before stuffing Kent Bazemore to finish with four blocks. The Warriors had double-digit blocks for an NBA-best fourth time this season. ""That was amazing. I don't know if I've ever seen a sequence like that from one guy,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""Draymond's amazing. He literally can guard anybody in the league."" KD BOBBLEHEAD Some fans lined up in their cars at the Oracle gates at lunchtime for a chance to be among the first 10,000 to receive the first Durant bobblehead with the Warriors. At the gates where the coveted dolls waited, members of the event staff closely guarded the special souvenirs. TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta's bench contributed 37 points. ... The Hawks dropped to 4-1 on the second night of back-to-backs. ... Atlanta is 0-3 on the road against Western Conference teams and hasn't beaten the Warriors away from home since Feb. 25, 2011. ...

Warriors: Golden State is 5-0 vs. Eastern Conference teams after going 27-3 against the East last season. ... Durant was chosen Western Conference Player of the Week, his 25th such honor and first since joining Golden State.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Detroit Pistons could have folded when center Andre Drummond was ejected in the second quarter. Instead, they rallied for a lopsided win with their talented big man in the locker room, routing the tired-looking Charlotte Hornets 112-89 on Tuesday night. Harris scored 24 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Marcus Morris each had 18 points to lead the Pistons. Ish Smith added 13 points, including two coast-to-coast layups to ignite his team in the third quarter. The Pistons outscored the Hornets by 23 after Drummond was ejected for a flagrant-2 foul when officials ruled he elbowed Roy Hibbert in the head. Drummond laughed and shook his head as he walked off the floor, flabbergasted that he had been ejected. ""I thought that was a key part of the game right there,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We were down after the play so to come back and be up three at the half was good."" Drummond said he didn't do it on purpose. ""I don't make the rules,"" Drummond said. ""I just play the game. They felt that I had done something maliciously. Everybody who knows me knows that's the type player I am. At the end of the day, it wasn't my call so I took the consequences and walked off the floor."" Said Harris: ""It says a lot about our team, but most importantly about guys like Aron (Baynes) and Jon (Leuer) to fill in for that role and be productive and bring the energy that he had when he was playing when he was out there."" Kemba Walker had 23 points for the Hornets, who were playing their fourth game in five nights. Hornets coach Steve Clifford refused to use that as an excuse. ""We can come in here and do the preverbal it's five (games) in seven (nights), but if you do that, to me, you have the wrong expectations of what our team should be,"" Clifford said The Pistons hadn't played since Saturday and looked much fresher throughout the game. Detroit took a 10-point lead into the fourth quarter after Caldwell-Pope knocked down a pair of 3-pointers late in the third. Things got sloppy from there with the Hornets turning the ball over frequently on bad passes, and the game quickly turned into a blowout. Hornets center Cody Zeller said ""there will always be tough nights, but we need to find ways to win those."" TIP INS Pistons: The win snapped a three-game road losing streak. ... The Pistons had a season-high 12 3-pointers. Hornets: Walker sent Smith falling to the floor in the second quarter when he faked a drive then stepped back to drain a 3-pointer. ... Walker has scored 20 or more points in 15 of the Charlotte's 18 games this season. ... Charlotte fell to 5-5 at home. DRUMMOND EJECTED There is a history between Drummond and Hibbert. Hibbert said back in 2013 he was no longer a fan of Drummond after claiming he talked too much trash. CHARLOTTE TROUBLES Clifford said he's concerned about two things -- the Hornets being 5-5 at home and 1/3 on the tail end of back-to-backs. ""If those things continue to happen then we certainly are not going to be in the position where we need to be,"" Clifford said. SMITH HOMECOMING Smith is a Charlotte native, so he enjoyed getting a win against the Hornets. ""It was good to see my family and friends and coaches and mentors who helped me along the way,"" Smith said. ""But it's a business trip. We'll be back in a week and it won't be any easier."" LAMB HURT AGAIN Charlotte's Jeremy Lamb left on the first possession of the fourth quarter after banging knees with another player. He had been playing well after missing 10 games with a hamstring injury.","400899710"
"NEW YORK --  CP3 mimicked giving CPR on a night that looked like lots of laughs for Los Angeles. Funny turned to fiery by the end, as an enraged Doc Rivers was thrown out as his team blew one in Brooklyn. Sean Kilpatrick scored 31 of his career-high 38 points after the third quarter and the Nets stopped a seven-game losing streak with a 127-122 double-overtime victory over the Clippers on Tuesday night. The Clippers started the game without Blake Griffin, ended it without Rivers and dropped their third straight game by coughing up an 18-point lead while not showing enough respect for the game in their coach's mind. ""We were walking around like we done something and that bothers me because we've done (nothing). We haven't done (anything),"" Rivers said. ""For us to walk around against a team, that to me is playing their hearts out every night just to win one game, us to walk around like we done something, it bothers me on a basketball level."" Chris Paul had 26 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for the Clippers, but the best guard on the floor in crunch time was Kilpatrick, who also had a career-best 14 rebounds. Brook Lopez added 27 points for the Nets, who trailed 86-68 with 2 minutes left in the third quarter. ""We were down 20, then next minute you know we just kept chipping it down,"" Kilpatrick said. ""Then next minute I knew we were down four, and I was like yo, it's on now. It's game time."" DeAndre Jordan had 21 points and 23 rebounds for the Clippers, who rested Griffin, their leading scorer, ahead of a game in Cleveland on Thursday. ""Anybody in the league knows, they say, you mess with the game and like you said, the basketball gods got us,"" Paul said. The Clippers started 39-year-old Paul Pierce, who had played in just two games, in place of Griffin. Pierce had played just 17 minutes all season but logged 29 minutes in this one, such an increase in workload that Paul pushed down on his chest a few times on the court at one point, pretending to give CPR after Pierce fell on his back while being fouled on a dunk attempt. The Clippers were serious by the end. Rivers was tossed late in the first OT, becoming enraged and having to be held back by Clippers players and assistants as he tried to get at referee Ken Mauer. Rivers appeared upset about a call on the other end of the floor, walking out of the coaching box and almost all the way to the Nets bench. Mauer said crossing over midcourt was an automatic technical and the second was for language and behavior. Rivers missed Kilpatrick's masterful finish, which he capped with a three-point play with 13.5 seconds left. The Nets, still playing without point guard Jeremy Lin, ended a skid that started with a 127-95 loss at the Clippers on Nov. 14. Los Angeles had lost in Detroit and Indiana in its last two games, managing just 70 points Sunday against the Pacers in its lowest-scoring game in 13 years. Rivers pointed to some defensive lapses as the bigger concern, and they certainly struggled to stay in front of Kilpatrick, who was just 3 for 14 after three quarters. TIP-INS Clippers: J.J. Redick made a 3-poiner in his 75th straight game, tying one of Stephen Curry's streaks for sixth-longest in NBA history. Curry's NBA-record 157-game streak was snapped earlier this season. Nets: Coach Kenny Atkinson still couldn't give a timetable on Lin, saying the point guard who missed his 12th straight game with a strained left hamstring was working hard and ""progressing as planned."" DOC IS JUST A NICKNAME The Clippers have increased their spending on biometrics this season, and Rivers -- first name Glenn -- was asked if he relied on that to determine Griffin would sit. ""I clearly didn't, I'm not smart enough to use biometrics,"" Rivers said. ""But the people we hired did, and they told me biometrically that this would be a good day for him to rest.""","400899711"
"MILWAUKEE -- After building a big third-quarter lead against the defending NBA champions, the Milwaukee Bucks poured it on in the fourth. And when the Cleveland Cavaliers pulled their starters, including LeBron James, midway through the final period, the young Bucks still didn't let up. ""We didn't let them off the hook. We were attacking,"" said Giannis Antetokounmpo, who tied a career high with 34 points while the Bucks stunned the Cavaliers 118-101 on Tuesday night. ""They are the champs, but this is a great win."" Bucks coach Jason Kidd had high praise for Antetokounmpo, who was often matched up against James. ""He's getting better with hard work,"" Kidd said. ""He was going against the best player in the world."" Antetokounmpo added 12 rebounds and five assists while Milwaukee ended Cleveland's four-game winning streak. Jabari Parker had 18 points and Michael Beasley had 17 off the bench for the Bucks. ""It was a matter of us trusting each other,"" Kidd said. ""For a young team, sometimes it takes time. You want to put it in the microwave and instantly get it right away, but if you're patient enough for the process and the journey, it will come."" James had 22 points for the Cavaliers, who fell to 13-3. Kyrie Irving added 20 points. ""You can't simulate how long they are in the passing lanes,"" James said. ""But four of my seven (turnovers) were unforced and that's careless."" The Bucks scored a season-high 68 points in the paint. ""They played harder than we did,"" Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said. The Bucks outscored Cleveland by 14 points in the third quarter and led by 22 in the fourth. Cleveland rode hot early shooting to a 14-point first quarter lead, but Milwaukee closed on a 10-0 run and trailed by only two at the end of the period. Antetokounmpo and Beasley sparked Milwaukee in the second quarter as the Bucks built an advantage of eight points before leading 58-54 at the half. FRIENDLY TO A FAULT The Bucks exploited J.R. Smith's affable nature for an easy dunk in the second quarter. Right before an inbound play, Milwaukee's Jason Terry stood up off the bench to say hello to Smith, sharing a handshake and hug along the baseline. Smith was supposed to be covering Tony Snell, but with Smith mingling, Snell cut to the basket, received the inbound pass and dunked with nobody around. Terry said it wasn't planned and he didn't realize play had restarted, and Smith at first said he just wasn't paying attention. When asked again, he said, ""I didn't even know I was in the game. My bad."" FAMILIAR FACES Matthew Dellavedova played against his former team for the first time since signing with Milwaukee as a free agent in the offseason. ""He was with those guys in a lot of battles,"" Kidd said. Lue said he misses having Dellavedova run his team's second unit. ""He's going to compete and play hard. He's going to scrap. His teammates loved him,"" Lue said. LOOKING FOR ANSWERS Smith entered the game just 1 for 22 in his last two contests, including going 0 for 11 against the 76ers on Sunday. He hit his first two shots, both 3-pointers, but missed his next five shots, all 3-pointers. IN THE HOUSE Michael Redd, the fourth all-time leading scorer in Bucks' history, attended the game. Redd played 11 seasons for the Bucks. IN REMEMBRANCE A moment of silence was observed for the victims of a plane crash in Columbia on Monday. A chartered airliner slammed into the Andes mountains while transporting a Brazilian soccer team traveling to the finals of one of South America's most prestigious club tournaments.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Jrue Holiday doesn't concern himself with who is guarding Anthony Davis, or how many defenders flock to the Pelicans' prolific power forward. Given Davis' recent form, Holiday just wants to get him the ball. ""I'd give it to him with four people on him,"" Holiday said. ""It doesn't really matter. He scores that easily."" Davis had 41 points and 16 rebounds, helping New Orleans dominate the short-handed Los Angeles Lakers 105-88 on Tuesday night. The Lakers expected to be healthier with forward Julius Randle returning to the lineup following a three-game absence because of a hip injury, but about two minutes into the game, starting shooting guard Nick Young was carried off with a strained right Achilles tendon. Lou Williams scored 16 points for the Lakers and Randle finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds, but Los Angeles was in a 20-point hole by the second quarter and never recovered. ""The first half we shot ourselves in the foot"" by playing poor defense, Randle said. ""In the second half, we played well defensively; we just missed a lot of open shots that we usually make."" Davis, meanwhile, is now averaging 31.8 points per game for New Orleans and shows no sign of slowing down. He's scored 36 or more in four of his last six games, breaking 40 twice in that span. ""I put in so much work to try and better myself as a basketball player, and when I'm on the floor I feel like no one can stop me,"" Davis said. ""It's just making the right read."" And when he has help, New Orleans can be tough to beat. Playing in his seventh game since returning from personal leave, Holiday started for the first time this season and scored 22 points. ""He got us off to a good start,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said, noting that Holiday also played well defensively. ""Having him out there, it's just a calming effect and obviously having him out there with A.D. -- that combination is really good for us."" Omer Asik added 10 points and 11 assists while New Orleans snapped a two-game skid. TIP-INS Lakers: With Williams outscoring his teammates in New Orleans, it marked the 14th time in 19 games that a reserve has been the Lakers' high scorer. ... Los Angeles, which entered sixth in the NBA in scoring, fell about 20 points off its average of 108.2 points per game. ... Timofey Mozgov had 10 points, nine rebounds and two blocks. Pelicans: Forward Anthony Brown played nearly 22 minutes against the Lakers, who had cut him at the end of training camp. Lakers coach Luke Walton said before the game that he views Brown as an NBA player but didn't have room for him on the roster because he wanted to maintain more of a veteran presence in the locker room, opting to retain Metta World Peace instead. Brown finished with seven points, six rebounds and two assists. DOMINANT DAVIS The 6-foot-11 Davis didn't have any dunks -- somewhat unusual for him -- but he scored in just about every other way possible. There were turnarounds from the post, mid-range jumpers, as well as off-balance floaters and runners as he was fouled. When the Lakers briefly threatened to get back in the game, cutting their deficit from 28 to 19 in the third quarter, Davis answered with a driving layup and straightaway 3. ""I was just trying to take over the game and not let them come back,"" Davis said. Davis, who also had four steals, three assists and two blocks, even dived to the floor to fight for a loose ball with New Orleans up by 24 in the third quarter, tying up Luol Deng for a jump ball. YOUNG'S NEXT STEP The Lakers said Young is slated to have an MRI on Wednesday to better gauge the severity of his injury. Walton said ""it will be tough"" on his team if Young has to miss a substantial amount of time, particularly with fellow guard D'Angelo Russell (left knee) already injured. Walton said he'd likely have to break up a reserve unit that has been among the highest scoring in the NBA to fill the guard spots, adding, ""We'll have to get creative.""","400899713"
"SAN ANTONIO --  All of Orlando's early season struggles were forgotten in one charmed night. Serge Ibaka had 18 points and the Magic took advantage of a sloppy game by San Antonio, winning 95-83 on Tuesday to snap the Spurs' nine-game winning streak. ""We scratched and clawed, that's what we needed to do,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""We're a desperate team. We needed a win and we needed to play with that kind of desperation."" San Antonio committed a season-high 19 turnovers in its worst scoring performance of the season. The Spurs have four home losses in the first two months of this season after falling just once at AT&amp;T Center in 2015-16. ""They played very well,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I thought their defense was really solid, and I thought it put us on our heels most of the game."" Orlando entered having lost eight of 11, but they were looser and more fluid than San Antonio from the start. The Magic's Aaron Gordon and Bismack Biyombo even fell to the court laughing after colliding while simultaneously attempting and failing to throw down a dunk off an alley-oop pass from D.J. Augustin in the third quarter. It was one of the few missteps in Orlando's first victory in 11 games against San Antonio. ""Frank is a great coach, he's a very positive guy and believes in us wholeheartedly,"" Gordon said. ""When you have that backing, you feel that you are capable. Tonight, we came out and we put the pieces together for a full game and it's a beautiful thing."" The Magic shot 45 percent from the field and were 6 for 15 on 3-pointers in snapping a four-game skid. Evan Fournier scored 13 points and Nikola Vucevic had 12, but it was on the defensive end that Orlando shined. San Antonio backed up a lethargic first half with an even more anemic third quarter. The Spurs shot 6 for 19 in the third, turning the ball over four times while being outscored 30-21. ""The ball is not moving,"" San Antonio guard Manu Ginobili said. ""We're forcing the issue too much. We're kind of stuck. So, hopefully we get the ball moving better and sharper."" The Spurs' turnovers resulted in 19 points for the Magic. ""We were denying,"" Gordon said. ""We were taking the Spurs out of their rhythm offensively and making them look for second and third and fourth options. When you do that the whole night, that wears on a team."" San Antonio's backcourt of Tony Parker and Danny Green combined to shoot 1 for 10 with five turnovers and four points. Kawhi Leonard had 21 points to lead the Spurs and LaMarcus Aldridge added 16. After going with its twin towers of Aldridge and Pau Gasol to start the game, San Antonio went with a smaller lineup in the second half. Neither option worked well. ""We had to win both halves two very different ways,"" Voegel said. ""They went big in the first half and we had to match their bigs and keep them off the glass and then they went small in the second half and then with an ultra-small lineup with four guards and a big and Serge has that versatility to still guard perimeter players while we stayed with who we are."" Ibaka finished with seven rebounds and a blocked shot. TIP-INS Magic: The Magic's last victory against the Spurs was Dec. 23, 2010, when they upended San Antonio 123-101 in Orlando. ... The Magic are undefeated in three games against the Southwest Division this season. ... Orlando has made at least one 3-pointer in 756 straight games, the fifth longest streak in league history. ... The Magic have three losing streaks of at least three games through 18 contests this season. Spurs: The Spurs observed a moment of silence prior to the game for the Brazilian soccer club Chapecoense and other passengers killed when a plane crashed into a Colombian hillside Monday night. ... San Antonio got its first loss in eight games with its projected starting lineup of Leonard, Aldridge, Gasol, Parker and Green. ... Dewayne Dedmon returned after missing six straight games with a sprained left knee. Dedmon had six points and eight rebounds in 16 minutes. ... Gasol has played in 1,073 career games, moving past Hall of Famer Michael Jordan for 79th on the career list. ROAD WARRIORS While San Antonio has lost four games at home, they have yet to lose on the road this season, which puzzles the Spurs. ""It is hard to explain, even for us players who are on the floor competing,"" Gasol said. ""It is not like we are trying to lose games at home and go on the road and get all of them."" San Antonio can become the third team in league history to open a season with 11 straight road wins with a victory Wednesday at Dallas. The Spurs have won 10 straight road games, matching the start by the Boston Celtics in 1961 and 1962. Golden State holds the league mark with 14 straight road victories to open last season and the New York Knicks won 12 straight in 1970. I'M FINE Orlando guard Elfrid Payton said he is ""great"" after injuring his right ankle by landing on teammate C.J. Watson's foot with 7:40 left in the final quarter. Payton exited and got X-rays following the game but said he was fine after returning to the locker room without any noticeable limp.","400899714"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder explained his team's offensive explosion Tuesday night in the most basic way -- they made shots. Gordon Hayward scored a season-high 31 points, helping the Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 120-101 for their season-best fourth straight win. ""Sometimes it's as simple as that,"" Snyder said. ""We've been getting some pretty good looks. Tonight the ball went into the basket. ""You take it when you can get it because sometimes it goes the other way."" Utah started strong en route to a season high for scoring. Rodney Hood had 10 points during a 20-5 first-quarter run after trailing 16-9, and Houston never led again. Hood finished with 19 points. Rudy Gobert recorded his 11th double-double of the season with 16 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks. Hayward had seven assists and five rebounds. James Harden scored 26 points but was an inefficient 8 for 23 from the field. He also had seven assists and five rebounds, while Eric Gordon scored 24 points off the bench. Hayward said the game was won on the defensive end by forcing Harden into tough shots and keeping everyone else in check. ""I started to get some better looks in the fourth quarter and got in a little bit of a rhythm,"" Hayward said. ""Teammates found me in good spots. Able to knock down some shots and see the ball go in. And that was that. ""We wanted to make sure that we made some of their guys guard. They're so good on the offensive end, that's kind of what they want to get to."" Utah rolled through the first half behind some dead-eye shooting from the entire roster. The team shot 54.8 percent from the field, including nine 3-pointers, to take a 62-50 lead into the break. The Rockets were 4 for 17 from behind the arc in the first 20 minutes, accounting for the biggest difference between the teams in the half. ""We were a step slow at everything,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""When we switched, we didn't switch out. We didn't pick up at the right points. Defensively, we just did not bring everything we had. Whether we're tired or whatever the reason, it doesn't matter. We'll try to figure that out. But we didn't have the same intensity. ""I just thought the whole game it looked like we were running in mud."" TIP-INS Rockets: Houston is 5-2 since Patrick Beverley returned from knee surgery. ... The Rockets are 2-1 during the current five-game road trip. ... They made 11 3s and have hit at least 10 3-pointers in their last 17 games, an NBA record. Jazz: The 62 first-half points were a season high. ... Utah is 10-2 when leading at halftime. ... Derrick Favors missed his seventh consecutive game with a left knee bone contusion. ... The 55.4 shooting percentage was a season high. ANOTHER INJURY Hood left in the third quarter with a right hamstring strain and did not return. The Jazz have been plagued by injuries again this year as Hayward, George Hill, Favors, Boris Diaw and Alec Burks have all missed time due to injury. GO, GO, GO Mike D'Antoni wants his teams to play fast, and that's usually a player-friendly system. The Rockets coach, however, said it's easier said than done. ""All players say they want to run and most players don't, actually,"" he explained. ""It's sexy to say, yeah, we're a running team. But it does take some mental energy to go out and do that every day and just get into the habit. ""I've done both ways. I think it's more taxing to play halfcourt basketball and slug it out with somebody than to run around. But they fall back into old habits and old habits are just walking the ball down. That's hard to break up sometimes."" QUOTABLE ""They wanted us to score 1-on-1,"" Gordon said. ""They didn't want us to kick out for 3s and that's why you didn't see a lot of that.""","400899715"
"BOSTON --  The Detroit Pistons' relaxed attitude is finally paying off with some road wins. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 25 points and Tobias Harris had 21 to lead balanced scoring that carried the Pistons to a 121-114 win over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night. Andre Drummond added 20 points and 17 rebounds, one night after he was ejected in the second quarter of a victory at Charlotte for a flagrant-2 foul. Marcus Morris had 20 points and Ish Smith 19 for the Pistons, who had lost eight of their first nine road games before winning away from home on consecutive nights. ""We're having fun,"" Drummond said. ""The more we play like that the better the season is going to be."" The Pistons beat the Hornets by 23 points a night earlier. ""Coming in with the problems we've had on the road, to play the way we've played the last two nights against two teams that are over .500 and have good personnel, to be on a back-to-back is a heck of a win,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. Isaiah Thomas paced the Celtics with 27 points, and Kelly Olynyk scored a season-high 19. Boston had won five of seven. ""It's disappointing, but like I said, they were making shots, man,"" Celtics guard Avery Bradley said. ""Hats off to those guys. They played well. Their starters played very well. (We've) just got to move on to the next game."" The Pistons shot 55.2 percent. Boston finished at 44 percent, going 15 of 42 on 3-point attempts. ""They made shots,"" Olynyk said. ""They made shots when they needed to make shots. They made them four quarters in a row."" Detroit used a 9-0 spree midway through the fourth quarter to open a 103-95 edge with 5:08 to play after Boston went on an 11-0 run to take its first lead since early in the opening period. Morris and Harris each hit a 3-pointer during the Pistons' spurt. Detroit pushed its lead to 112-101 on Smith's basket before Boston closed within four points in the final 30 seconds. The Pistons were shooting better than 55 percent midway through the third quarter and opened their biggest lead of the game, 90-80, on Jon Leuer's dunk. Boston center Al Horford returned after missing Monday's win at Miami due to the birth of his second child. He scored nine points. TIP-INS Pistons: Van Gundy said G Reggie Bullock hasn't gotten an appointment yet for a second opinion on the torn meniscus in his left knee. Celtics: Coach Brad Stevens said there was no longer a limit on F Jae Crowder's minutes in his sixth game back from a sprained left ankle. ... G Marcus Smart went down to the floor hard early in the fourth, but walked slowly to the bench during a stoppage. SIMPLE FORMULA The Pistons outrebounded Boston 52-33 and had a 13-9 edge on the offensive glass. ""That's been a key for us,"" Van Gundy said. ""When we've rebounded the ball well, we've won. When we haven't, we haven't won."" GET BETTER The Pistons reached the .500 mark (10-10), but Smith said they can play a lot better. ""It's not bad. We've got so much room for improvement,"" he said. ""We've been a really good home team, defensively at home. We can get so much better."" LOOKING GOOD Olynyk shot the ball well despite having a cut on his right elbow that he sustained Monday in Miami. He had it wrapped and went 7 for 9 from the floor. ""It's good,"" Olynyk said. ""Obviously tender.""","400899717"
"DeMar DeRozan finds a wide open DeMarre Carroll in the corner for a 3-pointer that gives Toronto a double-digit lead late in the fourth quarter against the Grizzlies. (0:16) TORONTO -- DeMar DeRozan's early season scoring surge has slowed. The Toronto Raptors haven't. Kyle Lowry had 29 points and eight assists, DeRozan scored 24 points and the Raptors ended the Memphis Grizzlies' six-game road winning streak with a 120-105 victory. DeRozan was held under 30 points for the sixth consecutive game after averaging 33 points in his first 12 contests. He was ably backed up by Lowry, though, helping the Raptors beat the Grizzlies for the third straight matchup and sixth time in their last seven meetings. ""It was just a period of time where we were reliant on him big time and now we're trying to take a little bit of the load off of him,"" Lowry said. The Raptors seized control midway through the fourth quarter on back-to-back 3-pointers from Patrick Patterson and Cory Joseph over a 1:01 span for a seven-point lead. A trio of free throws by Lowry quickly pushed that advantage up to eight, and a DeMarre Carroll's 3-pointer with 4:10 remaining made it a 12-point edge. The Raptors led by double digits the rest of the way, with Joseph finishing with a season-high 16 points off the bench and Patterson recording his 14th career double-double on 14 points and 13 rebounds. Up until that point it had been anyone's game. The short-handed Grizzlies, without six of their regular players because of injury and other reasons, had to get by with what coach David Fizdale called their ""Nasty Nine"" healthy players. ""When you play a team like that, with a lot of young guys playing out of position, they're going to play extremely hard and there's going to be a lot of things that you're not used to seeing or that you're not expecting,"" said DeRozan, who had five turnovers in the first quarter. The Raptors committed a season-high 20 turnovers in the game, but also made a season-high 16 3-pointers. Fizdale praised his team's gutsy effort, with Andrew Harrison leading the way with a career-high 21 points. Memphis could have tied the franchise record of seven consecutive road wins, set in the 2009-10 season, with a victory. ""The effort was fantastic. I just thought we had a bad stretch where we got careless with the ball, starting turning the ball over,"" Fizdale said of the Raptors' 16-5 run which took the game away from Memphis. Harrison echoed his coach's thoughts and bemoaned the loss of Mike Conley, the team's star guard who was ruled out for at least six weeks Tuesday with fractured vertebrae in his lower back. Conley was injured during Monday's loss to Charlotte. ""I know we were short-handed, but we have a bunch of guys on the team and we all believe that we could win this game,"" he said. ""Losing Mike was big, he's an MVP candidate in my eyes, but we know what we have to do, we have to bring it every night."" TIP INS Grizzlies: G Chandler Parsons (left knee), F Brandan Wright (left ankle), F Vince Carter (right hip), F James Ennis III (right calf) and F Zach Randolph (personal) missed the game. ... Carter, the former Raptor, received one of the loudest cheers of the night when he was shown on the video board in the second quarter. Raptors: Toronto finished the first month of the season with a winning record (11-7) and 10-plus wins for the third consecutive season. ... The biggest cheer of the night came late in the fourth quarter when the big screen revealed that Major League Soccer team Toronto FC had beaten Canadian rival Montreal Impact 5-2 on the night and 7-5 on aggregate to advance to their first MLS Cup final. CENTURY MARK Wednesday's game was Toronto's 100th straight sellout in the regular season and playoffs at the Air Canada Centre, the longest streak in franchise history. DOWN BUT NOT OUT Despite his team's lengthy injury list, Fizdale refused to dwell on the situation. ""I don't look at it like that. I see nothing but opportunity and I preach that to our guys. We don't feel sorry for ourselves. Next man up and trust that next guy to do his job well enough to win on the road."" ACES HIGH The world's No. 3 men's tennis player, Canadian Milos Raonic, sat courtside. He signed a number of balls and sat back as the team mascot, the Raptor, shot them high into the stands with a tennis racquet.","400899718"
"CHICAGO -- The Los Angeles Lakers needed a basket, and Julius Randle wanted the ball. Coach Luke Walton loved the whole thing. ""If it's a one-on-one situation with space, we feel very confident that he'll win that matchup,"" Walton said. Got it done in a big moment Wednesday night. Randle made a strong move against Nikola Mirotic for a tiebreaking layup with 45.1 seconds left, and the Lakers held off the Chicago Bulls for a gritty 96-90 victory. Randle had 13 points and matched a career high with 20 rebounds as Los Angeles bounced back from a 105-88 loss at New Orleans on Tuesday night. Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson scored 18 points apiece, and Larry Nance Jr. finished with 12 points and 11 boards. ""Our guys just played hard, stayed mentally locked in,"" Randle said. Randle's drive and layup gave Los Angeles a 92-90 lead. After Jimmy Butler missed on the other side for Chicago, Williams went 1 for 2 at the line with 20 seconds to go. Butler then missed another 3 and Randle and Nance combined for three foul shots to help Los Angeles hold on. ""Our guys have proven that when their backs are against the wall they can step up for a challenge,"" Walton said. ""They did it tonight. That's a great win against a very talented team."" Butler had 22 points on 4-of-18 shooting for the Bulls, who were hoping to build on a 4-2 road trip. Dwyane Wade, who was listed as doubtful after getting some dental work on Tuesday, scored 17 points, and Robin Lopez finished with 10 points, nine rebounds and a career-high eight blocked shots. ""It was an ugly game,"" Wade said. ""We have to find a way to win those games. No excuses."" The Bulls used 40 points from Butler to beat the Lakers 118-110 in Los Angeles on Nov. 20. But the Lakers held the Bulls to 35.2 percent shooting in the rematch and enjoyed a 60-46 rebounding advantage. ""I think the missed shots definitely affected us,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""You can't let that happen. That and rebounding has to be your constant."" BANGED-UP LAKERS It was an impressive response from Los Angeles after the team announced before the game that Nick Young strained his right calf muscle in Tuesday night's loss to the Pelicans, sidelining the guard for two to four weeks. The Lakers also were without guard D'Angelo Russell, who missed his sixth straight game due to left knee soreness. GOOD START, BAD FINISH The Bulls led by as many as 14 in the first quarter before settling for a 28-17 advantage after one. But the Lakers rallied in the second and it was tied at 47 at the break. ""We stopped rebounding. We stopped getting to loose balls. A lot of stuff,"" Butler said. ""It changed in their favor and they caught us slipping.""

"Russell Westbrook put on another show, balling out for 35 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists against the Wizards for his fourth straight triple-double. He passes LeBron James for sixth-most triple-doubles in NBA history with 46. (0:54) OKLAHOMA CITY -- For more than 47 minutes, Russell Westbrook could barely hit a shot. For the next 5-plus minutes, he rarely missed. Oklahoma City's fearless star was 7 for 28 from the field before he drained a 3-pointer late in regulation that forced overtime. He followed that by scoring 14 of his 35 points in the extra period to help the Thunder defeat the Washington Wizards 126-115 on Wednesday night. ""Never stop believing in yourself and your capabilities of doing what you're able to do on the basketball floor,"" Westbrook said. Bradley Beal, who led the Wizards with 31 points, couldn't believe Westbrook hit the shot with 8.5 seconds remaining. It was the only 3-pointer he made in six tries. ""I felt like I did a great job of cutting him off to the basket,"" Beal said. ""He wasn't making any jumpers all game. The only 3 he makes is the one to go into overtime."" Westbrook was 4 of 6 from the field and 6 for 6 on free throws in the extra period. He finished with 14 rebounds and 11 assists for his fourth straight triple-double, his ninth this season and the 46th of his career. The Thunder have won all four games during his triple-double streak, and he heads into December averaging a triple-double through 20 games this season. Former Thunder coach Scott Brooks returned as Washington's coach, and the Oklahoma City crowd greeted him warmly. Brooks coached the Thunder for seven years and led them to the Western Conference Finals three times and the NBA Finals once. ""I'm humbled that they did that for me, and I appreciate it,"" Brooks said. ""I'm glad they came out and supported their team and showed kind of what we did throughout the years."" John Wall had 15 points and 15 assists and Marcin Gortat added 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Wizards, who had won three of four. The Thunder led by 16 early in the second quarter and were up 60-53 at halftime. A block by Domantas Sabonis led to a fast-break dunk by Steven Adams that put the Thunder up 74-62 in the third quarter and prompted Brooks to call a timeout. The Wizards closed the quarter strong and tied the score at 84 heading into the fourth. The Wizards took control before the Thunder rallied. A 3-pointer and a dunk by Victor Oladipo cut Washington's lead to one, and the assist on the dunk gave Westbrook his triple-double. Washington's Otto Porter missed a short fadeaway at the end of regulation that would have won the game, and then Westbrook took over. ""I thought we did a good job until overtime on Westbrook,"" Brooks said. ""He's hard to stop. He's a terrific basketball player playing at a high level -- another triple-double -- but I thought we did a pretty good job of containing him most of the night.""

"MINNEAPOLIS -- Kristaps Porzingis and Karl-Anthony Towns are building a tantalizing rivalry for the NBA's new age. Carmelo Anthony let the kids have their fun until it was time to go home. Porzingis had 29 points and eight rebounds and Towns had 47 points and 18 boards, but Anthony hit the winning jumper with 2.3 seconds left, lifting the New York Knicks to a 106-104 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night. ""I mean the sky's the limit for those two guys in this league,"" said Antony, who had just 12 points on 4-for-15 shooting before splashing the winner over Andrew Wiggins' outstretched hand. ""With Towns, the way he's playing, Kristaps getting better and better each day, they'll be around for a long time and, you know, they'll be the face of this league in a couple years."" The 21-year-old Towns is the third-youngest player in the last three decades to have at least 45 points and 15 rebounds in a game. The Wolves used a 20-3 run to tie it at 102 with under a minute to play, but Porzingis threw Gorgui Dieng aside for a putback slam and Anthony tipped the inbounds pass on Minnesota's final possession to thwart the comeback. ""I think it was a good show for everybody,"" Porzingis said. ""But the most important is we got the win."" Brandon Jennings scored 12 points off the bench and Porzingis had a big block against his friend and draft classmate Towns to help the Knicks weather the loss of Joakim Noah, who sat out with a sprained left ankle. New York made 13 3-pointers to Minnesota's four. After the Timberwolves lost to Utah on Monday, a despondent Towns vowed to do more to help his team win. He came out a man on fire, scoring 22 points on 8-for-8 shooting and grabbing seven rebounds in the first quarter. ""I'm so proud of all of my teammates,"" said Towns, whose Wolves fell to 5-13.

G/F Brandon Rush was inactive with a sore big toe that has bothered him for much of the season. SLAM SWATTED The two young stars rarely guarded each other, but Towns did go at Porzingis late in the second quarter, rising up to try to dunk on him only to have the Latvian emphatically stuff him for Towns' first missed shot in 11 attempts. ""He tried,"" Porzingis said. ""He was being super aggressive. He was driving to the basket, shooting from the outside, playing in the post. He was doing everything. He was playing an overall game, and it was really hard to stop him."" FOND MEMORIES The Bulls made the playoffs all five seasons with coach Tom Thibodeau leading Derrick Rose and Noah. Rose and Noah were two players Thibodeau, now with Minnesota, deeply respected for their competitive drive and determination.

"DALLAS -- San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich got a win more in line with his expectations on Wednesday night. The Dallas Mavericks are just hoping a close loss signifies better days ahead. Patty Mills scored 15 of his team-high 23 points in the fourth quarter and Kawhi Leonard added 21 points, helping the Spurs rally from a 13-point deficit for a 94-87 win over the Mavericks on Wednesday night. San Antonio became just the third team to start the season 11-0 on the road, following last year's Warriors (14-0) and the 1969-70 Knicks (12-0). Popovich had criticized his team's ""lack of humility"" and ""lack of respect for the opponent"" after the Spurs' 96-91 home win over Dallas on Nov. 21. This time, his Spurs -- playing without three regulars -- went 13 straight possessions and nearly seven minutes of the third quarter without scoring, but rallied behind Mills and Leonard. ""We dug down deep, didn't moan or groan or whine, stuck with it and kept pounding away and found a way to win,"" Popovich said. Wesley Matthews had a season-high 26 points for the Mavericks, and Harrison Barnes added 17. ""I'm proud of this team,"" Matthews said. ""Frustration aside. Loss aside. This is two games in a row that could have been ours. This fight that we're showing -- this is who we were supposed to be all along."" Dallas, trying to win its second game in a row and only its fourth of the season, led from early in the third quarter until an 11-2 Spurs run midway through the fourth quarter. Mills started it with a 3 and Leonard finished it with another that gave the Spurs the lead for good at 80-79. The Mavericks simply couldn't stop Mills when it mattered. With his team leading 82-81, Mills hit a 3 with 3:04 to play. After Matthews answered with a 3, Mills dialed up another and then hit a long jumper to make it 90-84 with 1:31 left. ""We struggled majority of the game,"" Mills said. ""But we knew that it was all going to come down to defense. We needed to get stops and that would create our flow a little bit better. I thought we did that down the stretch of the game."" TIP-INS Spurs: Pau Gasol and Manu Ginobili did not make the trip to Dallas, and Tony Parker was held out, all for rest. ... Rookie Nicolas Laprovittola got his first career start and Dewayne Dedmon made his first start as a Spur. ... San Antonio has won seven in a row against Dallas.

Nowitzki has played only five of the team's 17 games this year. ... The team got some good news when Devin Harris returned after missing the first 16 games due to a right big toe sprain suffered in the team's final preseason game. He played 11 minutes and did not score. Coach Rick Carlisle said Harris' minutes would be restricted as he returns to form. PROBLEMS AT THE POINT The Mavericks' three primary point guards (Harris, Deron Williams and J.J. Barea) have combined to play only 19 games this season. Their depth was further compromised when Seth Curry suffered a mild right knee sprain in the fourth quarter. Curry had scored his team's first seven points of the quarter to build a 75-67 lead. But with his injury and both Williams and Harris out due to minutes restrictions, rookie Jonathan Gibson was forced to play the final 4:23. Gibson hit a 3 but had a key turnover with his team down by four, and Mills scored eight points during that stretch. ""Gibson was put in a very difficult situation, but there was no other choice,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""It was a tough way to end the game."" Carlisle said Curry would make the trip to Charlotte with the team for Thursday night's game.","400899722"
"DENVER --  Miami's Hassan Whiteside did his damage early and then handed the baton to Wayne Ellington. The combination was too much for the Denver Nuggets. Whiteside had another big game with 25 points, 16 rebounds and four blocks, and Ellington scored 22 points off the bench, lifting the Heat over Denver 106-98 on Wednesday night. Tyler Johnson returned after missing one game to get 18 points and seven assists for Miami. Goran Dragic had 16 points and seven assists for the Heat, who have more wins on the road (four) than at home (two). ""I like this group, I like the toughness that they're building,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Road wins are gratifying because they're tough. They're tough anywhere you go."" Nikola Jokic came off the bench with 17 points and 14 rebounds for Denver, which was outscored 31-18 in the fourth quarter to fall to 3-6 at home. ""We have to lock in for a full 48 minutes,"" Emmanuel Mudiay said. ""I think sometimes we play the score instead of just playing hard every possession. That is somewhere we need to grow and get better at."" A thigh injury sidelined Ellington for the first 16 games of the season and he made his Heat debut in a home loss to Boston on Monday. He found his groove Wednesday and led Miami on a decisive 11-0 run early in the fourth to get the lead for good. Ellington hit four 3-pointers in the period, and his last put the Heat up 10 with 2:25 left. ""I got two open looks and I missed them,"" Ellington said. ""I told Tyler next time he comes off, look at his shot first but watch me in the corner because sometimes (Wilson) Chandler's falling asleep. He did that and I knocked that one down. As a shooter and you knock one or two down in a row that's when you feel pretty good."" Jamal Murray's two 3-pointers got the Nuggets within five, but the Heat held on. Whiteside had 25 points and 17 rebounds in the loss to Boston and has 15 double-doubles this season. Chandler and Danilo Gallinari also scored 17 points each and combined for five of Denver's 19 turnovers. ""We talked pregame about we were taking care of the ball of late and we had 19 turnovers,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""But more importantly gave up 28 points off those 19 turnovers."" TIP-INS Heat: G Dion Waiters was diagnosed with a torn muscle in his thigh. An MRI revealed a tear of the pectineus muscle, located in the front part of the upper and inner thigh. Spoelstra said Waiters, who stayed in Miami, will be re-evaluated in two weeks after rehab and treatment. ... Justise Winslow also remained in Miami to work on his conditioning. He has missed nine games with a sore left wrist. ... Josh Richardson tweaked his ankle in pregame and did not play. Spoelstra said the team will send him back to Miami for further evaluation. Nuggets: G Will Barton missed his second game in a row due to soreness in his left ankle. Barton missed nine games after spraining the ankle, then returned for three before missing another for personal reasons. ... Darrell Arthur did not dress because of illness. ON GUARD Johnson was reluctant to wear a mouth guard, but after getting an implant knocked out against Detroit last week and having oral surgery Monday, he understood the need to protect his teeth. ""I can't miss games because I'm missing teeth,"" he said. ""My goal is to play all 82 and now I'm going to have to change it up and wear the mouthpiece."" The mouth guard didn't bother him in the first quarter when he had two dunks, including a slam at the quarter buzzer that pulled Miami within 30-28.","400899723"
"PHOENIX --  The Phoenix Suns' veterans are sometimes forgotten on a team with several players in their teens and early 20s. It was experienced players who made the difference Wednesday night, though. Brandon Knight scored 23 points off the bench and Phoenix reserves combined for 54 as the Suns held off the slumping Atlanta Hawks 109-107 thanks to a key fourth-quarter run. Jared Dudley and P.J. Tucker added 17 points apiece for the Suns, who had lost four of five. Leandro Barbosa made three important baskets in the fourth. ""That's what we need from them, is stability,"" Phoenix coach Earl Watson said. ""Our young guys are going to have ups and downs, trying to make it as consistent as possible."" Eric Bledsoe's bank shot with 28.4 seconds left gave the Suns a 104-99 lead and all but sealed Atlanta's fourth consecutive defeat. Bledsoe, who shot 5 for 17 from the field, pounded the scorer's table in celebration. ""Eric claims he called bank on the shot. I don't believe it,"" Watson said with a smile. Barbosa made baskets on three straight possessions midway through the fourth to give Phoenix an 89-84 advantage, part of an 11-0 run. ""I like that,"" Barbosa said. ""That's what we're supposed to do. We're supposed to show some things to these guys. Hopefully I give some spark to the team and some energy."" The Hawks cut it to 96-95 with 2:50 to play on Thabo Sefolosha's 17-footer, but Phoenix held on. Dennis Schroder scored 14 of his career-high 31 points in the fourth. Kent Bazemore had 22 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 21 and Dwight Howard added 17 points with 14 rebounds for Atlanta. ""We are playing the right way, trying to do the right things, but we just can't get it to go our way,"" Bazemore said. The Suns turned a five-point deficit at the 5:12 mark of the first quarter into a 36-27 lead to start the second. Knight scored 14 points in 5 minutes off the bench in the first quarter and Tucker had nine -- seven in the first 2 minutes of the game. The Suns took a 47-33 lead, their largest of the game, when Tucker scored and made a free throw in the second quarter. But the Hawks responded, going on a 10-0 run over the final 2:37 of the period. Hardaway hit two 3-pointers and flew in for a dunk during that stretch, finishing the first half with 12 points. The teams traded leads for about 4 minutes of the third quarter before the Suns ended it with a 77-75 lead. ""We just didn't get that stop that we needed to in the last couple of minutes and we didn't get the basket,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""You never feel good when you have a tough road trip and you have lost a few in a row, but I think we are looking forward going home."" TIP-INS Hawks: F Paul Millsap was held out with a left hip injury, and F/C Tiago Splitter (right calf strain) also did not play. Mike Muscala started in Millsap's place. ... The Hawks shot 10 free throws to 25 for the Suns. ... Hardaway was knocked into the scorer's table chasing down a loose ball in the fourth quarter but stayed in the game. Suns: F T.J. Warren (minor head injury) did not play and has missed the past six games. ... Dudley crashed to the floor in front of the Suns' bench after a hard foul on Sefolosha in the third quarter, but got up and made two of three free throws right afterward. DUDLEY DOES JOKES Dudley made sure Tucker was within earshot in the locker room when responding to a question about the veterans playing well. ""P.J. started it off, he hit a couple of pull-up jumpers, which he hasn't done since Texas,"" Dudley said, referring to Tucker's college days. BLEDSOE'S BURDEN Bledsoe had earlier expressed that it's his fault the Suns are not winning much, despite his most recent stretch of five games before Wednesday in which he averaged 26 points, seven rebounds and 6.6 assists. Phoenix had one win in that span. ""Bledsoe takes a lot of things to heart,"" Watson said. ""He's very purposeful with his words. ... It's going to be transparent. We understand Bled's purpose, and his commitment to this team is second to none."" BUDENHOLZER'S BACK Budenholzer is from Holbrook, Arizona, a town of around 5,000 about 185 miles northeast of Phoenix. He wasn't expecting a big turnout of townsfolk Wednesday night, citing a midweek game after a holiday and no bus service.","400899724"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Two days of focused practice with an emphasis on defense served the Trail Blazers well. Portland applied what it worked on, beating former coach Nate McMillan and the Indiana Pacers 131-109 Wednesday night behind Damian Lillard's 28 points, 10 assists and four steals. ""It was a really good defensive game. I think everything we addressed in practice the last two days, the effort, the mindset, how locked in we were the last two days, I think it translated to the court,"" Lillard said. Maurice Harkless added 23 points for the Blazers, who led by as many as 28 in their fifth consecutive victory over the Pacers. The Trail Blazers had lost six of their last eight games as they've struggled to find consistency on defense. Portland was coming off a 130-114 loss at home to the Houston Rockets on Sunday. Jeff Teague led Indiana with 25 points, while Myles Turner had 19 points and 10 rebounds. It was the first of a five-game road swing for the Pacers, who had won two straight. Portland was still missing forward Al-Farouq Aminu, out for more than two weeks with a calf injury. But there are signs he could return soon, possibly even by Sunday against Miami. The Pacers were without All-Star Paul George for the third consecutive game and seventh overall due to a sore left ankle. Portland took a 22-13 lead after Meyers Leonard's 3-pointer. Mason Plumlee's alley-oop dunk from CJ McCollum put Portland up 39-27 and Evan Turner, who has been looking more comfortable with the Blazers in the last half-dozen games, made a 3-pointer to push the lead to 46-29. Lillard, who had just four points in the first quarter, got rolling in the final 7 minutes of the second with 14 and the Blazers led 73-58 at halftime. Portland shot 63 percent in the first half. In the third quarter it was McCollum's turn. After managing just four points in the first half, McCollum had 15 in the third period and the Blazers went up 109-83 heading into the fourth. He finished with 19 points. ""I don't want to go overboard on this game. I think after two days of practice it was good to come out and shoot like that in the first quarter,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""It's not a sigh of relief right now -- we still have work to do."" It was the first Portland appearance for McMillan since he became head coach of the Pacers. McMillan was promoted in the offseason after the Pacers dismissed Frank Vogel. McMillan coached the Blazers from 2005-12. The latter part of his tenure was marked by the devastating injuries to top draft pick Greg Oden and later to star guard Brandon Roy. McMillan said before the game that he remembers Portland fondly as a ""great basketball town."" He said his latest stint as a head coach really can't be compared to the previous one because with the Blazers he was in a rebuilding mode, while with the Pacers he's got a more mature and seasoned squad. ""It's going to be about winning and doing things the right way,"" McMillan said about his new head coaching gig. ""I'm looking forward to the opportunity."" In the end, he came away impressed by the Blazers. ""They were getting to the paint, they were throwing lobs, they were kicking out and knocking down 3s, so we never really controlled the ball -- and with a team like that it's going to be a long night,"" McMillan said. TIP-INS Pacers: McMillan was greeted with warm applause by fans at the Moda Center. He joked that his nickname was no longer ""Sarge"" as it was in Portland. Trail Blazers: Harkless has scored 15 or more points in three straight games for the first time with the Blazers. ... Portland set season highs with 131 points and 73 in the first half. OREGON TIES Pacers guards Aaron Brooks and Joe Young both played college ball at Oregon. Young said he enjoys coming back to the Pacific Northwest. ""Coming back to Oregon is one of the most fun things I get to do,"" he said. ""Just to come back and see my fans and the people that support me. I love Oregon."" MO-MENTUM Harkless' 23 points matched his best total with the Blazers. He has scored at least 20 three times this season after hitting the mark just once last season. Harkless has been in double figures in eight consecutive games, his longest streak with Portland.","400899725"
"TORONTO --  Even though it is Kyle Lowry currently shooting lights out for the Toronto Raptors, second-year man Norman Powell is only too happy to take the credit. Lowry had 24 points and seven assists for the Raptors in a 113-80 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night, compared to Powell's 16. But according to Powell, it's his pre-game tradition with the All-Star guard that is powering his hot hand. ""We have a little shooting competition, the first to make five from five spots, and ever since we've started doing that he's been lighting it up, so I'm taking credit for it,"" Powell said jokingly after the game, Toronto's season-high fifth straight victory and a fourth consecutive win over the Lakers. Lowry, who has scored 20-plus points in his last six games against the Lakers, averaging 24.8 points, was only too happy to back up his teammate's claim. ""He can take credit. My teammates, they can all have the credit,"" he said. ""My teammates are the reason I'm able to do the things that I'm able to do."" Lowry tied his season high for 3-pointers, going 6 of 9 from beyond the arc as the Raptors registered their biggest win of the season. The 33-point victory surpassed the 27-point win over Philadelphia on Oct. 28. Still, coach Dwane Casey was more interested in his team's defensive performance, as Toronto held Los Angeles to an opponent season low of 80 points and .344 shooting from the field. The Raptors were particularly dominant in the second quarter, outscoring the Lakers 41-26 while shooting 75 percent from the field. But it takes more than that to impress the Raptors' coach. ""Case don't say nothing about offense. Case don't care,"" said DeMar DeRozan, who had 16 points. ""Everything that comes out of his mouth is defense."" Even though the game was the Lakers' third in four nights, coach Luke Walton was not about to use that as an excuse. ""I felt like we weren't mentally ready to compete against one of the better teams in the NBA tonight,"" he said. ""I don't know if that's just fatigue from the travel and the road trip so far. Even if it is it can't be an excuse in this league."" Brandon Ingram had 17 points for the Lakers, who are 1-2 on their four-game road trip. Meanwhile their bench, the top scoring unit in the NBA, chipped in with Jordan Clarkson's 14 and former Raptor Lou Williams' 13. The Lakers were held to just 14 points in the third quarter and 32 points in the second half, as Toronto successfully nursed a 21-point halftime lead all the way to the end, emptying its bench and giving minutes to some of its lesser lights. ""You have to give them credit, they played really good,"" former Raptor Jose Calderon said. ""They kept making shots in the right moment and played good defense. We didn't find a guy today who was really hot or going."" TIP-INS Lakers: G D'Angelo Russell (left knee) missed his seventh consecutive game and F Nick Young (right calf) sat out his second straight contest. ... F Julius Randle played his 100th NBA game Friday night. He has 39 double-doubles over that span. ... Williams has made a free throw in 29 straight games, the longest active streak for a Lakers bench player. Raptors: Usual starting F DeMarre Carroll was rested in the opening game of Toronto's first back-to-back home games since the 2008-09 season as the Raptors continue to exercise caution after Carroll's knee surgery late last season. Powell started in his place. ... DeRozan's six assists extended his career-long streak with at least four assists to 11 games. ... Lowry has made multiple 3-pointers in 10 straight games, tied for the longest such streak of his career. KERR-AZY VOTERS Despite leading the Lakers to a surprising 10-10 record over the first month of the season, Walton was passed over for Western Conference coach of the month in favor of his former boss, Steve Kerr of 16-2 Golden State. ""I'm furious that Steve Kerr won coach of the month,"" Walton said jokingly. ""No, I'm happy for him obviously. It doesn't matter to me who wins coach of the month. We're trying to do something that's bigger than individual awards."" DOMINATING FROM DOWNTOWN The Raptors, who shot 41.4 percent from 3-point range, had double-digit 3-pointers (12) for the fifth straight game. Lowry led the way with six, and in his last four games is shooting 71 percent (20 of 28) from beyond the arc.

"NEW YORK -- This time, Carmelo Anthony didn't have to hit the game-winning shot, but he did need help from his teammates. Anthony scored 29 points, Derrick Rose had 24 and Kyle O'Quinn added season highs of 20 points and 13 rebounds as the New York Knicks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-114 on Friday night. After hitting the game-winner in the Knicks' two-point win over the Timberwolves on Wednesday, Anthony saw O'Quinn and Rose carry a heavy load down the stretch. ""You don't want to have to do that every night,"" Anthony said. ""Derrick did a good job of getting the ball in his hands and making plays and creating. Tonight was his night to make shots."" After the Knicks fell behind for the first time in the game, 102-101, on Zach LaVine's dunk with 6:33 remaining, O'Quinn got the lead back with consecutive baskets, and after Minnesota got within one, Rose scored the next five points to give New York a 110-104 lead. Andrew Wiggins converted a layup with 2:11 left, but Anthony answered with a dunk off of a full court pass from O'Quinn to make the score 112-106. Quinn was starting in place of the injured Joakim Noah. ""Obviously, I have a chip on my shoulder. I wanna have more for myself,"" O'Quinn said. ""I just put it out there all I can."" Rose made two free throws with 31 seconds left for a 114-106 lead and the Timberwolves got no closer than four the rest of the way. ""I was taking what they were giving. It was all about rhythm,"" said Rose, who finished 9-for-15 from the field. Minnesota trailed 98-88 after three quarters, but went on a 12-2 run to start the fourth, aided by five Knick turnovers in the first four minutes. They eventually grabbed the lead, but it was short-lived. ""We've got to change our mindset,"" said Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau. ""I thought the start of the game really hurt us. I thought our bench came in and gave a good lift. They did it again in the second half, but then we made a lot of mistakes down the stretch."" The Knicks jumped out to a 24-8 lead to start the game. The Timberwolves were able to pull within nine after the first quarter, 30-21, and got as close as four, 34-30, on Nemanja Bjelica's 3-pointer with 9:06 left in the second quarter. New York took a 62-52 lead at halftime and led by as many as 14, 80-66, before settling for the 10-point lead after three. Justin Holiday finished with 13 points for the Knicks and Kristaps Porzingis had 11. LaVine scored 24 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 20 for the Timberwolves. Wiggins scored 19 points, Bjelica finished with 17, Shabazz Muhammad had 14, and Cole Aldrich posted a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds. TIP-INS: Timberwolves: Minnesota has faced the Knicks in each its last two games, the only time they will play the same team in consecutive games all season. They did play back-to-back against Los Angeles on November 12 and 13, but that was against the Clippers and Lakers, respectively. Knicks: New York is now one game over .500 for the second time this season. They have not been two games over .500 since Nov. 21 last season. SWEPT AWAY The Timberwolves have been swept by the Knicks in each of the past two seasons (4-0). Minnesota's last win in the series was a 95-92 overtime victory on March 19, 2015. LEFT OUT Courtney Lee and Joakim Noah were inactive for the Knicks due to injuries to their left ankles. Lee had started the Knicks' first 18 games, while Noah has now missed two games due to the ankle and four overall. However, Lance Thomas, who had missed the previous nine games due to a left ankle injury, returned to action for the first time since November 12.

"Dwyane Wade starts off the night by watching LeBron James dress up in a Cubs uniform for losing a World Series bet, and then ends it by beating LeBron and the Cavs on the court. (1:29) CHICAGO --  LeBron James wasn't holding back. Cleveland's superstar had plenty to say after the Cavaliers gave up 78 points in the paint on the way to another loss. The condensed version was this: It's time to start playing like a championship team again. Jimmy Butler scored 26 points, Dwyane Wade had 24 and the Chicago Bulls beat James and the slumping Cavaliers 111-105 on Friday night. Taj Gibson added a season-high 23 points and 11 rebounds for Chicago. Rajon Rondo had 15 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds as the balanced Bulls handed the Cavaliers their third straight loss.

After ring night is over with, now it's a new season and everybody is gunning for us every night and we have to understand that. The honeymoon stage is over. It's time to play some real ball and be physical, especially in the trenches. Giving up 78 points (in the paint) is ridiculous. We've got to man up. Everybody."" James manned up to the tune of 27 points and 13 assists, a championship-level performance on a night when he showed up dressed as a World Series champion: He arrived at the arena in a Cubs uniform to honor a World Series bet with buddy Wade. Kyrie Irving added 20 points and eight assists, but the Cavaliers matched their longest losing streak in a year. Chicago dominated Cleveland 78-60 in the paint, outrebounded the Cavaliers 49-33 and came out on top despite shooting 3 of 18 on 3-pointers. It was a big turnaround for the Bulls coming off a loss to the Lakers. ""I think we know what we're capable of if we play basketball the right way and do what we're supposed to do,"" Butler said. DOWN THE STRETCH The Bulls used a strong third quarter to turn a one-point halftime deficit into an 88-80 lead. And they withstood several pushes in the fourth to knock off the defending NBA champions. Kevin Love nailed a 3 to cut the lead to 103-99 with about 4 minutes left, but the Bulls hung on. Wade drove for a layup to make it 107-101 with 2:39 remaining. Nikola Mirotic then stole the ball from James, leading to a putback basket for Wade. Mirotic came up with another big play when he blocked a 3 by Irving with 1:11 left to cause a shot-clock violation. KING CUB James clearly wasn't thrilled about having to wear a Chicago Cubs uniform after he rooted hard for his hometown Cleveland Indians in the World Series. But he was a man of his word, honoring the wager he made with Wade, his good friend and former Miami Heat teammate. James wore a No. 23 Cubs jersey with his last name stitched across the back, a Cubs hat partially covered by a Cubbie-blue hoodie, pinstripe pants and long baseball socks. James' uniform even had the 2016 World Series champions shoulder patch. ""I actually thought he looked good,"" said Wade, who was waiting for James when he arrived at the arena and took a picture of his ex-teammate. ""He actually did look like a baseball player."" The two hugged before tipoff and had some playful moments during the game. James patted Wade on the backside as they ran down the court together after he hit a tough fadeaway jumper over his pal in the third quarter. Wade returned the favor after burying a 3 in James' face moments later. TIP-INS Cavaliers: G/F Mike Dunleavy Jr. missed his second consecutive game because of a concussion.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Clippers forward Blake Griffin praised the way Los Angeles finished off a 10-day trip that closed with games on the shores of lakes Erie and Pontchartrain on back-to-back nights. Griffin had 27 points and 10 rebounds, Chris Paul had 17 points and 13 assists, and the Clippers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 114-96 on Friday night. The dominant effort came one night after an equally convincing 113-94 triumph at Cleveland on Thursday night -- with a flight from the United States' northern border to the Gulf Coast in between, touching down in the Big Easy around 2 a.m. local time. ""It's tough, but the end of a road trip can go one of two ways,"" Griffin said. ""You can either be like, `All right, let's finish this out on a good note and get home and get this over with,' or you can completely lose focus and come in and not play the way you want, and I thought we did the first."" Jamal Crawford scored 21 points and Luc Mbah a Moute had 15 points for Los Angeles. Anthony Davis hurt his right shoulder late in the first quarter but played through it, scoring 21 points for New Orleans. E'Twaun Moore scored 15 points and Terrence Jones had 14 for the Pelicans, who have lost three of four and saw their home winning streak snapped at five.

The Clippers made 10 3-pointers, with Mbah a Moute hitting three, Crawford hitting two and even Griffin hitting one from the left corner. The Pelicans, by contrast, were 5 of 20 from long range.

Paul was called for a Flagrant-1 foul when he grabbed Jones' shoulder from behind to stop a breakaway layup. Pelicans: Center Alexis Ajinca played 11 minutes, his most in eight games. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry had not played Ajinca in six of New Orleans' previous seven games, and the 7-footer saw only 4 minutes last Sunday at Dallas. Against the Clippers, Ajinca had two points and three rebounds. ... First-round draft choice Buddy Hield played just the final 3 minutes, hitting both shots he attempted for four points. DEFENSIVE EFFORT After a Pelicans shot-clock violation, the Clippers bench was on its feet, roaring in approval of their teammates' defensive effort. ""A lot of times you see guys up cheering for big plays on the offensive end,"" Griffin said. ""It's nice when your team is excited about those little things."" In addition to holding Davis about 10 points below his scoring average, the Clippers combined for to block seven shots, including two each by Griffin, Mbah a Moute and DeAndre Jordan.

Griffin hit three 19-foot jumpers, another from 17 feet and a finger roll during a pivotal 17-5 surge. Paul assisted on three of those baskets. Paul ""pretty much controlled the whole game after halftime,"" Gentry said. ""They were kind of running freely and shooting the ball freely and taking it wherever they wanted to."" Paul said he noticed Griffin ""was in rhythm early, and if he's shooting it like that, the other team is in trouble."" Indeed, New Orleans struggled to recover after that, getting no closer than 10 points on Davis' short basket as he was fouled by Brandon Bass with 7:14 left.

The former University of Georgia standout and former Southeastern Conference player of the year finished 9 for 20 from the field. The outcome was decided early and resembled Atlanta's recent blowout losses to New Orleans and Utah. It's been a difficult run and the Hawks' worst stretch of games under coach Mike Budenholzer, now in his fourth season, since they lost 14 of 15 from Feb. 4-March 8, 2014. The Hawks played their second straight game without leading scorer Paul Millsap, who averages 16.1 points and is sidelined with a left hip injury. But star center Dwight Howard had just two points, took only four shots and was whistled for five fouls. ""I think as a team we've got to find a balance that we play inside and outside,"" Schroder said. ""We've got to keep moving the ball. We can't throw it into Dwight and he plays 1-on-1. That's not how we play, but I've got to do a better job of finding him and getting him more post touches."" Atlanta missed 10 straight shots from the field during a stretch in which it trailed 51-32 in the second. The Hawks never led after Caldwell-Pope hit a 3 at the 4:39 mark of the first. Detroit led 58-34 on Drummond's dunk of an alley-oop pass with 2 minutes left in the second. TIP-INS Pistons: Two games after hitting 12 3s in Tuesday's win at Charlotte, Detroit was torrid beyond the arc. Jon Leuer, who finished with 16 points, went 4 for 5 on 3s. Caldwell-Pope finished 5 for 8. The team record of 17 3s was first set Dec. 28, 2014, at Cleveland. Hawks: Budenholzer went with his second unit -- Hardaway, Muscala, Malcolm Delany, Taurean Prince and Kris Humphries -- to begin the third quarter. The starters -- Schroder, Howard, Kyle Korver, Thabo Sefolosha and Kent Bazemore -- combined for 20 points on 8-for-28 shooting. They were outrebounded by Detroit's starters 24-13 in the first half.","400899730"
"SAN ANTONIO -- The San Antonio Spurs are still not sure why they're playing so poorly at home. They certainly aren't panicking, though. A 16-4 start, including an 11-0 road record, will soothe most fears. Kawhi Leonard scored 23 points, including the winning jumper with 6 seconds left, and the Spurs overcame another sluggish start in their own building to beat the Washington Wizards 107-105 on Friday night. After matching an NBA record with a 40-1 mark at home last season, San Antonio has already lost four times at the AT&amp;T Center and was seconds from dropping a fifth. ""We can't get it going,"" said super-sub Manu Ginobili, whose efforts energized the Spurs. ""It's taking us a while to get into the rhythm, into the aggressiveness that we need to get leads. Yeah, we are not playing well, but the good thing is that meanwhile we're getting wins and we're maintaining a good record."" LaMarcus Aldridge added 19 points and Pau Gasol had 19 points and 10 rebounds for San Antonio, which won its 17th straight home game against Washington. Bradley Beal was 5 for 5 on 3-pointers in scoring 23 points for the Wizards. Beal's final 3 gave Washington a 103-102 lead with 53 seconds remaining. Danny Green's 3-pointer, his first points of the night, put San Antonio ahead 105-103 with 19 seconds to go. John Wall tied it at 105 with 11.2 seconds left on a driving layup against Ginobili before Leonard rose for a 20-foot jumper at the top of the key. Otto Porter Jr. missed a 9-foot runner off a Washington inbounds play that would have tied the game. ""The first look was (Beal) coming off of the curl,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""They did a good job of switching. ... But we had a good look."" Washington has just one victory in eight road games, but its fortunes were lifted by the Spurs' struggles at home this season. San Antonio trailed after the first quarter for the fifth time in nine home games. The Spurs scored only 24 points, falling behind by as many as 11 before closing the first quarter trailing 28-24. ""It seems like in the second half our defense always picks up and we get back into the games because of the defense,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""That's a good thing, I guess, that it gets better as the game goes along, but we've started out poorly here at home quite often."" The second unit again came to San Antonio's rescue, led by the 39-year-old Ginobili. He banked in a 14-footer at the close of the first half off an inbounds play that had the Wizards scrambling to find their man. In the third quarter, Ginobili helped the Spurs avoid a backcourt violation on an errant pass by tossing the ball back before tumbling to the backcourt after a leaping, one-handed grab. The save led to a jumper by Aldridge that cut Washington's lead to 71-66. ""Those are the kind of plays he's made his whole career,"" Popovich said. Ginobili finished with 13 points. San Antonio's bench outscored Washington's 11-2 in the third quarter, leading the Spurs to their first lead (78-76) since the opening minute of the game. ""We let another one go,"" Wall said. ""These are the ones at the end of the season when you look back at games where you could have made the playoffs, there are about seven games already this season for us that could haunt us."" Wizards center Marcin Gortat had 21 points and 18 rebounds, collecting his 11th double-double of the season in the first half. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington's last victory in San Antonio was Dec. 11, 1999. ... Wizards C Ian Mahinmi (sore right knee) and F Danuel House Jr. (broken right wrist) missed the game with injuries. Spurs: PG Tony Parker sat out with a bruised left quadriceps, missing his fifth game this season. ... San Antonio, which entered leading the NBA in free throw percentage, opened 1 for 6 from the line. ... The Spurs have won 19 of 21 against the Wizards overall. THAT'S NUTS Popovich is puzzled as to why people believe Spurs reserve guard Patty Mills has so much more energy than the rest of his teammates. Mills finished with 10 points and eight assists in 28 minutes. ""I don't know if it's because he's not very tall and he runs around real quick or something, but everybody else has energy, too,"" Popovich said. ""They might not look like it, because they're not built like . I'm not going to say. He's just smaller and he runs around. Like a squirrel looks like he has more energy than an elephant, right?"" Mills, listed at 6 feet, wasn't sure how to take Popovich's comparison, so he decided discretion was the better part of valor. ""Uh, I'd rather stay on this team for now and not make any comment,"" he said, laughing afterward. BATTLE OF THE BIG MEN Gasol and Gortat combined for 40 points and 28 rebounds while battling in the paint for much of the game. It was a rare battle between big men in a league that has become dominated by wing players. ""You don't see it very often,"" Popovich said. ""It was fun. Pau did a great job being more aggressive offensively.""","400899731"
"DENVER --  The Houston Rockets sure didn't look -- or play -- like a tired team. James Harden scored 20 points and the Rockets led from start to finish in beating the Denver Nuggets 128-110 on Friday night. Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson had 18 points each and Sam Dekker added 17 for Houston, which completed an impressive back-to-back road sweep that began with a 132-127 win over Golden State in double overtime Thursday. The latest victory came despite the Rockets' 5 a.m. Friday arrival in Denver. Most of the players and coaches got little sleep before playing the Nuggets. ""It's a good win for us,"" Harden said. ""Last night, double-overtime game, getting in at 5 a.m. and not really sleeping. ... We got off to a really good start, guys knocked down shots and just rode that wave the entire game."" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said the win was especially gratifying because of the circumstances and the way his team played. ""A lot of positives,"" he said. ""They found the energy to go ahead and finish up the game. It wasn't always pretty. It's a special group that can conjure that kind of energy in altitude after getting in at 5 o'clock in the morning."" Wilson Chandler had 24 points to lead the Nuggets, who had won three straight against the Rockets. The Nuggets have lost four of five overall and fell to 3-7 this season at home, the high-altitude venue where they once routinely dominated. Moreover, coach Michael Malone lit into his squad after the game over its lackluster performance. ""It's one thing to lose games but when you're outworked on your home floor -- Miami did it, Houston did it -- I have no explanation,"" Malone said. ""All I know is that it is unacceptable and that's why I do apologize to our fans because they deserve better. ""We're a bad team right now and I have to start doing a much better job because the direction we're headed right now is in a bad, bad place."" Up by 10 points at halftime, the Rockets took a 99-84 lead into the fourth quarter and kept the pressure on the rest of the way as part of a sharpshooting display that included converting 17 of 37 3-point attempts against a listless Nuggets defense. Denver went 9 of 30 from beyond the arc. The Rockets took a 73-63 halftime lead over the Nuggets, who allowed a season high in points by an opponent over the first two quarters. Houston led by as many as 15 in the first half, hitting nine 3-pointers, including four by Anderson, to gain early separation with its highest-scoring output over the first two quarters this season. The lack of defensive urgency by Denver was epitomized by Gordon's fast-break layup at the halftime buzzer as he drove the length of the court virtually uncontested in the final 3 seconds of the period. TIP-INS Rockets: F Trevor Ariza left the game in the final minutes with back spasms, D'Antoni said, apparently after coming down awkwardly while going for a rebound. ... Houston has made at least 10 3-pointers in 19 consecutive games, the longest streak of its kind in NBA history. ... Houston's previous high for first-half points was 71 against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 26. ... The Rockets are 7-2 on the road since beginning the season 2-3. Nuggets: C Nikola Jokic missed the game because of a sore left wrist. ... G Gary Harris remains sidelined with a right foot injury. ... G Will Barton returned from an ankle injury that sidelined him for the previous two games. QUOTABLE ""They played harder than us. They wanted the game more than us. It was a bad loss on our home court. They came back very, very late (to Denver). We should have jumped on them since the beginning and it was the opposite."" -- Nuggets forward Danilo Gallinari.","400899732"
"MILWAUKEE --  Bucks coach Jason Kidd wondered if his young team could rebound from a third-quarter lull. Milwaukee's kids did just that, winning their fourth straight game despite letting a 16-point third-quarter lead slip away. Matthew Dellavedova scored 12 of his season-high 18 points in the fourth quarter, helping the Bucks hold off the Brooklyn Nets 112-103 on Saturday. ""I thought it got a little sloppy,"" Kidd said. ""I wanted to see if they were going to figure it out. I wasn't going to call timeout. I wanted to see if they were going to talk themselves through it because that's what good teams do."" Milwaukee led 62-46 after a layup by Tony Snell with 8:11 left in the third, but Brooklyn closed the quarter on a 26-13 run to get within 75-72. Consecutive 3-pointers by Joe Harris gave the Nets an 82-81 lead with 10:00 to play. Sean Kilpatrick scored 13 of his 19 points in the third quarter, when he went 8 for 8 from the foul line. ""It definitely wasn't anything the coach did,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It was all the players playing well. We didn't change anything and kept with our rotations. The guys came out with focus."" With the game tied at 94, Milwaukee began a 9-1 run to lead 103-95 with 1:43 remaining. ""We had a chance in the third quarter to break the game wide open, and we didn't take it,"" Dellavedova said. ""They came back and played well. We then did a good job of pulling away."" John Henson led Milwaukee with 20 points and added seven rebounds, Giannis Antetokounmpo had 16 points and 10 rebounds, Jabari Parker added 15 points, Greg Monroe scored 13 points and Snell chipped in 10 points. ""They were just finding me,"" Henson said. ""I was open. (Antetokounmpo and Parker) are huge threats coming down the lane and off a pick-and-roll, so it is my job to finish for them and take a little heat off of them."" Bojan Bogdanovic led Brooklyn with 24 points. Brook Lopez had 13 points but was just 3 for 17 from the field and 0 for 10 in the first half. ""I just wasn't good enough,"" Lopez said. ""I made a lot of turnovers. I missed a lot of shots that I need to make. I think I let us down on both ends of the floor."" TIP-INS Nets: Forward Trevor Booker missed the game due to an illness. Anthony Bennett started in his place and had seven points and a career-high 14 rebounds. ... Lopez grabbed four rebounds to tie Derrick Coleman for second place on the Nets career list with 3,690. Bucks: Milwaukee is 10-0 after leading at halftime and 8-0 when leading after three quarters. ... The Bucks scored 62 points in the paint. ... Antetokounmpo tied his career high with five blocked shots. FAMILIAR FOES Milwaukee and Brooklyn were playing for the second time in three days after the Bucks beat the Nets 111-93 on Thursday night. The Bucks will face the same team in consecutive games four more times this season, including home-and-homes later this month with the Bulls, Cavaliers and Wizards.","400899733"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Perhaps this was the type of win the talented and young Minnesota Timberwolves needed to get on a roll. Andrew Wiggins scored 29 points, Karl-Anthony Towns added 27 points and 15 rebounds, and the Timberwolves showed late-game poise by erasing a 10-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Southeast Division-leading Charlotte Hornets 125-120 in overtime on Saturday night. ""The more close games you're in and the more you win, the better you get,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""Repetition builds habits. When you see things happen in a game, it slows everything down."" Zack LaVine added 17 points and Ricky Rubio had nine points and 12 assists for the Timberwolves, who snapped a four-game losing streak and avoided being swept by the Hornets for the third straight season. ""We came back and really made some really winning plays down the stretch,"" LaVine said. ""That's what happens when you keep fighting. We've been fighting the last four or five games and been in those positions but we got over that hump. It feels good. Now we need to keep it going."" Towns, a dominant force on the glass all night, had six points in overtime, including a backbreaking follow off a missed shot with 21 seconds left to put the Timberwolves up by six. Towns sealed the victory with two free throws with 3.9 seconds remaining. Charlotte appeared on its way to its fourth win in five games, leading 104-97 with less than one minute to play. But Minnesota battled back to tie the game in regulation with LaVine, Rubio and Wiggins all hitting 3-pointers in the final 39 seconds. Wiggins' pull-up from 31 feet in transition with 8.9 seconds tied the game at 106. The Hornets had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but Kemba Walker missed everything on a step-back 18-footer at the buzzer. ""There were a lot of mistakes on the defensive end and we gave up some big baskets,"" Walker said. ""We missed some rotations and we have to be better down the stretch."" Walker led Charlotte with 22 points and eight assists. Frank Kaminsky had 21 points and Nic Batum had 15 points and 12 assists. TIP-INS: Timberwolves: Wiggins and Towns were a combined 22 of 42 from the field. ... Blocked 10 shots. Hornets: The Hornets have given up an average of 16.5 points per game in the first quarter in the last two games, compared to a season average of 27.1 points. ... Cody Zeller had four blocks. STRONG OT START The Timberwolves took advantage of the momentum they had built at the end of regulation, opening overtime with a 7-0 run. ""You know, it always looks better when the ball is going in,"" Thibodeau said. ""When we're getting the right shots and sharing the ball, everything looks a lot better. Obviously, playing from a lead is important and we haven't been doing that."" NOT PHYSICAL ENOUGH Hornets coach Steve Clifford said he was ""especially disappointed"" with this loss because the team had emphasized getting its defense set and physicality in terms of blocking out. ""They crushed us with the block outs in the fourth quarter,"" Clifford said. ""They had at least four that might have led to nine points. That can't happen. It's been discussed and we've watched it and the reality is we either going to become a more physical group or we're not going to win -- at least not every night."" TOWNS PASSES GARNETT Towns established a new Timberwolves record with his 27th straight game with at least one blocked shot. He had two blocks against the Hornets.","400899734"
"TORONTO --  A balanced attack was the difference in a matchup of teams heading in opposite directions. DeMar DeRozan had 21 points, and Kyle Lowry and Patrick Patterson each added 17 in the Toronto Raptors' 128-84 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. It was Toronto's sixth straight win, and Atlanta's sixth loss in a row. ""Everybody's an elite scorer here,"" said Raptors forward Terrence Ross, who had 15 points, including three 3s, as Toronto (14-6) took the lead for good midway through the first quarter. ""Tonight was just one of those nights everybody had it going."" Lowry also had eight assists and eight rebounds to help Toronto tie Cleveland for the Eastern Conference lead. The NBA champion Cavaliers will be in Toronto on Monday night in an Eastern Conference Finals rematch. Dennis Schroder had 15 points and six assists for the Hawks (10-11), Dwight Howard had 10 points and 17 rebounds, and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 15 points. The Hawks are 1-9 in their last 10 games. ""There's not a lot to say,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""They thoroughly outplayed us, credit to them. That's it."" The Raptors were up by 15 at the half and led 86-70 after three quarters before turning it into a laugher early in the fourth quarter. Both teams, playing on back-to-back nights, turned the final minutes into a game for the reserves. The 44-point win was the largest margin of victory in franchise history. ""I thought the first six, seven, eight, nine minutes of the third quarter was kind of back and forth competitive and then it got away from us,"" said Budenholzer. ""The fourth quarter is the fourth quarter."" On the night, Toronto hit 58 percent from the field, including 13 for 24, or 54 percent, from 3. ""Like I always say, it's clich<U+FFFD>, but it's a make or miss league,"" said Toronto head coach Dwane Casey. ""Guys are making shots, making their shots. The ball's finding energy moving.

The Hawks shot 40 percent from the field, including 7 for 28, or 25 percent, from 3. ""We just have to stop getting frustrated with each other,"" said Howard. ""I think we got a little frustrated at times on the floor and it showed. ""I think we need to do a little better job holding our composure and understand that it won't like this the whole season."" TIP-INS: Hawks: Forward Paul Millsap missed his third straight game due to a left hip injury. Schroder had 15 points, the 19th time in 21 starts he's scored in double figures. Forward Kris Humphries, who came in averaging 4.0 points, scored 10 off the bench for the second straight game. Raptors: Forward DeMarre Carroll had 10 points, the ninth time in the past games he has reached double figures in scoring. Toronto had 60 points in the points in the paint to 36 for the Hawks. The Raptors led in bench scoring 64-38. DOUBLE DUTY: Howard had 10 points and 17 rebounds for his 627th career double-double, the most among active NBA players. RAINING 3S: The Raptors hit 13 3s, tying a franchise record with 10-plus 3s in six straight games. HE SAID IT: ""I just think we need to get out of our own heads.

"PHILADELPHIA -- As the tension of the game goes up, Isaiah Thomas calms down. Thomas scored 12 straight Celtics points late in the fourth quarter and tied his season high with 37 points to lead Boston to a 107-106 victory over the short-handed Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. Avery Bradley added 20 points for Boston, which won its ninth straight game against the 76ers. ""I just love the fourth quarter,"" Thomas said. ""Some guys get a little tight, a little timid. I embrace it. I want to be great. I want to be somebody my teammates can call on when the game is close."" The Celtics certainly know they can go to Thomas, who at 5-foot-9 can be described as a little big man. He entered ninth in the NBA in scoring (25.7 ppg) and now has five games of 30 or more points. ""We're a little bit like, `That's Isaiah,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""But he has a special ability to score the ball. My advice to anybody is buy League Pass and watch him as much as he can because he's a fun guy to watch."" Rookie Dario Saric tied his career high with 21 points while adding 12 rebounds for Philadelphia, which dressed just 10 players. The 76ers lost their sixth straight. Joel Embiid, who leads the 76ers in scoring (18.7 ppg) and rebounding (7.9 rpg), missed his seventh game as part of the team's rehab plan to not play him on consecutive nights after sitting out the last two seasons with a foot injury. Thomas scored six straight points to make it 98-91 with 3:05 left. The 76ers scored seven of the next nine to pull within 100-98 with just over a minute left. Thomas' driving attempt was blocked by Jahlil Okafor and then Saric tied it at 100 with 34 seconds left on a layup that just beat the shot clock. After a timeout, Thomas blew by two defenders for an easy layup that put the Celtics up 102-100 with 30.2 seconds left. ""That's what you see with All-Star point guards,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""He's hard to guard."" Hollis Thompson missed on a drive on Philadelphia's ensuing possession. The Celtics got the rebound and Bradley made one of two free throws with 16 seconds left for a 103-100 lead. Saric's tying 3-point attempt fell short and Marcus Smart made a pair of free throws on the other end. PHILLY'S FAST START The 76ers led by as many as 11 points in the opening half before taking a 53-45 lead into the break. The key was 3-point shooting. Philadelphia was 9 for 18 from the arc in the opening 24 minutes while the Celtics were 3 for 11. SARIC'S SURGE Saric had his best game as a member of the 76ers, who acquired him after Orlando selected him 12th in the 2014 draft. He played the last two seasons overseas. ""He was a man down there tonight,"" Brown said. ""You'd walk away and say that's a hell of a player for playing 20 games in the NBA."" Saric provided the highlight of the night when he sent Boston's Jonas Jerebko tumbling to the floor with a behind-the-back dribble before pulling up and draining an 18-footer. NOT CONNECTING The Celtics entered fifth in the league in both 3-pointers made (11.3) and attempts (31.1) per game. But they struggled from the outside against the 76ers, finishing 8 for 26. TIP-INS Celtics: This was the first of four meetings between the teams. Boston will host the next two games, on Jan. 6 and Feb. 15, before returning to Philadelphia on March 19. ... Thomas' career high is 38. 76ers: Philadelphia wore throwback jerseys from 1966-67 in honor of the 76ers NBA champions from that season. Billy Cunningham, a player on that team who later coached the 76ers to the 1983 NBA title, rang the replica Liberty Bell during pregame festivities. And many members of the team were recognized in a halftime ceremony.","400899736"

On Saturday night, it was Troy Daniels turn to fill the void for the short-handed Grizzlies. Daniels scored a career-high 31 points, and the Grizzlies hung on for a 103-100 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers after Julius Randle three free throws with 5.9 seconds left. Daniels shot 12 of 23 from the field, including 6 of 12 from outside the arc. Marc Gasol had 19 points while JaMychal Green finished with 16 points and 13 rebounds as Memphis won its second straight. ""I was just taking what the defense gave me,"" Daniels said. ""And my teammates helped me get into those spots."" Lou Williams scored a season-best 40 points for the Lakers. Luol Deng added 18, and Timofy Mozgov had with 13. ""It just flowed,"" Williams said about his shooting. ""It was just one of those games."" Memphis pulled away in a tight game with a 9-2 burst that erased a 95-94 Lakers lead in the final 5 minutes. Williams converted a three-point play with 51 seconds remaining to pull the Lakers within one possession. They then had a chance to tie when Gasol fouled Randle on a 3-point attempt. After Randle missed the third free throw, there was a scramble for the ball, and Jordan Clarkson hurled up a 3-pointer from the right corner that was off the mark. ""They made the little plays,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said about Memphis. ""Down the stretch, they got to a couple of loose balls that they turned into big plays."" Both teams were short-handed with injuries, particularly in the backcourt. Starters D'Angelo Russell and Nick Young already were out for the Lakers and Jose Calderon, who started, left in the first quarter with a right hamstring strain.

"DALLAS -- Wesley Matthews has taken greater responsibility with Dirk Nowitzki out of the Dallas Mavericks' lineup much of this season. Matthews scored 20 of his 26 points in the second half of Dallas' 107-82 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night. ""Matthews was the star of the game, obviously,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He is our leader right now with Dirk out. He really sets the tone for us in the locker room and on the floor. He is just the vocal guy."" Matthews has accepted the expanded role as Nowitzki has been limited to five games by a strained right Achilles tendon.

It's almost like we had to restructure ourselves. I think everybody has embraced that."" Harrison Barnes scored 17 of his 22 points in the first half to help Dallas improve to 4-15. Chicago was coming off a 111-105 victory over defending champion Cleveland on Friday night. Jimmy Butler led Chicago with 26 points. ""I don't think anybody played well tonight,"" Butler said. ""We didn't play with energy on either end of the floor."" Barnes powered the Mavericks to a 17-point first-quarter lead with eight points. ""They came out and threw the first punch and kept throwing, and we could just never recover from that,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We did expend a lot of energy (Friday) night."" Dwight Powell (17) and rookie Dorian Finney-Smith (11) had career highs in scoring, and Deron Williams had a season-high 15 assists with only one turnover.

Their flight landed in the DFW Metroplex at 2:30 a.m. for the second game in a stretch of four games in five days. Nikola Mirotic started in Wade's place and was scoreless in 13 minutes played. NOWITZKI ""INDEFINITE"" The Mavericks said that they no longer will keep a timetable for when F Dirk Nowitzki (strained right Achilles tendon) would play. Instead, his return will be listed as ""indefinite."" He has played in only five games this season. ""We said I'm still a few games away, but luck can change, so I just have to go day by day,"" Nowitzki said. ""At this stage in my career, I don't move well anyways, so if I'm out there at like 80, 90 percent, I don't think I'm a big help, so I want to make sure my body's responding the right way and we'll go from there.""","400899738"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Utah Jazz challenged Gordon Hayward to push his game even further last summer and become a more versatile scorer. The Jazz are seeing those results on a nightly basis through the first quarter of the season. Hayward matched his season high with 32 points and the Jazz beat the Denver Nuggets 105-98 on Saturday night. ""We talked about this early in the season. We felt like he'd expanded his game,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""He added a comfort-level in the post. ... And he's shooting off screens. He's able to score in multiple ways. ""When someone takes something away, he's able to have another option. The biggest thing Gordon's been doing is defending and, as a result, he's getting some easy baskets."" The Jazz used a 31-8 stretch in the third quarter to blow open the game. Hayward took over, scoring both inside and on the perimeter, with 21 points in the quarter. It was the third consecutive 30-point game for the seven-year veteran, who is averaging a career-high 22.8 points and has scored 20-plus points in 11 of 14 games this season. This is the first three-game, 30-point stretch of Hayward's career. ""It's a lot of work that I put in this summer, for sure,"" Hayward said. ""But, also, we're running some good sets for me. ... Just continuing to see the floor a lot better. Seeing where my shots are coming. Taking advantage of how the defense is guarding me. ... Just trusting the work that I did. ""When I'm active and play with a little bounce on the defensive end, I'm definitely more confident offensively because of that. It's all about staying active and getting myself involved in the game."" Rodney Hood chipped in 15 for the Jazz. Wilson Chandler and Will Barton each scored 20 for Denver. Denver knocked down seven 3-pointers trying to rally in the fourth quarter, but couldn't complete the comeback. The Nuggets matched a season high with 13 3-pointers. The Jazz took a 49-47 lead into halftime after a back-and-forth opening 24 minutes in which neither team was able to string together a significant run. Neither team shot the ball well from distance in the first half as the two teams were a combined 4 for 15 from behind the arc. ""I'm happy we showed a lot of fight and heart getting back in the game, not dropping our heads and feeling sorry for ourselves,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Hopefully, that can give us a little juice going forward. ""I'm just really happy with the fact we competed tonight. That's step No. 1 in our recovery."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Nikola Jokic missed his second straight game with a left wrist sprain. ... Denver is now 0-8 when trailing after the third quarter. ... The Nuggets have won just one road game since Nov. 6. Jazz: Hood returned to the starting lineup after missing the last game with a hamstring injury.  He went down hard in the third quarter and limped to the bench, but stayed in the game.  ... George Hill missed his second consecutive game with a sprained left big toe. TOUGH TIMES The Nuggets have lost five of six with a lengthy road trip ahead. Malone is not thrilled with the state of his team. ""Right now, I am living minute-by-minute, day-by-day,"" Malone said. ""We aren't playing good basketball right now. It's no secret. Our defense is evaporating rapidly."" QUOTABLE ""We started out in the first half doing all the right things,"" Chandler said. ""It was in the third quarter we kind of got away from that. Everybody, not just one person. We had to climb uphill and exert so much energy. It's hard to fight back from a 20-point deficit and get the win.""","400899739"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  While Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum didn't have their usual offensive outburst against Miami, they both got baskets when it mattered. Lillard scored 19 points and McCollum had 17, including a pair of late baskets, to rally the Portland Trail Blazers to a 99-92 victory over the Heat on Saturday night. ""We just find a way,"" Lillard said. ""You've got to gut one out like that. Find a way when your offense isn't there. I think that shows great character for our team and it shows growth."" Hassan Whiteside had 28 points and 16 rebounds for the Heat, who missed out on their first three-game winning streak of the season. Whiteside's follow shot put the Heat ahead 91-85, but McCollum made a 3-pointer with 2:57 left and Maurice Harkless' free throws narrowed the gap to 91-90 with 2:26 remaining. Wayne Ellington hit a free throw for Miami, but McCollum converted a layup and Harkless banked in a jumper to give Portland a 94-92 lead. McCollum added a jumper with just under a minute left and Portland held on for the win, outscoring the Heat 14-1 in the final 2:57. Harkless also scored 17 points for Portland, which has won three of four. The Heat, at 7-13, have struggled at times following Dwyane Wade's departure for the Chicago Bulls after 13 seasons in Miami. ""You'd like to go 3-0 but anytime you go positive on a road trip it's a motivation,"" Whiteside said, noting the Heat went 2-1 on the three-game swing. ""We can build on this."" Miami also is grappling with injuries. The team announced before the game that forward Luke Babbitt would not play because of a hip flexor. He joined forward Justise Winslow (wrist), guard Dion Waiters (groin) and Josh Richardson (ankle) on Miami's injured list and left the Heat with only 10 players available for the game. Ellington, appearing in his fourth game since returning from a deep thigh bruise, made his first start for the Heat. He finished with 12 points. Meyers Leonard's alley-oop dunk from Evan Turner gave the Blazers a 73-68 lead late in the third quarter. The Heat were hurt with 20 seconds left when James Johnson was ejected with a second technical when he got upset about a non-call. Portland's recent resurgence comes with a new focus on defense. ""We locked in,"" guard Allen Crabbe said. ""Defense is really a priority for us now."" TIP-INS Heat: The team ate on Friday night at 23Hoyt, the Portland restaurant that is partly owned by Miami coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra grew up in Portland, and played for the Portland Pilots. ... The Heat had three technical fouls in the first half. Trail Blazers: Following Saturday night's game, Portland heads out on a five-game road trip. ... McCollum missed a foul shot in the third quarter, snapping a run of 30 consecutive made free throws. WINNING TRIP Spoelstra said the positive road trip wouldn't sink in until later. ""By the time we get on the plane I'm sure we'll feel that way, but right now it stings,"" he said. ""You get up six and we really started to clamp down against a very dynamic, talented, well-schooled and experienced offensive team. They bring a lot at you but our guys were not backing off and making it as tough as possible."" KEEPING IT UNDER 100 It was just the third game this season that Portland has kept its opponent under 100 points -- demonstrating again the renewed commitment to defense. The Blazers are 3-0 in those games.","400899740"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Nope, Stephen Curry didn't know the last time Golden State dropped two in a row during the regular season. Draymond Green? Negative. That's because it's been quite a while: April 2015, to be exact. ""Let's see, I think it was my second year in the league. My third year?"" Green pondered. ""We didn't lose two in a row last year."" The Warriors realize how remarkable it is, that brilliant, NBA-best ability to bounce back. You bet, this bunch gets mad about losing. Curry scored 20 of his 31 points in the third quarter and Golden State ran its NBA-record streak of regular season games without consecutive losses to 106 by beating the Phoenix Suns 138-109 on Saturday night. ""We're a bunch of real pros. We don't have letups that often, but when we do we respond the best we can,"" Klay Thompson said. ""I thought tonight was a perfect example of that. I don't know how long we can keep that streak alive. It's really impressive, I'm not going to lie. It's something we're really proud of because it shows the world that we respond when we have an off night. The other night was one of those and tonight we made up for it."" Curry hit five 3-pointers and Thompson added 26 points and a season-high six 3s. Kevin Durant had 20 points and eight assists and Green a season-best 13 assists to go with nine points for Golden State, which hasn't lost back-to-back games during the regular season since April 2015 to San Antonio and New Orleans during its championship season. ""There's a resiliency to our team but obviously in this league anything can happen,"" Curry said. ""So for us to be able to correct mistakes and find ways to bounce back quickly and not have multiple games in a row where you don't show up to play says a lot about the character we have on this team."" The Warriors beat Phoenix for the 10th straight time, the longest winning streak by either team in the series, and 11th in a row at home. Eric Bledsoe scored 13 of his 27 points in the second quarter and Devin Booker had 21 points for the Suns, who had no answer for Golden State's 62.8-percent shooting and a 66.7-percent clip from long range (14 of 21). Golden State has three 20-point scorers in four consecutive games for the first time since Feb 10-21, 2009. The Warriors bounced back from a wild double-overtime defeat to Houston on Thursday night that snapped their 12-game winning streak -- tied for third-longest in franchise history. Warriors forward David West reached double-digit scoring for the first time with 10 points and JaVale McGee had 11 off the bench, helping Golden State follow a defeat with a victory for the 13th time in such scenarios. This marked the third meeting of the season already for the rivals, and now they won't play again until April. The Warriors also topped Phoenix at home 133-120 on Nov. 13. ""You're playing obviously the best team in basketball right now,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""They're the best scorers in the world."" TRIBUTE TO FIRE VICTIMS A moment of silence was held for the victims of a nearby warehouse fire. At least nine people were killed by the blaze less than three miles from the arena, and the Warriors announced they're donating $50,000 to support families of the victims. The Oakland Raiders late Saturday pledged to match up to $30,000 in contributions on the YouCaring.com page established by the Athletics. ""I want to start out today offering our condolences to the victims of the Oakland fire,"" Kerr said before the game . ""Just a devastating tragedy right here in the East Bay.

"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  For about ten minutes on Sunday night, it appeared the Detroit Pistons had solved the Orlando Magic's lock-down defense. Like the rest of the NBA, they will have to keep searching for answers. Orlando gave up 27 points in the first 9:30 but then shut the Pistons down in a 98-92 victory. ""I'm proud of our guys, because that team was averaging 118 points their last three games, and that was on the road,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""We held them to 92, and most of that was our second-half defense. They were at home, and they got 42 points on 37 percent shooting in the second half."" Serge Ibaka scored 21 points and blocked four shots, while Nikola Vucevic added 16 points and eight rebounds. The Magic have held 10 of their last 11 opponents under 100 points. ""We just changed our mindset,"" Ibaka said. ""We knew we could play defense, and now we're playing for each other on offense. We knew we could play this well. We just had to keep working."" Pistons guard Reggie Jackson made his season debut after missing Detroit's first 21 games with knee tendinitis. He had 18 points in 23 minutes. Marcus Morris led Detroit with 21 points. ""I felt good out there, but I wish we could have gotten a win out of it,"" Jackson said. ""I think there might have been a little rust, but I was able to do everything I need to do. I wouldn't be out there if I was going to be physically limited."" Orlando won for the third time in four games while Detroit had its three-game winning streak snapped. ""We were terrible on defense,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""Our offensive numbers were good enough to win, especially against that defense, but we didn't guard anyone. We just didn't want to put in the effort."" On Jackson's first possession, the Pistons went to their bread-and-butter play -- he and Andre Drummond running a high pick and roll. Jackson came off the screen and hit a 3-pointer, bringing a cheer from the small crowd. Jackson played the first 5:50 of the quarter as Detroit built a 16-10 lead. Morris had 14 points in the first 7 minutes but didn't get much support from his teammates. The Magic scored 35 points in the second quarter to take a 58-50 halftime lead. Orlando shot 62.5 percent from the floor in the half to Detroit's 51.2 percent and only turned the ball over four times. ""We're starting to see the value of the pass on the offensive end,"" Vogel said. ""If we pass with good timing, good intent and good delivery, it will help us shoot the ball, and we've got good shooters."" The Magic led by 11 late in the third, but the Pistons narrowed the gap to 78-73 at quarter's end. Orlando moved the margin back to double figures with nine minutes left, with the Pistons struggling to get open looks against one of the NBA's best defenses. Ibaka ended a Pistons run with a 3-pointer to make it 90-80 with 5:32 to play, then blocked Drummond's dunk attempt at the other end. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit a 3-pointer with 40 seconds left to pull the Pistons within 95-90, but Jeff Green clinched the game with a turnaround jumper. TIP INS Magic: Former Piston Jodie Meeks had seven points in 15 minutes in his second game of the season. Meeks only played three games last season for Detroit due to chronic foot problems. Pistons: Jackson spent most of the game matched up against D.J. Augustin, the main player given up by the Pistons in the three-team trade that brought him to Detroit in 2015. TROUBLE FROM THE LINE The Pistons were 0 for 5 from the free-throw line in the first half, with Drummond missing four in a row. He came into the game shooting 47.4 percent from the line after setting a league record at 35.5 percent in 2015-16. RARE STREAK The Magic have won two straight road games for the first time this season. They beat the Philadelphia 76ers 105-88 on Friday.

"OKLAHOMA CITY -- A few weeks ago, Michael Jordan helped induct Russell Westbrook into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame and called himself a fan of the Thunder guard's game. Now, Westbrook has accomplished something no one has since Jordan -- he became the first player with five consecutive triple-doubles since Jordan had seven straight in 1989. Westbrook had 28 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists on Sunday night, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the New Orleans Pelicans 101-92. The Thunder have won all five games during Westbrook's triple-double stretch, and 26 of 28 the past two years when he gets one. Westbrook said he doesn't worry about the numbers. ""I just play, honestly,"" he said. ""I don't want to get in a conversation of if I'm going to do it every night. I just go out and compete at a high level every night, like I've been doing since I've been in the NBA."" Westbrook is still averaging a triple-double for the season with averages of 31.0 points, 10.8 rebounds and 11.3 assists through 21 games. It was his 10th triple-double of the season and the 47th of his career. He's more concerned with the fact that the Thunder have recovered from a rough stretch and improved to 13-8. ""I just like to win, brother,"" he said. ""Honestly, that's the most important part. Making sure my guys are good, and making sure everybody's happy with their games, and making sure we win the game."" Enes Kanter had 17 points and 10 rebounds and Victor Oladipo added 15 points for the Thunder. Anthony Davis, the NBA's leading scorer, had 37 points and 15 rebounds for the Pelicans.

The last time he had played in Oklahoma, he scored 36 points to help the Sooners beat VCU and advance to the Sweet 16. In this game, he made 6 of 12 shots and 4 of 7 3-pointers. ""I haven't felt like that in a long time,"" Hield said. ""It's so great to get back in there and get a rhythm and see the ball go through the net. I've been struggling the last couple games, but I feel more confident."" Oklahoma City led 49-41 at halftime. Westbrook had 12 points, nine rebounds and six assists at the break, and Davis kept the Pelicans in it with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Westbrook threw down a vicious right-handed jam on a drive down the middle in the third quarter that gave Oklahoma City a 57-47 lead. He clinched the triple-double on an assist to Kanter for a dunk with 2:14 left in the third quarter. The Thunder took a 78-66 lead into the fourth quarter. Hield drained a 3-pointer to cut Oklahoma City's lead to four with just under two minutes to go, but Westbrook's 3 with 51.3 seconds to go bumped the Thunder's lead back to 99-92. ""We were still right there, and given the opportunity, Russell's going to make a big play,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""The big 3-pointer that he made was probably the difference in the game,"" TIP-INS Pelicans: G Jrue Holiday started for just the third time this season.

"NEW YORK -- They were bad enough to allow 18 straight points yet still good enough to win. That's all that matters to the New York Knicks, who ended up on the right side of the scoreboard and found beauty in an ugly game. ""It's a line drive in the score book, right?"" coach Jeff Hornacek said. Derrick Rose and Carmelo Anthony each scored 20 points and the Knicks held off the Sacramento Kings 106-98 on Sunday night for their eighth win in 11 games. The Knicks took a 21-point lead in the first half, surrendered an 18-0 run in the third quarter but outplayed the Kings down the stretch to win their third straight overall and improve to 9-3 at home. ""The main objective and the goal is just to get wins. I don't think nobody cares about stats or anything like that,"" guard Brandon Jennings said. ""As long as we win we're happy, but we've got to getter. I mean we haven't blew anybody out yet, so hopefully we can get a blowout game where other guys can play."" Jennings added 19 points and Kristaps Porzingis finished with 15 points and 14 rebounds. DeMarcus Cousins had 36 points and 12 rebounds for the Kings, but shot just 9 for 30 and tired late while playing the entire second half. ""Coach tried to take me out at the end of the third with like a minute left. I begged him could I stay in,"" Cousins said. ""I thought he was going to take me out at the beginning of the fourth but he stayed with me. Just tried to stay aggressive and keep pushing. It was a tough one tonight, but I like our team's effort. I liked that we kept fighting."" The Knicks used an 18-4 run to expand a seven-point lead to 48-27 midway through the second quarter and had a 19-point cushion in the third before suddenly sending the Kings to the foul line too much and not scoring at all, as Sacramento's 18-0 run cut it to 72-71 late in the period. Leading by two with just under five minutes left, the Knicks got a 3-pointer by Anthony to start a 7-2 spurt that finally put it away. Sacramento dropped its third straight on its road trip that was shortened to five games after a game in Philadelphia was postponed because of unsafe court conditions. TIP-INS Kings: The Kings intentionally fouled Joakim Noah away from the ball twice down the stretch and it worked -- defensively, at least -- as he missed all four free throws. But Sacramento couldn't follow up either time with a basket. ... Sacramento had its four-game winning streak against New York snapped. Knicks: Noah returned after missing two games with a sprained left ankle, but fellow starter Courtney Lee missed his second straight with the same injury. Hornacek said the guard was feeling pretty good but still having trouble moving side to side. ... Anthony left in the first quarter and went to the locker room area for treatment of a cut lower lip. ROUGH NIGHTS Among the struggling Kings were Kosta Koufos (1 for 7), Matt Barnes (1 for 11) and Arron Afflalo, who went 1 for 4 in his return to New York after playing for the Knicks last season. The Kings shot 32 percent. SEE YOU SOON When the Kings finally get home from their road trip, the first team to visit Friday is the Knicks, a team Sacramento coach Dave Joerger believes is on the rise. ""I think it's an exciting time for them,"" he said. ""I'm not really excited about playing them twice in eight days but I think they look good.""","400899744"

Thaddeus Young scored 17 points and George added 16 after missing four of the last five games in the Pacers' 111-102 victory on Sunday night that gave them a sweep of the season series for the first time since 2013-14. Indiana came back from 15 points down in the first quarter and held on after the Clippers got within four in the fourth. ""It was great to have everybody out there contributing. Everybody played a big part in this win,"" George said. ""That's got to be us. We can't put the pressure on one guy. We need this to be a collective effort every night."" Rodney Stuckey also had 16 points and Jeff Teague added 15 points for the Pacers. Miles had 12 points after missing six games with a sore left knee. Blake Griffin had 24 points and 16 rebounds for the Clippers, whose two-game winning streak was snapped in their return to Staples Center. They went 3-3 on their recent six-game road trip, including a 91-70 loss at Indiana last week. Los Angeles led by 15 in the first quarter and appeared on its way to victory, especially when the Pacers missed 15 of 22 shots. ""We didn't get off to a good start. The good thing about that was that we stayed with it,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""We started to get stops. We started to make baskets, and we worked our way back into the game, kind of grinded it out."" Indiana regrouped and eventually led by 20 in the fourth quarter. That's when the Clippers staged a furious rally, outscoring Indiana 22-9 to close to 98-93. DeAndre Jordan had a putback dunk off J.J. Redick's missed 3-pointer, but he missed the free throw to leave the Clippers down 104-100. Los Angeles has lost four of six. ""We couldn't get out of a hole,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""They were very confident against us."" George hit a 3-pointer with 48 seconds to go and Young made a pair of free throws to close out the comeback win. Jordan had 15 rebounds for the Clippers. Chris Paul added 18 points and 11 assists.

Indiana opened the third on a 19-2 run to take a 67-54 lead, with Young scoring eight and George five. The Clippers missed their first 10 shots and finished just 5 of 19 in the quarter. Stuckey's consecutive baskets sent the Pacers into the fourth ahead 83-69. ""They got us,"" Paul said. ""We started off the game well but the third quarter we just didn't have it."" TIP-INS Pacers: They narrowly missed a season low in points in the first quarter, saved only by Aaron Brooks making three free throws for 17, one off their season low. Clippers: Redick hit five 3-pointers in the first half for all of his 15 points. ... Los Angeles tied its season high with 20 turnovers. ... Three of the Clippers' six losses have come at home.

"PHILADELPHIA --  A dejected Will Barton walked toward the bench, but the Denver Nuggets guard got a reprieve because it wasn't a substitution opportunity for his team. With a second chance, Barton responded in a huge way. Barton scored 22 points, including a big 3-pointer late, to lead Denver to a 106-98 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night. Danilo Gallinari led Denver with 24 points and Jamal Murray added 22 for the Nuggets, who won for just the second time in the last seven games. It was their second contest of a six-game road trip. Ersan Ilyasova, Sergio Rodriguez and Dario Saric all had 17 points for Philadelphia, which culminated a four-game homestand with its seventh straight defeat. Murray was waiting at the scorer's table after Barton missed all four shots early in the third quarter. Barton had to quickly turn around and play defense after realizing Murray wasn't entering. From that point, Barton was 6 of 7 and tallied 16 points. ""I have to use that trick more often for some of our guys,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone joked. ""Will ramped it up and played well and I took Jamal (back). Will got the message and he picked up his defensive intensity and was all over the place."" Barton was glad to stay in the game. ""I walked off the court but they didn't let him in yet and that kind of saved me,"" he said. ""Jamal was my motivation. I had a tough little beginning to the third, but I'm a guy who can play through my mistakes. I made up for them, got my energy going, picked it up and coach let me stay out there."" Wilson Chandler, Denver's leading scorer at 18.6 points per game entering Monday, was scoreless until tallying 10 straight points beginning with a 3-pointer with 8:24 remaining that made it 84-74. He matched the Nuggets' largest lead with another 3 that made it 89-78 with 6:25 left. Joel Embiid's 3-pointer cut it to four, but Barton all but put the game away with a 3 of his own on Denver's next possession, making it 103-96 with 49 seconds to play. TOP ROOKIES MEET The game featured Murray and Embiid, the NBA's Western and Eastern Conference rookies of the month for October/November. Embiid finished with 16 points. Embiid returned after sitting out Saturday's 107-106 loss to Boston, the seventh game he has missed this season due to the team's rehab plan not to play him on back-to-back nights after he was sidelined for his first two seasons with a foot injury. The 7-foot-2 center will not make the trip to Memphis, where the 76ers will play on Tuesday night. The game was a slump buster for Murray, who was 1 for 11 with two points combined in his last two contests. He went 8 for 12, including 3 for 7 from the arc. The highlight of the third period was Murray's 17-foot underhanded scoop shot that just beat the shot clock. TURNOVERS GALORE Philadelphia coach Brett Brown bemoaned the club's 14 second-half turnovers. The 76ers finished with 19 for the game. ""There's a lot of things that led to the loss, (and) I think that's the major one,"" he said.

"TORONTO --  The Cleveland Cavaliers lost J.R. Smith to a left knee injury early in the game, though LeBron James wouldn't allow his team to let up on the Toronto Raptors one bit. James scored a season-high 34 points as the Cavaliers broke a three-game losing streak with a 116-112 victory on Monday night. It was their third straight victory this season over the Raptors, the team they beat on their way to the championship in last year's Eastern Conference finals. ""Next man up,"" he said. ""It's always been our mindset; obviously we hope the MRI's come back positive with J.R.'s injury, so it's next man up and guys have to be able to fulfill that."" Smith injured his left knee in the first quarter after landing on a jump shot and hobbled to the dressing room in considerable pain. He did not return, and the Cavaliers said X-rays taken at the arena were negative and that the guard would return to Cleveland on Tuesday for further examination. Coach Tyronn Lue said he was ""not sure on what it is,"" with regards to the precise nature of Smith's knee injury. Kevin Love had 28 points and 14 rebounds for his team-leading 13th double-double of the season and his third straight against the Raptors. Kyrie Irving added 24 points, his career-high 10th straight game with at least 20. Canadian Tristan Thompson chipped in with a season high-equaling 14 rebounds. DeMar DeRozan had 31 points and Kyle Lowry added 24 for Toronto, which had its six-game winning streak snapped. For Irving, winning the season series, and gaining the tiebreaker, over Toronto is something to celebrate, particularly when it also ended the Cavs' skid. ""We know we are going to get their best shot all the time,"" he said. ""We compete at a high level against one another, so it's great to come here or them come to Cleveland. It always comes down to basically the last two or three minutes."" Monday's game was no different. Cleveland seized control of the game in the third quarter with a 23-11 run, turning a one-point halftime edge into a 13-point lead on Love's sixth 3-pointer of the game with 3:35 to play in the quarter. The Cavs eventually took a 90-81 advantage into the fourth. A turnaround jump shot from DeRozan with 24 seconds remaining closed the gap to five, and he followed that up with a 3-pointer 10 seconds later that looked to put the result in doubt, but after review he was ruled out of bounds. Love then made a pair of free throws. ""They know how to win,"" DeRozan said. ""Throughout the whole game they understand when they have to turn it up on both ends, so with that you can't put yourself in a hole deeper than what you are already in, especially against this team. You know they are the champions."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: F Mike Dunleavy returned after missing the last two games with concussion-like symptoms. ... The Cavaliers received a scare just 1:29 into the game when James fell awkwardly after converting an alley-oop dunk. He remained on one knee and Cleveland responded by calling a timeout, but he was back on the court when the game resumed. Raptors: DeRozan tied Morris Peterson for the most appearances in Raptors' history with his 542nd game in Toronto colors on Monday. PLAYOFF PREVIEW? Lue thinks the Cavaliers will have to see the Raptors again in the postseason if they want to successfully defend their title. ""To get to the (NBA) Finals we've got to beat each other,"" he said. ""It's always a tough game when we play these guys."" GRITTED TEETH After being elbowed in the mouth by Love going for a rebound with 5:22 to play in the first quarter, Lowry headed to the dressing room to be examined by a dentist. He didn't lose any teeth and returned to the court after receiving a shot of Novocain, according to the team. PAYING TRIBUTE As part of the third annual Giants of Africa night, an event conceived by Toronto president Masai Ujiri to honor the legacy of late South African president Nelson Mandela, the Raptors wore specially designed blue warm-up T-shirts with ""1"" and ""Mandela"" on the back. Mandela's grandson, Kweku Mandela, was in attendance for the game.","400899747"
"NEW YORK --  The Nets hit a wall in the third quarter and were finished off by John Wall in the fourth. Wall scored 25 points, including 11 in the final period, to help the Washington Wizards overcome a 15-point halftime deficit and beat Brooklyn 118-113 on Monday night. ""I was just being aggressive,"" Wall said. ""I missed some shots in the third quarter that I was mad about. But the defense was giving me shots and I had it rolling and I just kept making them."" The Wizards trailed by as many as 16 points in the first half and 66-51 at halftime. However, Washington scored the first 13 points of the second half to pull within two points and went on to lead 83-81 after three quarters. The Nets committed 10 turnovers in the third quarter, when they have struggled all season. ""Our hands were active in that third quarter and that changed the game,"" said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. ""Brooklyn couldn't get into their offense. They were under duress to make that first pass, and that is what we have to do to start the game."" Bradley Beal's 3-pointer gave the Wizards a 107-106 lead with 3:27 left and Wall scored five consecutive points to up the advantage to 112-106. The Nets pulled within 116-113 on Sean Kilpatrick's layup with 39 seconds left and had a chance to tie after Kelly Oubre Jr. missed a 3-point attempt with 19 seconds left. However, the Nets did not call a timeout and Beal stole the ball from Joe Harris, the Nets' 22nd and final turnover of the game. ""It's one of those situations where we made a great defensive stop and Coach really wanted us to roll with it offensively,"" Harris said. ""He wasn't going to call anything in particular. It's just one of those unfortunate plays late in the game."" Wall hit two clinching free throws with 5 seconds left. Beal and Otto Porter Jr. finished with 18 points apiece and Markieff Morris added 16 for Washington. Marcus Thornton scored 11 points, while Marcin Gortat and Oubre each had 10. Gortat also had 12 rebounds. ""It was all about effort,"" Beal said. ""In the first half we were horrible on defense. At halftime we were real disappointed in ourselves, so we did a good job of flipping the switch."" Brook Lopez scored 25 and Kilpatrick had 21 for the Nets. Bojan Bogdanovic added 18 points and Trevor Booker had 14 points and 14 rebounds. ""It's just been the story of our season,"" Lopez said. ""I don't know what it is. I wish I had the answer, but it's something we need to figure out."" TIP-INS: Wizards: Washington has won the last four meetings against the Nets. The Wizards have not lost a game in the series since April 10, 2015. The Wizards swept the season series in two of the last three years and have won nine of the last 11, overall. Nets: Brooklyn has not won consecutive games this season. The last time the Nets put two victories together was March 24 and 26 last season. EMPTY NETS Since March 28 of last season, Brooklyn has posted a 5-25 record. That span has included losing streaks of 10 and seven games. HOME SWEET HOME Beginning on Tuesday against Orlando, the Wizards will play six of their next seven games at home in the Verizon Center. Washington is 5-5 at home this season, but only 2-7 on the road.","400899748"
"ATLANTA --  At first, Russell Westbrook couldn't get the shots to fall. No problem. He crashed the boards and kept looking for his teammates. Then, he found his shooting touch. The result: another triple-double for the Oklahoma City star. Westbrook scored 32 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and dished out 12 assists, extending his streak of triple-doubles to six games as the Thunder held off the Atlanta Hawks 102-99 on Monday night. It is the NBA's longest such run since Michael Jordan had seven in a row in 1989. ""I just read the game,"" Westbrook said. ""The game will tell you what to do."" Westbrook has sparked a six-game winning streak by the Thunder and reached double figures in all three categories in half of their 22 games. By contrast, Jordan had 15 triple-doubles for the entire 1988-89 season. ""Obviously, the league hasn't seen something like this in a long, long time,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Westbrook kept his streak alive with plenty of time to spare. He had 15 points and 11 rebounds when he picked up his 10th assist with 6:20 left in the third quarter. Scooping up a loose ball after a turnover by the Hawks, Westbrook led a 2-on-1 that ended with a pass to Victor Oladipo for a layup that gave the Thunder a 69-59 lead. ""My job is to find those guys,"" Westbrook said. He found his range in the third quarter after missing eight of his first nine shots. Westbrook knocked down five of seven, three of them beyond the arc, and finished with 16 points in the period as the Thunder stretched a one-point halftime lead to 83-69 heading to the fourth. Atlanta rallied down the stretch, but Westbrook closed it out for the Thunder. He finished with 27 second-half points to send the Hawks to their seventh straight loss and 10th defeat in the last 11 games. It's the longest losing streak for the Hawks since they dropped eight in a row in February 2014. Coach Mike Budenholzer decided to shake things up, sending Kyle Korver to the bench and putting Thabo Sefolosha in the starting lineup. The Hawks also were bolstered by the return of Paul Millsap, who had missed three straight games with a sore hip. He led five players in double figures with 24 points. It didn't matter. Westbrook made sure of that. ""He can do so many different things,"" said Sefolosha, who was often matched on Westbrook. ""It's definitely mind-blowing. And the way he does it. He's everywhere."" Atlanta had a shot to send the game to overtime after Korver forced a jump ball. Westbrook and the Thunder clamped down defensively off the inbounds play, and Tim Hardaway Jr.'s desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer failed to hit the rim. ""Can't dwell on it,"" Hardaway said. ""I've got to move on to the next play, the next game."" KORVER'S NEW ROLE Korver played more than 31 minutes and seemed to thrive in his new role as a backup. He finished with 15 points on 5-of-9 shooting, knocking down three of them beyond the arc. It was his most points in a game since Nov. 22. Korver had averaged 6.6 points over his last seven games, which led to his benching. MONSTER JAM Oladipo wasn't afraid to take on Dwight Howard in the lane. During the second quarter, the 6-foot-4 Thunder guard drove the baseline and slammed one over Atlanta's 6-11 center, rocking the rim and drawing gasps from the crowd. Oladipo savored the moment, pumping his fists, stomping his feet and posing briefly in the lane even as the Hawks took off the other way. RECRUITING DWIGHT Donovan made a recruiting pitch to Howard while coaching at Florida. During his pregame chat with the media, the Oklahoma City coach recounted a visit to Howard and his father at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy. Donovan quickly gave up any hope of getting Howard to attend college. ""All I had to do was watch one AAU game and then I stopped recruiting him immediately,"" he quipped. Howard, of course, went straight from high school to the NBA in the days before the rules required at least one year of college. He was the first overall pick by the Orlando Magic in 2004.","400899749"
"CHICAGO --  Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers learned from last month's blowout loss to Chicago. They turned that knowledge into their own road win Monday night. Lillard had 30 points and seven assists, CJ McCollum scored 24 and the Trail Blazers beat the Bulls 112-110 for their third consecutive victory. Portland had won five of six before Chicago visited the Moda Center on Nov. 15 and rolled to a 113-88 win. That loss started the Blazers on a bit of a slide, but they are rounding into form again. ""I think the game in Portland helped us prepare for what kind of game it was going to be,"" Lillard said. ""We saw how physical they were. They compete on both ends of the floor. ... We just came in with the right mindset, knowing what to expect."" Allen Crabbe added 17 points for Portland, which opened a five-game trip with its fourth win in five games. Maurice Harkless had 11 and Evan Turner finished with 10, providing a nice boost in the fourth quarter. ""I'm really pleased the way we responded after the way they beat us the first time,"" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Dwyane Wade scored 34 points for the Bulls, and Jimmy Butler finished with 26 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Robin Lopez had seven points and a season-high 14 rebounds. Chicago played without point guard Rajon Rondo, suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team. There was no public indication from the Bulls on what triggered Rondo's suspension. He is expected to return Tuesday night in Detroit. ""He's obviously very important with what we do in this building,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""He's a guy that really gets us out and establishes the tempo for our team, especially in the fourth quarter. He's important for what we do, but that's not the reason we lost the game."" Portland trailed 93-92 before Ed Davis converted a driving layup with 8:19 left, sparking an 11-0 run for the Trail Blazers. Turner made three straight jumpers and Lillard connected from long range to make it 103-93 with 5:55 left. Chicago closed to 108-105 on Nikola Mirotic's two foul shots with 1:56 remaining, but Lillard made four free throws in the final seconds to help Portland hold on. ""We used a lot of energy coming back in the third quarter and then from there we didn't make enough shots,"" Wade said. Mirotic finished with 18 points and seven rebounds for the Bulls, who have dropped three of four. Isaiah Canaan had 10 points. Lillard scored 17 to help Portland to a 65-57 halftime lead. The Trail Blazers shot 55 percent in the first half, but the Bulls turned it up on defense to get back in the game in the third quarter. Mirotic capped an 18-4 run with two foul shots, giving Chicago a 75-70 lead with 5:44 left. The Bulls had an 87-83 advantage before McCollum made a 3-pointer in the final second of the period, trimming the lead to one heading into the final quarter. AMINU'S RETURN Portland forward Al-Farouq Aminu had three points in 17 minutes in his return to the lineup after being sidelined by a left calf injury. Aminu started the first eight games of the season before he got hurt Nov. 8 against Phoenix. ""You could tell he had a little rust, but it was good to see him back on the court,"" Stotts said. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: C Mason Plumlee had 10 points, five rebounds, two steals and two blocked shots. ... Portland went 13 for 18 from the free throw line, compared to 33 of 38 for Chicago.

"MILWAUKEE -- San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich can't figure out why his team plays so much better on the road than at home. As long as they keep winning, Popovich will gladly take the results. LaMarcus Aldridge was credited for the go-ahead basket with 21.2 seconds left after Giannis Antetokounmpo was whistled for goaltending, completing the Spurs' rally from 15 points down midway through the third quarter in a 97-96 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night. ""You don't win every game by 20. They played well. That's how they stuck with us. They're young and athletic and hungry,"" Popovich said in typical gruff fashion. ""What are we, the Magic Johnson Lakers with Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) and everybody? We're just like everybody else,"" he added. Milwaukee had one last shot to retake the lead, but Mirza Teletovic missed an open 3-pointer from the right corner with 3.9 seconds left. Aldridge secured the rebound and the Spurs ran out the clock. The Bucks went the final 2:25 without a bucket. ""You cannot afford to make a lot of mistakes and put them in the game,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""They can take away the game as they did tonight."" San Antonio extended its season-opening road winning streak to 12 games in thrilling fashion. Aldridge had 18 points. Kawhi Leonard finished with 22 points and nine boards. The Spurs improved to 17-4 overall, but don't ask Popovich about the home-road disparity. ""I don't care, I have no clue,"" he said before the game. ""You ask me, I'm the coach, I'm supposed to know? Ask me about the .500 at home. Start with the bad."" Aldridge had 18 points, while Kawhi Leonard finished with 21 points and nine rebounds. BUCKS BALL Jabari Parker had 23 points, picking up the slack for much of the fourth quarter with Antetokounmpo on the bench with five fouls. Parker slashed through the lane for buckets and rebounds. But the team went scoreless after Parker's running bucket with 2:25 left for a three-point lead. ""You can also grow from losing, too,"" coach Jason Kidd said. ""I think tonight, we can learn a lot from our mistakes."" Antetokounmpo finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds. DEDMON ON The Spurs' bench keyed the second-half rally. San Antonio trailed 57-42 with 7:27 left in the third before reserves Dewayne Dedmon (10 points) and Nicholas Laprovittola (five assists) gave the team a spark. Dedmon ""made them guard a different way because he was at the rim. He was really special for us,"" Popovich said. TENSE MOMENT Tensions rose late in the third quarter after Dedmon and Monroe grappled for a rebound. San Antonio's Davis Bertans and Milwaukee's Michael Beasley were ejected for their roles in the shoving match. TIP-INS: Spurs: G Tony Parker started after missing the previous two games with a thigh contusion. He had six points and five assists in 18 minutes before limping off with about 9 minutes left in the third quarter after falling hard to the floor and appearing to grab at his left knee. Parker stayed on the bench the rest of the night, and Popovich said he could be out for a while. ... The Spurs hit their first three 3-point shots of the game before going 1 of 11 from behind the arc the rest of the first half. They trailed 48-35 at halftime. Bucks: Antetokounmpo was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week after averaging 24.3 points, 10.0 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 3.7 steals and 3.0 blocks per game.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Marc Gasol's second career triple-double didn't mean nearly as much to him as his game-tying 3-pointer late in regulation, his game-saving block late in the first overtime, or his 17-foot jumper late in the second overtime that wound up being the decisive basket. Gasol had 28 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists, and the Memphis Grizzlies outlasted the New Orleans Pelicans 110-108 in double overtime on Monday night. ""We played a lot of minutes, so numbers don't really matter,"" Gasol said. ""As long as you do the right thing and you win, obviously, that's the only thing."" Troy Daniels hit seven 3s and finished with 29 points in a reserve role for Memphis, including a game-tying 3 with 15 seconds left in the first overtime. ""The hoop is like an ocean, and as a shooter, that's what you want to see,"" said Daniels, who scored a career-high 31 points, also coming off the bench, in the Grizzlies' previous victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. ""I feel like I'm getting my rhythm. ... I've been working all summer just for this."" Anthony Davis had 28 points and 17 rebounds for New Orleans, which has lost three straight. Langston Galloway hit six 3s and scored a season-high 26 points, helping the Pelicans erase a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit. But Galloway missed a corner 3 that could have won it as second extra period ended. What bothered Davis most were the Grizzlies' 13 offensive rebounds that led to 13 second-chance points, none more damaging that Daniels' tying 3 at the end of the first overtime, which came after Gasol rebounded his own missed 3 and kicked the ball back out. ""If we just come up with the rebounds the outcome might have been different,"" Davis said. ""All you can ask for is that you just battle and keep fighting and that's what we did. So the locker room was fine. Of course, we want to come out with that win, especially at home."" Tony Allen had 19 points, 14 rebounds and three steals for the Grizzlies, who've won three straight despite having a handful of regulars injured. JaMychal Green grabbed 15 rebounds to go with two blocks and two steals, while Andrew Harrison scored 12 points, including a tying 3 with 1:50 left in the second overtime. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis had only 10 players in uniform. ... The Grizzlies announced that forward James Ennis, sidelined since straining his right calf at Charlotte on Nov. 21, has begun non-contact, on-court basketball activities. The club says Ennis will remain listed as out for all games this week and be re-evaluated in seven to 10 days. Pelicans: Prior to tip-off, the Pelicans announced guards Jrue Holiday and E'Twaun Moore would not play because they each had toe injuries, leaving just nine players available. ... Buddy Hield, drafted sixth overall last summer, got his second start of the season and scored eight points in 24 minutes. CLUTCH GRIZZLIES Each of Memphis' past five victories have come by five or fewer points, including another double-overtime win over Philadelphia on Nov. 23. ""If it's a close game, it's our kind of game,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""We're learning how to play well in those situations. The guys trusted each other late in the game and made the plays that need to be made."" WORN OUT The Pelicans were not only short-handed but had just played on the road Sunday night, losing to Oklahoma City. Davis had played more than 90 minutes in about 26 hours by the time his off-balance 15-footer clanged off the rim with 55 seconds left in the second OT with his team trailing by a basket. ""I was definitely feeling it. I just tried to push through it,"" Davis said. ""We're all feeling it, back-to-back and then coming into a double-overtime game -- both (games) with two physical teams."" FINAL SEQUENCE New Orleans wound up with three shots to win or tie in the final half minute. Galloway missed a 3, but Solomon Hill rebounded for the Pelicans with 22 seconds left. New Orleans then ran a play for Davis, who missed amid a crowd of defenders inside. But Davis tied up Gasol on the rebound and then won a jump ball, leading to Galloway's final shot at the horn.","400899752"
"HOUSTON --  Houston's coaching staff emphasized to the players that Boston led the league in fourth-quarter scoring. So when they Rockets found themselves down by six entering the final frame they knew they'd have step things up to escape with a win. Harden made sure they did that, scoring 13 of his 37 points in the fourth before Al Horford missed a shot just before the buzzer to allow the Rockets to hold on for a 107-106 victory Monday night. ""The fourth quarter we just picked up ... we just wanted to lock in and get stops and offensively be aggressive,"" Harden said. The game was tied before Harden scored five straight points to make it 107-102 with less than a minute remaining. Avery Bradley made a jump shot and Harden received a flagrant 1 foul for elbowing Marcus Smart in the face. Smart made both free throws before Isaiah Thomas missed a layup. But Houston knocked the ball out of bounds with 5.2 seconds left, giving Boston one last chance. Horford drove into the lane, but his shot rolled off the rim and Harden grabbed it to secure the victory. ""I felt good when I shot it, but it just didn't go down,"" Horford said. Horford had 21 points and Thomas added 20 for the Celtics, who had won two straight. It was the ninth 30-point game this season for Harden, who also had eight assists and seven rebounds. An 8-2 run by Houston, powered by a pair of 3-pointers by Eric Gordon, cut Boston's lead to one with about 8 1/2 minutes left. Smart made a 3-pointer for the first of seven straight points for the Celtics that made it 96-88. Smart also had a big defensive play in that stretch when he blocked a one-handed dunk attempt by Montrezl Harrell. Houston scored eight straight points, topped off with a dunk from Harrell, to take a 102-100 lead with about 3 1/2 minutes left. Harden raved about Harrell's work. ""You see how he's flying around everywhere,"" Harden said. ""He does a lot of different things, some things that don't show up on the stat sheet that helped contribute to this win."" The Celtics trailed by 12 early in the third quarter before using a 15-2 spurt to take a 68-67 lead with about 7 minutes left in the quarter. Boston made three 3-pointers in that span, capped by one from Horford. Houston missed five shots, including four 3s, and had two turnovers to help the Celtics close the gap. ""We guarded at a different level and our first unit played pretty well in the third,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""In one stretch in the fourth we turned the ball over and that was hurtful."" The Rockets were up by three points with 2 minutes left in the first half before Smart fouled Harden on a 3-point attempt and he made all three free throws. Houston had extended the lead to seven when Smart again fouled Harden on a 3-point try and his three free throws made it 58-48 at halftime. TIP-INS Celtics: James Young missed the game with an illness. ... Thomas received a technical for arguing a call at the end of the first half. ... Bradley finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds. ... Smart had 13 points. Rockets: Made 12 3-pointers to extend their NBA record of consecutive games with at least 10 3-pointers to 20. ... Trevor Ariza started despite dealing with back spasms and had 15 points and eight rebounds. ... Gordon finished with 19 points and made four 3-pointers to give him six straight games with at least four 3s. PERFECT Harden tied a franchise record for most free throws without a miss by making all 18 of his attempts on Monday night. Kevin Martin also went 18 for 18 on March 20, 2011 against Utah. He lamented committing the offensive foul on Smart late instead of drawing the foul and getting a chance to go to the line and set the record. ""Of course I wanted two free throws at the end of the game instead of a flagrant, but we won,"" he said. ""That's all that matters."" LATE PUSH The Rockets have developed a knack for scoring late. After managing just 13 points in the fourth quarter of a 105-103 loss to Oklahoma City on Nov. 16 the Rockets have picked things up, averaging 27.9 fourth-quarter points in the last 10 games. THEY SAID IT Stevens on Harden: ""Harden is a really good player. I don't know what else to say. We could go through and dissect every play, but overall he is just a really good player.""","400899753"
"DALLAS --  Yet another Dallas injury opened the door for a Charlotte Hornets rally. Kemba Walker scored 19 points, Nicolas Batum had 14 points and 15 rebounds, and the Hornets came back from an 11-point, third-quarter deficit to beat the Mavericks 109-101 on Monday night. Already down three regulars to injury, Dallas lost center Andrew Bogut late in the first quarter to a right knee injury. While the Mavericks didn't think the injury was serious, the Hornets took advantage to dominate the boards, outrebounding the Mavericks 55-35 and scoring 54 points in the paint. ""That's a big difference,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said of Bogut's absence. ""He's always been a terrific basket protector. If you take him out, those other guys are good, but it's a different level of rim protection."" Marco Belinelli scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half, including the team's first two 3-pointers after the Hornets missed their first 14 from long range. Six Hornets scored in double figures. Jeremy Lamb added 10 of his 14 points in the fourth quarter, including a 3 with 13.9 seconds remaining to hold off a late Dallas run. Harrison Barnes scored 29 points for the Mavericks and Deron Williams had his first double-double of the season with 15 points and 13 assists. ""It seems like we get someone back and somebody else goes down,"" said Williams, who had missed eight games of his own due to a calf strain. It's been tough. We'd really like to have Dirk (Nowitzki) out there, and J.J. (Barea). You can't control certain things so we've just got to keep on trucking."" After a 15-4 Mavericks run early in the third quarter temporarily opened up a back-and-forth game, the Hornets answered with a 10-1 spurt and the game stayed close into the final minutes. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle was assessed a technical foul arguing a call and Batum converted the free throw for a 98-91 lead with 4:26 to play, capping a 15-5 Hornets run. After the Hornets opened the lead to 104-95 with 2:01 to play, Dallas scored the next six points and had a chance to get closer, but Cody Zeller blocked Williams' shot in the lane with 34 seconds to play and Lamb followed with his 3. ""It's a tough environment, but we stuck together today,"" Lamb said. ""We got down 10, but we kept fighting, and we were able to pull out a win."" SIGH OF RELIEF Bogut limped off the court with 45 seconds left in the first quarter after a collision with Charlotte's Roy Hibbert, grabbing his right knee immediately. He was quickly ruled out for the rest of the game. But Carlisle said initial reports were positive and that the knee was only hyperextended. ""The X-ray was clean from the information that I got,"" Carlisle said. ""We'll probably have more information in a day or so. At this point, it appears we dodged a bullet."" Bogut was not available for comment after the game. LONG ODDS After 16 seasons in a row of finishing .500 or better and making the playoffs in 15 of those seasons, the Mavericks are just 4-16.

"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers began the game without four injured regulars, and lost a fifth in the second half. The Utah Jazz were merely without their coach and second-leading scorer. In a game defined by who was missing, Gordon Hayward and the Jazz continued to assert themselves in the Western Conference. Hayward scored 23 points and Utah overcame the absence of ill coach Quin Snyder for its sixth victory in seven games, 107-101 over the depleted Lakers on Monday night. Rodney Hood scored 16 points and hit two difficult shots in the waning minutes to keep the Jazz on track to win their only road game in a nine-game stretch. They made up for the absence of George Hill with scoring balance: seven players managed at least nine points. Veteran assistant Igor Kokoskov ran the Jazz for Snyder, who fell ill earlier in the day and decided he couldn't coach shortly before game time. Utah's bus also got stuck in traffic and arrived late at Staples Center. ""It's difficult, but to be a pro, you have to be there and be prepared for your team,"" Kokoskov said of his last-minute NBA head coaching debut. ""The team needs you, and you have to step up. That's what we ask from our guys, and that's what you do as a coach."" Players on both benches stepped into important roles. Lou Williams had 38 points, six rebounds and seven assists for the Lakers, who rallied in the fourth quarter and nearly stole a victory despite finishing their eighth loss in 11 games without a large chunk of their roster. Tarik Black sprained his right ankle in the third quarter and joined D'Angelo Russell, Nick Young, Jose Calderon and Larry Nance Jr. on the sidelines as Los Angeles lost its third straight while playing its ninth game in 14 days. Injuries and a brutal schedule have conspired to slow down the Lakers' encouraging start under first-year coach Luke Walton, but Williams led another thrilling rally. ""It's been tough, because we're kind of short-handed right now,"" said Jordan Clarkson, who scored 17 points. ""It just shows we ain't backing down from anybody, and we ain't letting up. This time will pass and we'll get back to winning games."" Williams scored nine points early in the fourth quarter, and Julius Randle's layup trimmed Utah's lead to 98-95. But Hood nailed two tough shots during Utah's ensuing 9-2 run to ice it. ""Quin is our leader, so it definitely was a different situation for us,"" Hayward said after his eighth consecutive 20-point game. ""I thought Coach Igor and the rest of the staff did a great job."" LOUUUUU Two nights after scoring 40 points in Memphis, Williams put together the first back-to-back 30-point games of his 12-year NBA career. He also became the first Lakers player to score at least 38 points in successive games since Kobe Bryant in March 2013. ""When we need him, he has stepped up on the court,"" Walton said. ""That gives other people a lot of confidence."" KOKOSKOV'S TURN Kokoskov got his first game in charge of an NBA team after a long career as an assistant with six franchises and as a head coach in Europe. The 44-year-old Serbian first arrived stateside in 1999 as an assistant to Snyder at Missouri. RON-RON RETURNS With his top two point guards out, Walton came up with an unorthodox starting lineup due to injuries. Seldom-used veteran Metta World Peace joined a group with no players under 6-foot-7 as a counter to the Jazz's big lineup. World Peace became the 11th player to start a game for the Lakers this season. The 37-year-old veteran hadn't started since March 18, and he had appeared in just four of the Lakers' previous 14 games. TIP-INS Jazz: Kokoskov is the head coach of Slovenia's national team in his spare time. He also spent seven years as Georgia's head coach. ... Hill missed his third straight game with a sprained left big toe. Lakers: Calderon will be out at least two more weeks with a strained right hamstring. ... Russell will be re-evaluated Tuesday to determine how much longer he will be sidelined by a sore knee. He had a platelet-rich plasma injection in the joint two weeks ago.","400899755"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Klay Thompson wanted one more quarter. He wanted to score 80, and thinks he absolutely could have. Hard to argue that one: He went off for 60 points in 29 head-shaking, jaw-dropping, defense-breaking minutes. ""Who knows? I know he would have kept shooting,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""Klay's never going to stop shooting."" Thompson had an NBA season-high and career-best performance for the highest-scoring output by a Golden State player in more than 42 years, and the Warriors whipped the Indiana Pacers 142-106 on Monday night. At one point, Pacers coach Nate McMillan looked downright speechless during a quiet timeout on his bench. Thompson raised his arms to encourage more of those steady ""KLAY! KLAY! KLAY!"" chants then let it fly again and again. He had 60 through three and called it a night, sitting down with 1:22 left in the period as fans jumped to their feet for an extended standing ovation. ""It's just unfortunate two times I got my career high I didn't get to play the fourth quarter,"" Thompson said. He scored 40 by halftime in just 18-plus minutes. Nearly two years ago, Thompson had a 37-point quarter on the way to 52 points against Sacramento. Thompson joined Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain, Rick Barry and Joe Fulks as the only Warriors to score 60 points. Barry was the last to do so, going off for 64 on March 26, 1974, against Portland. Now, Thompson hopes he gets a chance to go for more. ""Maybe. I think I could have, maybe one day I'll have the opportunity,"" he said, ""But 60 in 29 minutes is not too bad."" Thompson shot 21 for 33 and 8 of 14 on 3-pointers -- 15 of 22 with five 3s in the first two quarters -- and converted 10 of 11 free throws in 29 minutes. When he knocked down a turnaround baseline 3 under pressure midway through the second quarter right in front of a resting Curry on the bench, the shot sent the MVP into a tunnel-dashing frenzy of delight. ""That's a feat that I put money on will probably never be touched ever again in the history of basketball,"" Curry said. Previously this season the highest scorers were Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook with 51 in an overtime game and Anthony Davis with 50 in regulation for the Pelicans. ""I felt every shot I took was a good shot,"" Thompson said. Kevin Durant added 20 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two blocks for Golden State in another display of impressive passing. The Warriors' 15 first-quarter assists matched a franchise record done twice previously and they wound up with 45 total -- two off the franchise record they set Nov. 24 against the Lakers. In one sensational third-quarter play worthy of the highlight reel, Thompson had no part: Off a jump ball, Draymond Green hit Curry with a long heave and Curry made a leaping, one-touch pass to Durant for the dazzling alley-oop. Curry had 13 points and 11 assists. Thompson scored 17 points in just under 9 minutes to begin the game and Golden State had 15 assists on its initial 17 baskets and led 38-27 after the first. ""A guy like that, the best defense is not to allow him to catch,"" McMillan said. Paul George had 21 points and 10 rebounds a night after playing nearly 34 minutes and much of that with tissue in his bloody nose. TIP-INS Pacers: The Pacers own a 2-7 road record. They have lost eight of 10 on Golden State's home floor. Warriors: The Warriors notched their second game with 40 or more assists, the first team since Cleveland in 1992-93 with more than one 40-assist game. ... They recognized the AFC-leading Oakland Raiders, with quarterback Derek Carr and others in attendance. ... Golden State is 6-0 against the Eastern Conference. SELLOUT MILESTONE The Warriors reached 200 straight sellouts over the regular season and playoffs, to which Warriors coach Steve Kerr joked, ""If I had to do the math, I haven't even been here for half of those."" It's long been a daunting road venue for opponents. ""You've got to bring your best to play here,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""You've got to come here and you've got to hoop. Certainly if you don't, you don't come out of here with a win. Great atmosphere.""","400899756"
"WASHINGTON --  A rare offensive outburst by the Orlando Magic overcame the biggest night of John Wall's career. Elfrid Payton scored 22 of his career-high 25 points in the first half and the Magic beat the Washington Wizards 124-116 on Tuesday despite Wall's 52-point performance. The Magic were averaging 93.2 points and scored over 100 points in just five of their first 21 games but shot 52 percent en route to a third straight victory. ""We're growing on that end of the floor,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""We got several great contributions, starting with Elfrid Payton coming off the bench having the game of his life. He was terrific tonight."" Wall had the highest-scoring game of his career and kept Washington in it with 33 points in the second half as the Wizards cut the lead below 10 in the fourth quarter. The guard made 18 of 31 from the field and added eight assists. ""I mean, (in the) third quarter I started to make shots, and I was trying to be more aggressive at times,"" Wall said. ""I was able to be aggressive and get into the paint and make some easy shots."" Payton played like Wall in the first half as he went 8 for 8 from the field and 3 for 3 from the line, nearly matching his previous season best of 23 points in the first two quarters alone. Payton finished 9 for 12 and handed out nine assists. ""They were playing off a little bit, so they gave me a couple of open looks,"" Payton said. ""They just looked like they were staying home so just trying to be a little bit more aggressive."" Orlando's 124 points were a season high. Jeff Green scored 13 of his 20 in the first half for Orlando. Green went to Georgetown and played his college basketball at the Verizon Center, and he made a key 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter that stopped a Washington rally. ""(The offense) was clicking,"" Green said. ""We were making shots, making the extra pass, trusting each other, and we got it done."" The Magic scored the game's first seven points and the lead went back and forth until they took command in the second quarter. Orlando (10-12) slowly pulled away, making 13 of its first 18 shots in the second quarter to take a 62-48 lead with just under 3 minutes left. The Magic scored 40 points in the period en route to a 65-52 halftime edge. Seven Orlando players scored in double figures. Bismack Biyombo contributed a season-high 14 points and grabbed 13 rebounds. Only three Wizards scored in double figures. TIP-INS Magic: The Magic are 5-1 when scoring 100 points. ... Vogel called off practice Monday, and his team took a trip to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History &amp; Culture. Wizards: Ian Mahinmi remains out with a sore knee -- the non-surgically repaired one is the problem now. Coach Scott Brooks said the center had an MRI last week. ... Brooks also said Sheldon McClellan has been assigned to Delaware of the D-League and will play three or four games there. A LITTLE HELP FROM THEIR FRIENDS The Orlando bench gave the starters a lift by scoring 73 points. Payton and Green led the way while Jodie Meeks added 18, and Nikola Vucevic had 10. The four combined to make 24 of 37 shots (67 percent) from the field. NO DEFENSE The 124 points were the most Washington has allowed in a home game this season, and the second-highest amount the Wizards have allowed in any game.","400899757"
"MIAMI --  It's been a long time since the New York Knicks were in this position. More than three years, to be precise. Carmelo Anthony matched a season high with 35 points, and the Knicks took advantage of second chances all night to beat the injury-ravaged Miami Heat 114-103 on Tuesday night. At 12-9, New York is three games over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2012-13 season. ""Any time you can put together some wins you feel confident, you feel comfortable, you feel like you're heading in the right direction, and I really feel we're doing that,"" Anthony said. ""We're heading in the right direction."" Kristaps Porzingis had 14 points and 12 rebounds for New York, which has won four straight. The Knicks lost Derrick Rose to back spasms in the third quarter, but still scored 61 points after halftime. ""We just came out in the second half knowing that we have to win the game and that we have to play better,"" Porzingis said. Goran Dragic scored 29 points and Hassan Whiteside finished with 23 points and 14 rebounds for the Heat, who fell to 2-8 at home. New York had a 31-13 edge in second-chance points, and outscored Miami 56-36 in the paint. ""Sometimes the ball goes that way,"" Whiteside said. The teams were tied at 68 late in the third quarter, when the Knicks went on a 27-13 run over the next eight minutes to take control. Anthony finished 13 for 27 from the field, and Porzingis and Joakim Noah combined for 22 rebounds. The Heat had nine players, and might not have any more than that until next week. Justise Winslow missed his 12th consecutive game with a sore left wrist, and James Johnson (right rotator cuff), Dion Waiters (groin), Luke Babbitt (right hip) and Josh Richardson (right ankle) were also sidelined. None are slated to travel for Miami's three-game, four-day stretch that starts Wednesday in Atlanta. The Heat are leaving some staff in Miami to work with the injured players. ""They're getting way more work in than they would get on the road,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. TIP-INS Knicks: Coach Jeff Hornacek is now 1-5 against Miami. He's beaten every team he's faced, and has yet to coach against his former Phoenix club. ... The Knicks missed their first 11 3-point tries, then made 7 of their last 14. ... New York is over .500 this late in a season for the third time in 12 years. ... Not a good sign for Wednesday, when Cleveland visits the Knicks: New York is 0-4 on the second night of back-to-backs this season. Heat: It was Dragic's highest-scoring total as a member of the Heat. ... Whiteside has led the Heat in rebounds in all 21 games this season. ... Miami struggled again from the line, shooting 16 for 27. ON PHIL Spoelstra was asked to respond to Knicks President Phil Jackson's comments last month about the way the Heat had to handle LeBron James when he played in Miami. Spoelstra laughed it off. ""I honestly just think he gets bored and likes to throw stuff out there to get everybody all fired up,"" Spoelstra said. James and the Cavaliers visit Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. TALL ORDER Hilarity briefly ensued in the second quarter when the 7-foot-3 Porzingis had a jump ball against Miami's Tyler Johnson, who might be generously listed at 6-foot-4. Shocking: Porzingis won the tap.","400899758"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  In the long run, Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson are going to be the most important players on the Detroit roster. Tuesday, though, they were spectators. Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy went with his bench in the fourth quarter against the Bulls, and they outscored Chicago 31-19 to pull out a 102-91 victory. ""It's tough for guys like Andre and Reggie to have to watch a close game down the stretch, because they want to be out there,"" Van Gundy said. ""Marcus (Morris), too, but the bench guys were doing such a good job that I couldn't take them off the floor."" Tobias Harris, who led Detroit with 22 points, was the only Pistons starter to get his usual playing time in the final 12 minutes. He was joined by Ish Smith, Darrun Hilliard, Aron Baynes and Jon Leuer. ""Tobias was scoring and Ish got us 10 assists, but it was mostly great defense,"" Van Gundy said. ""That group took the game away from the Bulls."" Drummond added 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Pistons, who won for the fourth time in five games. Jimmy Butler scored 32 points and Dwyane Wade added 19 points and seven assists for Chicago, which lost its third straight. The Bulls were playing their fourth game in five nights and struggled in the fourth quarter. ""We battled back from a 17-point deficit and took the lead into the fourth,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""That just takes so much energy out of you. We have to stop digging holes for ourselves."" Drummond dominated early, scoring 10 points on three dunks and two tips. Even when he went to the bench with foul trouble, the Pistons put together an 11-0 run to lead 36-21 early in the second quarter. Rajon Rondo had 10 points in his return to the Chicago lineup. Detroit maintained a double-digit lead for most of the second period, but Chicago rallied after Jackson picked up his third foul. The Pistons were ahead 51-44 at the half, thanks to a 16-6 edge on points off turnovers. Drummond had 14 in the half, while Butler had 16 for the Bulls. Chicago was within 51-50 in the first two minutes of the third, and took a 72-71 lead into the fourth. Butler and Taj Gibson both had eight points in the period, while Drummond didn't score for Detroit. Hillard's 3-pointer capped Detroit's 12-3 run to start the fourth, giving the Pistons an 83-75 lead with 7:28 to play. ""We had things rolling and Coach let us keep going,"" Leuer said. ""You appreciate that as a player, if you get it going and you are allowed to ride it out."" The Pistons pulled away down the stretch against the weary Bulls. ""We've just got to win a couple games,"" Butler said. ""When we do that, everything will be fine and dandy again."" TIP-INS Bulls: Rondo missed Monday's loss to Portland due to a team suspension. Pistons: Due to his foul problems, Jackson only played 10 minutes in the first half. He's still on limited minutes after missing the season's first 21 games with knee tendinitis, and played eight minutes in the second half. Ish Smith played the entire fourth quarter. ROTATION PROBLEMS Leuer, normally Detroit's sixth man, only played seven minutes in the first half, and Van Gundy blamed himself. ""I was trying to keep Tobias away from Jimmy Butler and screwed up my rotation. As it turned out, it didn't matter who guarded Jimmy, but we should never have a half where Jon only plays seven minutes.""","400899759"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies are showing a knack for pulling out close games. The Philadelphia 76ers were just too young and too short-handed to stop that trend. Marc Gasol had 26 points and 12 rebounds, and Memphis finally put away the 76ers 96-91 on Tuesday night. The victory was the Grizzlies' 11th straight that either went to OT or was decided by five points or fewer. Grizzlies coach David Fizdale said he hasn't determined the formula that allows the Grizzlies to escape in close encounters. ""All I know is that group in (the locker room) really believes in each other, and when it gets tough, they dig in,"" Fizdale said. ""They know how to rise to the occasion when it calls for it."" To keep the streak going, Memphis scored the game's final seven points, erasing Philadelphia's lead with less than 2 minutes remaining, sending the Sixers to their eighth straight loss. ""We are all professionals, and we can't make excuses,"" said Philly forward Ersan Ilyasova, who led the Sixers with season bests of 23 points and 17 rebounds. ""We have no margin for error."" Injuries and rest left the 76ers with only nine players dressed. But Philadelphia was scrappy enough to stay close until the closing minutes. When Dario Saric, who had 17 points, scored inside, the Sixers led 91-89 with 1:57 remaining. But Zach Randolph, who had 12 points and 14 rebounds, scored inside and Memphis made enough free throws in the closing minutes. JaMychal Green finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds, including a pair of free throws with 4 seconds left to seal the Grizzlies' fourth straight win and 10th in the last 13. Philadelphia committed 16 turnovers and was 13 of 26 from the foul line, contributing to the downfall. ""We came down with nine guys, and you are playing against a veteran, tough, playoff, hard Memphis team,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""We had a chance to win the game, and I was proud of their effort."" TIP-INS Sixers: Earlier Tuesday, Philadelphia announced the hiring of recently retired forward Elton Brand as player development consultant. ... Philadelphia has dropped nine straight in the series, including a 104-99 double-overtime loss on Nov. 23. ... The Sixers, who lead the league in turnovers at 17.4 a game, committed 11 in the first half. Grizzlies: Randolph played in his 1,000th career game -- 494 with the Grizzlies. ... Rookie Wade Baldwin recorded his first double-digit scoring game with 11 points. ... Memphis is 6-0 on the second night of back-to-backs. RANDOLPH RETURNS Randolph returned to the team after missing seven games following the death of his mother, Mae, on Thanksgiving Day. He received a standing ovation from the crowd when he entered the game in the first quarter. ""It felt great to be back,"" the veteran forward said. ""With my brothers out here and to compete. . Getting back into the mix and doing what I love."" SHORT-HANDED SQUADS Sixers: Were without Jerryd Bayless (left wrist soreness); Robert Covington (left knee sprain); Joel Embiid (Rest), Nerlens Noel (inflamed left knee); Jahlil Okafor (gastroenteritis), Ben Simmons (acute fracture, right foot). For the Grizzlies: G Mike Conley (back injury), G Vince Carter (right hip injury), F Chandler Parsons (left knee soreness), F Brandan Wright (left ankle) and F James Ennis (right calf injury) all were out. FUMBLED AWAY Turnover problems plagued the Sixers down the stretch, allowing Memphis to pull away. After Memphis tied the game at 91, Philadelphia committed turnovers on consecutive possessions. On the next possession, the Sixers had four misses, including three tip attempts, and didn't score the rest of the way.","400899760"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Kawhi Leonard is getting used to his role as the San Antonio Spurs' go-to guy. The Minnesota Timberwolves found out on Tuesday night just how unstoppable Leonard can be when he puts his foot on the gas. Leonard scored 31 points and the Spurs improved to 13-0 on the road this season with a 105-91 victory. Leonard hit 11 of 15 shots after not scoring at all in the first quarter and Patty Mills scored 15 points off the bench for the Spurs (18-4), who played without Tony Parker after he bruised his left knee against Milwaukee on Wednesday night. San Antonio overcame a slow start to shoot 52.7 percent. ""Now I have game experience under my belt,"" Leonard said. ""That's what you need to get better, get comfortable -- see the ball go through the net in the game."" The Spurs moved past the 1969-70 New York Knicks to take sole possession of the second-best road start to begin a season in NBA history. The Golden State Warriors started 14-0 last year. ""Maybe there's just a little extra focus when we go into someone else's arena,"" Mills said. ""It's hard to put your finger on it."" Zach LaVine scored 25 points for the Timberwolves. Karl-Anthony Towns had 11 points and 14 rebounds, but shot just 3 of 16. ""You have to eliminate all the ways in which you beat yourself first,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""So we have to understand that, we have to improve in that area."" With seven new faces on the roster and Tim Duncan no longer there, it's been an adjustment for the Spurs this season. They haven't been their usual precise selves, but here they are with the second-best record in the league, tied in the win column with the Warriors (18-3). The Timberwolves erased a seven-point deficit with less than a minute to play to beat Charlotte on Saturday night, but Leonard buried a pair of 3-pointers to end the threat Tuesday. TIP-INS Spurs: Manu Ginobili got the night off. ... LaMarcus Aldridge had just six points on 3-for-8 shooting and did not score until early in the third quarter. ... San Antonio shot just 29 percent and scored a season-low 19 points in the first quarter. Timberwolves: Andrew Wiggins was quiet for the Wolves as well. He scored 11 points on 5-for-12 shooting. ... Thibodeau received a technical foul for arguing with officials in the second quarter. ... PG Kris Dunn played well with 15 points on 6-for-7 shooting. LINE CHANGE The Spurs starters got off to a terrible start after a narrow victory over the Bucks the previous night, so coach Gregg Popovich pulled all five starters with 7:30 to play in the first quarter and a 12-3 deficit. The bench unit of Mills, Kyle Anderson, Dewayne Dedmon, David Lee and Jonathon Simmons energized the team with a 14-3 run to get them back in the game. ""They're all together,"" Wiggins said. ""If one person moves, the other person moves with them. It's like they're all tied together."" PARKER'S ABSENCE Parker was injured when he knocked knees with a Bucks defender in the third quarter. The Spurs said he was listed as day to day, but Popovich said after the game he was ""probably 50-50"" to play Thursday against Chicago. Rather than the elevate veteran Mills to the starting lineup, Popovich wanted to keep the second unit intact and so he gave Nico Laprovittola, a rookie from Argentina, his third career start. Laprovittola scored 10 points in 22 minutes. ""We knew Tony was going to miss some games,"" Popovich said of the team's mindset going into the season. ""To have another person that has the courage and the experience to play that position is important.""","400899761"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  What started as an easy night on the court turned into another tough fourth quarter for the Utah Jazz, who blew a 19-point lead and were outscored in the period for the third straight game. Gordon Hayward scored 28 points and the Jazz held on for a 112-105 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night, their seventh win in eight games. ""It's human nature,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""When you have some separation, sometimes it's easier to let down. It's something that really good teams figure out a way to overcome. I don't think we're there, but we did find a way tonight."" Rudy Gobert scored a career-high 22 points and had 11 rebounds and blocked four shots for the Jazz, who recovered after the Suns erased a 23-point lead to tie it at 103. ""I've been working hard since I got here,"" Gobert said. ""I always want to improve, that's the main thing for me. That's what I'm going to keep doing."" Hayward had 11 third-quarter points to reach 20-plus points for the ninth consecutive game -- the first Jazz player to do so since Carlos Boozer in 2007-08. The Jazz sprinted out to a 25-10 lead thanks to an 8-0 run and never trailed. They led 65-45 at halftime after Hayward's pull-up 3-pointer highlighted a half-closing 11-2 stretch. The 65 points matched a Jazz season high for a half. Devin Booker scored 21 points for the Suns, who couldn't complete the comeback. ""That (second) unit came in and played selfless,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""They gave up all their energy on defense and offensively they moved the ball, created the tempo and played amazing perimeter defense."" TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix turned over the ball 13 times in the first half and Utah converted them into 19 points. ... The Suns made six 3-pointers after hitting 10 in the previous three games. Jazz: George Hill missed his fourth consecutive game with a sprained left big toe. ... Hill and Hayward have played just five games together and the Jazz are 5-0 in those games. ... Rodney Hood did not return after halftime with a sore right hamstring. BACK ON THE BENCH Snyder was the latest member of the Jazz to be forced from a game due to a physical ailment. He missed Monday's game against the Lakers due to an illness, but returned Tuesday. Snyder said it's the first time he's ever missed a game as an assistant or head coach in 20 years. ""It was strange,"" Snyder said. ""I had a small fever and then about midway through the fourth quarter, my fever jumped to over 103. So it was good I wasn't out there. It would have been unfair to the players and the staff."" HEY HEY, HAYWARD Hayward is averaging career highs in points and rebounds and is playing at an All-Star level. Watson played three seasons in Utah, Hayward's first three seasons. ""He reminded me of a young Jerry West,"" Watson said. ""Gordon has it, man. ... I knew it, I could see it immediately. There was something special about him. The unique part about him is he can impact the game beyond scoring. ""I remember Gordon just had this unique way about him. It was his rookie year. We played the Lakers. ... Gordon Hayward ran a pick-and-roll going to his left, Kobe was chasing him. Gordon jumped, lost the ball in the air, jumped off the right leg, got the ball and dunked it. I was like, `Oh (shoot) this kid is special."" QUOTABLE ""We got to understand that the game is not over until it is finished and we believe that,"" Suns guard Leandro Barbosa said.","400899762"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  On a rough shooting night for just about everyone, Kemba Walker got hot just long enough for the Charlotte Hornets. Walker scored 14 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, Nic Batum posted his third straight double-double and the Hornets beat the Detroit Pistons 87-77 on Wednesday despite shooting just 34 percent from the field. ""The shots just weren't falling (for) both teams,"" Walker said. ""Both teams played hard. Defensively I thought both teams were great, but down the stretch we were able to make some big plays and get a huge burst in the fourth quarter."" Batum had 14 points and 14 rebounds for the Hornets, who won for the third time in four games despite being held to 38 points in the first half on 27 percent shooting. Charlotte also got three key baskets in the fourth from reserve Marco Belinelli, who finished with 13 points. ""Marco was instrumental in getting our offense going in the third with a couple of catch-and-shoot buckets,"" coach Steve Clifford said. Andre Drummond had a season-high 26 points and 20 rebounds for the Pistons (12-12), who were coming off a 102-91 victory over the Bulls on Tuesday night. It was his 11th 20-20 game since 2012-13, tops in the NBA during that stretch. Detroit shot 38 percent from the field. It also went 5 for 8 from the free-throw line, compared to 21 for 29 for Charlotte. ""You can't have a 20 free throw differential and expect to win no matter how hard you're fighting,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. Marvin Williams returned to Charlotte's starting lineup after missing the last six games with a hyperextended knee and finished with 12 points and five rebounds. He also provided a needed physicality on defense. Williams said afterward he felt great. ""I was a little worried about my conditioning,"" Williams said. ""Sometimes, with lower-body injuries, you can't stay in shape like you want to. I just wanted to come out and be aggressive, not offensively but defensively."" The Hornets (13-9) pulled away when Walker began to heat up in the fourth quarter, finding lanes to drive to the basket and rediscovering the touch on his jumper that had eluded him for most of the night. Walker was 5 of 9 from the field in the fourth after going 4 of 13 in the first three quarters. The Hornets trailed 39-38 at halftime. It was only the fourth time this NBA season both teams scored fewer than 40 in the first half. TIP-INS Pistons: Made just 4 of 27 3-point shots. ... Had 13 turnovers. Hornets: Walker has scored in double digits in all 22 games this season. ... Walker has multiple steals in 11 games this season. DRUMMOND's BIG NIGHT Drummond went 11 for 14 from the field and 4 for 7 from the line. He was looking for a measure of revenge against the Hornets after being ejected in the second quarter against Charlotte last week for a flagrant-2 foul when officials ruled he deliberately elbowed Roy Hibbert in the head. JACKSON'S LEGS Pistons guard Reggie Jackson couldn't quite get to the basket on the second night of a back-to-back and settled for more jump shots than normal. He has been battling back from tendinitis in his left knee. ""I find myself not being as fresh as I normally feel,"" Jackson said. ""I'm sure I will get back to who I am and doing the things that I do.""","400899763"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Avery Bradley and the Boston Celtics made up for Isaiah Thomas' absence by spreading the ball around. Bradley scored 23 points, Jae Crowder had 15 points and 10 rebounds and the Celtics routed the Orlando Magic 117-87 on Wednesday night. Boston shot 51.2 percent from the field and had seven players score in double figures, bouncing back nicely from a disappointing 107-106 loss at Houston on Monday night. Terry Rozier scored a career-high 16 points, and Amir Johnson, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart finished with 13 apiece. It was an impressive offensive performance while playing without Thomas, who was held out after he suffered a groin injury against the Rockets. Boston (13-9) trailed by one at the break, but grabbed control with a big third quarter and pulled away in the final period. ""Whenever we have somebody down we come together and try to figure out a game plan,"" Bradley said. ""And our game plan was to get it done on the defensive end and make sure we are moving the ball on the offensive end."" Orlando shot 37 percent from the field. D.J. Augustin scored 15 points -- all the first half -- and Evan Fournier had 14. The Magic were coming off a 4-1 road trip, including a 124-116 victory against Washington on Tuesday night. ""We've just got to play better,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""The second game of back to back can't be an excuse. Every other team plays in these situations. If we're going to be a playoff team, we've got to win these games."" The Magic (10-13) came out cold in the third quarter and the Celtics took advantage. Bradley made a 3-pointer and Crowder connected on a jumper to help Boston open a 67-54 lead with 6:22 left. The Celtics outscored the Magic 58-26 in points in the paint. ""Like I've said before, we're always trying to attack the paint first,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""One of the things we want to do, especially in Isaiah's absence is play through our bigs and through the post."" TIP-INS Celtics: Smart replaced Thomas in the starting lineup. ... Bradley had three of Boston's seven 3-pointers. The Celtics went 7 for 27 from long range. ... Boston enjoyed a 49-37 rebounding advantage. Magic: Since returning to the bench, Jeff Green's production has improved immensely. The veteran small forward averaged 14 points in the team's recent road trip. ... The Magic had just one blocked shot, highly unusual for a team with Serge Ibaka and Bismack Biyombo. GRUELING STRETCH The Magic struggled with the back-to-back games, and they have another set this weekend when they visit Charlotte on Friday night and then host Denver on Saturday night. ""It's going to be a challenge,"" Fournier said. ""The last 10 days have been a challenge physically, but that's the NBA.""","400899764"
"NEW YORK --  The Brooklyn Nets almost picked up another heartbreaking loss Wednesday night. Then Sean Kilpatrick and Bojan Bogdanovic stepped up in the final seconds. Kilpatrick and Bogdanovic each made two big free throws to help Brooklyn hold off the Denver Nuggets for a 116-111 victory. ""It's a confidence boost for me when I know my teammates are counting on me with the ball in my hands towards the end,"" Kilpatrick said. ""I'm trying to make sure I make the right plays, especially down the stretch."" Brooklyn led by as many as 29 points midway through the third quarter, but Denver closed to 103-99 on Kenneth Faried's layup with 4:31 left. ""Look at the positive, I think we took a punch, two punches, maybe five punches and we got off the floor and finished it out,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Trevor Booker went 1 for 2 at the line with 13 seconds remaining for a 112-109 Nets lead. Jameer Nelson then threw away the inbounds pass after a Denver timeout, and Bogdanovic made two free throws with 12.7 seconds left. After Wilson Chandler hit a driving layup for Denver, Kilpatrick made two foul shots to help secure the win for the Nets. ""I tried to take advantage every time I saw a crease in the defense,"" said Kilpatrick, who finished with 22 points. Brooklyn had dropped three in a row and 10 of 11. Brook Lopez scored 24 points, Bogdanovich finished with 19 on 8-for-11 shooting, and Booker had 15 points and 12 rebounds. Chandler led the Nuggets with 27 points and 15 rebounds. Will Barton had 15 points, and Nelson and Nikola Jokic each scored 14. ""It's hard to look back at this game because when you play like that and come back, you just think about all the mistakes you made and the stuff you did to get down at that point,"" Chandler said. TIP-INS Nuggets: Jokic also had 11 rebounds. ... Denver was trying to win consecutive games for only the second time this season. The Nuggets beat the 76ers in Philadelphia on Monday. Nets: Isaiah Whitehead scored a career-high 14 points. ... The Nets have won six straight games against the Nuggets for their longest current streak against any opponent. ON THE OTHER SIDE Kilpatrick played eight games during two 10-day contracts with the Nuggets last year. ""I'm a huge fan,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Sean has proven to me time and time again that he will take any opportunity given to him."" BOOKER'S SHOW Booker posted his ninth double-double of the season. His previous career high was five, which he accomplished with the Washington Wizards in 2010-11 and 2013-14. LeVERT DEBUTS Caris LeVert, the Nets' first-round pick in this year's draft, made his season debut. He was 0 for 3 from the field, but finished with four rebounds and three steals in nine minutes. He had not played due to a left foot injury suffered in his senior season at Michigan. ""It's been so long since I played in an actual game,"" LeVert said. ""It was a blessing to get back out there.""","400899765"
"ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Hawks needed 14 days to win a game. Dwight Howard hopes to never go through a stretch like that again. ""All we've been thinking about since the last game was how we can come in and get this game,"" he said. ""I thought our effort and our energy were in the right place, and we got a win."" Howard had 23 points and 17 rebounds, Paul Millsap added 21 points and the Hawks snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 103-95 victory over the Miami Heat on Wednesday night. Dennis Schroder had 17 points for the Hawks. They are 2-10 since starting the season 9-2. Tyler Johnson scored a career-high 27 points and Goran Dragic added 21 for the Heat. Miami, which used just eight players because of injuries, has lost three straight. It wasn't an easy night for Atlanta's offense as the Hawks settled too often for jumpers and struggled to make crisp, timely passes. Coach Mike Budenholzer was clearly frustrated and called a timeout with a 10-point lead late in the third. The next three possessions resulted in a backcourt violation and an airball 3 by Malcolm Delaney and Howard's offensive foul, but Atlanta led by 15 to begin the fourth. The Heat pulled within three on two free throws by Dragic with 7:05 remaining before Thabo Sefolosha's putback dunk two possessions later gave the Hawks some momentum, but not enough to put the game away. Miami made it a six-point game with 2:40 remaining when Sefolosha's fast-break dunk put the Hawks up 10 at the 1:53 mark. ""I think at the root of this has been our practice schedule,"" Atlanta guard Kyle Korver said. ""We had a great training camp, a great preseason and we came out of the gates 9-2. But the way our schedule was, we had so many back-to-backs and literally didn't have a practice for three weeks. Practice matters. We're glad we're done with that part of the schedule."" Howard's dunk midway through the second put the Hawks up 15, but the Heat trimmed the lead to seven at halftime. Miami couldn't handle the inside matchups against Howard and Millsap and was outscored 58-26 in the paint. ""We're working with what we have right now,"" Heat center Hassan Whiteside said. ""Guys are giving their all right now. I'm proud of our guys. They're doing their best."" BE REASONABLE Miami coach Erik Spoelstra wasn't pleased when referee CJ Washington called Johnson for a foul against the 6-foot-11 Howard in the first quarter. Spoelstra couldn't believe Johnson, who's 7 inches shorter, affected the shot. ""He can't even jump that high!"" Spoelstra said. Washington smiled, but Spoelstra held firm. ""I'm dead serious!"" TIP-INS Heat: Johnson scored 14 points in the first half. ... Dragic played 34 minutes despite having a stinger in his shoulder from Tuesday's home loss to New York. ... Whiteside had 12 rebounds and has led the team on the boards in all 22 games. ... Wayne Ellington scored 19 points. ... Josh McRoberts had two points, two rebounds and five turnovers in 30 minutes. Hawks: G Kent Bazemore was sidelined with a sore right knee. He's expected to miss at least one more game. An MRI Wednesday morning showed no structural damage. ... Tim Hardaway Jr., who replaced Bazemore in the starting lineup, limped off the floor and into the locker room with a leg injury late in the fourth. ... Howard and Millsap combined for 26 of Atlanta's 53 points and for 12 of its 25 rebounds in the first half.","400899766"
"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo is emerging as a dynamic player and precocious leader -- and at 22 years old, he's already closing in on one of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's franchise records. Antetokounmpo got his second triple-double of the season to lead the Milwaukee Bucks over the Portland Trail Blazers 115-107 on Wednesday night. Antetokounmpo had 15 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists for his seventh career triple-double -- second-most with the franchise behind Abdul-Jabbar's eight. Antetokounmpo is the only NBA player averaging at least 20 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two blocks and two steals this season. ""Maybe it wasn't a fluid game for Giannis, but this is what he does,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""He fills up the stat sheet. ... He is a winner and he helped his team find a way to win tonight by getting other guys involved. That is the maturity of a 22-year-old, that you can see a leader is growing right in front of us."" Jabari Parker added 27 points for Milwaukee, which rebounded from a one-point home loss to San Antonio on Monday to win for the fifth time in six games. ""The team is rolling right now, feeling good,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Jabari is a beast right now."" The Bucks entered holding opponents to a NBA-best .311 shooting percentage from 3-point range, but Portland drilled 17 of them on 40 attempts -- both season highs. Damian Lillard made five and scored a team-high 30 points to go with seven rebounds and six assists. C.J. McCollum added 23 points, including four 3-pointers, as the Blazers continued a nine-game stretch of playing eight times on the road. ""That's one of the things we do,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""We shoot a lot of 3s when we move the ball."" Milwaukee led 101-90 with 5:27 left after two free throws from Antetokounmpo, but then Portland hit three straight 3s in 56 seconds to trim the deficit to two. The Bucks responded with the next three baskets to take a 107-99 lead after a jumper from Parker with 2:03 to go. Another 3 from Allen Crabbe trimmed the margin to 109-105 with 56 seconds remaining, but that is as close as Portland got. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: The team's 12 3-pointers in the first half tied the franchise high. The last time it had that many was 2002. ... Mason Plumlee became the fastest Portland player to tally 150 rebounds and 100 assists (23 games) since Scottie Pippen in 1999-2000 (22 games). Bucks: Jason Terry played his 1,300th career game. ... Antetokounmpo was called for a 10-second violation when attempting a free-throw in the third quarter. ... Miles Plumlee, the older brother of Mason, sat out for the third straight contest. ONE WAY TO LOSE Portland had eight of its 15 turnovers in the final quarter, including three in a stretch of 1:13 midway through the frame. ""I don't know if I'd say it was sloppy,"" Stotts said. ""Not all turnovers are sloppy. (Crabbe) stepped out of bounds -- that's a turnover. We had a 24-second shot clock (violation) -- that's a turnover. But I was probably more concerned with some of our shots."" QUOTE OF THE NIGHT Kidd, when asked about Lillard's play: ""He is one of the top guards in the world,"" he said. ""His range is once he gets past half court."" MONROE SCORING AGAIN Greg Monroe had 15 points -- one shy of his season high. Since a two-point game at Brooklyn on Thursday night, he is averaging 12.3 points per game in three outings.","400899767"
"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets were determined to make up for losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in their season opener. It was clear from the beginning Wednesday night that things would be different this time around. Eric Gordon made a career-high eight 3-pointers and scored 26 points to help the Rockets cruise to a 134-95 victory. James Harden added 25 points in three quarters. The Rockets scored a season high and extended their winning streak to a season-best four games. ""They have a lot of good road wins and for us that first game we played this season we lost so we wanted a get-back game,"" Harden said. The Rockets were up by 12 in the third quarter, then had a  22-6 run to make it 96-68 and put the game out of reach with about 3 minutes left in the quarter. Houston made four 3-pointers and got a nifty one-handed dunk from Clint Capela in that run to pad the lead. Gordon already had four 3-pointers 7 minutes into the first quarter after making each of his first four attempts. It was his seventh straight game with at least four 3-pointers, which is a franchise record. ""I'm just settling in on my role and my role is definitely to bring a different energy and scoring, playmaking with the second unit,"" he said. ""I'm settling in and it's getting better and better. Teammates look for me and it's just up to me to knock down shots."" Houston has its longest winning streak since taking five straight in January. Lou Williams led the Lakers with 24 points. They have lost four in a row, their longest skid of the season. ""We just didn't play well,"" he said. ""It was just one of those nights where we didn't respond to anything that was going on."" The Rockets led by 18 after a layup by Gordon to start the second quarter. It was the only shot he made that wasn't a 3-pointer. The Lakers got going after that, using a 17-6 run to cut the lead to 51-44 about five minutes before halftime. Brandon Ingram made two 3-pointers in that stretch and Jordan Clarkson capped the run with a 3. Houston got back on track after that and had pushed the lead to 67-52 with 1.4 second left in the half. Lou Williams cut the deficit after that when he hit a 3-pointer from beyond half court at the buzzer. TIP-INS Lakers: Coach Luke Walton said D'Angelo Russell (sore left knee) is getting better but he isn't sure when he'll return. ... Williams scored more than 20 points for the ninth time this season. ... Julius Randle added 21 points and 10 rebounds. Rockets: Scored a season-high 43 points in the first quarter. ... Made 15 3-pointers to extend their NBA record of games with at least 10 3s to 21. ... Gordon has scored at least 20 points in four of the last six games. ... The Rockets had 67 points at halftime and have scored at least 60 points in the first half in five of their last seven games. ... Harden had eight assists, six rebounds and four steals. SO CLOSE Houston's Patrick Beverley came three rebounds shy of his first career triple-double, finishing with 10 points, seven rebounds and tying a career high with 12 assists. Coach Mike D'Antoni said he kept him in a little longer than the other starters to give him a shot to get it. Harden joked about the 6-foot-1 Beverley's inability to get those last rebounds. ""I wanted him to get a triple-double so bad,"" Harden said. ""Every rebound he tried to get he couldn't get it because he's so small."" NO EXCUSES Walton wouldn't make excuses for this lopsided loss despite the Lakers playing without Russell and Nick Young, who is also out with an injury. ""Obviously, we are missing key players and we are going to lose games, but if we're just sitting around as a team saying we're waiting for this guy or that, that's not the mindset you want ... that's not an acceptable excuse,"" he said.","400899768"
"NEW YORK --  LeBron James had little to say about his choice of hotels and even less about Phil Jackson's choice of words. James and his teammates made their statement loudly on the court. James scored 25 points, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love also surpassed 20, and the Cleveland Cavaliers crushed the New York Knicks 126-94 on Wednesday night. It was the first meeting since James was angered when Jackson referred to his friends and business partners as a ""posse"" last month in an ESPN interview. James refused to answer questions about the Knicks president, who watched the game from his usual seat a few rows back of center court. ""I'm motivated for the love of the game, I'm motivated by the process, I'm motivated knowing that my kids are watching me tonight on national television,"" James said. ""So I don't need much more."" The Cavs, who didn't stay together in New York after James and some other players opted against staying in the team's Donald Trump-branded hotel, won their second straight after a three-game skid. Irving led Cleveland with 28 points and Love scored 21, 16 in the first quarter, in Cleveland's eighth straight victory over New York. ""We're going to go through skids, we're not the perfect team,"" Irving said. ""But we also know what we have as a team when we collectively come together and it's a beautiful thing."" Brandon Jennings scored 16 points for the Knicks, who had their four-game winning streak snapped and lost for the just the third time in 10 games. He started for Derrick Rose, who missed his first game of the season with lower back pain. The Cavs made 22 3-pointers in 40 attempts. ""They played unbelievable and made all those shots,"" Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis said. ""It's really hard to stop a team like that."" James and Love outscored Porzingis and Carmelo Anthony 46-20. Tristan Thompson grabbed 20 rebounds for the Cavs. They played without guard J.R. Smith, who returned to Cleveland for additional testing after hyperextending his left knee Monday in Toronto. Love and Irving made consecutive 3-pointers to kick off a 20-4 spurt that extended a one-point lead to 34-17 and the Knicks never really recovered. They trimmed it to nine late in the first half, but James had a ferocious dunk during the Cavs' run of six straight points, and another burst to open the second half pushed it to 71-48 on Irving's 3-pointer. TIP-INS Cavaliers: It was a rough first quarter for former Knicks guard Iman Shumpert, who missed a layup and a breakaway dunk, when he appeared to hurt his hand after hitting it on the rim. ... Irving came in averaging 28.4 points in five games at MSG, his highest in any arena. Knicks: Anthony was presented with his USA Basketball Olympic championship ring before the game. He shared USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year award earlier Wednesday with Kevin Durant after winning his record third gold medal in Rio. ... Former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, working the game for ESPN, got a big ovation when shown on the overhead video screen. LEBRON'S LODGING James said the decision not to stay at the Trump SoHo was a personal preference and not a political statement. He said it was the first time he hadn't stayed in the team hotel -- some other players also changed hotels -- though he did ride the team bus as usual to the morning workout. BAD BACK Rose left the Knicks' victory over Miami on Tuesday in the third quarter and was still feeling pain when he arrived Wednesday to meet with team doctors, who sent him for an MRI exam to make sure there was nothing structurally wrong.","400899769"
"DALLAS --  DeMarcus Cousins and the Sacramento Kings started and ended with victories on a six-game trip that got a little weird in the middle. Now they're headed home, but the road-heavy schedule isn't quite finished. Cousins had 24 points and 14 rebounds, and the Kings snapped a three-game losing streak with a 120-89 victory over the last-place Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night. Rudy Gay scored 19 as the Kings wrapped up a trip that started with a win at Brooklyn before an overtime loss at Washington on a back-to-back and a postponement in Philadelphia over poor floor conditions. It was the second road trip of at least five games for the Kings, who play 21 of the first 35 games away from their new Golden 1 Center. ""Nobody wants to fly that long with a loss under their belt,"" said Cousins, who had his 11th double-double and tied his season high with seven assists. ""A good way to go home, good way to end this trip. Hopefully we can gain some momentum from this and start a little streak."" Deron Williams had 20 points for the injury-plagued Mavericks, who dropped to 4-17 in what is shaping up as their worst season in more than 20 years. Four rotation players were out, most notably Dirk Nowitzki (strained right Achilles tendon). The Kings led by four when they started the second half with an 11-0 run. They led by as many as 23 points in the third quarter before the lead ballooned to 33 late in the fourth. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle didn't take questions after a roughly 30-second statement following the game, and reporters were later asked to leave the locker room for a team meeting. ""That was a very, very, very disappointing performance,"" Carlisle said. ""The second half was inexcusable. The way we played -- just the way we performed all around -- everything from how we competed, decision-making. Shot-making comes and goes, but the competitive spirit has got to be there."" TIP-INS Kings: Kosta Koufos had six of his eight points during the 11-0 run to start the second half. ... Garrett Temple made all four of his 3-point attempts and finished with 17 points. One of the 3s came after Dallas had pulled within 14 midway through the fourth. ... Former Dallas point guard Darren Collison scored 19 points. Mavericks: At halftime, Harrison Barnes received his ring as a member of the gold medal U.S. men's team at the Rio Olympics last summer. ... Dallas got two technicals in the fourth quarter for Carlisle calling a timeout when the Mavericks didn't have any. It's the second time this season that has happened. TURNABOUT The Kings have won two in a row in Dallas following a 22-game streak by the Mavericks that was the longest at home against any opponent in franchise history. The previous streak ran from 2003 to 2016. WALKING WOUNDED Dallas center Andrew Bogut will be out 10 to 14 days with a right knee injury sustained in Monday's loss to Charlotte, while Nowitzki missed his sixth straight game and 16th overall. The other rotation players out are guards J.J. Barea (left calf injury) and Seth Curry (right knee sprain). Curry is the closest to returning. FIRST START Kings guard Ben McLemore scored nine points, hitting 1 of 6 from 3-point range, in his first start of the season after sitting for three straight games as a coach's decision. Arron Afflalo didn't play after starting 18 of the first 20. ""Ben has been doing his work and it is no detriment to Arron or the group or anything,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""It was just a great opportunity for him."" NUMBING NUMBERS Barnes, Dallas' leading scorer, had 11 points on just 5-of-16 shooting. Wesley Matthews scored 16 points, none in the second half.

"PHOENIX --  Paul George had some big numbers -- and shut down high-scoring Devin Booker. George had 25 points and 13 rebounds and the Indiana Pacers pulled away in the fourth quarter to beat the struggling Phoenix Suns 109-94 on Wednesday night. George defended Booker and helped hold the second-year guard to 13 points on 4-of-13 shooting. Booker also committed four turnovers. ""He's young and really good and has got a lot to learn playing with the physicality,"" George said about Booker. ""Tried to get him out of his spots, tried to get him uncomfortable. That's what you have to do with guys that are so good with getting into a rhythm."" Myles Turner added 20 points, and Jeff Teague had 19 points and a season-high 11 assists. Indiana had a 9-0 run midway through the fourth quarter to open a 97-87 lead. ""We were able to get stops. We were able to get out in transition,"" George said. ""We did a great job of just getting good looks. Not any shot we took was bad, I thought."" Eric Bledsoe led Phoenix with 15 points, and Tyson Chandler had 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Suns shot 40 percent from the field and made only 9 of 33 3-pointers. They have lost five of six. Indiana has won four of six. The Pacers haven't won or lost more than two games in a row this season. ""We have a young group,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""We have to set the tone and identity on how we want to play. From now on, moving forward, defensively aggressive is how we have to play."" Rodney Stuckey's 12-foot turnaround with 17 seconds left in the third quarter gave Indiana its largest lead of the game to that point, five, at 82-77. But Jared Dudley hit a 3 at the quarter buzzer on the next possession to make at 82-80 to start the fourth. The Pacers led 23-22 at the end of the first quarter, which saw four lead changes, five ties and neither team leading by more than four points.

"LOS ANGELES --  Golden State lacked its usual outside shooting touch. The Warriors still had an easy time with the Clippers. Klay Thompson scored 24 points, Draymond Green added 22 points and the Warriors won 115-98 Wednesday night for their seventh straight victory over Los Angeles. Stephen Curry had 19 points for Golden State, and Kevin Durant, who came in averaging a team-best 27.0 points, was held to 16 on 5-of-17 shooting. Curry failed to make a 3-pointer for just the second time this season, going 0 of 8. The Warriors were 7 of 30 from long range. ""You try to affect the games other ways when your shot is not falling,"" Curry said. ""That's kind of the test. To stay locked in and not get frustrated because I know it won't happen that often. We'd like to make every shot every night and have that free-flowing offensive rhythm. But for us, if we can defend and not turn the ball over, we're going to be in good shape most nights. Tonight was a testament to that."" Jamal Crawford scored 21 points for the Clippers, who have lost five of seven. Four of their seven overall losses have come at home. ""Our spirit wasn't right,"" said Chris Paul, who shot 7 of 14. ""We gave them a lot of baskets. A team that shoots as well as they do, we can't give them points."" Blake Griffin struggled, scoring 12 points on 5-of-20 shooting and while committing seven of the Clippers' 14 turnovers. J.J. Redick had two points, well under his 15.5 average. ""I turned the ball over, I missed some easy shots, forced some bad shots,"" Griffin said. ""We got some work to do, obviously."" The Warriors set a dominant tone in the first quarter when they shot 56 percent. They erased the Clippers' one-point lead with a 28-9 run to lead 37-19. Golden State's defense smothered the Clippers' shooters, who were held to 33 percent in the first, and forced coach Doc Rivers to bring in his second unit. The reserves couldn't get anything going while Thompson, Curry and Green combined to score 15 consecutive points as part of Golden State's big run. ""Great night defensively,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""If we defend like that and take care of the ball, even on a night when shots aren't going in, we have a chance to win anywhere, even on the road against a great team."" Trailing by 20 early in the second quarter, the Clippers clawed back within seven on three 3-pointers by Crawford, including a rainbow that just beat the shot clock. Paul added seven points and DeAndre Jordan dunked to get to 53-46. But just as quickly, the Warriors restored their lead to 62-49 at halftime, capped by Green's 3-pointer. Even a 12-0 run by the Clippers only cut their deficit to 14 points late in the third after they fell behind by 27 earlier in the quarter. On the Warriors' last possession, Curry and two teammates fell down but Kevon Looney still dunked to send them into the fourth leading 91-75. TIP-INS Warriors: Thompson was coming off his career-high 60-point performance against Indiana on Monday. He was 8 of 18 from the floor against the Clippers. ... They have won seven straight on the road. ... They shot 48 percent from the floor, just under their league-leading 50 percent. Clippers: Their losing streak to the Warriors is the team's longest active skid against any opponent. ... Their last win against the Warriors came on Christmas Day 2014 at home. ... Doc Rivers, Griffin and Paul each got technical fouls. ... Jordan is two rebounds away from 6,000 in his career. ... G Raymond Felton missed the game for unspecified family reasons and is expected to be out a couple games. ... Jay Z, Chris Rock, Olympic champion gymnast Simone Biles and the Rev. Jesse Jackson attended the game. NEXT TIME The teams meet three more times in the regular season, once in January and twice in February. ""Don't get too cocky when we play them next time,"" Thompson said. ""They're very capable. It was just a great effort by us.""","400899772"
"TORONTO --  DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors pushed aside the Minnesota Timberwolves -- again. With Toronto down 95-94 with 8:46 left, DeRozan and Lowry keyed a 17-4 Raptors run that took the game away from the youthful Timberwolves. Toronto eventually pulled out a 124-110 victory, handing Minnesota its 13th straight loss at the Air Canada Centre. ""We just picked it up,"" DeRozan said. ""We kicked in our experience of understanding how we have to win games. We can't underestimate a team like that that plays extremely hard."" DeRozan had a team-high 27 points for the Raptors, Lowry added 25 points with 11 assists, and Jonas Valanciunas registered his team-leading sixth double-double on 20 points and 10 rebounds. ""We just have guys that are used to it, trying to come through at the end of games and sticking with the game plan and sticking with the course of action,"" Lowry said. After Toronto fell behind 11-2, coach Dwane Casey sat all his starters except for DeRozan in an attempt to get kick-start his team into action. Toronto still trailed by 10 at the end of the first quarter, but it sent a message. ""We can be a good team, but we can't be special if we allow things to happen that happened in the first two quarters,"" Casey said. His counterpart, Tom Thibodeau, shared that sentiment, especially after seeing his team enter the final 12 minutes with the lead, 89-88. However, the Timberwolves could only shoot 38.9 percent in the final quarter, allowing the Raptors to outscore them 36-21. ""I thought the first three quarters were very good, connected, making the right reads, right plays, ball movement and screening a lot of good things happened,"" Thibodeau said. ""Then in the fourth quarter we got away from that."" Zach LaVine led all Timberwolves scorers with 29 points, while Andrew Wiggins, playing in his homtown for the third time in the NBA, had 25. However, the loss didn't take off too much of the shine playing in front of family and friends for the Canadian, who is still waiting for his first taste of NBA victory on home soil. ""We need to get that first win here for it to be really good, but it's always good to play back home,"" he said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota fell to 2-14 when allowing 100 or more points. The Timberwolves have had double-digit first-half leads in 11 of their 22 games. The 37 points that Toronto scored in the second quarter were the most Minnesota has given up in a second quarter this season. Raptors: Wore their blue-and-white Toronto Huskies uniforms for the second time this season. Uniforms are replicas of those worn by the Huskies during the NBA's inaugural season in 1946-47. DeRozan played his 543rd game for the Raptors, breaking a tie with Morris Peterson for the most in team history. Toronto successfully converted 10-or-more 3-pointers for an eighth straight game, extending its franchise record. Raptors are 10-1 this season when Carroll scores 10 or more points. HE SAID IT ""All his shots are lucky. To me it's a bad shot."" -- DeRozan jokingly about Lowry, who with 5:41 to go in the third quarter drained a 31-foot jump shot, one of the five 3-pointers he had on the night. RING IT UP Before the opening tip-off, USA Basketball men's national team director Sean Ford presented DeRozan and Lowry with their Team USA Olympic championship rings. The pair helped the U.S. win its third straight gold medal in August.","400899773"
"WASHINGTON --  The scoreboard wasn't working at the outset, when there were thousands of empty seats and the fans that did show up were quiet as can be, so the arena announcer pierced the silence Thursday night, telling the small gathering by just how much the mediocre Washington Wizards were trailing the Denver Nuggets, basket after basket. ""It was kind of, like, a gloomy feel,"" Denver's Wilson Chandler said. Eventually, the overhead electronic display began functioning, and when Wizards guard Bradley Beal's airball led to a shot-clock violation with the hosts already down 12 and proud owners of seven turnovers and two made baskets, the till-then mum spectators mustered the energy to boo the home team. It was that kind of night for the Wizards until the second half, when it became that sort of night for the Nuggets. Washington erased a double-digit deficit and, thanks to Beal's 26 points and Denver's season-high 29 turnovers, beat the Nuggets 92-85. Washington is 8-13. The Nuggets lost for the fifth time in six games, dropping to 8-15. This was not a marquee matchup, by any definition, and the atmosphere was apt. The announced attendance was 12,645 -- about 7,000 shy of a sellout. At tipoff, fewer were there. The scoreboard was stuck at 0-0 for several minutes, which ""kind of bugged us,"" Beal said. The place had all the verve of a library. ""You always want that sixth man, that disadvantage to the other squad,"" Beal said. ""But at the same time, we're all grown men, we're all NBA players, this is our job, and at the end of the day, we have to go out there and play the game ... if there's one fan or 30,000."" John Wall scored only 15 points one game after a career-best 52, but nine came in the fourth quarter. With starting point guard Emmanuel Mudiay inactive because of a sprained right ankle, and leading rebounder Kenneth Faried on the bench throughout, the Nuggets went 5 1/2 minutes without a point in the fourth quarter. In that period, they had 10 turnovers and shot 1 for 14 on 3-pointers. Washington coach Scott Brooks keeps lamenting no-effort defense from his team, which allowed 124 points in a loss to Orlando on Tuesday. ""We were disappointed in ourselves last game. All of us,"" Brooks said. ""It's only one game, but we did play better defense."" Nuggets coach Michael Malone attributed his team's 12-point fourth quarter mainly to fatigue on the second game of a back-to-back. ""Not taking anything away from their team, I thought a lot of our turnovers were self-inflicted,"" Malone said, ""and when you get tired, you start to make mistakes, mental mistakes."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Nikola Jokic scored 17 points. ... Denver led 22-8 in the first quarter and 52-47 at halftime. ... Previous season-high was 25 turnovers. Wizards: Wall drew a technical foul for hitting Jusuf Nurkic with a forearm in the third quarter. ... Washington is 6-6 at home, 2-7 on the road. DENVER'S CHANGES Mudiay missed a game for the first time all season. He's fourth on Denver in scoring (13.1), second in assists (3.8). ""He went out and tried to warm up before the game,"" Malone said. ""Just wasn't feeling right."" Faried's minutes, declining recently, went to zero Thursday. ""By no means is Kenneth Faried out of our rotation or not going to play for us,"" Malone said. LEADERSHIP Asked who takes care of holding teammates accountable when things don't go well, Wizards F Markieff Morris replied: ""Wall is the voice and I'm like the muscle.""","400899774"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Longtime Memphis Grizzly Marc Gasol carried the team throughout the game. The team's newest member closed out an unexpected win. Gasol scored 36 points, but it was a pair of free throws by reserve guard Toney Douglas with less a second left that closed out Memphis' 88-86 comeback victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday night. ""We gave them everything we could. We just threw the kitchen sink at them,"" said Memphis coach David Fizdale, who watched his team overcome an 11-point deficit in the final 5 minutes. ""I don't know if we got lucky or what."" Douglas' last-second free throws gave him 11 points, including the game's final six to seal Memphis' fifth consecutive victory. The Grizzlies have won 12 straight that either went to overtime or were decided by five points or less. ""I wish I could tell you,"" Gasol said when asked about Memphis' ability to pull out close games. ""We just keep fighting. You've seen it in many games now where we just don't let go of the rope."" Gasol was 13 of 24 from the field, including 4 of 6 from outside the arc. But Douglas, signed by Memphis this week because of injuries, took over down the stretch. The guard scored on a 19-footer with 34 seconds left, then converted two pairs of free throws in the last 20 seconds. CJ McCollum led the Trail Blazers with 24 points, and Damian Lillard had 19. Evan Turner had 15 points and 10 rebounds. Portland held a 79-68 lead after Al-Farouq Aminu scored inside with 5:28 left. But Memphis clicked off a 14-2 rally, Gasol collecting nine points in the stretch capped by a 30-footer from Troy Daniels with 1:35 remaining. The game settled into a one-possession contest at that point, including four ties. Portland center Mason Plumlee split a pair of free throws with 7 seconds left, and the Grizzlies pushed the ball down court. Douglas' pump fake drew a foul from Lillard with a half-second remaining. ""It's a tough call,"" Lillard said. ""I think at that point of the game, there are some calls you make, and there are some you just play basketball. You can't be as technical about it."" TIP-INS Blazers: Turner started his first game of the season due to an injury to Maurice Harkless. ... G Allen Crabbe finished with seven points after scoring at least 14 in four straight games. ...Plumlee had four points, ending his streak of seven straight games in double figures. Grizzlies: Fizdale finally said enough about calls and no-calls late in the first half to earn a technical. Lillard missed the ensuing free throw to open the third. ...Gasol also got a tech in the third quarter for arguing a call. .Tony Allen had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Memphis. ... F JaMychal Green had a career-high 18 rebounds. His previous best was 17 this week in a win at New Orleans. EXTENSIONS Earlier Thursday, the Grizzlies announced they have agreed to multi-year extensions with general manager Chris Wallace, John Hollinger, executive vice president of basketball operations, and Ed Stefanski, executive vice president of player personnel. Terms were not disclosed. HARKLESS HURT Portland forward Maurice Harkless did not play because of a left ankle sprain suffered late in Portland's 115-107 loss at Milwaukee on Wednesday night. ""I remember him wincing. He was on the free throw line,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""It was late in the game, like the last 2 minutes."" HELLO, MR. DOUGLAS: Douglas was signed Monday by the team because of multiple injuries for the Grizzlies. His name isn't even on a locker. But Fizdale recognized the guard's importance. ""We don't win that game without him. Fresh off the street, but that's who he is. .He's a bulldog.""","400899775"
"NEW ORLEANS -- Ersan Ilyasova sat in one locker room, both feet in ice buckets as he soaked in the afterglow of the Philadelphia 76ers' first road victory in nearly 11 months. Down the hall, Pelicans forward Anthony Davis sat in his locker, a black hood pulled up over his head, staring at nothing and clearly conveying his disgust without saying much at all. New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry had a little more to say, even uttering an expletive in response to a question about his job status. Ilyasova scored 23 points, Sergio Rodriguez added 16, and the 76ers snapped a franchise record-tying 23-game road losing streak, beating reeling New Orleans 99-88 on Thursday night. The victory was a gratifying one for Philadelphia coach Brett Brown, who contends his team has been improving, only to come up short in close games. ""We've been trending that way,"" Brown said. ""We just haven't had a win to validate it."" The Pelicans became the first team to lose at home to the Sixers (5-18) since last season, when Orlando fell to Philadelphia on Jan. 20. The loss marked a new low for New Orleans (7-16), which was already off to a rough start. When asked if he was concerned about keeping his job, Gentry responded, ""I don't really give a (expletive) about my job status. I'm going to work hard. I'm going to coach until the day they tell me I'm not the coach anymore. ... That is not anything I spend five seconds worrying about."" Davis, who finished with 26 points and 11 rebounds, offered only terse answers to questions, including a ""yes,"" when as if he was more frustrated than at any point in his four-plus NBA seasons. ""We're just not playing right,"" Davis said. ""We need to figure out something."" Asked for his thoughts on what the Pelicans might change, Davis said, ""play harder."" He also said he thinks Gentry is ""doing fine."" Langston Galloway added 19 points for New Orleans, but the Pelicans made only 12 of 40 shots during the second half en route to a fourth-straight loss and sixth loss in seven. Joel Embiid had 14 points and blocked four shots to go with three steals for Philadelphia, which arrived in New Orleans on an eight-game skid and had lost all seven of its previous road games this season. Dario Saric highlighted his 13-point night by scoring eight straight Sixers points on an 8-foot floater, a layup while he was fouled and 3-pointer to help Philadelphia quickly turn a tenuous 85-82 lead into a 10-point advantage with 3:50 left. ""We have to learn how to finish games. We're moving the right way as far as the learning process,"" Ilyasova said. ""This game, we tried to focus ourselves as far as being precise, not turn the ball over and be smart offensively."" TIP-INS Sixers: Nik Stauskas scored 14 points, hitting five of seven shots. ... Forward-center Nerlens Noel, who has not played this season because of a left knee injury, joined the Sixers in New Orleans. Brown has said Noel could play soon. ... The Sixers attempted 40 3s, hitting 12. Pelicans: First-round draft choice Buddy Hield started for a second straight game and for the third time this season, but made only two of 12 shots, hitting both from 3-point range. ... New Orleans was 7 of 25 from deep. SHOOTING SLUMP New Orleans led 57-52 at halftime, but fell into a fell into a shooting funk in the third quarter, missing 20 of 25 shots. The Sixers hit just eight of 22 shots in the period, but led 71-69 heading into the fourth quarter. ""We really just laid an egg tonight,"" Galloway said. MISSING PLAYERS The Pelicans were short-handed, missing guards Jrue Holiday and E'Twaun Moore, who both have toe injuries, but the Sixers have been injury ravaged as well. In addition to Noel, they were without center Jahlil Okafor, guard Jerryd Bayless, and forward Robert Covington, while top overall draft choice Ben Simmons still hasn't even made his debut yet because of a foot fracture. ""We don't have time to have a pity party or anything like that,"" Gentry said. ""We've got to find a way to correct the mistakes.""","400899776"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Golden State Warriors needed less than nine minutes to open a 24-point lead over the short-handed Utah Jazz on Thursday night. Stephen Curry scored 26 points and the Warriors controlled the Jazz from start to finish in a 106-99 victory. Curry had 14 points during a 29-1 run that made it 29-5. The Jazz's only lead of the game was 4-2. ""Loss of focus,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said about the second half. ""Our first quarter was great, we pushed the ball and our defensive intensity was fantastic. I think we let down. We started turning it over some careless, purposeless plays. ""We didn't really have an idea of what we were trying to accomplish. Some defensive mistakes not getting out on shooters and they took advantage."" Kevin Durant added 21 points and 11 rebounds for Golden State. Jazz center Rudy Gobert had 20 points and 17 rebounds, Joe Ingles scored a career-high 21 points, and Shelvin Mack added a season-high 19. The Jazz have four starters sidelined by injuries, including their top three scorers. ""I didn't do a good job of attacking throughout the game and I thought that was a good opportunity for me to attack,"" Durant said about the fourth quarter. Golden State led 65-46 at halftime as the second unit allowed the Jazz to hang around and, technically, remain within striking distance. The urgency from the first quarter disappeared in the second half and the Jazz crept within five in the fourth quarter thanks to buckets from Mack and Ingles, but Durant closed the game with 11 in the final period. ""What we've discussed is just roles,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said about surviving the injuries. ""They can morph. They widen, they can narrow, they can do anything. Hopefully, on a team, guys are willing to evolve and adjust to what the team needs. That's really all we emphasized."" TIP-INS Warriors: Rookie Patrick McCaw scored a career-high 10 points, all in the first half. ... Shaun Livingston took the night off to rest. ... Draymond Green was two assists shy of his 15th career triple-double. ... Green tweaked his ankle, but he and Kerr didn't seem overly concerned. Jazz: Utah started the combination of Joe Johnson, Mack, Dante Exum, Gobert and Boris Diaw for the first time this season. ... Ingles hit a career-high five 3-pointers. INJURED JAZZ The Jazz were without four starters -- Gordon Hayward (finger), Rodney Hood (hamstring), George Hill (toe) and Derrick Favors (knee). Utah has been dealing with injuries all season, but Thursday was their most depleted lineup to date. ""It's easy to be frustrated,"" Snyder said. ""That's something you have to just fight against and make a decision to do the best with where we are. ""It's a credit to our guys really. We've got a group that has character. Over a longer period of time it becomes more challenging. ... Hopefully, there's a silver lining. We've got some guys that are getting minutes that may not be getting otherwise."" QUOTABLE ""This team, my first year was kind of a surprise and everybody seemed to love us. Now maybe it's changed a little bit. It honestly makes no difference to us."" -- Kerr. ROLES Snyder said roles morph, but Joe Johnson added that shouldn't be a difficult thing night-to-night. ""This is our profession, man,"" Johnson said. ""This is what we signed up for. This is what we do. When you're number's called, you've got to be ready regardless of the circumstances.""","400899777"
"CHICAGO --  It wasn't that they finally lost a road game and had their shot at a record dashed. No, what bothered the San Antonio Spurs was the disturbingly slow start. Dwyane Wade scored 20 points and the Chicago Bulls handed the Spurs their first road loss after a 13-0 start, hanging for a 95-91 victory on Thursday night. San Antonio fell one win shy of matching the NBA's best road start set by the Golden State Warriors last season. The Spurs cut an 18-point deficit midway through the third quarter to four in the closing minutes, only to come up short. ""Streaks are a good sign when they're positive and they're a bad sign when they're negative, but at the end of the day, it doesn't give you anything else,"" said Pau Gasol, the former Bull. He's more concerned that the Spurs keep struggling early in games. It could be San Antonio is still adjusting after a busy offseason that included the retirement of Tim Duncan and the addition of several new faces to complement Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge. Even so, the Spurs need that to change. ""Our opponents have outplayed us physically and execute-wise in most first halves for most of the season, and somehow we pull it together in the second half and play harder and smarter than we did in the first half,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""We got it to four, then some execution mistakes. That's the disappointing part, that we're not a very consistent team and we haven't learned as a group the game is 48 minutes."" Leonard scored 24 for San Antonio. Patty Mills added 16 points, hitting 4 of 6 3-pointers. Gasol had 13 points and 10 rebounds in his first game in Chicago since signing with San Antonio in the summer, but the Spurs lost a road game for the first time since Oklahoma City knocked them out in the Western Conference semifinals last season. Jimmy Butler scored all of his 13 points for Chicago in the second half. Rajon Rondo added 12 points, nine assists and 10 rebounds, and Chicago picked up the win after dropping three in a row and six of nine. The Bulls have beaten two of the NBA's best teams in the past week in the Spurs and defending champion Cleveland. But they also lost to Denver, the Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas and Detroit during this slump. ""It's a long season,"" Wade said. ""We have time to fix it. We could play with good teams in this league home or road, but we still have time to fix that. As long as we understand what we need to do, what we have 60 games left, whatever it is, we have a lot of games to fix that so hopefully we can."" STREAK ENDS The Spurs had won 14 straight regular season road games since Denver beat them on April 8. But after a big push down the stretch, they couldn't pull out this one. The Bulls led 65-47 midway through the third following a surge by Butler, who scored seven in a 54-second span after missing his first six shots. But the Spurs jumped back into it in the closing minutes of the quarter. They went on an 11-2 run that Mills finished with a 3 to cut it to 72-66 just under a minute into the fourth. Things got real tight when Gasol nailed a 3 to pull San Antonio within 88-84 with 3:24 left. Doug McDermott then hit three free throws after being fouled by Tony Parker, and the Bulls hung on. WELCOME BACK Gasol spent two seasons with Chicago and forgot for a moment where to go when he arrived at the United Center. The six-time All-Star was halfway to the Chicago locker room when he realized his mistake and turned around. The Bulls showed a video tribute to Gasol during a timeout midway through the first quarter. TIP-INS Spurs: Parker had eight points and five assists after missing a game because of a bruised left knee. ... For the second straight game, the Spurs set a season low for first-quarter scoring. They had 17 points after managing 19 at Minnesota on Tuesday night. Bulls: McDermott scored eight points after being sidelined because of a concussion since Nov. 12. ... Butler had scored 20 or more in 15 consecutive games, the longest streak by a Bulls player since Michael Jordan did it in 24 straight during the 1995-96 season.","400899778"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker didn't mind a bit kicking back and watching the Charlotte reserves play the entire fourth quarter of a blowout win over the Orlando Magic. Especially with an important road game at Cleveland coming up on Saturday night. ""It's always nice to get a little bit of a break,"" Walker said. ""(The starters) played well so we were deserving of it, I thought."" Nic Batum and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist each had 16 points, and the Hornets routed the Magic 109-88 on Friday night for their third straight victory. Walker had 15 points in 25 minutes, and the Southeast Division leaders held the Magic to 37 percent shooting while outrebounding them 59-40. Charlotte's starters didn't even play in the fourth after the Hornets opened a 21-point lead with a late third-quarter surge. The Hornets (14-9) have won six of eight, but now head out on a five-game road trip beginning in Cleveland. ""It's good momentum, obviously,"" coach Steve Clifford said. ""Whenever you are going to go on an extended trip, it's good to win the last home game before you leave. You want to build as much of a cushion as you can."" Batum, who has 39 rebounds in his last four games, missed out on a chance at a triple-double because he didn't play in the fourth quarter with the game out of hand. He finished with nine rebounds and seven assists. This could easily have been a classic trap game for Charlotte, but the Hornets took all the drama out of it with a dominant third quarter. They opened a 52-46 lead at halftime behind a late second-quarter push led by Kidd-Gilchrist, who had 14 points at the break on 6-of-8 shooting. Charlotte extended the margin to 21 late in the third period as Walker began to heat up, beating defenders off the dribble with his quickness and knocking down jumpers. ""Just a lot of breakdowns in the third quarter in particular, on the defensive end with our transition defense, offensive rebounds,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""This is not a great offensive rebounding team, but they burned us tonight and they hit 3s every time they got one, so we didn't match back up. We just had more breakdowns across the board."" Evan Fournier had 14 points for the Magic. TIP-INS Magic: Fournier was assessed a technical foul in the first half for arguing a call. ... Nikola Vucevic played despite a right corneal abrasion and had seven points in 22 minutes. ... Orlando went 9 of 34 on 3-point attempts. Hornets: Have beaten the Magic four consecutive times. ... Walker has reached double digits in every game this season. ... Batum's streak of double-doubles ended at three games. OFFENSIVE WOES The Magic have struggled recently on the offensive end. ""We have a very slim margin for error,"" Vogel said. ""We have to get guys to play more the right way, more often."" BALL MOVEMENT The Hornets moved the ball extremely well on offense against a Magic team that looked a step slow. ""We are a very unselfish team,"" Batum said. ""We're going to move the ball and involve everybody. The guys off the bench did a great job to finish the game, they tried to move the ball, play as a team and we did a good job of that."" CAVS COMING UP Walker said he's eager to face the Cavaliers, who will also be playing on the tail end of a back-to-back. ""It's going to be tough playing against the defending champs, of course, in their building,"" Walker said. ""We lost there already, but we want to go out and play as hard as possible, same thing as tonight. Play some great defense, offensively make some shots and just play a good game.""","400899779"
"CLEVELAND --  Another game, another milestone for LeBron James. The four-time MVP scored 27 points to move into ninth place on the NBA scoring list, and the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Miami Heat 114-84 on Friday night. James passed Elvin Hayes on a driving layup with 6:58 remaining and has 27,315 career points. The Cavs star was removed about a minute later and received a loud ovation from the Cleveland crowd. ""Whenever you're great, you're going to move up a lot of lists,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""It's a tribute to his hard work and his dedication."" James moved past Hakeem Olajuwon earlier and could pass Moses Malone (27,409) for eighth place in the next few games. ""Anytime I'm mentioned with the other greats, it's very surreal and very humbling,"" James said. Kevin Love, a game-time decision because of back spasms, scored a team-high 28 points and had 15 rebounds after missing the morning shootaround. Kyrie Irving added 23 points for the Cavs, who have won three straight after losing three in a row. Derrick Williams scored 17 to lead the short-handed Heat, who dressed only eight players and have lost four straight. Miami center Hassan Whiteside, who spent most of the third quarter on the bench, had eight points and 12 rebounds in 28 minutes. Whiteside entered averaging 17.6 points and 14.7 rebounds. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra was clearly displeased with his center's effort. ""This league is for competitors only,"" Spoelstra said. ""I just wanted more energy, more life defending the pick-and-roll. It has nothing to do with how many touches (you get)."" ""I really don't know what I've got to do, man,"" Whiteside said. ""I really don't know. I'm coming out here playing as hard as I can, putting up what I can."" Cleveland went ahead for good late in the first quarter and took its biggest lead of the half, 57-46, on Irving's 3-pointer as the second quarter was winding down. The Cavaliers took command soon after halftime. Irving hit another 3 and James scored on a breakaway dunk as Cleveland built a 68-50 lead. James had eight assists and is four away from becoming the 16th player in NBA history to compile 7,000 in his career -- and the first frontcourt player to reach the milestone. James isn't sure if he will play when Cleveland hosts Charlotte on Saturday night. ""As far as health-wise, I'm able to go, but Coach and the training staff have some type of program about me and I'll go with whatever they say,"" he said. James rested at Indiana on Nov. 16, the only game he's missed this season, also the second of a back-to-back set. Cavaliers guard J.R. Smith missed his second straight game because of a hyperextended left knee The Heat began an unusual reunion tour by facing James, who helped Miami win two NBA titles in his four seasons with the team. The trip will continue Saturday when they play in Chicago against Dwyane Wade, who signed with the Bulls in the offseason. WHAT BAD BACK? Love showed no signs of any back problems, going 11 of 18 from the field and hitting three 3-pointers. ""It's the Kevin Love of old,"" James said. ""He's going out and playing his game right now.""

"BOSTON --  Not too many teams have been able to outshoot the Raptors this season. The Celtics were the latest to try and fail. Kyle Lowry scored 21 of his season-high 34 points in the second half to help Toronto hold on for a 101-94 victory over Boston on Friday night. Toronto erased an eight-point halftime deficit and led by as many as 11 in the fourth quarter. The Celtics pulled within four in the final minute, but Al Horford fouled Lowry on a 3-point attempt with 30 seconds to play. Lowry made all three free throws to help close out the victory. DeMar DeRozan added 24 points, and Norman Powell had 20. The Raptors have won eight of their last nine. ""I don't think we've had a tough game in that sense of having to come back and fight,"" Lowry said. ""But we've done it before so I think our team is equipped to handle the pressure situations that's going on. We just kept going at it."" Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas sat out his second straight game with a strained right groin. Marcus Smart started in his place, but struggled to keep up with Lowry down the stretch. Horford and Avery Bradley each had 19 points to lead Boston. Boston had nine 3-pointers in the first half and used a 13-0 run in the second quarter to take a 14-point lead. The Raptors crawled out of that hole with 21-3 run in the third. Lowry had 14 points in the quarter. The Celtics kept firing 3s in the second half, but cooled off and finished 17 for 42 for the game. ""They just weren't falling tonight,"" Bradley said. ""We got some really good looks in the second half. We just weren't making shots."" DeRozan said the Raptors' defense in the third quarter, limiting Boston to just five field goals while forcing five turnovers, is something to build on. ""It shows a lot about how resilient we are,"" he said. ""No matter if things aren't going well for us, we can always play extremely hard defensively and try to figure out a way to win."" TIP-INS Raptors: Powell started in place of DeMarre Carroll, who was given the night off to rest and was not with the team. F Bruno Caboclo (sore right knee) also did not travel. Celtics: Tied a franchise high with 17 made 3-pointers. ... Shot just 12 of 42 from the field in the second half. ... Were outscored 33-18 in the third quarter. MAKING PROGRESS The closest Thomas came to basketball Friday was matching up against some kids in a pregame video game challenge on NBA 2K, which was played on the TD Garden jumbotron. He said that he's making progress in rehabbing from his groin strain and is hoping to return Wednesday when the Celtics play at San Antonio. ""It's getting better. It hasn't gotten any worse,"" Thomas said. ""Today I feel a lot better than I have since I've gotten the injury. So we'll see."" MINUTES WATCH As much production as the Raptors have gotten out of Lowry this season, coach Dwane Casey said the coaching staff is mindful of the number of minutes he's playing.  Lowry entered the night averaging 37.4 minutes per game, which was second in the NBA behind only New Orleans' Anthony Davis (38.1). He played 36 minutes Friday. ""It's a big concern,"" Casey said. ""We watch it. We try to keep it down as much as we can. But at the same time we're trying to win games. Because if we don't win as many games as we did last year worried about resting players, then we don't get home court advantage last year.""","400899781"
"MILWAUKEE --  After scoring only 44 points in the first half, the Atlanta Hawks broke loose for 40 in the third quarter to turn the tide. Sparked by Dennis Schroder, who finished with a career-high 33 points, the Hawks rallied to defeat the Milwaukee Bucks 114-110 on Friday night. ""What happened in the first half, that can't happen,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""But I'm very pleased with how they responded and how they competed in the second half."" Schroder thought a lack of defensive pressure and a stagnant Hawks offense allowed the Bucks to build a 20-point halftime lead. ""In the second half, we did it with our energy,"" he said. ""Coach got into us (at halftime). He said to do whatever you have to do to come back."" Paul Millsap had 23 points and 14 rebounds for the Hawks, who ended a seven-game losing streak on Wednesday with a win over Miami. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 18. ""We missed a lot of easy stuff in the first half, but in the second half our mentality was right,"" Millsap said. Jabari Parker scored 27 points for Milwaukee. Giannis Antetokounmpo, in foul trouble throughout the game, had 14. Atlanta pulled ahead 105-103 on Kyle Korver's jumper with 3:15 remaining, giving the Hawks their first lead since early in the game. Parker hit a 3-pointer with 1:51 left to give the Bucks a one-point lead. Schroder countered with a driving layup to put the Hawks back in front. A 3-pointer by Hardaway with 36 seconds remaining gave Atlanta a 110-106 lead, and a pair of free throws by Thabo Sefolosha sealed the victory. A 13-3 run by the Hawks to start the third quarter cut the Bucks' halftime lead in half. Atlanta shot 62 percent in the quarter. ""Being up 20 doesn't mean the game is over,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""Our defense, as a whole, was bad in the second half."" Greg Monroe, who had 14 points off the bench for the Bucks, said the team lost its intensity after building a big lead. ""It was a total letdown on both ends,"" he explained. Milwaukee used strong long-range shooting to take a 64-44 lead at the break, just two points off the team's highest-scoring half of the season. The Bucks shot 54 percent to take a 30-23 lead after the first quarter. Schroder scored 17 points in the period. MISSING IN ACTION Miles Plumlee, who signed a four-year, $52 million deal with the Bucks in the offseason, didn't play (coach's decision) for the fourth straight game. CROWDED FIELD With about one-fourth of the regular season completed, there's a logjam of teams in contention for playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. Entering play on Friday, just 3 1/2 games separated the third- and 11th-place teams. ""It could be that type of year where you have two or three teams that are on top of the East and then everybody else is bunched up to where you could win two games and go from ninth place to fifth,"" Kidd said.

G Kent Bazemore missed his second straight game with a sore right knee. Bucks: Eight players scored in the first quarter, compared with just three for Atlanta. ... The Bucks shot 8 of 13 on 3-pointers in the first half, including 3 of 4 by Jason Terry, who had gone only 9 of 31 from long range (29 percent) this season coming into the game. ...

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Patrick Beverley savored getting the best of his rival, Russell Westbrook. Despite a seventh straight triple-double for Westbrook, Beverley and the Houston Rockets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 102-99 on Friday night. Beverley's history with Westbrook goes back to the 2013 playoffs, when Beverley went after the ball while Westbrook called a timeout. Beverley crashed into Westbrook's knee, and the star guard missed the rest of the postseason with a knee injury. As usual, the Oklahoma City crowd greeted Beverley with boos during pregame introductions Friday. Westbrook finished with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, but Beverley helped harass him into shooting just 8 for 25. ""I won't say what I want to say, but yeah, we tried to show bodies and force him into a crowd and make it tough for him,"" Beverley said. Westbrook gave Beverley no credit. ""I missed a lot of easy shots, man. Honestly, brother,"" Westbrook said. With the Thunder down one in the closing seconds, Westbrook had a chance to give Oklahoma City the lead. Beverley was guarding Westbrook with five fouls, but he settled for a 3-pointer and missed. ""He's a really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good player,"" Beverley said. ""We were fortunate to come up with a stop."" After Westbrook's missed 3, Houston's Trevor Ariza got the rebound, was fouled and made both free throws with 5.8 seconds left. Oklahoma City's Anthony Morrow then missed a 3 that would have tied the game. James Harden had 21 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds to help the Rockets win their fifth straight. Houston withstood Harden's 6-for-23 shooting effort. Westbrook owns the longest triple-double streak since Michael Jordan had seven straight in 1989. The NBA record is nine in a row by Philadelphia's Wilt Chamberlain in March 1968. It was Westbrook's 12th triple-double this season and the 49th of his career. He is the NBA's active leader in the category and ranks sixth all-time. The Thunder had won the previous six games during Westbrook's triple-double binge. The Rockets led by as many as 13 points in the third quarter and took an 86-77 lead into the fourth. Westbrook rested to start the fourth, then re-entered with 8:37 remaining while Clint Capela was at the free throw line. The Thunder trailed by 12 when Westbrook rebounded Capela's miss, and he gave his team a chance. With Houston leading 94-90, Westbrook stole the ball and Ryan Anderson was called for a clear path foul, giving Westbrook two free throws and the Thunder the ball. Westbrook made the free throws, but he missed a fadeaway on the extra possession, and Harden scored on the other end. Oklahoma City got as close as a point, but never took the lead. ""Ball just didn't go in,"" Thunder forward Andre Roberson said. ""Ball just didn't go our way. You have to live with it and go onto the next."" TIP-INS Rockets: Shot 9 for 28 in the first quarter, yet led 25-23. ... Made 11 of 42 3-pointers. ... Made just 19 of 30 free throws. ... Starting backcourt of Beverley and Harden combined to shoot 7 of 31. Thunder: Committed seven turnovers in the first quarter that led to 10 Rockets points. ... Thunder coach Billy Donovan was called for a technical foul in the second quarter after a no-call against Beverley. ... Steven Adams' 17 points in the first half were a career high for a half. He finished with a career-best 24. QUOTABLE Beverley, on Westbrook: ""The man is a walking triple-double. He's not frustrated about that.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Andre Drummond flexed his muscles, bowed his back and enforced his will on the Minnesota Timberwolves. And the free-falling pups showed they wanted nothing to do with Detroit's monster in the middle, raising alarm bells all over Minnesota. Drummond had 22 points and 22 rebounds for his second straight 20-20 game and the Pistons cruised to a 117-90 victory over the Timberwolves on Friday night. ""His energy was great,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""He was dominant. He was all over the boards."" Marcus Morris had 15 points and seven rebounds and the Pistons had their way with Minnesota's struggling defense, hitting 14 of 29 3-pointers. Detroit came into the game second-to-last in the NBA averaging just 7.1 made 3s per game. Andrew Wiggins scored 16 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Wolves. Drummond had his third 20-20 game of the season and 10th since 2014-15, the most in the NBA during that span, and Detroit won for the fourth time on the road in the last five games after starting the season 1-8 away from home. ""I give my all every night,"" Drummond said. ""When the ball's falling the right way like that, my energy kept going up more and more as the game went on because everything was kind of going the right way that night."" Van Gundy has been harping on Drummond to give more consistent effort night-in and night-out, and he beamed that he has gotten three straight strong performances from his All-Star center. Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau is having even more difficulty squeezing energy out of his team and said he was ""very concerned"" that his message is not getting through to a team that is 6-17. ""I'm going to keep coming. I don't go away,"" Thibodeau vowed. ""I'm going to look at everything, re-examine. Something's being missed. It's got to change."" Detroit broke the game open in the third quarter, hitting six 3s during a 31-10 run that bled into the fourth and prompted boos from a sparse Target Center crowd. Reggie Jackson scored 16 points in his fourth game back from a left knee injury. REELING WOLVES Minnesota has lost seven of its last eight games and has not won at home since Nov. 17. ""We can accept making mistakes and don't make shots,"" said Ricky Rubio, who had 10 points. ""Playing with no heart, with no desire, it's just awful. Right now, it's just bad."" Thibodeau said ""everything is on the table"" as he looks to fix things, including lineup changes. ""Something is not right,"" he said. ""We have to find the answer to that."" LONG DISTANCE The Wolves started out the season as the best 3-point shooting team in the NBA, an enormous improvement from recent seasons when they have languished near the bottom of the league. They have steadily regressed to the mean, however, and made just 3 of 16 3s on Friday night. They went through a stretch of 13 straight misses before Brandon Rush made one, his first since Nov. 1, in garbage time. HOMECOMING Pistons rookie Henry Ellenson is from Rice Lake, Wisconsin, a two-hour drive from Target Center. Ellenson said more than 150 people were making the trip for his first game in Minnesota. It was such an anticipated night that Rice Lake High School rescheduled its boys and girls basketball games so more people from the town could make it. The Rice Lake High School band also played during pregame warmups. The vocal contingent cheered ""Put in Henry!"" as the game got out of hand in the fourth, and cheered wildly when he finally entered with four minutes to play.

"DALLAS --  A night after a 31-point home loss that embarrassed Wesley Matthews and his teammates, they all showed up at a charity event hosted by the Dallas shooting guard. Coach Rick Carlisle called it a team-building moment for the unit with the worst record in the Western Conference. Matthews couldn't really disagree. ""I'll have an event every night if that's what we're going to do,"" Matthews said after matching a season high with 26 points as the injury-plagued Mavericks answered their lowest point in a difficult season with a 111-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. A listless second half in a 120-89 loss to Sacramento prompted a team meeting. Two nights later, the Mavericks started the third quarter with a 10-2 run for their first double-digit lead in just their third win in 15 games. Harrison Barnes scored 25 points. ""That game, I think it ate at a lot of people, as it should,"" said Matthews, who was 8 of 16 from the field and 5 of 10 from 3-point range. ""I was embarrassed. I think a lot of other people were, too."" Indiana had 10 3-pointers in the first quarter and a half, including four from Dallas high school product C.J. Miles. But the Pacers couldn't sustain it against the NBA's worst defensive team at the arc, finishing 14 of 25. Paul George scored 22 points to lead the Pacers (11-12), who failed for the third straight time with a chance to get above .500. Indiana hasn't had a winning record since dropping Game 2 at Brooklyn after beating Dallas at home in overtime in the opener. ""It's real disappointing,"" said George, who had just nine points after the first quarter. ""I don't know what it is. I don't have the answers for that."" Matthews outscored the Pacers by himself during a 32-11 spurt that turned a 50-42 deficit into a 74-61 lead. He had 16 points during the run , capped by a 3-pointer midway through the third quarter. The Mavericks (5-17) shot 58 percent in the third quarter, making six of 12 from long range and outscoring the Pacers 31-25. In a 120-89 loss to Sacramento on Wednesday, Dallas was outscored 29-12 in the third. Dallas is without starters Dirk Nowitzki (strained right Achilles tendon) and Andrew Bogut (right knee injury) and key backup guard J.J. Barea (left calf strain). ""We are in desperate need of wins,"" Carlisle said. ""We really played a solid game tonight."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana made its first 24 free throws before Jeff Teague missed the first of two with 1:34 remaining. The Pacers finished 25 of 26. ... Myles Turner, who grew up in the Dallas area, scored 18 points. He had 30 in the first meeting. ... Miles scored 18 points, going 6 of 9 from long range.

It's the first time he was held without a point since Feb. 9, 2015, during his final season with the Mavericks when he played just 4 minutes and missed his only shot. ""Monta is just trying to figure out his role within what we have going on,"" George said. ""We're all trying to figure this out."" CAREER NIGHT Undrafted Dallas rookie Dorian Finney-Smith had career highs with 12 points and eight rebounds, the latter a game high along with Barnes. His scoring included a running one-handed dunk on a fast break. ""I put in the work so I deserve to go out there and shoot it with confidence and that is what I've been doing,"" Finney-Smith said.","400899785"
"LOS ANGELES --  Not even Lou Williams' latest party-crashing performance could ruin Eric Bledsoe's birthday festivities with the Phoenix Suns. Bledsoe had 30 points and nine assists on his 27th birthday, Leandro Barbosa added 21 points and the Suns snapped their three-game losing streak with a 119-115 victory over the slumping Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night. Devin Booker had 15 points before fouling out for the Suns, who hit a season-high 13 3-pointers and withstood a late rally by the short-handed Lakers. Phoenix blew nearly all of its 18-point lead in the second half, but hung on for just its seventh victory of the season after losing five of its previous six. ""My team needed it,"" Bledsoe said after hitting three 3-pointers and getting three steals. ""We had lost a couple of bad ones in a row, but this was one of the best wins we've had all season."" Williams hit six 3-pointers and scored 35 points in his fourth consecutive big game, but the Lakers have lost five straight after a promising start to their season. Nobody else in purple and gold managed more than 14 points. Lakers rookie Brandon Ingram hit a 3-pointer with 17 seconds left to trim Phoenix's lead to 115-113, but Bledsoe and Brandon Knight each hit two free throws in the closing moments. ""I'm just playing and trying to lead by example, playing as hard as I can,"" Williams said. ""Usually when you score a ton of points, you're going to get some wins out of it, and we haven't had that. ... Losing is losing.

Los Angeles has faltered during a busy portion of its December schedule while playing without four injured regulars: D'Angelo Russell, Nick Young, Tarik Black and Jose Calderon. ""The shots we missed the previous game, we had the same shots this game,"" Phoenix coach Earl Watson said. ""The guys just made them. It's a positive reinforcement."" Alex Len had 14 points and 13 rebounds for the Suns. SWEET LOU Williams has three 30-point performances while scoring 137 points over the Lakers' last four games. That's the biggest four-game scoring performance by a reserve since the NBA began keeping track of starts in 1970, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Williams is only coming off the bench to provide a boost to the Lakers' thin lineup, but his impact has been remarkable. ""He's dynamic,"" Watson said. ""He's one of the best scorers in the league. You're not ever going to stop him. You just want him to be not as efficient."" ANGRY DEVIN Booker dropped a career-high 39 points on the Lakers at Staples Center last month.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  For a team that's been on the wrong end of lopsided losses too often this season, the New York Knicks have become pretty good at pulling out the close ones. It's not exactly the plan new coach Jeff Hornacek laid out at the start, but it's one he's willing to live with for now. Carmelo Anthony scored 33 points, including two free throws with 14.8 seconds remaining, and New York held on to beat the Sacramento Kings 103-100 Friday night. ""It just builds confidence and trust,"" said Brandon Jennings, who scored 13 points in place of injured Derrick Rose. ""I know it's still kind of early, but for us this is big to win these close games . especially in the clutch."" Kristaps Porzingis added 17 points and 10 rebounds for New York. Kyle O'Quinn had eight points and 11 rebounds to help the Knicks beat the Kings for the second time in six days. The Knicks have dropped four games by 19 points or more, including a 126-94 home loss to defending NBA champion Cleveland on Wednesday. Conversely, New York is 6-0 in games decided by four points or fewer. ""It's really been our defensive stops late that have allowed us to win these games,"" Hornacek said. ""They're veteran guys that get after it and they have a confidence going. They don't get panicked, they just take their time and make the plays."" New York went cold from the field down the stretch but made six free throws over the final 2:09 to hang on. The Kings missed multiple shots in the waning moments, including an uncontested driving layup by DeMarcus Cousins with 22 seconds left that would have given Sacramento the lead. Rudy Gay missed a potential tying 3-pointer with 3.9 seconds remaining, and Cousins also missed a desperation heave from beyond midcourt that hit the rim at the buzzer. ""We competed the whole night but we had small mistakes and we have to correct those or continue to lose close games,"" Cousins said. ""I hate to say it, but it's a learning curve."" Anthony had 23 points and five rebounds in the first half, then came up big from the stripe to help seal the Knicks' fifth win in six games. He shot 9 of 22 from the floor and made his first 12 free throw attempts before missing two with 2.6 seconds left. Cousins finished with 28 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Gay added 13 points for the Kings. Things got chippy during a timeout with 2:23 remaining. Darren Collison of the Kings and Courtney Lee of the Knicks appeared to get into a heated exchange before players from both teams stepped between the two. Collison and Lee received technical fouls. TIP-INS Knicks: Anthony scored 15 points in the first quarter. He also was called for a technical foul while driving for a layup attempt in the fourth. ... Jennings was 5 of 10 and had five rebounds with seven assists. He also shot an air ball on a free throw in the fourth quarter. Kings: Collison scored six straight points in the fourth quarter and made a layup that briefly put Sacramento up 94-92. ... Cousins was whistled for a technical foul midway through the third quarter, his eighth of the season. A REST FOR BARNES Matt Barnes did not play for the first time this season, although Kings coach Dave Joerger said it had nothing to do with the ongoing investigation stemming from an altercation in a bar that Barnes and Cousins were allegedly involved in while the team was in New York last weekend. Joerger called it a scheduled rest for Barnes, adding that he plans to do it more frequently for the remainder of the season.","400899787"
"WASHINGTON --  Kelly Oubre Jr. is rewarding Wizards coach Scott Brooks' decision to use him late in games. Oubre scored a career-high 19 points to go with nine rebounds and three steals in Washington's 110-105 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday night. For the second game in a row, Oubre played with the starters late. Trailing 100-95, the smaller unit reeled off an 11-0 run. ""When he rebounds and defends the scoring is going to come and I thought he was outstanding throughout the game,"" Brooks said. ""He is on a nice run right now."" John Wall had 24 points and 11 assists, and Bradley Beal added 20 points as the Wizards won for the third time in four games. Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee with 28 points and 13 rebounds, but committed seven of Milwaukee's 20 turnovers. Antetokounmpo's two free throws gave the Bucks a 100-95 lead with 4:28 left, but the Wizards rallied while the Bucks went cold. Wall's driving layup gave the Wizards a 101-100 lead with 3:03 left. Oubre then anticipated a pass by Tony Snell, got the steal and his dunk at the other end made it 103-100. Oubre is averaging 9.4 points and 5.8 rebounds over his last seven games. ""Just my focus. Focusing more on the game plan, focusing more on what I need to do, focusing more on what I can do and can't do out there on the court,"" Oubre said of his recent success. Beal's driving layup pushed the lead to 105-100 and Wall, who scored nine of his points in the fourth quarter, soon added a free throw. Mirza Teletovic's 3-pointer with 5.9 seconds left pulled the Bucks to 108-105, but Beal hit two free throws to seal the win. Teletovic finished with 25 points on 8-for-12 shooting. The Bucks have lost three of four. ""We had 20 turnovers tonight that led to a lot of points. Again, we turned the ball over, we shot a lot of threes there in that five-minute (fourth-quarter) span,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""Our strength is the paint. We have to get back to the paint and work from the inside out."" Trailing by eight early in the third quarter, the Wizards went on a 16-3 run and led 70-65 before the Bucks answered to make it 77-77 after three.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Danilo Gallinari is at his best when being aggressive and imposing his will on opposing teams. That hasn't always come easily to the Denver Nuggets forward. Gallinari managed to put it all together Saturday night, scoring 21 points in leading the Nuggets to a 121-113 win over the Orlando Magic. He consistently attacked in the paint and got to the foul line 10 times. ""That's what I need to do every game,"" said Gallinari, who shot 5 for 8 from the field and 9 of 10 at the free throw line. ""The more I'm aggressive, the more I can make things happen for everybody else."" Gallinari hit perhaps his biggest shot when he nailed a 3-pointer that put the Nuggets ahead 109-106 late in the fourth quarter. Denver never trailed again in a game that included 12 lead changes and six ties up to that point. ""It's real simple with Danilo: When he is aggressive, he's a great player,"" said Nuggets coach Michael Malone, whose team improved to 9-15. ""When he settles for jump shots and doesn't get to the foul line, he is not as good of a player."" The entire Nuggets team played aggressively Saturday, successfully attacking a short-handed Orlando interior that was without center Nikola Vucevic, who injured his back during Friday night's loss at Charlotte.  Power forward Serge Ibaka and Bismack Biyombo were there but that did little to slow the Nuggets, who outscored Orlando in the paint 64-34. In addition to Gallinari, Denver also got big baskets inside from Jusuf Nurkic, Nikola Jokic and Kenneth Faried. It didn't help the Magic that leading shot blocker Biyombo was nursing a left shoulder injury and wore a brace to protect it. ""They have shot blockers in there but we can't be afraid of them,"" said Faried, who had 19 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. ""We have to keep attacking them. Sooner or later something is going to give. Either we are going to get our shot blocked or we are going to finish over the top. We were able to finish tonight."" It was a sore point for Magic coach Frank Vogel, who has seen his top-3 defense cave during this stretch of playing eight games in 12 days. ""Most of it was on the interior,"" said Vogel, whose team has lost three straight. ""Nurkic is a load in there. Not having (Vucevic) hurt us a little bit."" Nurkic had 17 points on 8-of-11 shooting and grabbed eight rebounds for the Nuggets, who lost their previous two games. Will Barton scored 16. Faried was 9 of 10 from the field, and Denver shot 57 percent. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver outrebounded the Magic 35-26 and benefited with 17 second-chance points to just seven for Orlando. ... Denver's bench outscored Orlando's reserves 58-34. Magic: Orlando recalled rookie center Stephen Zimmerman from the Erie BayHawks of the NBA Development League. ROOKIE BREAKOUT Denver rookie Juancho Hernangomez had his best outing as a pro, coming off the bench to score 14 points. After missing his first 3-pointer of the night, he knocked down four straight in the first half. He also had a big basket inside to tie the game at 106 in the fourth.","400899789"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Paul George did what the three-time All-Star does best. He scored a season-high 37 points, including 13 straight in the fourth quarter, to lead the Indiana Pacers over the Portland Trail Blazers 118-111 on Saturday night. ""That's the Paul George we are accustomed to,"" forward Myles Turner said. ""It was good to see him find that groove."" George missed the game at Portland on Nov. 30 when the Pacers lost 131-109, and because of injuries and a five-game trip out West, he hadn't even played at home in more than two weeks. George made up for lost time, putting on a show with five 3-pointers and the fourth-quarter rally in his first game back at Bankers Life Fieldhouse since Nov. 23. Thaddeus Young hit a career-high six 3s while getting 24 points and nine rebounds, and Turner added 14 points for the Pacers, who had lost five straight regular season games to Portland. ""I thought Thaddeus was the biggest player of us all tonight,"" George said. ""I was the one who was there late in the game, but he was the one who kept us in the game."" C.J. McCollum made a career-high seven 3-pointers and had a season-best 34 points for the Trail Blazers. Damian Lillard had 33 points behind five 3s. George scored 13 straight points in the fourth quarter for Indiana. He was fouled on the go-ahead basket with 4:36 remaining and completed the three-point play to give the Pacers a 108-105 lead. Indiana didn't even take its first lead until Al Jefferson was fouled on a basket and made the bonus free throw to put the Pacers ahead for the first time 99-98 with 8:34 left in the fourth quarter. Then McCollum scored seven straight points to give the Trail Blazers the lead again before George took over. The Pacers trailed by 20 points after Portland didn't waste much time taking a lead right from the start. Lillard, who scored 28 points in Portland's win over Indiana on Nov. 30, had a big first quarter with 19 points and five 3-pointers. ""It's the same thing,"" Lillard said. ""We start off the game well and we build a lead, but we know the other team is going to make a run. We're just not getting it done."" He made back-to-back 3s to put the Trail Blazers ahead 26-11 with 5:59 remaining in the first, and McCollum's 3-pointer with 8:09 left in the second quarter gave the Trail Blazers a 58-38 lead. George made back-to-back 3-pointers with under a minute to go in the first half. His 3 with 25.3 second remaining put the Pacers within seven to trail 71-64 at the half. 3-POINT SHOOTOUT Portland finished with 16 3-pointers -- just one shy of tying their season best. It became a 3-point shootout during different stretches throughout the game. McCollum made one in the third quarter to put Portland ahead 82-73, but George answered with a 3 before McCollum made another. Young scored three 3s during a stretch in the third to cut the deficit to six. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Their 44 points in the first quarter were the most Portland has scored in a quarter this season and the 13 points in the fourth was the fewest scored in a quarter. ... Lillard had nine assists. ... Mason Plumlee had eight points and nine rebounds. Pacers: Jefferson finished with 10 points off the bench. ... Monta Ellis had 10 points and five assists.","400899790"
"CLEVELAND --  Standing at midcourt, LeBron James spun the ball on his index finger as the final seconds ticked off the clock. He had the Hornets turning in circles all night. James scored 17 of his season-high 44 points in the fourth quarter and reached another career milestone as the Cleveland Cavaliers won their fourth straight, 116-105 over Charlotte on Saturday. James did it all, making five 3-pointers and adding 10 assists and nine rebounds in 43 minutes. He took over in the fourth, scoring 13 straight during one stretch to help the Cavs hold on. ""A lot of our guys had heavy legs tonight and it was up to me to get through it,"" he said. ""He carried us,"" teammate Kevin Love said. ""I kept telling him, `Take us home."" James, who moved into ninth place on the career scoring list Friday, recorded his 7,000th assist in the first half, becoming the first frontcourt player in NBA history to reach the plateau. The 31-year-old is the only player with 27,000 points, 7,000 assists and 7,000 rebounds. ""I don't know what to say,"" James said when asked about the achievement. ""That's the triple threat of me. To rebound, to pass, to put the ball in the hole a little bit. It's just an honor. I'm just blessed. To be the only one to put up those numbers is pretty cool because this is the game I love. It's the game I watched my whole life growing up, so it's incredible."" Cleveland shot a season-best 58 percent from the field and beat Charlotte for the sixth straight time at home. Kemba Walker scored 24 to pace the Hornets, playing the first of five consecutive road games. Walker sat out the final few minutes after banging knees with James. ""It's not bad at all,"" said Walker, who had a sleeve over his left knee. ""At the moment it looked pretty bad, but I'm good. I was coming off a ball screen and he ran into me."" Charlotte coach Steve Clifford knew his team was going to have trouble defending the Cavs if the reigning NBA champions were clicking. Once James warmed up, there wasn't much the Hornets could do. ""He passed. He rebounded. He made 3s. He was great going to the basket,"" Clifton said. ""He was phenomenal. He made three or four 3s that he's going to make. You can't block them. You can't contest them. When he's shooting the ball like that there's nothing you can do, other than blitz, and that's what he wants you to do, and then he really makes you look bad."" The Cavs were on target from the start, shooting 71 percent while building a 12-point lead in the first quarter. Cleveland stayed around 70 percent for most of the first half and had a 15-point lead at halftime. The Hornets cut it to three in the third, but James countered with a pair of 3s in a span of 25 seconds, straddling the arc after the second make while looking in the direction of Clifford, who was calling a timeout. NO REST Cavs coach Tyronn Lue intends to rest James at some point, but not on a night when Kyrie Irving said he was tired. ""I didn't want to play LeBron this many minutes, but he came and said, `Coach, I'm fine,"" Lue said. ""Then, he started raining 3s. We had to ride him tonight."" TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum is one of five NBA players averaging at least 13 points, 7.7 rebounds and 5.6 assists. James, Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden are the others. Of that group, Batum came in averaging the fewest turnovers (2.3). ... Walker entered with the second-most 3-pointers (61) in the Eastern Conference. Only Toronto's Kyle Lowry had made more. ...

"CHICAGO --  Dwyane Wade wearing a Chicago Bulls uniform never will look right to Miami coach Erik Spoelstra. On nights like this, it's particularly painful. Wade scored 28 points against his former team, Jimmy Butler led the way with 31 and the Bulls held off the struggling Heat 105-100 on Saturday. Butler scored Chicago's final 10 points to help the Bulls come out on top after Miami pulled within one. Wade, the 12-time All-Star and three-time NBA champion with Miami, keyed a big third-quarter run in his second game against the Heat. He and the Bulls hung on after handing San Antonio its first road loss two nights earlier. ""I've seen it for so many years on our side,"" Spoelstra said. ""He showed his competitiveness and the variety of his menu. He was going into the post, he was playing pick-and-roll basketball -- he puts a tremendous amount of pressure on your team defense. He's got all the talent in the world, but what really makes Dwyane is his intellect for the game. He knows where the defense is going to be, and he knows the moves before you even make them."" Goran Dragic led Miami with 21 points and 11 assists, and an energetic Hassan Whiteside added 20 points after being benched for part of Friday's blowout loss in Cleveland. Tyler Johnson scored 15, but the Heat dropped their fifth straight. Johnson cut it to 97-96 when he nailed a 3-pointer with 4:20 left. Butler then drove for a three-point play and hit another free throw to make it 101-96, but the Heat weren't finished. A layup by Dragic and basket by Whiteside in the lane cut it to 101-100 with 13 seconds remaining. Butler then hit two free throws to boost Chicago's lead back up to three. With a chance to tie, Dragic and Josh Richardson botched a handoff near the top of the key. Butler got the steal and hit two more foul shots with less than a second left to seal the win. ""In this league, there are going to be some nights you're going to play amazing, and there are going to be some nights where you play just well enough to get a win,"" Wade said. ""Never begrudge a win. We played good enough to get a win tonight."" BIG DUNK Wade let out a smile after he was fouled by Whiteside on a soaring dunk after splitting two defenders for a three-point play during an 18-2 run in the third. Wade scored 11 during that spurt. THAT'S MONEY Floyd Mayweather took in the game and was shown on the video board during the third quarter. TIP-INS Heat: F Udonis Haslem rejoined Heat after they let him miss Friday's game at Cleveland to watch his son win a state football championship. The 14-year veteran got to see Kedonis Haslem, a 6-foot-4, 290-pound lineman, and Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas pound Plant 45-6 in the Florida Class 7A final. ""He's missed all of his son's important playoff games and championship games, senior year,"" Spoelstra said.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Grizzlies bolted out of the starting gate and never looked back. The Warriors weren't exactly gaining on them anyway. Marc Gasol and Tony Allen scored 19 points each and Memphis rolled over Golden State 110-89 for its sixth straight win. ""We couldn't have played much worse,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, ""and I thought (the Grizzlies) were great. They came out, took it to us. The Grizzlies led by as many as 30 points in the second half -- the biggest advantage by any Warriors opponent this season. Seven Memphis players finished in double figures, including Zach Randolph and JaMychal Green with 14 points each. ""We stayed poised, we stayed in control, we stayed aggressive,"" Gasol said. ""We played to win. We didn't play not to lose."" Kevin Durant led Golden State with 21 points, while Stephen Curry added 17 points and Ian Clark finished with 10 points. Curry and backcourt starter Klay Thompson (eight points) were a combined 8 of 28 from the field, including 3 of 14 outside the arc. Memphis had a double-digit lead early, led 61-38 at halftime and kept building in the third quarter. Golden State ended a four-game winning streak. The Warriors had won 16 of 17, the lone loss in the stretch coming 132-127 in double overtime to Houston on Dec. 1 Kerr benched his starters with 10 minutes left and Memphis leading 93-65. It was just one of those rare nights for Golden State, which entered with the league's best record at 20-3. The Warriors had a season low in points, a season high in turnovers (23) and were close to their season low in shooting percentage (44.2 percent). Golden State's 38 first-half points were its fewest in any half this season. ""We weren't on the same page. We were trying to force too many things,"" Thompson said, adding that ""(the Grizzlies) definitely took us out of our rhythm early, and we let that affect us on the offensive end and the defensive end."" The lead ballooned to 68-38 when Memphis scored the first seven points of the second half, and the Grizzlies held an 87-65 lead after three quarters. ""It was one of those nights,"" Durant said. TIP-INS Warriors: C Zaza Pachulia was a late scratch with a right wrist contusion. Anderson Varejao started his first game of the season (and first with Golden State)...

Clark, who attended college at Belmont, is the only former Germantown player to make the NBA. Several teammates, including Durant, Draymond Green and Curry, attended the ceremonies. TOO MUCH WARRIOR LOVE Gasol has grumbled this year when opposing fans have packed into FedExForum and subtly mentioned it Saturday night. ""We did a good job of keeping their crowd out of the game for the most part,"" he said. ""I think our crowd won. We didn't let their fans get too excited throughout the game.""","400899793"
"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets still had a double-digit lead, but had gotten a little careless and had three turnovers in a row in the third quarter on Saturday night against the Dallas Mavericks when coach Mike D'Antoni had seen enough. ""Coach went off a little bit,"" Trevor Ariza said. ""I think that was the turning point for us to get our head in the game and for us to start playing the way we normally play."" Soon after that, Ariza -- who finished with 17 points -- made three straight 3-pointers to pad the lead and the Rockets beat the Mavericks 109-87 for their sixth straight win. ""They turned it on when they needed to and then as a coach you kind of feel silly sometimes ... (but) you just try to caution them because things happen and they're a good 3-point shooting team, they get hot,"" D'Antoni said. James Harden had 18 points, 16 assists and nine rebounds and Eric Gordon added 18 points to give Houston its first six-game winning streak since Oct. 28-Nov. 6, 2014. Gordon's 3-pointer extended Houston's lead to 16 in the fourth quarter before Harrison Barnes hit a basket on the other end. Montrezl Harrell then made an off-balance layup as he was fouled and crashed to the court. He made the free throw to leave Houston up 92-75. Wesley Matthews made a 3 with about six minutes left to get the Mavericks within 12. But Patrick Beverley, who scored all of his 15 points in the fourth quarter, hit 3s on the next two possessions to push Houston's lead to 100-82. Matthews scored 26 points to lead the Mavericks and Barnes finished with 20. ""When you get off to a bad start on the road, it just makes it harder,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We hung in and kept it within 10 or 11 a lot of the game, but it was hard getting over the hump."" A layup by Seth Curry cut Houston's lead to nine points midway through the third quarter. That's when Ariza got hot, making 3-pointers on three straight possessions to power a 9-4 run that pushed Houston's lead to 75-61. ""It was a drag, it was dull and we couldn't find energy,"" Harden said. ""But Trevor made some big shots, kind of got us going and pushed the lead up going to the fourth quarter."" Gordon and Sam Dekker added 3-pointers after that to leave the Rockets up 86-69 entering the fourth quarter. Ariza made four 3s to move past Shane Battier for fourth on Houston's all-time 3-pointer list with 579. Harden's 16 assists were his most since he had 17 in Houston's season opener.

The crowd snickered and booed as he got up and shook his head. A moment later the miscue was played on the jumbotron and the boos started again. THEY SAID IT Carlisle on why Devin Harris played just over four minutes on Saturday: ""He's not injured or anything like that. I just determined that it was best to not play him anymore.

"SAN ANTONIO --  If the San Antonio Spurs weren't aware of how poorly they've played in the opening half of most games this season, they were forcefully reminded recently. After coach Gregg Popovich called out their professionalism and effort, the Spurs rebounded from their first road loss of the season with their most efficient home performance. Kawhi Leonard had 30 points and the Spurs set five season highs, rolling to a 130-101 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night. The Spurs led by as many as 38 three days after what Popovich deemed another ""24-minute"" effort in a 95-91 defeat at Chicago. ""We have so many professional guys and veteran guys, it shouldn't take him to do that,"" San Antonio reserve guard Patty Mills said, ""but it definitely affected everyone to know that we've got to lace them up here and do what we do. No one messing around."" The Spurs set season highs for points, points in a quarter, points in a half, assists and 3-pointers in winning their 14th straight at home over the Nets. San Antonio also matched its largest margin of victory, set in a season-opening win over Golden State. ""It feels good, especially to do it at home,"" said point guard Tony Parker, who had a season-high seven assists. ""We've been struggling a little bit at home. We had a good start today. Energy was good. And we kept it for the whole game."" The Spurs' effort through the opening 36 minutes enabled them to sit Leonard in the final quarter, which was the only time the Nets could slow the sleek 6-foot-7 forward. Leonard was 10 for 18 from the field, including 4 for 7 on 3s, in scoring 30 points or more for the seventh time this season. He had four 30-point games in his previous 324 career games. San Antonio was 14 for 26 on 3-pointers. ""They execute their offense with pace,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""They are tough to chase around; they really share (the ball). It was a great challenge for us and we weren't up to it."" After a string of anemic starts at home that had frustrated the Spurs, San Antonio set season highs for points in any quarter and any half with a 41-point effort in the opening period that helped produce a 67-52 lead at halftime. The 41 points in the first quarter were nine more than the Spurs had against Chicago in the first half. ""We didn't like the way we played,"" Spurs veteran Manu Ginobili said. ""We needed to feel better about the way we played."" San Antonio had five assists on its first six baskets, with Parker collecting a pair of assists off bounce passes for mid-range jumpers from LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol. The Spurs had a season-high 38 assists. Bojan Bogdanovic led Brooklyn with 20 points. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn has not won consecutive games all season. ... Nets F Trevor Booker, who has a team-high nine double-doubles, finished with nine points and four rebounds. ... The Nets have not won in San Antonio since Jan. 22, 2002, losing 14 straight on the road against the Spurs. ... The Nets are 1-9 on the road this season. . Brooklyn PG Jeremy Lin missed the game due to a strained left hamstring. ... The Nets have 50 games missed due to injuries this season. Spurs: San Antonio is 40-4 against the Nets at home, the best home record by a team against an opponent in NBA history. ... San Antonio is 13-0 when scoring 100 points or more. ...

The Spurs' previous high for any quarter was 39 points in the third against the Lakers on Nov. 18. The team's previous high for the opening period was 31 in the season-opening win against Golden State. WORTH WATCHING The Spurs gave the Nets plenty of film to watch on how to execute properly. ""One thing that's great seeing a team like that is watching how they move the ball, how they share the ball (and) how quick their decisions are,"" Atkinson said. ""It's good for us as a coaching staff and good for our players to kind of feel that and feel what it's like. Hopefully one day we will try to imitate that."" ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT San Antonio might have the NBA's second-best record at 19-5, but the Spurs know they still have much to improve on. ""I think in this case we can,"" Ginobili said. ""I don't think you're going to find anybody in this locker room that feels satisfied with the way we are playing. We all know we can do so much better. The record is not that important when you're not playing well.""","400899795"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Turnovers got the Utah Jazz off to a rough start Saturday night. Sacramento raced to big leads in the first and third quarters, but behind Gordon Hayward and Rudy Gobert, Utah rallied both times for a 104-84 victory over the Kings. The Jazz had 22 turnovers but won for the eighth time in 10 games after holding Sacramento to just eight points on 3-of-22 shooting in the fourth quarter. It is the fewest points allowed by Utah in the fourth quarter this season. ""We guarded,"" Hayward said. ""They got nothing easy. It seemed like a lot of the shots were contested. That's just what happened. Then we were able to get the ball up the court and they weren't set. We got some good looks. People knocked down timely 3s."" Gobert had 17 points, 14 rebounds and a season-high six blocks for the Jazz and is one of only five NBA players to block six or more shots in a game this season. Hayward scored 26 points after sitting out with an injured finger in Thursday's loss to Golden State, and Trey Lyles added 14 points and five rebounds for Utah. Rudy Gay scored 20 points and DeMarcus Cousins had 16 points and 10 rebounds to lead Sacramento. Darren Collison added 17 points and Omri Casspi chipped in 12 for the Kings, who lost for the seventh time in nine games. The Kings were undone by their lifeless fourth quarter. ""We scored eight,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""We shot 37 percent (in the game). It's tough. They do a great job of clogging the paint. You got to make shots if you're going to get them."" The Kings took an early lead thanks to Utah's mistakes. The Jazz turned the ball over four times in the first 2:20 of the game, leading to an 11-0 Sacramento run. Gay highlighted the spurt with layups off back-to-back steals, and Kosta Koufos banked in a hook shot to finish it off. After a quick timeout, Utah's offense got back on track with baskets from Boris Diaw and Dante Exum on consecutive possessions. The Jazz took their first lead a couple of minutes later after Joe Ingles buried a 3-pointer. Hayward then capped a 22-5 run with back-to-back baskets to give Utah a 22-16 lead. The third quarter felt like a rerun of the first. After clawing back for a 52-50 halftime lead, Utah fell behind again after committing a pair of turnovers to spark a 10-0 Sacramento run. The Kings went ahead on two baskets from Collison and took a 60-52 lead on a pull-up jumper from Gay. Much like the first quarter, the Jazz rallied, and then Utah used a 20-4 run to slam the door on the Kings early in the fourth quarter. Hayward capped the stretch with a 3-pointer to give the Jazz a 98-80 lead with 5:31 remaining. ""They were unforced, just sloppy play,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""The guys sorted it out, which was good to see."" TIP INS Kings: Sacramento scored a season-high 36 points off turnovers. ... The Kings are 0-12 this season when trailing after three quarters. ... Cousins averaged 30.0 points and 13.0 rebounds in three games against Utah last season. Jazz: Hayward became the first Jazz player with 10 straight 20-point games since Karl Malone in 2001. ... Gobert registered his fourth straight double-double and his 15th overall this season. Gobert has averaged a double-double through Utah's first 25 games. CORRALLING COUSINS Utah tried to limit Cousins to low-percentage shots, keeping him out of the paint and off the free-throw line. Mission accomplished. Cousins shot just 7 of 22 from the floor and attempted just three free throws in 34 minutes. It became obvious Cousins was in for a long night when Gobert swatted back his dunk attempt on Sacramento's first play of the game. ""For Cousins, he's one of the best players in the league at his position,"" Gobert said. ""So you can't give him any space and you also have to make sure you move your feet because he's pretty quick and pretty strong.""","400899796"
"LOS ANGELES -- Twenty points, 20 assists, zero turnovers -- what caught Chris Paul's eye first? ""The turnovers,"" the Clippers point guard said. ""That's the first thing I look at every game."" Paul was historically efficient Saturday night, helping the Clippers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 133-105 with their highest offensive output of the season. It was the first 20-20 game of Paul's career, and he is the first player since at least 1977-78 -- when turnovers were first recorded for individuals -- to have 20 points, 20 assists and zero turnovers in a game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. ""As a point guard, I'm like the quarterback, so a turnover is like an interception,"" he said. ""And when you have as much firepower as we have, a turnover takes away that opportunity."" This was the fifth time this season that Paul did not commit a turnover, but he averaged 7.8 assists in the first four games. ""He didn't have any turnovers?"" DeAndre Jordan said. ""He is a legend, man."" The Clippers shot a season-best 57.4 percent from the field and made a season-high 17 3-pointers on 36 attempts to snap a two-game skid. ""We were just running the same play over and over, to be honest,"" Paul said. Jamal Crawford scored 22 points and Jordan had 19 points and nine rebounds for Los Angeles, which won for only the third time in eight games after opening the season 14-2. Austin Rivers had 18 points, and J.J. Redick had 16. ""Coach played a lot of guys tonight, and everyone who stepped on the court did something,"" said Mo Speights, who chipped in 17. Coming off a tough loss to the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night, the Clippers got back to work in practice on Thursday and Friday. ""A lot of times you have a great practice and it doesn't translate right away,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""I thought yesterday was the start of how we played tonight."" The Pelicans, playing without resting Anthony Davis, lost their fifth straight. New Orleans gave up its season high in points and has lost four consecutive road games, falling to 2-9 away from home. ""I thought we played well the first half. I thought we competed, did a good job,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""And the turnover thing reared its ugly head. The problem with our turnovers is that we have too many live turnovers."" The Pelicans coughed up 16 turnovers on the night. Tim Frazier scored 20 points to lead New Orleans. Cheick Diallo, playing his first extended time for the Pelicans, added 19 points, and Terrence Jones had 18. ""Basically, Coach told me yesterday, 'I want to give you a chance,'"" Diallo said. ""I got a chance today, so I had to take it. I just played hard every possession he wanted me to play."" The Clippers led 61-55 at halftime and broke the game open with an 18-6 run over the opening 4:29 of the third quarter. Rivers hit a pair of 3-pointers and capped the stretch with a lefty layup off the glass, giving the Clippers a 79-61 lead. This was the Clippers' eighth consecutive victory over the Pelicans at Staples Center, a streak dating to 2012. NO A-D The Pelicans elected to rest Davis, the NBA's leading scorer with 31.4 points per game. He had averaged 44 minutes over his previous three games. ""I think he just needs to take the day off,"" Gentry said. Through Saturday night, Davis had averaged a league-leading 38.1 minutes per game. RIVERS RUN THROUGH Rivers took a hard elbow to the jaw from a driving Jones with 4:22 left in the third quarter. Rivers returned late in the quarter and tried to play in the fourth, but he had to be helped from the court early in the final quarter. He was taken to the locker room to be evaluated by team physicians, according to the Clippers. 3,000 AND COUNTING Saturday's game marked announcer Ralph Lawler's 3,000th regular-season Clippers television broadcast.

"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  All of a sudden, the 76ers are a handful on the road. Three days after ending a long losing streak away from home, Philadelphia showed another glimpse of its potential. Playing without center Joel Embiid (rest), the Sixers used balanced scoring to beat the Detroit Pistons 97-79 on Sunday night for their second consecutive road victory after going nearly a year without one. Robert Covington had 16 points and Ersan Ilyasova scored 15 to lead five players in double figures for Philadelphia, which raced to a 25-point advantage in the first half. The 76ers had matched a franchise record by losing 23 straight road games before beating New Orleans last Thursday. That was their first win away from home since Jan. 20 last season at Orlando. ""We're a young team and we have so many offensive and defensive weapons,"" said Covington, who also had seven rebounds and two steals. ""Once we lock in and do what we're supposed to do, this team can become really scary."" Jahlil Okafor had 14 points and nine rebounds, and T.J. McConnell added 12 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for the Sixers, who snapped a four-game losing streak against the Pistons. ""All over the place, people contributed,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""It was a Philly-hard effort."" Marcus Morris scored 28 points and Andre Drummond finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds for Detroit, which fell behind 32-12 in the first quarter and never led. ""They were playing way too fast for us,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We weren't the least bit ready to play."" The 76ers shot 72 percent in the opening quarter, including 57 percent from 3-point range, to open a commanding lead. Philadelphia continued to dominate, taking a 58-35 edge into halftime. ""That was by far one of our best starts,"" Covington said. ""We were assisting on the offensive end and executing on the defensive end."" The Pistons fought back in the third quarter, cutting the deficit to 80-64 heading into the final period. Detroit used an 8-0 run, capped by Morris' 3-pointer, to get to 87-79 with 4:23 left. Philadelphia, however, scored the final 10 points to seal it. ""Hats off to them,"" said Pistons guard Reggie Jackson, who scored 10 points on 5-of-17 shooting. ""They ran circles around us and kicked our butts."" TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid and Jerryd Bayless (left wrist) did not travel with the team. Philadelphia rookie Ben Simmons (right foot) remains out. Pistons: Starting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (bruised right knee) was a late scratch and did not play. ...

"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Russell Westbrook's triple-double streak ended at seven games, but he finished the night with two things that meant more to him -- a win and his long-lost shooting stroke. Westbrook scored 23 of his 37 points in the second half to help the Oklahoma City Thunder defeat the Boston Celtics 99-96 on Sunday. He had 12 rebounds but only six assists, ending the NBA's longest triple-double run since Michael Jordan had seven straight in 1989. Westbrook hadn't been satisfied. He shot just under 38 percent during the streak, and said after Friday's loss to Houston that it bothered him. Against the Celtics, he made 14 of 26 shots and finally found his rhythm. ""Just taking shots I wanted to take, that was the most important part,"" he said. ""And playing from the block. That's the most important part. I talked to my dad this morning, and he got on me about not using that to my advantage, and I definitely tried to do more of that tonight."" Westbrook wasn't worried about the streak ending. ""Honestly, I'm just happy we won tonight,"" he said. ""That's the most important thing. As a player, I always try to look forward. Maybe at the end of the season, I can talk about it, but as of right now, my job is to move forward and get ready for Portland."" Steven Adams scored 16 points on 7-for-8 shooting and Enes Kanter added 14 points for the Thunder, who have won seven of eight. Oklahoma City got away with making just 14 of 27 free throws. Al Horford scored 19 points, and Jae Crowder and Avery Bradley each added 18 for the Celtics. The Celtics controlled most of the first half and led 43-39 at halftime. It was Oklahoma City's lowest-scoring first half of the season. The Celtics led by 13 in the third quarter, but the Thunder whittled their deficit to four by the end of the period. Westbrook made a driving layup with 30.6 seconds left to give the Thunder a 96-94 lead. Westbrook then won a jump ball with Bradley to start a fast break, and Jerami Grant finished it with a dunk that put Oklahoma City up 98-94 with 14.4 seconds to play. Marcus Smart scored in close for Boston to make it 98-96. Westbrook made the first of two free throws with 5.1 seconds left to leave the door open, but Smart's 3-pointer for the tie bounced away as time expired. ""I think we just stopped moving the ball,"" Bradley said. ""We took some bad shots. We weren't able to score the ball. If we continued to play the way we had, we could have made it easier on ourselves."" --- TIP-INS Celtics: G Isaiah Thomas missed his third straight game with a strained right groin. He averages 26 points per game. ... Smart, who played college ball at Oklahoma State, got his eighth start of the season. He finished with 11 points, nine assists and six rebounds. ... Crowder fouled out. Thunder: Westbrook was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... The Thunder missed their first 16 3-pointers and finished 3 for 21. ... Coach Billy Donovan was called for a technical foul midway through the third quarter. INJURY UPDATE Thunder guard Victor Oladipo left the game for good after spraining his right wrist on a hard fall with 5.2 seconds left in the first quarter. He leaped to challenge a shot by Jonas Jerebko and fell onto Jerebko's shoulder and back on the way down, causing him to lose control of his landing. STAT LINES Adams has made 15 of 17 field goal attempts and 10 of 14 free throws over the past two games, with averages of 20 points and nine rebounds.","400899799"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- With all the Golden State Warriors have accomplished in the last three years, they take special pride in an NBA-record streak of 111 regular-season games without back-to-back losses. The Minnesota Timberwolves thought they were going to end that run Sunday night. Those hopes ended with a splash. Klay Thompson scored 30 points and the Warriors roared back to avoid their first set of consecutive regular-season losses since 2015 with a 116-108 victory over the Timberwolves. Stephen Curry had 22 points and nine assists, and the Warriors rallied from a 10-point deficit to start the fourth quarter to keep their streak alive. Thompson scored 12 points during a 25-4 surge to start the final period. ""Let's not fool ourselves,"" said Draymond Green, who scored 18 points and hit five 3-pointers. ""We played a great 12 minutes, inspired by our second unit who played 9 of those 12 minutes. And that's what gave us this win."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 25 points and 18 rebounds, and Andrew Wiggins scored 25 for the Timberwolves (6-18), who lost their fourth straight game. ""I wanted to stop that streak,"" Towns said. Zach LaVine scored 25 points and hit five 3s for the Wolves. The Warriors were coming off a 21-point loss Saturday to the Grizzlies and were playing their fourth game in five nights, and it was clear from the start that they were a little weary. Just when Curry appeared to be heating up, hitting back-to-back 3s midway through the third quarter, the best shooter on the planet tossed up an airball on the very next possession. Between that ghastly miss and Kevin Durant missing a wide-open layup, it was clear the Warriors were just a bit off for the second night in a row, something that hasn't happened in the regular season since April 7, 2015. The Wolves closed the third period with a 14-1 run, but the Warriors found the gas pedal. ""We were down 10 but we didn't let it deflate us,"" Thompson said. ""Twelve minutes is a long time for this team."" TIP-INS Warriors: Curry passed Steve Nash for 17th on the career 3-pointers list. ... C Zaza Pachulia was out again with sprained right wrist. ... Kevon Looney started at center despite being listed as questionable with a sprained right ankle. Timberwolves: Minnesota outrebounded Golden State 51-37. ... F Nemanja Bjelica missed his second straight game with a sore right ankle. RECORD STREAK The Warriors lost three straight games to Cleveland in the NBA Finals in June, but surviving the gauntlet of the regular season the way they have remains impressive. The streak is 16 games longer than the second-place Utah Jazz, who went 95 straight from 1997-99. ""It's one of the most impressive streaks that I can think of in my experience in the NBA,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said before the game. KD STRUGGLES Durant missed 14 of his first 17 shots, many of them open looks that he normally knocks down. He went 3 for 5 in the fourth quarter, getting some encouragement from Curry along the way. ""My energy was low because I was feeling sorry for myself,"" Durant said. ""But I can't do that, you know? I'm 10 years in the league and I've got to wake up sometimes when I get down on myself. It's just part of the game. I'm going to miss shots. I'm going to miss layups. I'm going to make mistakes. Just keep fighting. My teammates encouraged me all night and it was much-needed."" REUNITED Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau has been friends with Warriors assistant Ron Adams for more than two decades. Adams worked under Thibodeau in Chicago, and the Wolves coach said that when he got the job in Minnesota this summer he called Adams and ""begged him"" to leave Golden State and join him. ""They have such a great organization that I knew it was kind of tongue-in-cheek,"" Thibodeau said. ""I know how happy he is with the situation that he's in.""","400899800"
"PHOENIX -- Triple-doubles are nothing new to Tim Frazier. He had five with the Maine Red Claws, where he was D-League player of the year in 2015. Now he can add one with the New Orleans Pelicans, and that is a much bigger deal. Frazier had 14 points, a career-high 11 rebounds and 11 assists, helping the Pelicans rally from a 15-point second-half deficit to beat the Phoenix Suns 120-119 in overtime Sunday night, snapping a five-game losing streak. ""You just have to understand he is just a tough kid,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""That is what we really like about him. We ask him to do a lot of things. We ask him to do things that All-Star guards do, and he never says anything. He just goes out and gives us the effort."" Suns coach Earl Watson knew who deserved the credit for New Orleans' win. ""Tim Frazier, simple as that,"" Watson said. ""Tim Frazier changed the game and had a triple-double. Look at the plus-minus. He was plus-18. He was the biggest difference for their team."" The quiet Frazier, a third-year guard out of Penn State, acknowledged the performance ""is a great accomplishment."" ""It feels good but I am glad we got the win,"" he said. ""It wouldn't mean much without the win."" The victory for New Orleans came despite a 4-for-17 shooting performance by NBA scoring leader Anthony Davis. He finished with 14 points, 16 below his average, but grabbed 12 rebounds. ""That is why we have a team,"" Davis said. ""That is why we have other guys on the floor. Guys stepped up and made shots when I couldn't. That is good for us."" Eric Bledsoe scored 32 for the Suns. Tyson Chandler added 14 points and 21 rebounds, both season highs. Frazier made one of two free throws with 3.6 seconds left to put the Pelicans up 120-116. Jared Dudley sank a 3-pointer at the buzzer to make it a one-point final margin. Jrue Holiday hit four free throws in the final 14.3 seconds and scored 23 points for New Orleans. With the Pelicans up 119-116, Davis tipped Devin Booker's try for a tying 3-pointer. Frazier got the ball, was fouled and put the game out of reach when he hit the second of two free throws. The teams have gone to overtime in both meetings this season. Phoenix won 112-111 in New Orleans on Nov. 4. The Suns were trying for their second two-game winning streak of the season but once again couldn't hold a lead late. It's tough for the veteran Chandler on this extremely young team. ""I'm a competitor. I want to win,"" he said. ""These losses aren't easy on me."" Langston Galloway sank four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to help the Pelicans force overtime. Holiday's two free throws put New Orleans up 110-108 with 40.6 seconds to go in regulation, and Bledsoe tied it with a driving left-handed layup with 35.2 seconds left in the period. Phoenix had the last shot in regulation, but Bledsoe's long 3-pointer was off the mark. The Suns took the lead with an early 14-1 run and never trailed until the last 5 minutes of regulation. They led by 15 in the third quarter. FAST START Reggie Williams, signed by the Pelicans on Saturday, scored 11 quick points off the bench in the first half, including 3-of-3 shooting on 3-pointers, and finished with 17. It was the 201st game of Williams' career. He has played for Golden State, Charlotte, Oklahoma City and San Antonio. Williams had been playing for the Oklahoma City Blue D-League team.

"LOS ANGELES -- Carmelo Anthony was thrilled when several Knicks took turns hitting big shots while they held off the Lakers. He can see New York embracing the teamwork and syncopated speed necessary to run coach Jeff Hornacek's offense effectively. The Lakers had a similar rhythm going, and now they've lost it. Kristaps Porzingis had 26 points and 12 rebounds, Derrick Rose scored 25 in his return from injury and the Knicks beat Los Angeles 118-112 Sunday night for their sixth win in seven games. Brandon Jennings scored 15 of his season high-tying 19 points in the fourth quarter as the Knicks moved a season-best four games over .500 (14-10) with a dynamic effort in the final minutes, capped by Rose's jumper with 19.4 seconds left. ""As you can see, different guys stepped up at different times,"" said Anthony, who had 13 points on 4-of-16 shooting and hit a key late jumper. ""We're just trusting one another and believing in what we're doing, in our schemes, defensively and offensively. Guys are feeling confident when they get the ball to make plays for themselves and others. We need that as a team. We need that confidence."" Porzingis has been feeling discomfort in his right knee, but the Latvian big man shook it off for another impressive effort that included seven blocked shots, tying his career high. His defense didn't prevent the Lakers from putting up a 37-point fourth quarter, but the Knicks scored enough to hang on. The Lakers had a narrow lead in the fourth quarter before Jennings went off, hitting back-to-back 3-pointers and threading a slick pass to Courtney Lee for a three-point play to put the Knicks up 97-89 with 6:46 left. ""It's just trust,"" Jennings said. ""I just try to bring as much energy to it as I can."" Lou Williams scored 24 points in his latest big game off the bench for the sliding Lakers, who lost their sixth straight despite the return of D'Angelo Russell and Nick Young. Luol Deng set season highs with five 3-pointers and 22 points, but Los Angeles (10-16) hasn't won in December. FRESH ROSE Rose went 12 for 16 after missing two games with a back injury, capping the effort with that cool 10-footer after the Lakers got within four. The Knicks have won four straight on the road after a 1-6 start away from Madison Square Garden. ""I've been trying to catch a rhythm for like a minute,"" Rose said. ""It's slowly coming."" NO D The Lakers' solid offense can't overcome a defense that was the NBA's fourth-worst before allowing 118 points to the Knicks. ""It's embarrassing, and it's embarrassing because we have too many good defenders and athletic guys on this team to be this bad on the defensive end,"" forward Julius Randle said. ""We can be a lot better, and we will be a lot better. It's just frustrating right now."" THEY'RE BACK Russell and Young returned to boost the Lakers, who had been without their usual starting backcourt since late November. Russell had missed 12 of the Lakers' last 13 games with soreness in his left knee, while Young missed seven of the past nine with a strained calf. Russell had three points on 1-of-8 shooting in 18 minutes, with Lakers coach Luke Walton strictly limiting his playing time. Young was right back to his usual swaggering self, scoring 12 points in the first half and finishing with 15 in 20 similarly restricted minutes. Both expect to play Monday in Sacramento. ""I felt good,"" Russell said. ""Definitely out of rhythm, but it was cool."" TIP-INS Knicks: They made their second stop on a five-game road trip that began with a narrow win at Sacramento. ...

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Paul George and Myles Turner were determined to end Indiana's recent woes against Charlotte. George and Turner scored 22 points each to lead the Pacers to a 110-94 win over the Hornets on Monday night,  snapping Indiana's four-game losing streak against Charlotte in the regular season. ""We knew this team has kicked us in the past, four or five times, so we wanted to come out here and send a message,"" Turner said. ""We were so connected in the first quarter on defense and it just carried over to the rest of the game."" Jeff Teague had 16 points, 11 assists and five rebounds, and Rodney Stuckey added 14 points for the Pacers, who have won two straight since returning home from a five-game road trip. Marco Belinelli scored 14 points for the Hornets, Marvin Williams and Nicolas Batum each had 13 and Kemba Walker added 12. C.J. Miles made the go ahead 3-pointer with 5.6 seconds remaining in the third quarter to start an 11-1 run by the Pacers. It gave Indiana a 76-73 lead and Stuckey's two free throws with 8:56 to play put the Pacers ahead 84-74. The Hornets had a short spurt in the fourth as Frank Kaminsky made a 3-pointer and Jeremy Lamb scored on a fast break layup to make it 87-82 with 7:03 left. But Turner's 3 with 1:12 put the Pacers ahead 103-92 to seal it for Indiana. At the start of the game, George appeared to pick up from where he left off on Saturday when he scored 37 points in the Pacers' 118-111 win over Portland. He started the game with a 3-pointer and a flashy, turnaround jumper, but never went off to help Indiana pull away until the fourth quarter when he scored three times, including a basket to give the Pacers a nine-point lead. Mostly it was a game of runs. Turner and Glenn Robinson III made back-to-back 3s in the first quarter to help Indiana get off to a good start. Later Turner hit another 3-pointer and Thaddeus Young scored on a layup to put the Pacers ahead 20-10 with 3:20 to go in the first before the Hornets went on a 9-0 run to get back within a point. ""When you're down, you have to stick to the game plan and keep playing,"" Batum said. ""You can't give up. We did it a couple of times. We almost got the lead and when we get the lead we just have to keep it.""

Pacers: George and Turner each had five rebounds. . Stuckey left the game in the fourth quarter with a left knee contusion . G Monta Ellis was out with a sore groin. A HOMECOMING OF SORTS Hornets center Cody Zeller, who attended Indiana University and is a native of the Hoosier state, received a warm welcome from fans during pregame introductions. The welcome wasn't quite the same for Roy Hibbert when he checked into the game late in the first quarter. Hibbert, who played for the Pacers for seven seasons from 2008-15, was met with scattered boos when he entered the lineup. The jeers were noticeably louder when he first got the ball, though his hook-shot in the middle of a 9-0 run in the first quarter quieted fans. FIRST QUARTER SPARK Hibbert actually created a bit of a spark off the bench in the first quarter. He set a screen twice for Belinelli that cleared him for open baskets, including one he was fouled on before he completed the and-one. Then Hibbert made back-to-back shots, including one to get the Hornets within a point.","400899803"
"TORONTO --  Terrence Ross helped the Toronto Raptors put a stop to the Milwaukee Bucks' comeback effort. After seeing Milwaukee cut a 26-point deficit to just 10 after three quarters, the reserve swingman scored the first seven points of the fourthto key a 14-2 run and the Raptors pulled away for a 122-100 win Monday night. It was the Raptors' sixth straight victory over the Bucks, and their 12th win in the last 13 meetings. ""We had to pick up our intensity,"" Ross said after finishing with a season-high 25 points. ""They made their push, they made their run just like everybody else is going to do, and we had to come back and make ours, and I think the second unit helped do that."" While DeMar DeRozan led the way with 30 points in the victory, the Raptors benefited from strong shooting from throughout the lineup. Toronto shot 50.6 percent from the field and 56 percent from 3-point range, improving to 7-1 this season when they shoot 50 percent or better from the field. While acknowledging the contributions of Ross, Toronto coach Dwane Casey tipped his cap to the play of point guard Kyle Lowry, who had 18 points and seven assists, for finding the team's shooters in stride. ""Kyle's doing a good job when they're trying to blitz him and kicking it out and guys are making shots,"" Casey said. ""Like I've always said when we were struggling shooting, it's a make-or-miss league and guys are doing a good job stepping into them with conviction and taking good shots."" After losing a third straight game, Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd was less than impressed. Though Giannis Antetokonmpo had 30 points, his fourth 30-point game of the season, Kidd watched as his team missed its first 13 3-point attempts and finish the game shooting 16.7 percent from beyond the arc. After briefly having a lead, Milwaukee gave it up at the 2:52 mark and never came close again. Kidd said his team had made it too easy for one of the NBA's best teams. ""It was easy the whole night, no matter 3s, layups, (the Raptors) were in character the whole night from the start,"" he said. ""We weren't, we just didn't put up any resistance, our defense was non-existent."" And while seeing DeRozan getting 30 points is hardly new -- it was his 12th such game this season -- Jabari Parker, who had 27, said his team shouldn't be letting a player like Ross burn them. ""You can let other players get their rhythm still, but him, nothing against him, we can't let the wild card get us like that,"" he said. TIP-INS Bucks: Despite making 10 or more 3-pointers in their last three games, Milwaukee was held to just 4 of 24 from beyond the arc by Toronto. ... Bucks rookie Thon Maker, who played high-school basketball in nearby Orangeville, Ontario, played his first professional game in Canada, finishing with three points and three rebounds. ... The Bucks continued their strong play in the paint. Averaging 49.2 points per game coming into the game, good for second in the league, Milwaukee had 54 points in the paint on Monday. Raptors: The Raptors improved to 10-3 against Eastern Conference opponents this season, with all three losses coming against Cleveland. ...  Toronto scored at least 100 points for the 11th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA. THE CURSE OF VINCE CARTER ""I don't know, man. I'm telling you, I started calling it the curse of Vince Carter. Nobody's allowed to do 2-foot windmills in the ACC until he retires, I'm guessing."" -- Ross on rimming out on a wide-open dunk with 8:17 to play in the game. LOU WHO? With four 3-pointers, Lowry set a new franchise record by hitting at least three from beyond the arc for the ninth consecutive game. The previous record was eight, set by his former teammate Lou Williams from March 27th to April 11th, 2015. STATISTICAL ANOMALY? ""It is a good example of sometimes how analytics don't tell the entire story. It gives you a hint but doesn't tell the entire story because if you can explain to me how we can shoot the ball and score as well as Golden State that would be a good essay."" -- Casey after being told that the Raptors and Warriors share the NBA lead for offensive efficiency with a rating of 114.2 points per 100 possessions.","400899804"
"MIAMI --  Goran Dragic sat out almost the entire third quarter after picking up his fourth foul, and that's when the Miami Heat saw control of yet another game start to slip away. Dragic made sure that was a temporary problem. He scored 13 of his season-high 34 points in the fourth quarter, and Miami beat the Washington Wizards 112-101 to snap a five-game losing streak. ""We want him to make a lot of plays for our team,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We have great confidence in him. I think he's really comfortable right now and we want to keep him in this place. He's driving so much of what we're doing right now offensively."" Dragic made 14 of 23 shots, helping Miami kick off a six-game homestand with a win. The Heat outscored Washington by 26 points when he was on the floor, and were outscored by 15 when he was on the bench. ""We had a meeting and said this is our chance,"" Dragic said. ""We go on a run, we put together some good games and win a couple in a row, this is a big opportunity for us to show we can play."" Hassan Whiteside had 17 points and 16 rebounds and James Johnson scored 14 off the bench for Miami, which won for only the third time in 11 games at home. John Wall scored 30 points and Bradley Beal added 29 for Washington, which is 0-2 against Miami this season. ""It's just a tough loss for us because we battled hard throughout the game,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""A couple breaks here and there we probably could have won the game."" Miami led 59-53 at the half, after making 10 consecutive shots late in the second quarter. Dragic went 4 for 4 in that stretch, plus assisted on two others. But he picked up his third foul -- a call he didn't like -- with 38 seconds left in the half, then got his fourth early in the third quarter. When he went to the bench, Miami was up nine. But a 23-7 Wizards run later in the third gave Washington a five-point edge, and it was a one-point game going into the fourth when Dragic returned. ""He got a lot of easy looks,"" Beal said. ""We were trying to figure out what we wanted to do with him. ... I have to give credit where it is due. He was shooting the ball well and he played well tonight."" TIP-INS Wizards: Beal made two 3-pointers, giving him 496 in his career. He's about to become the third Wizards player to make 500 3's, joining Gilbert Arenas and Antawn Jamison. ... Washington plans to evaluate F Ian Mahinmi (right knee) in the coming days. Mahinmi has missed 22 of the Wizards' 23 games. Heat: Dragic's 34 were a high for his Heat tenue. ... James Johnson (right shoulder) returned after sitting out four games. Luke Babbitt (right hip) was cleared to return, but did not play. Dion Waiters (groin) remains out. WINSLOW UPDATE Heat forward Justise Winslow missed his 16th game with a sore left wrist. ""He's getting better. He's doing more court work each day,"" Spoelstra said. BEAL AND WALL In four games where the Wizards didn't have both Beal and Wall, they averaged 94 points. In 19 games with both in the lineup, they've averaged 106.","400899805"
"HOUSTON -- The Houston Rockets overcame their inability to make defensive stops by running over the Brooklyn Nets on the offensive end. James Harden had 36 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds to lead the Rockets to their seventh straight win, 122-118 over the Nets on Monday night. ""There's 82 games -- every game isn't going to be perfect,"" Harden said. ""You've got to figure out ways to win, and that's what we did tonight."" Eric Gordon scored 24 points on 6-for-10 shooting on 3-pointers, and Ryan Anderson added 19.for the Rockets. Houston shot 17 for 43 on 3s, making at least 10 for an NBA-record 24th straight game. Brook Lopez scored 26 points and Sean Kilpatrick added 17 for the Nets. ""They made some plays and we didn't,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It could've gone either way."" Jeremy Lin returned to action for Brooklyn for the first time since Nov. 2 when he suffered a strained left hamstring. Although Lin did not start, he played 20 minutes off the bench, scoring 10 points. Atkinson said Lin's presence on the court helped Brooklyn's offense by keeping the team organized and said he was glad Lin didn't try to do too much following a five-week absence. ""I felt a lot better than I thought I would with my wind, but I struggled with the rhythm,"" Lin said. ""The shots, the feel and getting back out there -- you practice all these shots, but I got in there and it felt like I was shooting a football."" Brooklyn trailed for much of the game until Joe Harris tied it at 118 with a layup with less than 40 seconds remaining. Gordon gave Houston a two-point lead with a free throw with 11.9 seconds left, and the Rockets came up with a key steal on the ensuing inbound pass. Gordon then made two more from the line and the Rockets held on for the win. ""We were just lackadaisical,"" Gordon said. ""Luckily, we made some plays in the end that helped us win. We definitely need a wake-up call, but we know what we need to do. It's good that we get a win, but there's all the little things that we need to do to be a better team."" The Rockets improved to 7-0 in December while knocking Brooklyn down to 1-5 in the month. The Nets haven't won on the road since Nov. 12. Houston outscored Brooklyn by five in each of the first two quarters to take a 53-43 lead at the half. Brooklyn cut the lead to five to start the fourth quarter. ""I think we can look at ourselves in the mirror and say individually we could have done a better job, and as a team, we could have done a better job, too,"" Anderson said. TIP-INS Nets: C Justin Hamilton missed his second straight game with migraines. Atkinson said he will be reevaluated in a few days. ... The Nets scored 42 points in the third quarter, the team's most points in a quarter this season. Rockets: Houston allowed 68 points in the paint, a season high for their opponents. ... Harden passed Eric ""Sleepy"" Floyd (2,363 assists) for seventh on the franchise's all-time assists list. ... Trevor Ariza had three steals and two blocks for Houston. COVERING LOPEZ The Rockets struggled to contain Brook Lopez for the entire game. Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni switched gears and let veteran center Nene play 24 minutes off the bench and starting center Clint Capela less than 19 minutes. When asked if Nene was a better matchup for Lopez than Capela, D'Antoni didn't hesitate. ""Much better, much better,"" D'Antoni said. ""Nene's more experienced, more bulk. Clint will learn through this stuff, and Brook is a very good offensive player, really good offensive player. They all had their hands full with him."" WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME Until he came up with his only rebound of the game with less than 16.9 seconds remaining, Lopez was nearly held without a rebound for the first time since March 26, 2011, when he went without a rebound in 31 minutes against Atlanta. ""I need to be more aggressive getting to the glass,"" Lopez said. ""I'm not trying to make any excuses -- I need to do better in that category."" HONORING SCOLA Nets forward Luis Scola, who played with Houston from 2007-12, was honored by the Rockets after the first quarter as part of the team's celebration of its 50th season. A video tribute featuring interviews from Yao Ming, Tracy McGrady and Shane Battier was played and Scola was given an ovation when shown on the videoboard.","400899806"
"DALLAS --  Wesley Matthews and the Dallas Mavericks have a long way to go to recover from a miserable start plagued by injuries. Consecutive home wins for the first time and a .500 record over six games are a start. Matthews scored 25 points and the last-place Mavericks enjoyed a rare blowout, beating the listless Denver Nuggets 112-92 on Monday night. Harrison Barnes had 18 points for the Mavericks (6-18), who led 65-43 at the break. They expanded the margin to a season-high 28 points in the third quarter on the way to their second win in three games since a 31-point home loss to Sacramento that prompted a team meeting. ""That's how we're supposed to play,"" said Matthews, who finished a point shy of the season high he reached in three of the previous five games. ""Now it's just about harnessing that, trying to get a string and run off a couple of wins."" The Nuggets were finishing a season-long six-game road trip and played like it, shooting 42 percent with their starters getting outscored 80-37. Backup center Nikola Jokic led Denver with a season-high 27 points and 11 rebounds. Denver missed a chance to split the six-game trip, instead losing for the eighth time in 11 games. Emmanuel Mudiay scored 17 points and Danilo Gallinari had 12 points. ""Very disappointed,"" coach Michael Malone said after bursting through the locker room door, causing it to slam loudly into a wall. ""Not just in the loss, but how we played. It's a bad loss for us."" The NBA's worst-shooting team coming in at 41.5 percent, Dallas shot 65 percent in the first half and a season-high 58 percent for the game. The Mavericks were 12 of 26 from 3-point range after missing six of their first seven. It was the best showing for an offense still missing star forward Dirk Nowitzki (strained right Achilles tendon), starting center Andrew Bogut (right knee injury) and key backup guard J.J. Barea (left calf strain). ""We won't go away,"" said second-year player Justin Anderson, who provided a spark with 11 points and six rebounds. ""We are not going to get down. We are going to continue to build off this."" Matthews was 10 of 14 from the field and hit his first five 3-point attempts before finishing 5 of 7. He even made long-range shots that didn't count, hitting a desperation shot from about 30 feet after a shot-clock buzzer in the fourth quarter. It was the third game in four nights for the Mavericks, but two were at home and all three in Texas. And they showed plenty of energy, taking a 10-2 lead in the first five minutes and never trailing. ANOTHER CAREER NIGHT Undrafted Dallas rookie Dorian Finney-Smith had career highs in points and rebounds for the second straight home game, finishing with 13 points and nine boards three nights after getting 12 and eight in a win over Indiana. QUIET NIGHT FOR LOCALS It was a quiet night for Mudiay, who played high school basketball in the area, and Dallas high school product Darrell Arthur. Mudiay was a minus-20 despite his scoring total, and Arthur was pulled 4 1/2 minutes into the game and didn't return. All Malone would say after the game was that Arthur wasn't hurt. TIP-IN Nuggets: Jokic scored 23 of Denver's 49 second-half points. He had his third double-double in the past four games. ... Jamal Murray scored 15 points. ... Denver gave up 40 points in the paint in the first half. Mavericks: C Salah Mejri had three blocks , one more than his season high, in the first four minutes. He finished with four, two off his career high. ... Previous high for a half was 63 in the second half of a 130-121 overtime loss at Indiana in the season opener.","400899807"
"LOS ANGELES --  J.J. Redick came through at the free-throw line in the closing seconds to help the Los Angeles Clippers pull out a win in a game that saw the teams trade leads until the final minutes. Blake Griffin had 26 points and 12 rebounds, Chris Paul had 21 points and 14 assists, and the Clippers held off the Portland Trail Blazers 121-120 Monday night to sweep the three-game season series. Redick finished with 19 points, hitting all eight of his free throws -- including three in the final seconds to push Los Angeles' lead to four points. Portland's Damian Lillard hit a 3-pointer with 1.7 seconds left for the final margin. ""It was an up-and-down game, back and forth,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""Each team made not big runs, but little runs and that was kind of the ebb and flow of the game."" The final minutes saw Clippers center DeAndre Jordan and Blazers forward Evan Turner ejected. Portland center Mason Plumlee was hit with a technical after he elbowed Griffin on a drive in his face, causing a cut on his upper lip that needed three stitches after the game. That only highlighted what was a roughly played game throughout. ""I'm sure there is no love lost,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We play each other a lot and whenever you play each other a lot it seems like you get testy. We don't really care if you like us or not."" Paul was also charged with a flagrant foul. ""It's just competition,"" Paul said. ""Guys out there fighting and trying to get a win and stuff happens."" Paul hit a three-pointer with just over 2 minutes to play, and later added a pair of free throws to give the Clippers a 118-113 lead with 18 seconds to play. But the Blazers responded again, Lillard hit a pair of free throws himself. After Lillard's last 3 the Clippers ran out the clock. ""It was probably our most competitive game of the year,"" Stotts said. ""It was a tough loss but I like the way we competed throughout the game. We got down and came back. It was a very good effort."" C.J. McCollum had 25 points and Lillard finished with 24 points and eight assists for the Trail Blazers, who lost their fourth straight -- all on the road. ""The way we played tonight is the way we're supposed to play,"" Lillard said. ""This is what gives us our best chance against good teams, like they are. It's what we've kind of been missing on a consistent basis. We did a good job but lost the game. We want to win."" The Clippers acted like they were going to dominate early, jumping out to a 38-27 lead at the end of the first quarter. They connected on 14 of 22 field goals (63.6 percent), came up with four blocked shots and outscored Portland 14-4 to close the quarter. But Portland charged back in the second, opening with a 13-2 run and then just kept rolling. The Blazers outscored the Clippers 33-18 in the second quarter to take a 60-56 lead at the half. ""I thought we did a great job early being an aggressor and then somewhere we lost it, but down the stretch the guys made plays,"" Griffin said. A PLUM ADDITION The 6-11 Plumlee had a strong game, finishing with 18 points, seven rebounds and five blocked shots. TECHNICAL AFFAIR Stotts also picked up a technical when he objected to foul called against McCollum on a three-point attempt with 4:14 left. Redick hit all four free throws. ""No comment,"" was all Stotts offered. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: F Al-Farouq Aminu (back contusion) was called a game-time decision, but started against the Clippers. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Luke Walton will back his players every time, and when no whistle came as DeMarcus Cousins took down Julius Randle early in the game the new Lakers coach got crazy mad. As in having to be held back as he made his way to midcourt before a pair of technical fouls in succession led to an ejection -- two of seven total Ts in a testy game. ""I just felt like I needed to stand up for my guys,"" Walton said. ""I felt like what happened on the floor wasn't right and my only concern is our guys and the locker room and our team. If I feel like something's not right I'm going to stand up for my guys."" Cousins had 31 points, 16 rebounds, five assists and three blocks, and the Sacramento Kings used a big third quarter to send slumping Los Angeles to a seventh straight defeat with a 116-92 win Monday night. After five straight points by Cousins during one sequence, Darren Collison hit consecutive 3-pointers late in the third as the Kings outscored the Lakers 39-13 in the quarter on the way to just their second victory in seven games. Collison wound up with 20 points. Walton was ejected at the 4:14 mark of the first quarter, and he had to be held back by his players. Randle sure appreciated it. ""Ahh, I love my coach, man,"" Randle said. ""That's my guy. He backs me up with everything. He has all of our backs 100 percent."" Randle also received a T on the play and associate head coach Brian Shaw took over. D'Angelo Russell, Shaw, Cousins and Lou Williams also had technicals. The Lakers got Russell and Nick Young back for Sunday's 118-112 home loss to the Knicks, but their minutes were limited again Monday. Russell scored 17 points while Jordan Clarkson and Williams contributed 15 and 14 points, respectively, off the bench. Young had eight points as Los Angeles lost for the eighth time in nine games. The Lakers played the second game of a back-to-back while kicking off a seven-game, 13-day road trip. ""I thought guys grabbed each other and came out in the third with a lot of energy against a team playing the second night of a back-to-back,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Russell had missed 12 of 13 games with left knee soreness and Young returned after sitting out seven of nine with a strained calf. This was already the Lakers' second visit to new Golden 1 Center, where they won 101-91 on Nov. 10 after trailing by 19 in the second quarter. ""I felt like for the first time this season we kind of gave in, we gave up, which is disheartening because our group has been very resilient all year long,"" Walton said. Kings guard Ben McLemore was helped off the court with a bruised left quadriceps at the 7:35 mark of the first quarter after getting a knee on Mozgov's screen. He didn't return. WALTON'S SUPPORTING CAST As Walton experiences the bumps and losing streaks, he has leaned on old boss Steve Kerr of the Warriors, Phil Jackson and even his dad, Bill. He also is so thankful to have Shaw on his staff -- he mentioned it before the game and ejection -- since he has been through it all as a head coach. ""We're all in it together and we're taking accountability in leading as well,"" Walton said. TIP-INS Lakers: Walton increased his technical total to three and the Lakers had six in all. ... Los Angeles is 4-10 on the road. Kings: Cousins had his 10th 30-point game. ... F Rudy Gay headed to the locker room 3:50 before halftime with a hip flexor. ...

"CLEVELAND -- Kevin Love scored 29 points, J.R. Smith found his aim -- for one half -- and LeBron James added 23 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers won their fifth straight, 103-86 on Tuesday night over the Memphis Grizzlies. Memphis rested center Marc Gasol for the first of back-to-back games against the defending NBA champions. Smith, who has been in a season-long shooting slump, scored 17 of his 23 points in the first half as the Cavs, who gave star point guard Kyrie Irving the night off, built a 22-point lead and ended the Grizzlies' six-game winning streak. Zach Randolph replaced Gasol in the starting lineup and scored 18 points to lead the Grizzlies. The reigning Western Conference player of the week, Gasol is expected to play Wednesday in Memphis to complete a brutal three-game stretch for the Grizzlies, who beat Golden State by 21 on Saturday. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said after the game that James, Love and Irving will not travel for the game Wednesday. Cleveland will start Smith, DeAndre Liggins, Iman Shumpert, James Jones and Tristan Thompson. Smith came in shooting a career-low 31 percent from the field and 32 percent on 3s, the lowest mark since his rookie season with New Orleans in 2004. He also has been slowed by a sore left knee, which he hyperextended last week, causing him to miss two games. Smith got it going early, dropping four 3-pointers in the first half. His fourth put the Cavs ahead 56-34, and he was 6 of 8 at halftime. He missed his first six shots in the third quarter and finished 8 of 17 -- 6 of 10 on 3s. Cleveland seemed disinterested after halftime and Memphis managed to stay within striking distance, but the Grizzlies didn't have enough firepower without Gasol and Mike Conley, who is expected to miss another month with a back injury. The Grizzlies were still within eight when James scored on a layup and hit a cutting Love for an easy bucket to make it 90-74 with 5:11 left. TIP-INS Grizzlies: G/F Vince Carter returned after missing seven games with a right hip flexor strain. He played 18 minutes. ... Memphis coach David Fizdale was an assistant in Miami the four years James was with the Heat. ""He coached me more than I coached him,"" said Fizdale, who got a big hug from James before the opening tip. ""You're talking about a one percentile guy when it comes to basketball intelligence. I think I learned more from him than he learned from me.""... Memphis is 12-0 this season in games decided by five points or less. Cavaliers: James needs 28 points to pass Moses Malone (27,409) for eighth place on the career scoring list. ... In Saturday's win over Charlotte, James became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1968 to score 44 points and get 10 assists, nine rebounds and shoot 70 percent. ... With his 3-pointer in the first, Love became the fifth active player with 800 career 3s and 6,000 rebounds. James, Carmelo Anthony, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce are the others. ... Channing Frye was back after missing two games for his father's funeral. ... Smith passed Dale Ellis (1,719) for 14th on the career 3-pointer list.","400899810"
"ATLANTA -- Elfrid Payton had the best night of his career. Even better, he did it on a night when the entire Orlando roster met coach Frank Vogel's mandate. ""Coach has been on us over the past month or so about making the extra pass, making plays for others,"" Payton said. ""We did a good job of that."" Serge Ibaka scored 29 points, Payton reached career highs with 26 points and 14 assists and the Orlando Magic snapped a three-game losing streak with a 131-120 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night. Orlando began the night ranked 29th in scoring and played without center Nikola Vucevic, but it got big production from the bench. Payton, Jodie Meeks and Jeff Green combined for 62 points, while starting guard Evan Fournier scored 23. Dwight Howard had 20 points and 16 rebounds and Dennis Schroder had 19 points and 13 assists for the Hawks, who thought they were on a good trajectory after rallying from 20 points down in last Friday's win at Milwaukee. Atlanta began the night having won two straight since a 1-10 stretch dropped them out of the top eight spots in the Eastern Conference. The Hawks were 9-2 and tied for the East lead before the slump. ""It's just a tough pill to swallow right now,"" guard Tim Hardaway Jr. said. ""Defensively, they made a lot of tough shots. It was just that type of night. Give them credit, man. They were knocking down their open shots, knocking down their tough shots."" Thabo Sefolosha's 18-footer at the 4:18 mark of the third quarter gave the Hawks their first lead since the first quarter, but Payton answered with a 3 and Orlando never trailed again. ""We tightened the screws on the defensive end during that stretch,"" Vogel said. ""We forced a lot of misses, held them to one shot and we were able to get the offense back under control."" The Magic set season highs in points, assists with 36 and 3-pointers with 15. They had 21 assists and zero turnovers until committing two miscues in the final 44 seconds of the second quarter. Orlando took charge with a 20-9 run in the second quarter that ended with Fournier's short turnaround jumper to make it 72-60. Payton combined with Fournier and Ibaka to score 46 points on 20-for-27 shooting in the first half. ""You can always find things you can do better, but a lot of those guys had pretty special nights,"" Hawks guard Kyle Korver said. MAYBE TOMORROW Vucevic, Orlando's leading rebounder and third-leading scorer, missed his second straight game with a sore lower back. He hopes to be back in Wednesday's home game against the Los Angeles Clippers. ""It depends,"" he said. ""At the moment when the pain happens, it bothers me a lot."" TIP-INS Magic: The last time they scored over 131 on the road was Jan. 13, 2009 at Sacramento. ...

"CHICAGO -- Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau got a loud ovation during pregame introductions before his first game back in Chicago, and his Timberwolves made it a triumphant return. Zach LaVine scored 24 points, Andrew Wiggins added 23 and Minnesota rallied to beat the Bulls 99-94 on Tuesday night. The Timberwolves wiped out a 21-point deficit and got Thibodeau a victory in his first game in Chicago since the Bulls fired him in an acrimonious split in 2015. ""There were far more great times than there were real problem times,"" Thibodeau said. ""In the end, it didn't end great, but most of the time things were good. I'm proud of what our team did. I loved being here and that's how I look at it."" Gorgui Dieng and Karl-Anthony Towns each scored 16 points, and the Timberwolves snapped a four-game losing streak. Jimmy Butler led Chicago with 27 points, and Robin Lopez added 14. But the Bulls continued a pattern of letdowns against losing teams, this time falling to one that came in tied for the NBA's worst record. And, of course, they lost to their former coach. ""There wasn't really any emotions, it was just about trying to get a win,"" Chicago's Taj Gibson said. ""Trying to keep them down. That's a struggling team."" That wasn't what the Timberwolves expected when they hired Thibodeau. After all, the Bulls went 255-139 and made the playoffs in all five of his seasons, including a run to the 2011 Eastern Conference finals with MVP Derrick Rose leading the way. ""I know what these guys are doing in there,"" Thibodeau said. ""I know what I'm doing in there. And that's all that matters. If we're doing each and everything you can do every day, that's all that matter."" BIG RALLY The Timberwolves looked like they were going to get blown out, down 38-22 after the first quarter and trailing by 21 in the second. Instead, they closed the half on a 22-5 run to pull within four. Minnesota was leading 91-87 in the game's closing minutes when Butler threw down an alley-oop dunk off a feed from Dwyane Wade in transition and nailed a fadeaway jumper off a steal to tie it with 1:34 remaining. Wiggins then hit a pullup jumper and LaVine scored on a reverse layup to make it 95-91 with 52 seconds left. Wade picked up two technical fouls and was ejected with 14.1 seconds left after his driving layup was blocked by LaVine. Butler also got called for a foul on the play. It all led to Ricky Rubio hitting two technical free throws and LaVine making two foul shots to make it 99-91, sealing the win for Minnesota. ""It was frustration and I told the truth, so I got kicked out,"" Wade said. QUOTABLE ""I feel like we're good enough to have those results. We've been in every game. We were winning or really close throughout almost every game that we've played, so it shows that record could be flipped. There are a lot of games we should have won."" -- LaVine on the Timberwolves' expectations. TIP-INS Timberwolves: The Timberwolves had allowed at least 100 points in nine straight games. ...

"NEW ORLEANS -- Draymond Green irritated the other team, nearly started a fight, ignited a torrent of boos from opposing fans -- and backed it up with an all-around performance punctuated by a clutch defensive play in the final seconds. In other words, it was a typical performance for the Warriors' feisty forward. Green recorded his 15th-career triple-double with 12 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, and it was the last of his four steals -- against star Anthony Davis, no less -- that helped the Golden State Warriors hold off the New Orleans Pelicans 113-109 on Tuesday night. ""I love playing defense, so when it comes to a situation where you've got to get a stop to win the game, I enjoy that moment,"" Green said of his steal, which he executed while the Warriors held a tenuous 111-109 lead. Davis, who had 28 points, five blocks and two steals, was furious that officials deemed Green's steal a clean play and drew a technical foul for disputing the officials' decision. There was contact between the two players, but Green said Davis initiated it. ""I hit the ball as he was trying to throw his shoulder into me. I thought it was really clean,"" said Green, who also noted that he wasn't worried about the risk of putting Davis on the foul line if officials had seen it differently. ""We're up two (at the time) and we've got three of the greatest scorers in the world,"" he said, referring to Stephen Curry, who had a game-high 30 points, Kevin Durant, who scored 27 and Klay Thompson, who added 17 points. Davis' disappointment was evident in his eyes as he largely avoided discussing the play -- a wise move if he didn't want to make headlines or draw a fine for criticizing officials. When asked to describe what happened, Davis said he was ""trying to score,"" and then waited in silence for the next question. Earlier in the game, after Davis had rejected Green's shot, the two bumped one another and appeared to exchange words while fans bombarded Green with boos. Later, when Green was rejected by Alexis Ajinca, the crowd went wild. But was Green was able to celebrate Golden State's 13th road win in 15 games away from home. DURANT'S DEFENSE For all his scoring on an array of shots that ranged from a driving dunk to a 3-pointer, Durant's happiest moment seemed to be when he was lying on the floor, pumping his fist, moments after he'd blocked Davis' driving shot with 34 seconds left. ""That whole possession, I was telling myself I wanted to make a huge play,"" Durant said. ""I was excited I was able to get over there and help the team out in another way besides making a shot. It was definitely fun. I was in the moment."" COMMANDING RESPECT Curry hit five of Golden State's 14 made 3-pointers, but one shot that stood out was a 22-footer from the right side. As the shot fell through, Curry reached back toward the New Orleans bench and got a reluctant but respectful low-five from Pelicans associate head coach Darren Erman, a former Warriors assistant. Right as Curry was pulling up, he said he could hear Erman trying to encourage New Orleans' defense by saying, ""If he makes it, it's a good shot."" ""So I wanted a little praise for that good shot, and he gave it to me,"" Curry added. ""He was a good sport."" BOLD APPROACH For much of the game, the Pelicans sought to beat the Warriors at their own game, a seemingly counterintuitive approach for a team that has won just eight games. Instead, it produced one highlight after another on both ends of the floor, not to mention a highly competitive game. Langston Galloway scored 20 points, hitting five of New Orleans' 14 3s, but the Pelicans missed their final five shots from that range. Tim Frazier scored 13 points for the Pelicans, who led by as many as nine in the first half and by five early in the final period. But the Pelicans committed four of their 17 turnovers in the last 4 minutes and missed their last five 3-point attempts. ""We stopped making shots,"" Davis said. The Warriors ""didn't force anything and things were going in for them. I had my opportunities but didn't come through."" TIP-INS Warriors: Center JaVale McGee made his first start this season at center because regular starter Zaza Pachulia was missing his third straight game with a right wrist injury. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he inserted McGee instead of Kevon Loney, who'd started the previous game, because ""we're experimenting a bit and looking at a few different combinations."" McGee had nine points and five rebounds in 16 minutes. ... Kerr said Pachulia is scheduled to have an MRI performed on him Wednesday. Pelicans: Solomon Hill scored 12 points and Jrue Holiday 10. ... Terrence Jones grabbed 10 rebounds for the Pelicans.","400899813"
"PHOENIX -- Eric Bledsoe took over in overtime, and all Kristaps Porzingis could do was sit and watch. That was the difference in the Phoenix Suns' 113-111 victory over the New York Knicks on Tuesday night. Bledsoe scored the go-ahead points on a driving, left-handed layup with 30 seconds to play, the last of eight straight points for the Suns point guard in OT. ""Bledsoe is Bledsoe on the offensive end,"" Phoenix coach Earl Watson said. ""Twelve of 12 at the free-throw line, which is big-time, big-time baskets down the stretch, attacking the rim."" Porzingis scored 34 points for New York, one shy of his career high, before fouling out with 1:34 left in OT. Carmelo Anthony capped a 3-for-15 shooting night with an air ball that resulted in a 24-second clock violation with 5.9 seconds left. Devin Booker's two free throws with 5.2 seconds remaining boosted the lead to 113-110, and the Suns, coming off an overtime home loss to New Orleans on Sunday night, held on from there. New York's Derrick Rose didn't play in the second half due to back spasms. The game was intense and physical with six technical fouls, four against Phoenix. P.J. Tucker set the tone with his defense on Anthony. ""They got under (our skin), we got under theirs,"" Tucker said. ""It got real chippy. I love it when it gets like that."" Anthony, though, said ""it was more me than anything they were doing."" Kyle O'Quinn, who scored 22 points for New York, made the first free throw to cut the lead to 113-111 with 4 seconds left and purposely missed the second. Lance Thomas' tip attempt in a crowd didn't go, and Tucker grabbed the ball for Phoenix. Tucker missed two free throws with 1.2 seconds remaining, but it didn't matter in a victory that spoiled the return to Phoenix for Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek, who was fired as Suns coach 10 months ago. Tyson Chandler grabbed a season-best 23 rebounds for Phoenix, giving him 44 in his last two games. Rookie Marquese Chriss had 14 points, 12 rebounds and a soaring block of Justin Holiday's layup in overtime. The Suns led by as many as 14 in the third quarter. Neither team scored in the final 1:46 of regulation. ""Our bench guys did a nice job to get us back in the fourth quarter,"" Hornacek said, ""but we just couldn't finish it."" MINI-RUMBLE Four technical fouls and a flagrant-1 foul were called after a mini-rumble erupted in the third quarter. It began when Porzingis ran over Bledsoe, and then Chriss threw Porzingis to the floor. Porzingis got up and there was some shoving in a confrontation between the two teams. Chriss drew a flagrant-1 foul and a technical. Technicals also were called on Bledsoe, Porzingis and Brandon Jennings. A Knick fan behind the scorer's table was tossed for his heated reaction, aimed at Chriss, to the commotion. Watson didn't mind the 19-year-old Chriss' play at all. ""Marquese Chriss has to become our Draymond Green,"" Watson said. ""And I think he gave you an example or a flash of what that can be, as far as getting a flagrant, protecting his teammate. I have no problems with that. We need a presence on the court that brings fight to our team that is kind of contagious."" The incident seemed to get Porzingis going, too. The Knicks were glad to see the usually mild-mannered Latvian get so fired up. ""He needed it,"" Anthony said. ""Sometime people try to take advantage of his kindness and I thought it was getting a little bit too much out there for him and he reacted. We had his back out there."" TIP INST Knicks: New York had started 2-0 on a road trip of at least five games for the first time since February of 2003. ... Joakim Noah missed five consecutive free throws in the final 2:08 of the first half. Suns: Booker made a huge block of Anthony's shot in the third quarter, leading to Chandler's score at the other end. ... Alex Len sat out the game with a hip bruise. ... Booker has 1,490 points in his first 100 NBA games. In Suns history, only Walter Davis, Alvan Adams and Armon Gilliam scored more in that span.","400899814"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Damian Lillard called it a breakthrough. Coming off a one-point loss to the Clippers the night before, the Portland Trail Blazers snapped a four-game losing streak with a 114-95 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night. Lillard had 17 points and nine assists before sitting in the fourth quarter. Mason Plumlee added 18 points for the Blazers, who led by 26 points in Portland's first game back after a 1-4 road trip. Russell Westbrook was off his league-leading average of 31.1 points a game with 20 for the Thunder, who have lost two of their last three after a six-game winning streak. Westbrook also sat for the final quarter. Portland was coming off a 121-120 loss at Los Angeles on Monday night to extend the season's longest losing streak. ""We had a chance to win that game, but we came up short,"" Lillard said about the game against the Clippers. ""I think all of those things we went through, and then staying with it, and the build up, tonight felt like kind of a breakthrough from all those experiences."" The Thunder were without Victor Oladipo because of a right wrist sprain, forcing Oklahoma City's first starting lineup change of the season. Jerami Grant, acquired by the Thunder in a trade with Philadelphia at the start of the season, got his first start for Oklahoma City and finished with 11 points. ""I didn't think that we shot the ball particularly well today,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I thought that we had fairly decent looks, but we didn't shoot the ball well, and I thought some of that bled into our defense a little bit."" The Blazers didn't have Al-Farouq Aminu, who has a sore back, instead starting Noah Vonleh. But Vonleh got into foul trouble, collecting three in the first quarter. Westbrook's 3-pointer put the Thunder up 25-16 early, but Portland came back to take a 32-31 lead on Allen Crabbe's layup before the end of the first quarter. CJ McCollum made a three-quarter court shot, but he didn't beat the buzzer. Portland stretched the lead to 50-36 after Evan Turner's floater and free throw. The two sides exchanged words midway through the second quarter when Lillard reached down to pick up the ball at a timeout and Westbrook kicked it. Lillard closed out the half with a left-handed layup to make it 68-52. Plumlee's basket stretched Portland's lead to 90-65 late in the third quarter. Plumlee said he didn't feel Portland went through any lulls. ""Every time they made a 3 or they had two baskets in a row, we would get right back on defense, we would get a good shot on offense so we didn't let anything get out of control,"" he said. ""We didn't let anything snowball."" TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook drew the ire of fans when he forcefully threw the ball and it went into the seats. He was heartily booed when he touched the ball for the rest of the game. ... The Thunder were coming off a 99-96 victory at home over Boston on Sunday. Trail Blazers: C.C. Sabathia and Derek Jeter had courtside seats. ... Maurice Harkless had five steals, his most as a Blazer. ... Six Portland players finished in double figures. ALL ABOUT THE SHOES: In addition to being Star Wars Night at the Moda Center, the Blazers were celebrating the release of Lillard's new signature shoe, the Dame 3. Lillard wore an all-red version of the Adidas shoe, which will be released Wednesday, and the fans at the game were all treated to T-shirts emblazoned with Lillard's logo. NOT TALKING: Westbrook was asked to explain what happened with Lillard and the kicked ball: ""I don't know,"" he replied.","400899815"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan spent an off night in town at Villanova watching the best basketball team in the Philly area dominate in another victory. A night later, Lowry and DeRozan ditched the courtside seats to team up and keep Philadelphia the worst team in the NBA. DeRozan scored 31 points and Lowry added 20 to help the Toronto Raptors win their fourth straight game, 123-114 over the 76ers on Wednesday night. DeRozan continued to make the 30-point mark a routine part of his game and scored 31 points through the first three quarters. DeRozan posterized Jahlil Okafor with a dunk over the Sixers big man and easily rolled to his second straight 30-point game. He scored 30 points on Monday against Milwaukee and came in averaging a robust 27.9 points per game. ""It's just experience. My work ethic,"" DeRozan said. ""I just try and be better every single year."" He's having his best one yet. Lowry helped blow the game open in his Philadelphia homecoming. Lowry made a 3-pointer in the fourth that stretched the lead to 99-80 and earned some applause for the All-Star raised in the area. DeRozan and Lowry helped squash the Sixers' modest two-game winning streak. Long one of the NBA's worst teams, the Sixers haven't won three straight games since they took four in a row from Dec. 29, 2013-Jan. 4, 2014. Robert Covington led the Sixers with 26 points and Okafor had 17. The Sixers had won two straight on the road and seemed like they could win a rare game at home when they opened with a strong first 17 minutes. Lowry brought the Sixers crashing back to reality. Lowry buried two quick 3-pointers that brought the Raptors within two and scored on a driving layup that tied the game at 45-all. The Raptors turned a three-point deficit to open the second quarter into a 60-54 halftime lead. The Sixers went on a mini-run late in the fourth and got within five points with 30 seconds left. They could have used another 30 minutes to top the Atlantic Division-leading Raptors. The Raptors have won 10 of 11 games and are 11 games over .500 for the first time this season. Lowry dedicated the win to his mother on her birthday . ""I got as many points as her age,"" he said, laughing. TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry and DeRozan attended No. 1 Villanova's game on Tuesday night. Lowry, a Philly native who played at Villanova, wore a ""Just a Kid From North Philly"" sweatshirt at shootaround. ""He's a pain in the butt sometimes, but he's our pain in the butt,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. Casey said Lowry reminded him of former Seattle great Gary Payton. 76ers: Okafor started at center and Joel Embiid at power forward for the first time this season. They played the first 6 minutes of the first quarter together. Embiid and Okafor are natural centers. Coach Brett Brown decided the time was right to pair them and see what they could do together in the frontcourt. ""It's my job to grow our program, grow our guys, and see what we actually have,"" Brown said. ""We have really yet to see Jahlil and Joel together in any significant timeframe. Tonight, it's available. So I'm going to do it."" Embiid twisted his left ankle in warmups and sat out a stretch in the first half with a bloody nose and scored nine points. ""I was just standing, I wasn't moving, I was just standing on the perimeter,"" Embiid said. ""I wasn't active on defense."" DID YOU SEE THAT!? Embiid's lone block in the first half came when he charged at DeMarre Carroll and used his outstretched right hand to swat the ball away. DeRozan had the dunk of the night when he split defenders down the lane and stuffed one over Okafor. SHOE FITS No. 1 overall pick Ben Simmons ditched the walking boot and sat in sneakers on the Sixers bench for the first time this season.  Simmons has not played this season because of a broken bone in his right foot suffered during training camp. Simmons shot free throws in practice this week. The Sixers say there is no timetable for his return.","400899816"
"WASHINGTON -- After Kemba Walker's potentially tying 3-point try went around the rim and out at the buzzer of the Charlotte Hornets' third consecutive loss, the star guard and coach Steve Clifford agreed on this: The team needs to be more physical. ""Sooner or later, we've got to respond. We have to respond as a group or it's not going to get better,"" Clifford said. ""I'm sick of watching it, frankly."" John Wall and Bradley Beal combined for 19 of their 45 points in the third quarter, and the Wizards outrebounded the Hornets while scoring twice as many points in the paint during Washington's 109-106 victory over the Southeast Division leaders Wednesday night. ""It's the lack of physicality overall. I just told them that. I love our guys, but listen: We got knocked around ... again tonight,"" Clifford said. ""If guys aren't willing to be more physical, we're going to be an up-and-down team. We'll struggle to make the playoffs. You have to change -- no matter how old you are, how many years you've been in the league."" Told of his coach's assessment, Walker said: ""He sees it all. He's watching the whole game. So he's right."" Charlotte is 0-3 to start a five-game road trip after losses at Cleveland on Saturday, then at Indiana on Monday. Against Washington, the Hornets led by as many as 10 early in the third quarter, then trailed by as many as 12, but made things interesting at the end. The Hornets pulled within two points after Marco Belinelli stole the ball from Wall, leading to Cody Zeller's layup with 10.6 seconds remaining. Wall made one of two free throws a second later for a three-point lead, before Nicolas Batum and Walker both missed 3s that would have tied it. After Batum's miss, Walker got the rebound and moved out beyond the arc to launch his shot, which came oh-so-close to going in at the buzzer. Beal said afterward he was ""a little nervous, I'm not going to lie, because he had a solid look."" TIP-INS Hornets: Batum scored 20 points on his 28th birthday. He had game highs of 14 points and seven assists in the first half, helping Charlotte lead 54-49. ... G Ramon Sessions, who played the last two seasons for Washington, scored four points. Wizards: Wall drew a technical -- his sixth of the season -- for jawing with Belinelli after making a basket in the fourth quarter. ... Markieff Morris was a late scratch because of a sore left foot. Kelly Oubre Jr. started in his place and scored 15 points. ... Rookie F Danuel House missed his 10th game in a row with a broken right wrist. WALL VS. WALKER Wall, wearing bright orange neon shoes, outplayed Walker, finishing with more points (25-17) and assists (10-9), along with seven steals to become Washington's franchise leader in that category, surpassing Greg Ballard, who played in the 1970s and 1980s. Wall became the team's career leader in assists earlier this season. ""He wants to be the best at everything he does,"" Beal said of his backcourt mate. BIG QUARTER Washington eclipsed its season high for points in a quarter during the third, outscoring Charlotte 38-23 in that period, including a 23-5 run. BEAL'S DEAL Beal, 0 for 6 in the first half, scored 11 points in the third. He finished with 20 points, a career-high nine assists and one turnover. ""Oh, that's a good ratio,"" he said with a big smile.","400899817"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- Los Angeles Clippers guard Austin Rivers is proud to have a stat line like he had Wednesday night in any arena. Twenty-five points, 7 for 10 from 3-point range and 9 of 12 from the field. But a trip home where his high school jersey was retired Tuesday night was made even more special with an outstanding performance that helped push the Clippers to a 113-108 victory over the Orlando Magic. Rivers estimated he had about 15 to 20 family members and friends in attendance at Amway Center. ""It's great to have a good game anywhere but I'd be lying to you if I said that it's a little bit more fun to do it here,"" said Rivers, who starred at Winter Park High School before going on to Duke. ""That's for sure."" Rivers, coming off missing a game due to the NBA concussion protocol, made his biggest long-range shot with 2:18 left to give the Clippers a nine-point lead that proved too much for Orlando to overcome. ""We needed every basket,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, Austin's father. ""We were laughing and saying he needs to get hit in the head more. He was terrific."" With forward Luc Mbah a Moute out with a shoulder injury, Doc Rivers went with a three-guard lineup that included Chris Paul, J.J. Redick and Austin. The Clippers gave up more than usual on defense with the smaller lineup, but they made up for it with explosiveness. The trio combined for 51 points while also keeping the Magic on their heels all night. All five Clippers starters scored in double figures. ""It just allows us to play at a different pace,"" said Paul, who finished with 16 points and four assists. ""We played a little faster but it just means we have to scrap. We may give up a little bit but when we are all small like that we have a lot of guys who can score."" The Magic at times were able to overpower the Clippers smaller lineup. It certainly worked for Aaron Gordon, who had one of his better all-around games with a game-high 33 points and seven rebounds. But defensively, Orlando couldn't keep up and as result fell to 4-9 at home this season. ""We're doing the best we can to manage the slippage without practice time and it's not good enough,"" said Magic coach Frank Vogel. ""The smaller lineups are hurting us with our ability to contest and use our size."" HACK-A-JORDAN In effort to slow the Clippers offense down, the Magic turned to an often used strategy in the third quarter. They intentionally fouled Los Angeles center DeAndre Jordan, who has been a poor free throw shooter. It allowed the Magic to outscore the Clippers by nine points in the period but it didn't produce the desire results because Jordan converted 11 of 16 free throw attempts during that two-minute stretch late in the third quarter, which included six straight at one point. Jordan finished the night with 22 points, which included 12 of 18 from the free throw line. ""He's over 50 percent so we don't mind it anymore,"" Doc Rivers said. TIPS-INS Clippers: Small forward Luc Mbah a Moute was held out with a right shoulder injury. Magic: Center Nikola Vucevic missed his third straight game with a sore back. ... Serge Ibaka struggled during the first half, picking up three fouls while scoring just three points in 10:17. He finished with just eight points. ... While the Magic attempted to take advantage of Jordan's poor free throw shooting, Bismack Biyombo was the one who was exposed at the line. He converted just one of seven from the line of the night.","400899818"
"MIAMI --  Winning consecutive games at home for the first time all season isn't exactly something to celebrate, particularly when the season is nearly two months old. For the Miami Heat, it's a start. Hassan Whiteside had 26 points and 22 rebounds, and the Heat clamped down defensively to beat the Indiana Pacers 95-89 on Wednesday night. Miami held the Pacers to 37 percent shooting and outrebounded them 58-38. ""Guess that's what you can expect with a Heat-Pacers game, regardless of who the faces are,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It was good for us to grind out another one."" No, this wasn't one of those playoff battles with the Pacers that featured LeBron James and Dwyane Wade almost always finding a way for the Heat in recent years. This time, it was the likes of Tyler Johnson and James Johnson coming up big, combining for 29 points off the bench -- and Whiteside simply controlling the paint during his 34 minutes. ""I try to lead by example,"" Whiteside said. Paul George scored 22 for the Pacers, who were hoping for a season-best third straight win and instead managed just 10 points in the fourth quarter. CJ Miles added 15 for Indiana. ""This is a game that we should have won,"" George said. ""It's frustrating. ... We played OK. We just didn't finish well."" Neither team led by more than seven, and the Heat got to that margin after James Johnson found Goran Dragic for a layup and a 92-85 lead with 3:35 left. They needed to hang on desperately from there. Miami didn't score again until there were 12.9 seconds left, when Josh Richardson sealed the win with a dunk that put the Heat up five after Indiana didn't foul. The Pacers missed three 3-point tries that would have tied the game in the final 2 minutes, one by George and the last two by Myles Turner. The Pacers shot 5 for 18 in the fourth. They went scoreless over a 7-minute stretch in the second half, and Miami took the lead for good during that drought. ""They basically muscled us and broke our offensive execution,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. TIP-INS Pacers: Monta Ellis (right groin strain) was sidelined again, and Rodney Stuckey played through a bruised left knee. ... This was the start of Indiana's sixth of 17 back-to-backs this season. ... George has played 19 games at Miami, including playoffs. Indiana's record in those games is 2-17. Heat: It was the fourth time Whiteside reached 20 points and 20 rebounds in the same game, the second this season. ... Justise Winslow returned from a 16-game absence due to a sore left wrist and scored two points in 21 minutes. ... Dragic missed his first seven shots before connecting on a pull-up for his first basket early in the third quarter. He shot 4 for 15. ... Dion Waiters (groin) missed his 10th consecutive game. `CANES VISIT Miami's women's basketball team -- No. 13 in this week's AP Top 25 -- was at the game, along with coach Katie Meier. For some, it was their first time at a Heat game. ""They were so excited,"" said Meier, whose team next plays Friday at Florida International.

"NEW YORK --  When Larry Nance Jr. kept climbing until he had all but jumped over Brook Lopez for an electrifying dunk late in the third quarter, the Lakers looked ready to overcome any obstacles standing in their way. Then the Brooklyn Nets made sure that was about the final highlight for Los Angeles. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 23 points, Sean Kilpatrick had 22 and the Nets sent the Lakers to their eighth straight loss with a 107-97 victory Wednesday night. Nance's dunk came near the end of the Lakers' 33-point third period, but they managed just seven baskets in the fourth -- none over the final 6-plus minutes. ""Our offense kind of hit a wall,"" Nance said. Lopez added 20 points for the Nets, who played without Jeremy Lin again but avoided a third consecutive defeat. Trevor Booker grabbed a season-high 18 rebounds and helped key Brooklyn's rare fourth-quarter defensive stand. ""I think if we're going to take a step that's where we need to take a step, is defensively,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I was very pleased."" Lou Williams scored 16 points for the Lakers, who have fallen from a .500 team early in Luke Walton's first season as coach to one that is 10-18. They shot 38.5 percent from the field and were dismal as well from 3-point range (22 percent) and the free throw line (61.8). ""As a group, as a team, we've got a lot to learn about winning and how hard it is,"" Walton said. ""It's frustrating, but it's where we are at. Like I told our guys, we're going to find a way out. When that is? Time will tell."" The Lakers led by one midway through the fourth before consecutive follow shots by Luis Scola and Lopez put Brooklyn on top for good, and Lopez had back-to-back baskets later during an 11-2 run that gave the Nets a 102-94 advantage with 4:47 to play. Los Angeles kept misfiring and the Nets eventually increased the lead to double digits near the end. Nick Young scored 14 points but shot 5 of 15 for the Lakers, who had won the last three meetings. He dislocated his finger but said he was OK. ""It wasn't no real Kobe moment,"" he said. ""You know, it wasn't that (badly) dislocated. It will be all right."" TIP-INS Lakers: Young and D'Angelo Russell both played their third game since an injury absence. Walton said a minutes restriction remained in place for Russell, who missed 12 games with a sore left knee, but no longer for Young, who was sidelined six games with a strained right calf. ... The Lakers lost for just the fourth time in the last 20 meetings. Nets: Bogdanovic had his sixth 20-point game of the season but first at home. ... The Lakers' 13 second-quarter points were the fewest the Nets have allowed in any period this season. LIN'S LOSS Lin had just returned from a 17-game absence with a strained left hamstring to play in the Nets' loss at Houston on Monday. Atkinson said the point guard's back tightened up Wednesday morning and Lin was ruled out shortly before the game. WALTON'S WORDS Walton was fined $15,000 by the NBA for verbally abusing a game official and not leaving the court in a timely manner after an ejection for arguing what he thought should have been a foul in a loss to Sacramento. But apparently, he won't change his fighting ways when he deems it necessary. ""Our guys aren't getting treated right, then I'm going to stand up for them,"" Walton said.","400899820"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The defending NBA champion Cavaliers left an average of almost 71 points per game back in Cleveland. The result was their lowest-scoring output of the season and a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. With stars LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love resting in Ohio, the Grizzlies built an early lead, then extended it to 15 in the first half and 25 in the fourth quarter, before coasting to a 93-85 victory over the Cavaliers on Wednesday night. ""It's the NBA and some guys are going to rest and some guys are not,"" said Memphis guard Troy Daniels, who led the Grizzlies with 20 points. ""I think we play to win each and every game, no matter who's playing."" Marc Gasol added 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Grizzlies. Tony Allen finished with 16 points, eight rebounds and three steals, as Memphis won for the seventh time in eight games. The only loss during that stretch was a 103-86 defeat on Tuesday night in Cleveland. With Cleveland's top three scorers not on the one-day trip, the Cavaliers managed only nine 3-pointers -- matching their fewest in a game this season. James Jones made three shots from outside the arc and led Cleveland with 15 points. Cavaliers rookie Kay Felder scored a season-high 14 in 23 minutes. ""I know Coach [Tyronn] Lue said plenty of times -- and we have said the same -- at the end of the day, we are here to win,"" Jones said. ""And we are going to do everything we need to put ourselves in a position to be as good as we can be when it really matters in the postseason."" The Grizzlies took advantage of the missing Cavaliers and carried a 47-36 advantage into the break. The Cavaliers opened the second half with nine straight points, but the Grizzlies continued to connect from beyond the arc. By the end of the third quarter, Memphis was 11-of-17 from long distance and had a 74-53 lead. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland's 16 points were the team's fewest in a first quarter this season. ... Mike Dunleavy made his second start of the season and Channing Frye his first. ... Jones, who entered 11-of-14 from 3-point range, hit his first two 3s before finishing 3 of 5. ... J.R. Smith had eight points without a 3-pointer, leaving him two 3s short of passing Craig Ehlo for eighth place in franchise history. Grizzlies: Gasol had his 12th game with multiple 3s. ... Memphis made 12 3-pointers, reaching double figures in the category for the ninth time this season. ... Memphis is 7-0 on the second night of a back-to-back. NOT REALLY THAT CLOSE The final score made the game appear closer than it was because Cleveland scored the final eight points. That was the only time the Cavaliers were within single digits since about three minutes left in the third quarter. NO REST FOR THOMPSON While the Big Three sat out for the Cavaliers, center Tristan Thompson played in his 394th consecutive game -- the longest current streak in the NBA. ""I know the streak is important,"" Lue said before the game. ""It's a great streak to be a part of when you're durable and ready to play every single night."" FOCUS ON LeBRON Some fans in Memphis were disappointed that the Cavaliers left James, Irving and Love at home -- especially because it was Cleveland's only trip to Memphis this season. Some paid hundreds of dollars to see James in particular. One youngster held up a sign that read: ""LeBron. Thanks for ruining my Christmas!"" Lue understood. ""You know, guys sit their guys every night,"" the Cleveland coach said. ""But when the Cavaliers do it or LeBron does it, it's something different. I understand too, because these people were waiting to see LeBron play."" ALWAYS READY Lue said he never had to worry about a night off for rest in his career.

"HOUSTON -- James Harden's latest game left him tied in Houston's record books with perhaps the greatest Rocket of all. Harden had a triple-double -- 15 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds -- in just three quarters to lead the Rockets to their eighth straight win, 132-98 over the short-handed Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. It was Harden's fifth triple-double this season and the 14th of his career, which ties him with Hakeem Olajuwon for most in franchise history. Harden acknowledged how special it is to be mentioned in the same breath as The Dream. ""Yes, obviously all-time Rockets great, best to ever do it (in) a Rocket uniform and one of the best to ever do it period,"" Harden said. ""So just honored. It's a credit to my teammates who helped me and coaches and just trying to win. That's all."" Houston's winning streak is the longest current one in the NBA and the team's longest since 2014. ""The biggest thing I'm happy with is we had 40 assists on 50 buckets, so they're sharing the ball,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""James does what he does every night and just a lot of good stuff going on."" Harden's triple-double came in 29 minutes and 52 seconds of play, which is his second when playing less than 30 minutes. Houston led by 15 points in the third quarter before using a 10-4 run to push it to 76-53 with about 7 minutes left in the quarter. The Rockets began to pour it on after that, outscoring the Kings 18-5 over the next 3 1/2 minutes to make it 94-58. Trevor Ariza scored the first five points in that span and capped it with a 3-pointer. Harden grabbed his 10th rebound soon after that and got one more late in the third before heading to the bench at the end of the quarter to end his night. The Kings played without three starters with Rudy Gay (hip flexor strain) and Ben McLemore (left quadriceps contusion) out with injuries and DeMarcus Cousins getting a planned day of rest. They were led by Garrett Temple's 20 points. ""There are times when teams are going to have to rest people and that gives other guys an opportunity to step up,"" Sacramento's Matt Barnes said. ""We have to weather the storm until Ben and Rudy get back and I think DeMarcus is playing in the next game. We have to pick up the pieces and continue to play hard and improve."" Ryan Anderson had 22 points and Sam Dekker had a career-high 19 for Houston. Harden has thrived running D'Antoni's fast-paced offense and has piled up 53 assists in the last four games. TIP-INS Kings: Have lost six straight in Houston. ... Anthony Tolliver had 12 points and 10 rebounds. ... Trailed by as many as 39. ... Willie Cauley-Stein had 11 points, five rebounds and two blocked shots. Rockets: Eric Gordon had a season-high eight assists. ... Every Houston starter scored at least 10 points. It's the sixth time that's happened this season. ... Ariza finished with five 3s and has had at least four 3s in 11 games this season. ... The Rockets had 64 points at halftime and have scored at least 60 points in the first half in seven of their last 11 games. COME ON GUYS The Rockets finished with 22 3-pointers to give them at least 15 3s in three straight games, which ties a franchise record. They came just short of tying the NBA record for 3s in a game of 23. With her son on the bench for the entire fourth quarter Harden's mother Monja Willis was imploring Dekker to help the Rockets break the record. ""James' mom kept yelling at me,"" Dekker said. ""She was laughing and she kept saying: `You need two more for the record. Two more for the record.' But I didn't pay too much mind to it. We got out of there with a win and with the way we shoot the ball I think we'll get pretty close again."" NO REST With Cousins sitting out to rest Wednesday night, Harden, who has played in 152 consecutive games, was asked why he never wants to take a night off to give his body a break. ""I know I'm not going to be playing basketball for the rest of my life,"" he said. ""I cherish moments like these and I love to play basketball. ... I love being on the court.""","400899822"
"DALLAS --  Reggie Jackson took another step forward in his return from a knee injury. Jackson scored 20 points -- a season high in his sixth game -- and Andre Drummond led a dominant rebounding effort with 17 as the Detroit Pistons beat the Dallas Mavericks 95-85 on Wednesday night. Detroit's floor leader had nine points and three of his six assists in the fourth quarter, when the Pistons finished a run that started late in the third to overcome a 12-point Dallas lead. Jackson missed the first 21 games this season recovering from left knee tendinitis. ""That's the player he can be,"" said teammate Jon Leuer, who scored a season-high 19 points. ""That's the player we need him to be because he is a great floor general and a good leader for us."" Leuer was a plus-25 off the bench as the Pistons beat the team with the worst record in the Western Conference three nights after losing to Philadelphia, the last-place team in the East. Drummond grabbed 10 rebounds in the first 7 1/2 minutes and the Pistons had a 29-9 edge on the boards at halftime and 50-30 for the game. The 6-foot-11 center had more rebounds than Dallas by himself until the middle of the third quarter, when the Mavericks finally went ahead 15-14. Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 19 points. The Pistons went on a 27-5 run covering about 10 minutes in the third and fourth quarters, turning a 64-52 deficit into their first double-digit lead at 79-69 after an alley-oop layup by Aron Baynes with about 5 minutes remaining. Dallas' Wesley Matthews had a season-low four points on 2-of-10 shooting, ending a three-game stretch with at least 25 points. Deron Williams scored 16 but was just 3 of 13 as one of the NBA's worst-shooting teams finished at 41 percent, just below its average. ""This one was frustrating tonight because we had control of the game for most of it,"" Matthews said. ""So we'll learn from it and look at what went wrong."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had seven of his 11 points in the fourth quarter, including a 3-pointer when the Mavericks were within four points with about 3 minutes remaining. TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond had at least 15 rebounds for the 11th time in 25 games. ... Baynes had 10 rebounds and eight points. ... Jackson's previous season high was 18 points in his debut Dec. 4 against Orlando. Mavericks: Barnes was Dallas' leading scorer for the 13th time in 25 games. ... Williams was 9 of 9 on free throws. ... The Mavericks had a season-high 13 steals. ANOTHER DALLAS INJURY Mavericks center Salah Mejri, who led the team with eight rebounds, injured his left ankle in the fourth quarter and didn't return. He said an X-ray didn't show any damage but he planned to get an MRI on Thursday. Dallas is already missing starter Andrew Bogut with a right knee injury, and there's no timetable for his return. Star forward Dirk Nowitzki missed his 10th straight game and 18th out of 20 with a strained right Achilles tendon. Key backup guard J.J. Barea missed his 15th straight with a left calf strain. HOW WAS IT TIED? The Pistons were tied 43-all at halftime despite the huge rebounding edge and holding two Dallas starters scoreless, in part because of 13 turnovers to just three for the Mavericks. ""Besides the turnovers, even the ones we didn't turn the ball over, we had a lot of sloppy possessions that we didn't get good shots because we didn't handle the ball well,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said.","400899823"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  To say Rodney Hood was eager to return to the court after a hamstring injury sidelined him for three games might be an understatement. The third-year guard knocked down basket after basket from the opening tip and finished with 25 points as the Utah Jazz defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 109-89 on Wednesday night to break a tie between the teams atop the Northwest Division. ""These last few games have been so tough to watch,"" Hood said. ""My teammates have been out there just battling and playing and you can't do nothing but watch. It was good to be back out there."" Utah led from start to finish behind 58.3 percent shooting and showed why it's one of the best defensive teams in the NBA, holding the Thunder to 36.6 percent from the field. Gordon Hayward scored 17 for the Jazz, who have won nine of 11. Rudy Gobert added 12 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks. Russell Westbrook paced the Thunder with 27 points, six rebounds and five assists. He shot 7 for 25 from the floor. ""When he has an off shooting night, you don't take credit for it with your defense,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""You just try to make sure you do as good of a job as you can, not giving up offensive rebounds when he drives and try not to give him layups. Sometimes that's hard to do. ""The guys that were guarding him worked hard. And that's really all you can ask."" Enes Kanter scored 19 for Oklahoma City against his former team. The Jazz took a 55-41 lead into halftime thanks to a 15-6 run in the second quarter. Hood sank a pair of 3-pointers to highlight the stretch. The Thunder shot just 32.5 percent in the first half and had little offense outside of Westbrook's 14 points on 3-for-11 shooting. ""I know Gobert is a great rim protector, but I thought we had some shots around the basket that we normally could have made,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I thought that bled into our struggles scoring."" TIP-INS Thunder: Victor Oladipo missed his second consecutive game with a right wrist sprain. Jerami Grant started in place of Oladipo for the second straight night. The Thunder had the same starting lineup for the first 24 games of the season. Jazz: George Hill missed his sixth straight game with a sprained left big toe, but is no longer in a walking boot. ... Utah is 15-2 when leading at halftime. A LITTLE REST The Jazz played their first game in four days after a stretch of eight games in 13 days. The injury-ravaged roster got Derrick Favors (knee) back after a 13-game absence, and Hood (hamstring) returned after missing three games. Snyder said the injuries didn't allow the team to practice much, but the Jazz tried to be smart and efficient in the things they could do. They also tried to get some rest and get healthy. ""There's always a fine line between, you want to rejuvenate and recharge, but then you also don't want to lose timing and things like that,"" Snyder said. OVER IT Westbrook failed to get a triple-double for the third consecutive game and is starting to get annoyed with all the talk about him averaging a triple-double for the entire season. ""Honestly, people with this triple-double thing, is kind of getting on my nerves,"" he said. ""People think if I don't get it, it's like a big thing. When I do get it, it's a thing. ""If I get it, I get it. If I don't, I don't. It is what it is. I really don't care, not for the hundredth time. I don't care. All I care about is winning.""","400899824"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs turned to their most tenured veteran to fight off the youthful energy of the Boston Celtics. Tony Parker had 16 points, including 10 in the final period, and the Spurs played their second consecutive solid home game in beating the Celtics 108-101 on Wednesday night. ""Tony made it a point that he wanted to finish the game out,"" Boston guard Avery Bradley said. ""You could tell. You could see it in his eyes, you could see it in his play. Every time he got the ball he was aggressive. He was either making a play for himself or making a play for his teammates."" After entering the NBA as an 18-year-old rookie in 2001, Parker is now in his 16th season, all with the Spurs. The 34-year-old point guard has slowed, but he showed flashes of his old self against the Celtics. Parker was 8 for 15 from the field, including a turn-back-the-clock, teardrop floater in the first quarter over a hard-charging Amir Johnson after crossing over Marcus Smart. Parker also hit an 18-foot fall-away jumper off his left heel that gave San Antonio a 96-85 lead. ""It was just one of those situations,"" Parker said. ""It was kind of like they were coming back, and (Spurs coach Gregg Popovich) is the boss, I just try to do whatever he wants. Just put me in that situation. I'm just happy they went in."" Parker's second straight game in double figures backed up Kawhi Leonard's 26 points. Pau Gasol added 17 points and 13 rebounds for San Antonio, which has won three straight at the AT&amp;T Center after dropping three of its first four at home. The Spurs (20-5) are 7-4 at home after matching an NBA record with a 40-1 mark last season. ""I thought the ball movement was a little more aggressive tonight,"" Popovich said. ""We communicated pretty well defensively. The ball moved. The ball moved better than it has at home all year."" After collecting a season-high 38 assists in Saturday's home win over Brooklyn, the Spurs had 33 assists on 44 field goals against the Celtics while shooting 55 percent from the field. ""It's too early to say that we've turned the corner, but it's a good sign,"" said Manu Ginobili, who is in his 15th season with the Spurs. Ginobili finished with 12 points and four assists. Boston was without injured leading scorer Isaiah Thomas. San Antonio rested starting power forward LaMarcus Aldridge, and both teams showed off their depth. David Lee, who started in place of Aldridge, had eight points and 10 rebounds. Bradley had 25 points and 10 assists for the Celtics, and Boston got 34 points from its bench. The Celtics outscored San Antonio 18-4 to pull to 74-73 with a minute left in the third quarter, but San Antonio came out on top in a game of big runs to win its 11th straight over Boston. ""They are tremendous at maximizing every detail of the game,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""We have had our moments where we play really well, but we're not as good as them at that."" TIP-INS Celtics: Gerald Green was a late scratch after tweaking his left hip Tuesday in practice while playing 1-on-1. Green's status changed when he experienced soreness in the hip Wednesday morning. ""He went through all the practice, felt pretty good, didn't feel good this morning,"" Stevens said. ... Boston is 3-7 against the Western Conference this season, including 1-4 against the Southwest Division. ... Smart started his ninth game, including his third at point guard in place of Thomas. The Celtics are 4-5 with Smart starting at small forward or shooting guard. Spurs: Aldridge was rested for the second time this season, initially sitting out Oct. 30 in a 94-87 win at Dallas. ""He's a little banged up,"" Popovich explained. ""A little back-to-back, a little bit of rest, a little bit of everything."" ... Aldridge, Parker, Gasol and Ginobili have missed a combined eight games for rest this season. Ginobili has sat out three times. ... Lee is the 88th player in NBA history with 10,000 career points and 7,000 rebounds. ... San Antonio is 11-2 against Eastern Conference teams. DUNKING DUNCAN San Antonio will retire Tim Duncan's jersey during a postgame ceremony Sunday, but Parker is already feeling nostalgic about his longtime teammate. After teaming with Dewayne Dedmon on an alley-oop, Parker couldn't help but recall all the times he did the same with Duncan. Or maybe Parker was getting an early dig in at Duncan. ""The last time I had a guy who could jump like that was Tim Duncan for the lobs. We've been missing that,"" Parker said, attempting to stifle a laugh about Duncan's lack of leaping ability. ""Missing the Timmy lobs, Dewayne is fulfilling the job."" LOOKS GOOD Stevens expects Thomas to play Friday at home against Charlotte. ""I have not spoken to him directly, but via others and text, he feels really good and the goal is to play Friday,"" Stevens said. The 5-foot-9 guard has missed four straight games with a strained left groin he initially injured Dec. 5 at Houston. Boston is 1/3 without Thomas.","400899825"
"MILWAUKEE --  It was the Giannis and Jabari show Thursday night for the Milwaukee Bucks. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 30 points and Parker added 28 in leading Milwaukee to a 108-97 victory over the Chicago Bulls. Milwaukee led the entire game and held a 24-point advantage early in the fourth quarter but had to hold on to snap a three-game losing streak, its longest of the season. Antetokounmpo has totaled 88 points and 35 rebounds in his last three games, and Parker has reached at least 27 points in four of his past five. ""If we're just being judged on points, then they're playing really well,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""But it's not all about points. Unfortunately, that's all you guys write about. It's a team game, but it comes down to winning and doing your job. Both of those guys did their jobs tonight."" Chicago lost for the fifth time in seven games and dropped its third straight on the road despite 21 points from Jimmy Butler and 20 from Dwyane Wade. The Bulls also got 19 points from Taj Gibson in the opener of a home-and-home between the teams on back-to-back nights. The Bucks went up 95-71 on a dunk by Antetokounmpo with 10:01 remaining. Chicago cut the deficit in half by scoring the next 12 points, with 10 of them coming from Wade. His two free throws trimmed the margin to 95-83 with 7:14 to go. Milwaukee led by at least eight the rest of the way, marking just the second time this season the Bucks never trailed in a game. ""I think everybody did a great job keeping the lead,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It's hard to keep a lead for 24 minutes, for a half. It's hard sometimes."" The Bucks' biggest lead of the night was 27 on a dunk by Tony Snell that made it 58-31 with 3:40 left in the second quarter. The advantage was 64-45 at halftime, as Antetokounmpo (20), Parker (17) and Mirza Teletovic (10) combined to outscore Chicago by two points. Milwaukee shot 80 percent (8 for 10) from 3-point range while Chicago was 1 for 9 (11.1 percent) from beyond the arc in the first two quarters. ""They were too comfortable early,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We didn't want to give them dare shots, we wanted to keep them out of the paint, and they were hitting them."" TIP-INS Bulls: Rajan Rondo returned to the starting lineup after missing Tuesday's game against Minnesota because of a right ankle sprain. ... Butler has 79 points in his last three games and has scored at least 20 in 18 of his last 19 outings. ... Chicago lost at Milwaukee for just the fifth time in the last 15 games. Bucks: There was a moment of silence following the death of longtime TNT sideline reporter Craig Sager, and Milwaukee players wore Sager Strong T-shirts during pregame warmups that resembled the outfit he wore at the recent ESPYs. Even mascot Bango donned a funky blue sport coat and plaid pants in Sager's honor. ... Michael Beasley missed his first game of the season with a left foot sprain. STRONG DIVISION Milwaukee improved to 12-12, making the Central Division the only one in the NBA with every team at .500 or better. LET'S PLAY TWO Not only does Milwaukee play Chicago on consecutive nights, the Bucks also play back-to-back games against Cleveland on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then against Washington on Dec. 23 and Dec. 26. ""Scouting reports are easy,"" quipped Kidd. TRADE TALK Milwaukee traded Michael Carter-Williams to Chicago for Tony Snell on Oct. 17. Carter-Williams has missed the last 22 games for the Bulls with knee and wrist injuries, while Snell has started all but two games for the Bucks.","400899826"
"NEW ORLEANS -- Anthony Davis backpedaled from the 3-point line, his arm staying up in the follow-through position as his shot went down to push New Orleans' lead to eight points with a minute-and-a-half to go. A mere 12 seconds later, his arm was extended again -- this time to swat away Thaddeus Young's running floater as the Pelicans emphatically closed out a 102-95 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Thursday night. ""My teammates were just telling me to end the game,"" Davis said. ""Of course, they lean on me to try to close out down the stretch. I was just trying to be aggressive."" Davis was having a pretty good night even before his late flourish, finishing with 35 points, 16 rebounds and five blocked shots. He highlighted his latest dynamic performance with two 3-pointers and a couple of driving dunks. During a pivotal 15-0 Pelicans run inside the final 5 minutes, he converted a three-point play on a driving dunk, hit a 3, added four free throws and blocked two shots. Davis ""got loose in a couple transitions. He made a 3. They're moving him around,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""He hurt us really in transition and just attacking the basket."" Rookie Buddy Hield also hurt the Pacers with a career-high 21 points, hitting five 3s along the way. ""He can shoot it even better than he did tonight,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said of Hield. ""He's just learning what a good shot is."" And New Orleans even got its first production of the season from guard Tyreke Evans, who played 11 minutes in his return from a right knee injury that also sidelined him most of last season. He had seven points, three rebounds and two assists. ""He played pretty well in his limited minutes,"" Davis said. Jrue Holiday, who started the Pelicans' decisive surge with a driving layup, had 16 points and 14 assists, while Terrence Jones added 10 points, 11 rebounds and two blocked shots. Myles Turner scored 26 points on 11-of-14 shooting for Indiana, but the Pacers missed eight straight shots during a 4-minute scoring drought late in the fourth quarter. Indiana's Jeff Teague had 21 points and 10 assists and Paul George had 18 points. The game was close through 3 1/2 quarters, when neither team had built a lead larger than eight points. The Pacers led 90-85 after George's layup with 4:52 to go, but that's when the game turned dramatically in New Orleans' favor. ""There's something we're not doing right. We have to address it,"" George said. ""The majority of our losses, we've been in the game or in control. We're not figuring out how to close it."" TIP-INS Pacers: Al Jefferson scored 14 points. ... G Rodney Stuckey was sidelined by soreness in his left hamstring, which he pulled during a loss at Miami on Wednesday night. His absence further thinned Indiana's depth at guard with Monta Ellis skipping the trip because of his right groin strain. ... George was assessed a technical foul for arguing a call on the defensive end in the second quarter. Pelicans: Reserve PG Tim Frazier, who sprained his right wrist during Tuesday night's loss to Golden State, was scratched from the lineup. ... New Orleans outrebounded Indiana 56-46. OFF TARGET Indiana entered the game shooting 37 percent from 3-point range but hit only 3 of 21 (14 percent). Davis said the Pelicans had something to do with that. ""That was one of our biggest focuses was guarding the 3-point line. We wanted to be up on ball screens and make them shoot 2s,"" Davis said. ""They rely on their 3s a lot and we just wanted to make sure it was tough on everyone."" COMPETITIVE REUNION In his first game against the team he left in free agency after last season, New Orleans small forward Solomon Hill often guarded George, who failed to score 20 points for just the first time in seven games. ""We didn't let him close to the basket. Everyone had my back,"" Hill said. ""We felt like he didn't get comfortable tonight and that changed the dynamic of their team.""","400899827"
"DENVER --  Gary Harris' return was supposed to strengthen Denver's defense. Instead, the Nuggets relied on their offense to finally solve the Portland Trail Blazers. Harris had 18 points in his first game back from a foot injury, Danilo Gallinari scored 20 of his 27 in the first half and the Nuggets led big early before holding on late to beat the Trail Blazers 132-120 Thursday night. Wilson Chandler added 17 points and Jameer Nelson scored 13 of his 15 in the fourth quarter as the Nuggets withstood a late push. It was Denver's second victory in the last 15 games against the Blazers, who got 40 points and 10 assists from Damian Lillard. ""That's the team we have to be,"" Harris said. ""We show flashes of that, so we need to put it together every night."" CJ McCollum scored 23 for Portland, which has lost five of six. ""We didn't have much of an impact on the defensive end,"" Lillard said. ""They felt comfortable. They made uncontested shots and when we picked our energy up and our effort up they had themselves going."" Harris missed 16 games after getting hurt Nov. 12 against Detroit. Nuggets coach Michael Malone planned on easing the third-year guard back into action but Harris played 32 minutes, third-most on the team. ""I didn't know what was going to happen,"" Harris said. ""I was glad to get back out there."" The Nuggets snapped a three-game skid at Pepsi Center, where they are 4-7 this season. One of those defeats came in their home opener against Portland when they blew a late lead and lost in overtime. Denver never trailed in this one, but the Trail Blazers tried to make it a game in the fourth behind Lillard. Harris was given the tough task of guarding Lillard and helped hold him in check for three quarters. But the All-Star guard scored 14 points in the last 12 minutes as Portland rallied. After trailing by as many as 25 in the first half and 21 in the third quarter, the margin was just 10 in the fourth. Denver responded with an 11-5 run to push the lead to 16, and Portland never got the deficit under 10 again. ""We were able to make enough plays on offense to stem the tide,"" Malone said. ""They just ran out of time, thank goodness. That clock was moving very slow."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: F Al-Farouq Aminu missed his second straight game with a back injury. ... Lillard has scored 30 or more points in three of his last five games. Nuggets: The 132 points were a season high. ... Denver Broncos LB Shaquil Barrett was in attendance.

Alonzo Gee was inactive and Malik Beasley is with Sioux Falls of the D-League. REMEMBERING CRAIG SAGER There was a moment of silence before the national anthem following the death of Sager, the longtime TNT sideline reporter. Malone and Portland coach Terry Stotts spoke about Sager before the game. Malone said it is ""a tough loss for the entire NBA family,"" while Stotts said ""his legacy will go well beyond just his suits and colorful personality.

"PHOENIX --  The San Antonio Spurs continue to be the NBA's best road team. The Spurs turned a close game early in the fourth quarter into a romp, getting 18 points and 10 rebounds from Kawhi Leonard and 18 points and nine boards from Pau Gasol in a 107-92 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night. The Spurs (21-5) withstood the Suns' attempt to push the tempo after San Antonio had played Wednesday, and held Phoenix to 40 percent shooting. They improved to an NBA-best 14-1 on the road. ""We haven't really thought about that much,"" guard Danny Green said. ""Took one loss last time on the road, wanted to bounce back and play better."" San Antonio took a 10-point lead early in the third quarter, but the Suns wouldn't go away until the fourth. Leandro Barbosa flipped in a finger roll and was fouled with 10:08 to play in the game, and the Suns' 77-76 lead was their first since midway through the second quarter. The Spurs responded with an 11-0 run and clamped down defensively to take control of the game for good, and beat Phoenix for the eighth consecutive time. ""We have such a deep team, we really don't play our guys a lot of minutes. So our effort is pretty steady,"" Gasol said. ""When teams ramp it up and try to increase the intensity, they make their runs, they might get ahead at times, but then it's hard for them to sustain it for 48 minutes."" Devin Booker's 17 points led the Suns, who missed a chance to win consecutive games for only the second time this season. ""Our guys fought and gave all they could. Some games end up like this,"" coach Earl Watson said. Phoenix took a 39-33 lead on Tyson Chandler's dunk with 4:44 to go in the first half, but the Spurs scored 18 of the final 22 points of the half for a 51-43 lead. Two came from a steal and dunk by Leonard and his 3-pointer with 39.5 seconds left. ""For us we have a couple of more hurdles to get over, but that is the biggest hurdle, the fourth quarter,"" Suns forward Jared Dudley said. ""When teams go on big runs we lose our confidence. We lose our composure."" TIP-INS Spurs: The Spurs moved to 6-1 in the second of back-to-back games this season. ... F LaMarcus Aldridge returned to the starting lineup after being rested Wednesday night and had a rough first half of shooting, but finished with 14 points. ""He passed the ball when he needed to, he scored when he needed to,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. Suns: F T.J. Warren missed his 13th straight game due to a head injury ...  F Alex Len missed his second straight with a right hip bruise. ... The Suns recalled G Tyler Ulis, F-C Alan Williams and F Derrick Jones Jr. from Northern Arizona of the D-League. Ulis and Williams got major minutes Wednesday night in a one-game stint with Northern Arizona, then were brought back to the Suns. IN MEMORY OF SAGER Both teams' coaches expressed sorrow regarding the passing of longtime NBA reporter Craig Sager, for whom a moment of silence was observed in the arena before tipoff. Popovich spoke only of Sager for about 2 minutes before the game. Watson said it was his and many other players' dream to be interviewed by Sager. ""Every genius is never afraid of being exactly who they are. And he was a genius at his job, a genius at everything that he's done,"" Watson said. ""He stayed true to himself and we all embraced him."" Booker wore a brightly colored Sager tribute T-shirt during warmups. KNIGHT TAKES TWO HITS Suns G Brandon Knight absorbed two hard fouls on consecutive possessions in the third quarter. He took a forearm from Manu Ginobili, then was knocked off-balance and fell to the court with a thud when Patty Mills yanked his arm going up for a layup. Knight remained in the game and shot free throws after both fouls were reviewed and ruled common fouls, to the dismay of the home crowd.","400899829"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Another spectacular passing performance earned Steve Kerr's postgame praise, yet there was little else the coach liked about his ""heavy-legged,"" December-weary Warriors after an exhausting road trip. Klay Thompson scored 25 points, JaVale McGee added a season-best 17 and Golden State beat the undermanned New York Knicks 103-90 on Thursday night. But at the end of an emotional day for the NBA, news of the death of good friend and colorful sideline reporter Craig Sager made it hard for Kerr and everybody else on the court to focus on basketball. ""Craig's death and the news today far outweighs anything that happens in the gym,"" Kerr said. Kevin Durant had 15 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists, and Stephen Curry pulled down a season-high 10 rebounds to go with eight points and eight assists against a New York team missing stars Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose. ""We kept the ball moving and made them chase the ball all night and got layups,"" Durant said. ""And we didn't really shoot the ball that well."" The Warriors had 36 assists on their initial 36 baskets -- 26 in the first half -- and all 11 players who appeared in the first half scored in Golden State's fifth straight win over New York. The Warriors wound up with 41 assists and held a 57-49 rebounding advantage. Justin Holiday had 15 points off the bench for the late-arriving Knicks, whose second bus was delayed coming from San Francisco in a downpour. New York couldn't overcome a slow start from the field, going 4 for 15 to fall behind in a hurry. The Knicks shot 40.9 percent overall and 5 for 21 from 3-point range. ""They're running in transition, they're throwing up 3s, they're hitting open guys and playing fast,"" Knicks guard Courtney Lee said. ""You can get caught up in that, and that's not our style of game."" Golden State had its third game this season with 40 or more assists, the first team to do that since the Chicago Bulls in 1996-97.

"WASHINGTON --  A month removed from a dreadful start to the season, the Washington Wizards just might becoming together under coach Scott Brooks. It continued Friday night, as John Wall had 29 points and 11 assists while guiding a Wizards offense that committed a season-low five turnovers in a 122-108 victory over the Detroit Pistons. Bradley Beal added 25 points and Marcin Gortat had 12 to go with 14 rebounds, helping Washington score its most points of the season while winning for the fourth time in five games. ""I think we're getting into a nice little rhythm that we're understanding what we want to do as a basketball team on both ends,"" said Brooks, who replaced Randy Wittman after last season. ""We're still not where we want to be. But I see some progress, I see some belief in each other, and that's what it's all about."" After losing eight of 10 to start the season, the Wizards have gone 9-6 since to move within three games of .500 (11-14). Recently, Washington has at least 109 points in its last three wins. And against a Detroit team that entered Friday allowing the second-fewest points per game, Washington shot 57.1 percent (44 for 77) from the floor and 48 percent (12 of 25) from 3-point range. ""We're competing. We're into guys. We're making guys uncomfortable,"" Wall said. ""At first we were giving ups 3s, giving up layups and giving up transition points. I think (when) we're a team that's more physical, we give ourselves a better chance to win."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 24 points to lead the Pistons. Andre Drummond added 13 points and 12 rebounds, but Detroit allowed its most points all season while seeing its streak of holding opponents under 100 halted at seven games. ""John Wall was great. Beal was great,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We couldn't handle them at all. They were getting wherever they wanted on the floor making plays. Then the other guys shot the ball well two, but those two guys just destroyed us."" The Wizards broke it open during an excellent second quarter, shooting 5 of 7 from 3-point range and taking a 13-point lead after a 21-8 run, part of a season high 38 points in a quarter. ""We know this is a team who loves to slow the game down a little bit,"" Beal said. ""But we didn't want to play their game. We wanted them to adjust to us."" TIP-INS Pistons: Began the game 1 of 8 from 3-point range ... Drummond picked up his second personal foul with 4:15 left in the first quarter. F/C Aron Baynes then replaced Drummond and accrued three personals before the end of the period. Wizards: Wall and Gortat each had their 14th double-doubles. ... F Markieff Morris returned after missing his only start of the season in Wednesday's win over Charlotte. ... Reserve F/C Jason Smith left in the second quarter with a strained right hamstring. BROTHER, BROTHER Wizards F Markieff Morris blocked twin brother Marcus' shot on the baseline midway through the third quarter, then reached out a right arm to lift him off the floor. ""He put it right in my face; I can't just not block the shot,"" Markieff said. In their fifth game as opponents since playing as teammates in Phoenix, Markieff finished with 11 points while Marcus had two. QUOTABLE ""There were so many times during the timeout I didn't know which one was giving us fits."" -- Brooks, on facing the Morris twins when he coached Oklahoma City.","400899831"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Evan Fournier seemed oblivious to the trash talk and choice words Brooklyn Nets newcomer Sean Kilpatrick sent his way in the final 3 minutes Friday night. Instead of firing back with nothing more than his mouth, the Orlando guard silenced Kilpatrick with a dominant performance down the stretch. Fournier scored 11 straight points -- hitting all eight of his free throws and a clutch 3-pointer -- as the Magic beat Brooklyn 118-111 to snap their six-game home losing streak. ""It's part of the game. I love it. I really love the trash talking,"" said Fournier, who finished with 21 points. ""I'm usually not the one starting it, but when it's on it's on."" Fournier's outburst broke open a game that was tied at 106. He converted four consecutive free throws and then drained a 3-pointer that gave Orlando a 113-108 lead with 1:53 remaining. It was a remarkable finish considering Fournier's early struggles, which led to a brief benching in the third quarter. ""He's done that before, where hasn't been shooting the basketball well but still has the confidence to hit big shots down the stretch,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""As long as he is making the right reads -- when he makes the right reads he shoots a remarkable 3-point percentage. He is a big reason why we pulled away with the victory."" In a game that was close throughout, the Magic came up with key baskets and big stops down the stretch. The Nets had no offense outside of point guard Jeremy Lin during the final 3 minutes. Orlando, meanwhile, received key contributions from its big men, with Serge Ibaka, Bismack Biyombo and Nikola Vucevic combining for 11 blocked shots. The trio also was important in giving the Magic several second-shot opportunities. The Magic outscored the Nets 10-4 on second-chance points as a result of 13 offensive rebounds. ""They absolutely have an athletic group and we knew they were committed to crashing the glass beforehand,"" said Nets center Brook Lopez, who had 22 points and five blocked shots. ""They went out and did it. Maybe we need to recommit."" NET GAIN Vucevic seems to save some of his best performances for Lopez and the Nets. Friday night was certainly no different. After missing three games with a back injury, Vucevic had 21 points, 10 rebounds and a big blocked shot off the bench against Lopez. ""I think we both play really well against each other. I think we both just enjoy going against each other. You get fired up for a matchup like that,"" he said. GETTING TECHNICAL The third quarter featured five technical fouls, four on the Magic and one on Nets coach Kenny Atkinson. But going into the fourth, Vogel let his players know it was time to get their heads back in the game. ""I told everybody to stop getting techs,"" said Vogel, assessed one of the technicals himself for arguing a no-call. ""We said our peace. We didn't like what we were seeing. We said our peace and move on."" TIP-INS Nets: Lin returned to the lineup after missing Wednesday's game due to lower back tightness. He scored 17 points on 7-of-13 shooting. ... The Nets are 1-11 on the road this season. Magic: Orlando has assigned rookie center Stephen Zimmerman and guard C.J. Wilcox to the Erie BayHawks of the NBA Development League. ... The Magic are 5-9 at home.","400899832"
"BOSTON -- The Boston Celtics took their defense from solid in the first half to stifling in the second. Isaiah Thomas scored 16 of his 26 points after halftime and Al Horford had 18 points and five blocked shots as Boston beat the Charlotte Hornets 96-88 on Friday night to stop a three-game slide. ""Coach just told us we needed to step up our level of energy a little more on the defensive end,"" Horford said. ""We did that and that was the big difference."" Getting Thomas back after he missed four straight games with a groin strain didn't hurt, either. Thomas scored nine in the third quarter as the Celtics fought back from a 12-point deficit. He added seven in the fourth to help Boston put away the Hornets. ""We got stops and got running,"" Thomas said. ""The one thing we did in the fourth quarter is we just spaced the floor and made plays for each other. Guys hit big shots."" Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder added 12 points apiece for the Celtics, who held the Hornets to 13 field goals in the second half. Charlotte played without leading scorer Kemba Walker, who did not travel with the team due to personal reasons, and lost its fourth straight. Although the Hornets outrebounded Boston 54-46, the Celtics outscored them 38-30 in the paint as Charlotte had trouble converting inside. ""We have to finish some of these plays,"" coach Steve Clifford said. ""You get these point-blank ones and you don't have the floor balance in there back the other way. There were two or three of those that were huge plays."" Nicolas Batum led the Hornets with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Ramon Sessions had 13 points and six assists, Marco Belinelli scored 11 and Jeremy Lamb added 10 points for the Hornets. Crowder hit a 3 with 6:11 left to put Boston up 80-79 after Charlotte scored seven straight points. Thomas drew a flagrant foul by Belinelli and hit both free throws. Boston retained possession because of the flagrant, and Crowder drew another foul and added two more free throws to put Boston ahead 84-79. Cody Zeller missed from inside for Charlotte, and Thomas came back with a 3-pointer to make it 87-79 with 4:52 left. Charlotte turned it over right away after the inbounds play and Bradley added another 3 that gave Boston a 90-79 cushion with 4:24 to go. After a basket by Belinelli with 6:32 left completed their 7-0 run, the Hornets went scoreless until his layup with 2:20 remaining cut it to 92-81. Boston held Charlotte to five field goals in the third quarter, when the Hornets were 5 of 23. Charlotte closed the second on a 14-4 run and took a 50-41 lead into halftime. The Hornets led 60-48 early in the third when the Celtics started their surge. Kelly Olynyk hit a 3-pointer to tie it at 62 with 3:57 left, and it was tied 69-all at the end of the third. MISSING KEMBA Sessions started for Walker and had six assists, but the Hornets' offense appeared lost without Walker. ""He's one of the best in the league, so we missed him a lot tonight,"" Batum said. ""We played better tonight overall. But we should have won that game, anyway. No excuses."" COLD OUTSIDE After shooting 2 of 14 from beyond the arc in the first half, the Celtics started hitting from outside in the third period. They went 7 of 14 on 3-pointers in the second half and held Charlotte to 19 points in each of the final two quarters. WELCOME BACK Thomas hadn't played since scoring 20 points against Houston on Dec. 5. The Celtics went 1/3 in the games he missed and were happy to have him leading the offense once again. ""It helps all of us just because it opens the floor even more. Teams have to play us a little more honest,"" said Horford, who also had eight rebounds, five assists and two steals. ""It's just good to have him back."" TIP-INS Hornets: Walker is averaging 22.6 points per game. He missed his first game this season, but was expected to return when the Hornets visit Atlanta on Saturday night. Walker's absence made Belinelli and Sessions the only Charlotte players to appear in all 27 games this season. Celtics: Jonas Jerebko scored nine points to lead Boston's reserves.","400899833"
"TORONTO --  Embarrassed by the Toronto Raptors 13 days ago, the Atlanta Hawks made up for that poor performance in the rematch. Dwight Howard had 27 points and 15 rebounds for his 17th double-double of the season to lead the Hawks to a 125-121 victory over the Raptors on Friday night. Toronto had a franchise-record 44-point victory over its Eastern Conference rival on Dec. 3. In this one, Atlanta responded with a season-high scoring effort and shot a season-best 53.5 percent from the field. ""I thought our energy was better tonight,"" Howard said. ""We locked in on defense and we forced some of their guys to take tough shots. I thought last game they just got any shot they wanted."" The Raptors made the game close down the stretch with 39 points in the fourth quarter, closing to within three on DeMar DeRozan's layup with 10.6 seconds left. However, Dennis Schroder converted a free throw with 6.7 seconds to re-establish a four-point Atlanta edge, and Kyle Lowry's miss on a 3 with 1.9 seconds left ended Toronto's comeback effort. Despite the frantic finish, overall Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer was pleased with his team's defensive effort. ""The first half I thought the defense was very good, there's maybe some slippage in the second but anytime you can come in here and get a win, you are doing something on both ends of the court,"" he said. Kyle Korver did his best to help on the offensive end with a season-high 19 points, including a season-high six 3-pointers, while Schroder added 24 points. For the Raptors, DeRozan had 34 points, his third straight 30-point outing and 14th of the season to tie a career high, with Lowry adding another 24, including a season-high-equaling six 3-pointers, as Toronto saw its four-game winning streak come to an end. The defeat to Atlanta was Toronto's fourth against an Eastern Conference club, but its first to someone other than Cleveland. After allowing an opponent season-high 69 points in the first half, and getting outrebounded 44-26, Toronto coach Dwane Casey was less than impressed with his team's defensive effort. That's something he has preached even as his team has scored 100 points in 13 consecutive games, the second longest streak in team history and the longest active one in the NBA. ""We scored enough points, 121 points, shooting 54 percent, 47 percent from the 3,"" Casey said. ""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where our problem is."" While Lowry agreed with his coach's assessment, he was also happy to give credit to Atlanta, particularly given the 128-84 score the last time the two teams met. ""They played aggressive and they played like they wanted to win,"" he said. ""Tip our hats to them, it's one game for us and they beat us fair and square. We will look at the film; they beat us tonight, they really beat us."" TIP-INS Hawks: G Tim Hardaway remained in the starting lineup for the third straight game even as usual starter G Kent Bazemore returned after missing the last two games with right knee soreness. Raptors: C Lucas Nogueira returned to the starting lineup after missing Wednesday's game with a sore right knee. ... The crowd at Air Canada Centre observed a moment's silence in memory of late TNT sideline reporter Craig Sager. ... In defeat, the Raptors scored at least 120 points for the eighth time this season, one shy of the franchise record of nine, set in the 2014-15 and 2005-06 seasons. SWEET 16 With his second of two free throws with 1:15 to go in the first half, Howard became the NBA's newest member of the 16,000-point club. The shot gave him a first-half high 18 points.","400899834"
"CHICAGO --  A day later, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks ran right by the Chicago Bulls again. Antetokounmpo had 22 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds, and the Bucks routed the Bulls 95-69 on Friday night for a sweep of their home-and-home series. It was a nearly identical copy of Milwaukee's 108-97 win Thursday night, except there was no closing push by Chicago this time. Led by Antetokounmpo, the younger and more athletic Bucks had six players score in double figures and shot 46 percent from the field, compared to 30 percent for the weary Bulls. ""We talked about it: We would like to duplicate what we did in Milwaukee,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""I thought our guys came out with that same intent to share the ball, move guys around. I think rebounding the ball and our defense put us in position to win a game on the road against a very talented team."" Antetokounmpo also had three steals and blocked a shot. His streak of 30-point games ended at two, but he watched the last couple of minutes from the bench with Milwaukee in complete control. The 22-year-old Antetokounmpo is averaging 27.5 points, 10.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists in his last four games. ""For me, I'm just starting to figure it out,"" he said. Greg Monroe added 14 points and 12 rebounds, and fellow reserve Mirza Teletovic finished with 13 points. The Bucks (13-12) had dropped four of five before the pair of wins against the Bulls. Chicago (13-13) lost for the sixth time in eight games in the opener of a three-game homestand. Nikola Mirotic did not play for the second straight night after he missed the pregame walkthrough, and Taj Gibson exited in the third quarter with a bruised right hip. ""Where they exposed us last night, they got us again early tonight with rebounding, points off turnovers and not getting back and building a wall defensively,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""A couple of times not getting back and not getting matched up. It's as simple as that."" Dwyane Wade scored 12 points for the Bulls, booed off the floor as the final seconds ticked off. Jimmy Butler was held to seven on 3-for-14 shooting. ""I think I've got to play better, but that's what tomorrow's for, getting in the gym and figuring it out,"" Butler said. Antetokounmpo scored 10 points to help Milwaukee to a 34-15 lead after one quarter, and he was only getting started. He had a rim-rocking dunk for a 53-31 advantage with 2:17 left in the first half, and Jabari Parker followed with a drive right by Doug McDermott for an easy layup. Antetokounmpo added a pretty lob to John Henson for a dunk in the third, and then shook the basket again on another vicious slam in the fourth, drawing a technical for hanging on the rim. MISSING MIROTIC Mirotic said he forgot about the walkthrough, and he apologized to his teammates and Hoiberg. Mirotic was fined for the unexcused absence, and said it had nothing to do with not playing Thursday night. ""No, I'm not that kind of guy. Even if things are not like how I would like them to be, I'm very professional,"" he said. ""It's not my first year here. Those guys respect me and I respect them. I would never do that, something like that."" TIP-INS Bucks: Parker, a Chicago native, had 12 points on 6-for-8 shooting. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Sacramento coach Dave Joerger returned to Memphis and left town with a win against his former team. DeMarcus Cousins scored 22 points, Kosta Koufos had 16 points and 13 rebounds, and the Sacramento Kings weathered a late Memphis rally for a 96-92 victory over the Grizzlies on Friday night. Joerger, who started as an assistant with the Grizzlies, was the head coach for three seasons. It was his first return to Memphis since he was fired after last season, ending nine years with the organization. ""It was not an enjoyable game to coach from that aspect,"" Joerger said of the return. ""But now, I'm here (with Sacramanto) and these are my guys now."" It wasn't until the final seconds that Joerger could fully enjoy the return. The Kings led by 11 with 4 minutes left, but Tony Allen, who had 16 points, scored two baskets and Troy Daniels converted a pair of 3-pointers, the last one with 55 seconds left to trim Sacramento's lead to 95-92. The Grizzlies had a chance to tie, but Mike Conley -- returning after missing nine games with a back injury -- missed a leaning 3-point attempt with 3.9 seconds left. Memphis coach David Fizdale was blunt about the Grizzlies inability to outhustle the Kings to loose balls. ""Our effort was pathetic,"" Fizdale said. Garrett Temple added 17 points and Darren Collison had 11 for Sacramento. Marc Gasol led Memphis with 20 points. Daniels finished with 13. The Kings, who led 52-42 at halftime, benefited from a poor shooting night from the Grizzlies. Every time Memphis got the deficit under double digits in the fourth, the Kings seemed to have an answer including the final push. ""We just grinded it out,"" Koufos said. ""They are an experienced team. They are going to fight the whole game. ""For us, we've got to just try and execute as much as possible and we did that."" TIP-INS Kings: G Garrett Temple started his second game of the season. ... Joerger got a mixed reception when he was introduced before the game. ... Sacramento held an opponent under 100 points for the fourth time in the last eight games. Grizzlies: Conley missed nine games after he was injured in the Nov. 28 in home game against the Charlotte Hornets. Memphis went 7-2 in his absence. ... With a free throw in the third quarter, Conley passed Pau Gasol to become the all-time leading scorer in franchise history. SHALLOW SLOGAN Memphis has a reputation for its toughness, but didn't live up to it Friday. ""They outworked us,"" guard Tony Allen said of the Kings. ""For a team that says they `grit and grind,' I don't think that should happen on our home court."" HOLIDAY RETURNS Conley wasn't the only return for Friday night's game. There are plenty of Kings who have spent time in Memphis beyond Joerger and several members of his coaching staff. Forward Matt Barnes was with the Grizzlies last season, while Koufos played two seasons in Memphis. Forward Skal Labissiere lived in Memphis before playing collegiately at Kentucky. Rudy Gay, who started his NBA career with the Grizzlies, didn't play due to a right hip flexor. SAME DAVE Asked if Joerger was different before the game, Cousins said: ""Honestly, no. He was the same guy coming in. Same message. Maybe he (thought about the return) deep down inside, but he didn't show it.""

"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets didn't seem too impressed with their latest entry in the NBA record book. The Rockets made an NBA-record 24 3-pointers, led by Eric Gordon's 7-for-12 effort, and beat the New Orleans Pelicans 122-100 Friday night. ""We just played how we play,"" said Harden, who shot 6 for 12 on 3s and finished with 29 points. ""It didn't feel no different. We shot the basketball, open 3s and you know -- they went in."" Harden also had 11 rebounds and 13 assists for his sixth triple-double of the season and 15th of his career -- passing Hakeem Olajuwon for the most in franchise history. ""The best player in Rockets history -- The Dream,"" Harden said. ""For me, it's an unbelievable accomplishment. Credit to my teammates for knocking down their shots. I'm just trying to make an impact on the game that's all."" Ryan Anderson made Houston's 24th 3-pointer of the game with 32 seconds remaining, and the Toyota Center crowd erupted in celebration of the record. Gordon confidently predicted that the best is yet to come. ""I wouldn't doubt before the season's over that we'll break that record again,"" Gordon said. ""I think it'll happen again, for sure. A lot of teams like to load up and not let us get layups and force us to shoot 3s so why not?"" In picking up their ninth straight win, the Rockets attempting 61 3s -- making 39.3 percent -- to shatter their own record of 50 set earlier this year. They broke the NBA record for 3s made in a game, shared by Houston in 2013 and Orlando in 2009. ""They've added another dimension to the game because of their ability to be able to shoot the way they do,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. Trevor Ariza added 20 points and Patrick Beverley had 13 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists for Houston. Anthony Davis scored 19 points in 22 minutes for New Orleans and rested much of the second half after Houston built a lead as big as 24 points. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry later said Davis was kicked in his lower leg and was limping so he held him from playing in the fourth quarter. Houston attempted 31 3s in the first two quarters, an NBA record for a half. The Rockets made 14 3s in the first half, entering the break with a 45.2-percent clip. Houston entered the game attempting 37.6 3s per game, tops in the league, and making 38.4 percent. Gentry said Houston's offense is fueled by Harden's abilities as a playmaker. ""He controls the game,"" Gentry said. ""The game is played at his pace. He's leading the league in assists and he has a lot of shooters around him. He can score and he's playing like an MVP candidate. If you look around the league right now, he's as good as anybody playing."" Pelicans point guard Tim Frazier played through a right wrist sprain in his hometown, several miles from his alma mater of Strake Jesuit. There was plenty of familiarity between the two teams. Three Rockets players -- Gordon, Ariza and Anderson -- played previously for New Orleans, while the Pelicans' Terrence Jones and Omer Asik are former Rockets. Additionally, Pelicans coach Gentry served as an assistant for Rockets coach D'Antoni in Phoenix. TIP-INS Pelicans: After playing 11 minutes in his first game of the season on Thursday night against Indiana, Tyreke Evans (knee) was given the night off for rest. ...

"Nerlens Noel sounds off after the 76ers' loss to the Lakers and he only plays eight minutes. (0:23) PHILADELPHIA -- The Los Angeles Lakers took advantage of a timely game against the lowly Philadelphia 76ers. Julius Randle scored nine of his 25 points in a dominating first quarter and the Lakers snapped an eight-game losing streak with a 100-89 victory Friday night. Lou Williams added 18 points and D'Angelo Russell and Nick Young had 15 points apiece. They were playing the third game of a seven-game, 12-day trip -- their longest of the season. ""It feels great,"" Young said. ""It's tough coming in after every loss, putting our heads down."" Joel Embiid scored 15 points for the 76ers. They have dropped eight straight at home to fall to an NBA-worst 6-20. ""We got jumped from the start,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Sevyn Streeter performed the national anthem wearing a ""We Matter"" jersey. The R&amp;B artist had been scheduled to sing before the 76ers' home opener in October, but was scratched by the team two minutes before the performance because she was wearing a ""We Matter"" T-shirt. Streeter came to center court on Friday in a black jersey with the words ""We Matter"" above the No. 7. She received applause upon her introduction and cheers when she completed the song. Los Angeles rebounded after a 107-97 loss at Brooklyn on Wednesday night when they shot 38.5 percent from the field, 22.2 percent from 3-point range and 61.8 percent from the free-throw line. Coach Luke Walton publicly challenged his team after the loss. ""They're competitors,"" Walton said. ""They're sick of losing."" The Lakers scored the first 13 points against the 76ers, finished the first quarter up 30-18 and led from start to finish on the way to the rout. They blew the game open in the third quarter by tallying 15 of the first 21 points, taking their biggest lead on Young's drive that made it 68-46 with 5:41 left in the period. The 76ers missed 10 of 12 shots to start the period. Philadelphia cut the third-quarter deficit to 10 points, 74-64, entering the fourth, and the 76ers got as close as seven, 80-73, on Dario Saric's 3-pointer with 9:07 remaining. But the Lakers responded with a 10-2 run to go up 90-75 with 6:19 left. The Lakers won for the first time since Nov. 30. GETTING DEFENSIVE Los Angeles held Philadelphia to 36.4 percent from the field, including 19.4 percent from the arc. Walton said the Lakers' defense was a key to the victory. ""I thought we came out and set our tone defensively early on and had one of our better defensive games,"" Walton said. ""Better communication and better effort from everybody. We had guys really committed to playing defense tonight."" THREE'S A CROWD? Philadelphia had all three of its coveted big men -- Embiid, Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel -- available together at the same time for the first time. Embiid, the third pick of the 2014 draft, missed the first two seasons with a foot injury. Noel was picked sixth in 2013 by New Orleans and traded to the 76ers. He returned Monday after recovering from offseason knee surgery only to sprain his ankle and miss Wednesday's game. Noel had two points in 8 minutes and aired his frustration afterward. ""I think I'm too good to be playing eight minutes,"" he said. ""That's crazy. Need to figure this (stuff) out."" Okafor, picked third in the 2015 draft, started alongside Embiid for the second time. He had 14 points. The duo also started in Wednesday's 123-114 loss to the Raptors and Embiid had his worst game as a pro, tallying a season-low nine points. Embiid and Okafor didn't look very comfortable together on the floor again. Both natural centers, Embiid moved to the power forward spot to accommodate Okafor. ""Never from the start to the finish did you feel like you were in any type of rhythm or flow,"" Brown said. ""It doesn't surprise me. It saddens me but it doesn't surprise me."" TIP-INS Lakers: Tarik Black (ankle) missed his sixth straight game, and Jose Calderon (right hamstring) sat out for the seventh consecutive contest. ... Russell was high school teammates with Embiid and 76ers No. 1 pick Ben Simmons at Montverde Academy in Florida. Simmons has been out all season with a foot injury. 76ers: Philadelphia shot 6-for-31 from 3-point range. ... The 76ers honored Allen Iverson for his recent induction into the Hall of Fame. Iverson rang the replica Liberty Bell in the pregame and spoke at halftime. He questioned the fortitude of present-day players. ""Not taking anything away from the new era, but I could never, ever, ever sit out of a game if something wasn't broke,"" he said","400899838"
"MIAMI --  Turns out, DeAndre Jordan does more than catch lobs. Sometimes he grabs offensive rebounds and scores to clinch games for the Los Angeles Clippers. And that was a most fitting ending on Friday night. Blake Griffin scored 20 points, Chris Paul and J.J. Redick each added 17 and the Clippers held on to beat the Miami Heat 102-98 for their fourth consecutive win. Jordan had a putback of a missed free throw by Paul with 7.7 seconds left to seal the win for Los Angeles. ""That's what he does,"" Paul said. ""Rebound, get buckets, make shots."" Jordan had 12 points and 19 rebounds, his big night coming a day after Heat center Hassan Whiteside said Jordan ""just catches lobs"" -- a comment he would insist Friday was misconstrued. ""I just wanted to come out here and get a win,"" Jordan said. Goran Dragic had 21 points and 11 assists, Justise Winslow scored 15 and Wayne Ellington added 13 points before leaving injured for Miami. Whiteside had 11 points and 17 rebounds, and wasn't on the floor for Jordan's final rebound. Miami was going with a small lineup, guessing that Paul wouldn't miss from the line and trying to set up what it figured would be a 3-point shot for a tie. ""DJ took advantage of the size and then made the shot, which was even better,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. The Clippers led by 16 in the first half. Miami got within six before Los Angeles went up 16 again in the third quarter -- then had to hang on. ""We lost this game in the first half,"" Dragic said. A three-point play by Josh Richardson with 13.2 seconds left got Miami within three, and the Heat forced a turnover on the Clippers' ensuing inbounds pass. The Clippers didn't want to give up a 3 and fouled Dragic, who made both to make it 99-98. ""A terrific second half against a team that's obviously a championship-caliber team,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""But you have to play 48 minutes."" TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles had 60 points in the first half, 42 in the second. ... It was Paul's 800th regular-season game. No one in NBA history had as many points, assists and steals through 800 games, and only John Stockton, Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson had more assists at this point in their careers. ... Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder) missed his second consecutive game. Heat: Tyler Johnson (illness) did not play. ... Ellington left in the third quarter with a right hamstring strain. ... Miami made 10 of its first 17 shots, then four of its next 17. ... Winslow met up with U.S. soccer star Jozy Altidore postgame, chatting and posing for photos. SAGER TRIBUTE The Heat had a pregame tribute video and moment of silence to honor the life of broadcaster Craig Sager, who died this week after a long fight with leukemia. Rivers was a business partner of Sager's for about nine years in a sports bar called ""Jocks &amp; Jills."" ""I didn't get any profits -- I think Craig enjoyed himself quite a bit,"" Rivers said. Spoelstra called Sager ""a pillar of greatness and character."" PIERCE IN MIAMI Paul Pierce didn't get in for the Clippers on Friday, meaning he's probably played for the last time in Miami. He has more regular-season points (1,205) against Miami than anyone in history, and no one has more than his 79 combined regular-season and playoff appearances against the Heat. Pierce has said he will retire after this season.","400899839"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Rodney Hood had never hit a game-winning shot -- at any level. So when he knocked down a big one Friday night, all he could think to do was give a little shoulder-shimmy. Hood pulled up for a 3-pointer in transition with 0.8 seconds left that gave the Utah Jazz a 103-100 win over Dallas after a furious rally by the Mavericks in the fourth quarter. ""It's crazy,"" Hood said. ""I didn't know what to do, so I just shook a little bit. It felt good, though. ""Everybody dreams of that feeling, time going down, 3-2-1, and you hit a shot and the crowd goes crazy. I did it a lot of times in my front yard, but never in a real game."" Dallas used a 9-0 run late in the fourth to tie the score at 100 before Hood grabbed the rebound of Deron Williams' miss with several seconds left. ""As a point guard, I know when to run a play,"" Williams said. ""We started the play too early. Couldn't really check the time because of how the play developed. I've just got to do a better job of controlling the game. At the end of the game like that, we've got to get the shot with as little time as possible."" Jazz coach Quin Snyder passed on calling a timeout, waving his arms at Hood to push the ball up the floor. Hood did exactly that and drained a 26-footer from the left side to send Utah to its 10th victory in 12 games. Following a timeout, Dallas had one more chance to tie it. But an inbounds pass deflected off Harrison Barnes' hands, and time expired. ""All there is, is fight in this team,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""These guys were determined to hang in."" Rudy Gobert posted his sixth straight double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds, tying Karl-Anthony Towns for the longest active streak in the NBA. Hood finished with 15 points. Barnes led the Mavericks with 21 points, and Williams added 18 points and seven assists against his former team. The normally stout Utah defense wasn't at its best and allowed Dallas to come back from a 15-point deficit, but the Jazz shot 56.9 percent from the field and held on. ""We were atrocious the first half, defensively,"" Snyder said. ""It was awful. We made so many mental mistakes. ... They can shoot, that's what they do. If you give them open 3s, they're going to make them and then they're going to get even more confident and they're going to hit tough shots."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Williams was booed lustily even though he hasn't played for Utah since 2011. ... Andrew Bogut missed his sixth consecutive game with a right knee injury. Jazz: Gordon Hayward passed Ricky Green for 10th on the team's scoring list. Hayward has 6,925 points. ... Derrick Favors played 13 minutes in his second game back from a knee injury. HILL UPDATE Jazz point guard George Hill missed his eighth consecutive game with a sprained left big toe, but Snyder said Hill is walking, shooting off his toes and doing toe raises. ""Frankly, he hasn't been able to do (that),"" Snyder said. ""I feel like he's turned a corner, being able to do a little bit more. ""Now the biggest thing, too, is once he's able to start doing things more aggressively and moving, he's going to have to start and stop. It's different than when he was coming back from his thumb. His feet, your lower body, and particularly your big toe, I don't know when you're not using it."" RETURN ON INVESTMENT Barnes entered averaging career highs in points (20.4) and rebounds (5.6). Carlisle said he expected Barnes to have a big year when the team signed him away from Golden State during the offseason. ""He's taken quantum leaps in the first two months of the season,"" Carlisle said. ""When you're third, fourth, fifth option, you're a guy that's living off other great players. He needed to develop a foundation of footwork and a means to create based on his skill set and situations on the court. ""He's done a terrific job of scoring and now he's learning how to make plays, penetrate, find guys -- those kinds of things which are essential to a guy being one of those guys.""","400899840"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook passed the credit around like he shared the ball on Saturday night. Westbrook had a career-high 22 assists in his 50th career triple-double, leading the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 114-101 victory over the Phoenix Suns. ""My teammates did a great job of spacing, catching and finishing, making some shots,"" he said. ""My job is to be able to find those guys. The ball is in my hands a lot."" Westbrook also scored 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in his 13th triple-double of the season. He had gone three games without one, yet the league's leading scorer continues to average double figures in points, rebounds and assists. Westbrook set up his teammates for much of the night, but he also showed why he averages more than 30 points per game. He scored 17 points on 5-for-9 shooting in the third quarter to help the Thunder push their lead out to 20 points. ""As the game goes on, I read and kind of see what's open,"" he said. ""And I can go back to different things that I see that's open and try to find ways to be assertive and when not to be. That's just something I've learned over the years."" Steven Adams had 19 points and seven rebounds and Enes Kanter added 12 points for Oklahoma City, which had dropped two in a row. Thunder guard Victor Oladipo, the team's No. 2 scorer for the season, missed his third straight game with a right wrist sprain. Devin Booker scored 31 points for the Suns, who have lost six of eight. The Thunder led 54-39 at halftime. Westbrook had 12 assists before the break, a Thunder record for a half. Phoenix's first-half scoring total matched the lowest allowed by the Thunder in a half all season. It took Westbrook a while to get to double figures in points -- he finally got there on a free throw with 8:41 left in the third quarter. He was stuck on nine rebounds when he went to the bench with 2:35 left in the third. He re-entered the game with 8:44 to play, and he got his 10th rebound almost immediately upon his return. ""He is putting up phenomenal numbers,"" Suns center Tyson Chandler said. ""I think it really just comes down to heart, passion and will. Every second, he is going full speed, giving 100 percent. He is just putting his will into the game."" TIP-INS Suns: F T.J. Warren returned after missing 13 games with a head injury. He scored two points in 14:28. He scored 30 points when the teams met earlier this season. ... Booker was the only Phoenix player who scored more than 12 points. Thunder: Anthony Morrow got his first start of the season in Oladipo's place and scored 11 points. ... Westbrook was issued a technical foul in the third quarter. ...

"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  The Indiana Pacers hope a renewed emphasis on defense will help turn their season around. Paul George scored 26 points and Indiana held Detroit to 38 percent shooting in a 105-90 win over the Pistons on Saturday. ""We've got to be a consistent and well-coached defensive team,"" said George, who also had seven rebounds and two steals. ""It's the consistency that we have to match every night."" Jeff Teague had 19 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the Pacers, who snapped a two-game losing streak and beat the Pistons for the third straight time. Glenn Robinson III added 12 points and 12 rebounds, and Thaddeus Young also scored 12 points on 6-for-8 shooting. Indiana had six players score in double figures and shot 48 percent from the field. But it was near the bottom of the NBA in scoring defense coming into the day, so it was its work on that side of the court that was so encouraging for George and company. ""Offensively, we'll make shots,"" George said. ""But defensively, that's got to be us."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 20 points for Detroit, and Reggie Jackson finished with 19 points and 10 assists. Tobias Harris added 13 points, and Andre Drummond grabbed 15 rebounds. The Pistons have lost three of their last four games, dropping into last place in the Central Division in the Eastern Conference. ""We're not in a good place right now,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We have to get it back together."" Detroit jumped out to an early nine-point lead, but George hit a 3-pointer to help Indiana to a 27-26 lead after one. The Pacers kept up the pressure in the second quarter and led 55-44 at the break. George and Teague each scored 14 in the first half. Indiana opened a 64-45 lead on Teague's jumper in the third. Detroit cut the deficit to 11 late in the period, but George's 3-pointer gave Indiana an 83-69 advantage heading to the fourth. ""We always want to be aggressive attacking the basket,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""If your attack forces them to commit to the ball, then you move the ball, it's a simple basketball game.""

""It's frustrating,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We're all competitive. We want to win."" Millsap's 15-foot jumper gave the Hawks a 95-94 lead with 3:51 remaining, but Belinelli answered with a layup, and the Hornets never trailed again. Williams ended the last trace of a threat, hitting a 3-pointer with 27.8 seconds left to make it a five-point game. Walker set him up with a perfect bounce pass. ""The whole game plan was to try to contain Kemba,"" Millsap said. ""Those other guys got free. Give them credit. They ran their offense and they hit some tough shots.""

"CLEVELAND --  One game off and few days of rest refreshed the Cavaliers' Big 3. LeBron James scored 16 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, Kyrie Irving matched a career high with 12 assists, Kevin Love scored 27 with 17 rebounds and Cleveland finally put away Los Angeles in the fourth quarter, beating the young Lakers 119-108 on Saturday night. The Cavs were back at full strength after coach Tyronn Lue left James, Love and Irving behind earlier this week for a game in Memphis, a decision that sparked some criticism as fans were denied a chance to see the three stars and Cleveland lost. Irving, who complained of tired legs before a game last week, looked more like himself in his first game since Dec. 10, finishing with 21 points as the Cavs improved to 19-6. ""It was just a needed rest for me,"" said Irving, who didn't get a break after Cleveland won the NBA title in June because he played for the U.S. Olympic team. ""For me, it's just about being smart and not running into that wall completely. I'm able to push through anything and my mind commands my body at the same time, it's still about being smart."" James, Irving and Love combined for 74 points, 30 rebounds and 25 assists. James, who missed the end of pregame warmups, national anthem and player introductions before running onto the floor just before the opening tip, took over in the fourth and needs just two points to move past Moses Malone (27,409) for eighth place on the career scoring list. Nick Young made eight 3-pointers and scored a season-high 32 for the Lakers, who snapped an eight-game losing streak on Friday in Philadelphia and were a headache for the defending NBA champions all night. The Lakers were still within 110-105 when James hit a 3-pointer in transition as the Cavs closed with a 10-3 run. ""Even though we lost, I liked the way we played and what we did,"" said Julius Randle, who added 16 points. ""They're a championship team, and we were right there with them until the end."" Jordan Clarkson scored 20 points and Los Angeles rookie Brandon Ingram missed a triple-double by one point and an assist. Channing Frye and James each hit a 3 to help Cleveland to a 95-86 lead early in the fourth quarter, but the Lakers refused to give in and were right there when James pulled up and knocked down his crucial  3 with 2:32 left. ""I was just in rhythm in the fourth quarter,"" James said before explaining his reason for taking a risky shot. ""That's the time when a defense is at its relaxed point, bringing the ball up in transition and they really don't think you're going to take that shot. I was in a great groove and I felt good when I let it go and I was able to knock it down."" RING TIME Before receiving his NBA championship ring, Lakers center Timofey Mozgov, who spent 1 1/2 seasons with Cleveland, was mobbed by the Cavaliers at mid-court. ""I was really proud to be with this team, it was everything I could ask for,"" said Mozgov, who received a nice ovation from Cleveland fans and visited the Cavs locker room postgame. ""It was a happy memory, and I was excited all night."" HOMECOMING Lakers forward Larry Nance Jr., who grew up outside Cleveland, played in his first regular-season game in his home state. His father, longtime Cavaliers forward Larry Nance, had his No. 22 retired by the franchise.

I don't ever see us out of a game,"" Harden said. ""We score the ball so easily, so well."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 41 points, 15 rebounds and five assists for Minnesota, and Zach LaVine scored 24 points. But the Wolves turned the ball over 22 times and couldn't get a stop down the stretch to miss their chance for their first back-to-back wins this season. ""We just let one go, that's it,"" Towns said. ""I let one go. We just have to move on to the next game and get ready."" One night after setting NBA records with 24 made 3s on 61 attempts, the Rockets started the game 7 for 29 from deep. But they found their range in the nick of time, hitting 10 of their final 22 3s, including five in the final 2:38 of regulation. Anderson's first 3 of the game-winning surge splashed through with 2:03 to play, and his second cut the deficit to 95-92 with 33 seconds to go. Ariza, who missed eight of his first nine 3s in the game, hit one from the corner to tie it at 95 with 6.5 seconds remaining. Harden opened OT with a 3, and then scored on two zig-zagging drives to the rim to put Houston in control and the Rockets withstood a late charge from Minnesota. ""We can't just let that happen,"" LaVine said. ""We played too good of a game to let that slip through our fingers."" It was a big win for the weary Rockets, who overcame a slow start to improve to 4-0 on the second night of back-to-backs. ""There was a lot of points where I'm thinking, `We're in trouble,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""The guys, that's where the chemistry comes in, and the will to win, the will to get things right and bounce back.""

GIVE AND TAKE Towns and LaVine combined for 65 points, but they also committed 14 turnovers. LaVine had eight and Towns had six, with the Rockets' double-team giving him a few issues at inopportune times. ""I'm frustrated with myself,"" LaVine said. ""Not to say the blame is on one person, but you've got to hold yourself accountable for some of the things that happen in the game. It's just a tough one.

""It's two games in a row that we've never trailed,"" said coach Michael Malone, whose Nuggets beat Portland 132-120 two days ago, posting a season high in points in the process that also coincided with the insertion of Wilson Chandler and Nikola Jokic into the starting lineup. ""If that starting group can play as well as they've played on both ends of the ball then that really helps out our deep bench when they come into the game.

Added guard Gary Harris: ""I wouldn't say we turned a corner yet but if we keep playing like this, it's going to be good."" Anthony, who missed the Knicks' loss at Golden State on Thursday night with a bruised right shoulder, had 29 points against his former team but remained winless in five trips to Denver since he was traded to New York in 2011. ""It was the lack of effort that we put out there tonight,"" Anthony said. ""To give up 127 on the road. To be honest, you can't win too many games like that. Today we played one step behind and tried to get it going. They maintained their lead and ran what they wanted to run. I just thought we didn't put forth the effort tonight."" The Knicks have dropped nine in a row in Denver overall. Kristaps Porzingis scored 22 points, but New York concluded its five-game road trip with a third consecutive loss for its first three-game slide of the season. In the first NBA matchup of brothers Willy Hernangomez of the Knicks and Juancho Hernangomez of the Nuggets, Willy finished with 17 points. Juancho didn't get into the game until the final minute and went 1 for 2 at the free-throw line. New York trailed by eight at the break, but it closed to 70-66 on a 3-pointer by Brandon Jennings.

Denver carried a 96-80 lead into the fourth quarter and stretched it to 19 when Danilo Gallinari, who came to Denver as part of the Anthony trade, connected on a 3-pointer with 6:07 left. TIP-INS Knicks: G Derrick Rose, who has been bothered by back spasms, was given the night off after experiencing some discomfort during the pregame shootaround. ""It is stiff, he tries to get it loose and then it feels like it might turn into a spasm, so he doesn't want to really jar it or turn hard on it,"" coach Jeff Hornacek said. Nuggets: Their nine consecutive wins at home against the Knicks are second only to their home streak against Chicago, which has lost 10 in a row in Denver. ... Denver's starters combined for 73 points and all five had at least 10 points for the second straight game. MISSING ROSE Hornacek admitted the absence of Rose seemed to make a difference. ""It sure looked like it,"" he said. ""Brandon (Jennings) has the ability to drive in there too, but Derrick's finishes really draw guys into the lane and then where Derrick will kick out, Brandon will dribble out, draw it to somebody, but I don't think other teams are as concerned with Brandon finishing at the basket as Derrick.""","400899846"

Durant dazzled and scored 34 points in another efficient performance from the floor, Curry added 19 points with five 3-pointers and the Golden State Warriors quickly ran away from the overmatched Portland Trail Blazers in a 135-90 win Saturday night. ""There have been moments throughout the season where I wouldn't say you're surprised but it's kind of just `Wow' moments where you appreciate the talent on this squad all the way through,"" Curry said. ""That's an amazing pass when he's obviously had it going from all over the floor and he recognized he had two people on him, found me and I was able to knock it down just in time."" Durant shot 11 for 13 with four 3s in his seventh 30-point game and also pulled down 11 rebounds in nearly 31 minutes. Klay Thompson scored 16 points, Draymond Green had 12 rebounds and 11 assists, and reserve Ian Clark added a career-high 23 points in a lopsided rematch of the Western Conference semifinals won in five games by Golden State. Damian Lillard scored 20 points playing back home and Maurice Harkless had 17, but cold-shooting Portland looked a step or two behind all night and never could stay with the deep Warriors. ""It's embarrassing to get beat by 45,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""You want to play better against the best team in the league."" Golden State won its fourth straight against Portland with the largest Warriors margin of victory in the rivalry, getting four more dunks and 11 points from JaVale McGee. Curry and Durant put on quite a show before their work was done and the fourth quarter once more belonged to the subs. That buzzer-beating 3 by Curry put Golden State up 108-72 heading into the final period, and the Warriors finished with 36 assists. Curry swished his first three 3s and then had a decent look another time but handed off to Durant, who shimmied past CJ McCollum and dribbled left into the paint before finishing with an emphatic one-handed slam with his right hand over Noah Vonleh. Durant did it again midway through the second quarter, driving left and slamming it home. The passing was pretty again after Golden State had assists on its first 36 baskets Thursday against the Knicks on the way to 41 total. The Warriors notched 30 or more assists for an NBA-best 20th time this season. Lillard scored 31 against the Warriors in Golden State's 127-104 win at Portland on Nov. 1, but didn't have enough help and the Blazers shot 39.5 percent. ""It was one of the best ones in the last couple weeks for sure because this is a hard team to guard,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of the defense. PLAYERS RETURN Zaza Pachulia returned to Golden State's starting lineup after missing four games with a bruised right wrist and contributed seven rebounds. David West, who sustained a hip pointer in the fourth quarter Thursday against New York, also played. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Stotts wouldn't confirm whether C Festus Ezeli was considering season-ending left knee surgery given he has yet to play for his new team. ""I really don't have any comment on it, on his health or any medical procedure until something is scheduled or something's actually done,"" Stotts said. ... Portland has lost five in a row and 19 of 22 in Oakland. Warriors: Durant had his third game with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds. ... Curry has 105 3-pointers in 25 regular-season games against the Blazers, his most vs. any opponent. ... Green started his 200th regular-season game. ... Clark is 17 for 19 in two games this season facing Portland, 6 of 7 from 3-point range. ""He always stays ready,"" Curry said. ... Golden State is 14-0 in its alternate slate uniform and 26-3 all time.","400899847"
"WASHINGTON --  Bradley Beal fell a point short of his career high Sunday. He'll have to settle for making a fan out of Chris Paul. Beal scored 41 points -- including 18 during the third quarter -- in the Washington Wizards' 117-110 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. In the process, he left the nine-time All-Star Paul thoroughly impressed. ""Brad looks like a totally different person,"" said Paul, who scored 13 points and had 12 assists for the Clippers. ""This is the Bradley Beal he should be all the time. Tonight he was aggressive. In order for this team to be as good as they probably want to be, he got to be like that."" Markieff Morris had 12 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter, and John Wall added 18 points and 11 assists for the Wizards. After going down by seven, Washington closed the game on a 22-8 run to seal their third straight win and fifth out of six. The Wizards shot 80 percent (12 of 15) from the floor in the fourth, and on the other end held Blake Griffin scoreless after he had scored 26 in his first three periods. ""We wanted to make him shoot jump shots,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""The ones he was making, in the second half he still made a few, but we still just wanted to stay with that strategy, and it paid off."" DeAndre Jordan added 13 points and 17 rebounds Los Angeles, which played the final 1:08 without ejected coach Doc Rivers. ""This little stretch we've been winning games, but our defense still hasn't been great,"" Paul said. ""You want to win and learn at the same time, and it finally caught up with us."" Beal hit 6 of 10 3-pointers and shot 13 of 23 from the floor during a night when he repeatedly took the initiative to drive the lane. And after his outburst in the third quarter helped Washington recover from an 11-point deficit, Beal's 3-pointer from the right off Wall's transition feed made it 102-102 with 5:01 left. Some 90 seconds later, Morris' alley-oop slam of Wall's lob gave Washington a 106-104 lead, its first after halftime. Then Morris' leaning jumper after Jordan missed a pair of free throws made the lead six. Rivers received two technicals in the aftermath, and Beal hit both foul shots to make it 116-108 with 1:08 to play. ""He was able to get to the paint, get to the rim and get to the free throw line,"" Wall said of Beal. ""We found him a couple time in transition for some 3s. He was being aggressive on his own. And that kind of helped us get back into the game."" TIP-INS Clippers: Griffin passed Elton Brand for third on the Clippers' career scoring list. ... F Luc Mbah a Moute (shoulder) returned to the starting lineup after missing two games. Wizards: F Kelly Oubre did not play and is in the league's concussion protocol after running into a screen by Detroit's Aron Baynes on Friday, coach Scott Brooks said. ... F/C Jason Smith sat out with a right hamstring injury picked up in Friday's game. AIR SHOW Three of Griffin's seven assists resulted in alley-oop dunks for Jordan, including a stunning reverse slam that made it 83-80 with 2:13 left in the third quarter. On the other end, Morris' tomahawk dunk over Marreese Speights tied it 89-89 early in the fourth and brought the Verizon Center crowd to its feet. FAMILY AFFAIR Doc Rivers' dismissal came after his son, Clippers guard Austin Rivers, received his fifth technical of the season late in the first half.","400899848"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Late in a physical, defensive showdown, the Utah Jazz discovered their 3-point shooting and broke open a close game. Gordon Hayward scored 22 points and Rudy Gobert had 21 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks, helping the Jazz beat the Memphis Grizzlies 82-73 on Sunday night. The win -- Utah's fourth straight and seventh in the last eight -- came after Boris Diaw, Hayward and Shelvin Mack connected on a trio of 3-pointers starting just short of the 4-minute mark, turning a 66-all tie into a Jazz victory. ""We had a hard time scoring in that game,"" Diaw said, adding Jazz coaches emphasized players taking open shots. ""We had a hard time scoring anyway, so why not take a chance from the 3-point line?"" Diaw had 11 points and Mack scored 10. Mike Conley led Memphis with 14 points, while Zach Randolph had 12 points and 11 rebounds. JaMychal Green added 10 points and 11 rebounds. Memphis managed only 30 percent shooting against the aggressive Jazz defense. That included the Grizzlies converting only 2 of 23 shots from outside the arc as Memphis lost its second straight. ""Our (offensive) execution is horrendous right now,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""We are just not taking pride in executing our offense with purpose."" The game featured two of the league's top defensive teams. Both entered limiting opponents to 42.9 percent shooting. Utah is first in fewest points allowed at 95.4 a game, and Memphis is third at 97.3. The Grizzlies ended with their lowest-scoring game of the season. Conley was 3 of 16 for Memphis. Marc Gasol was 4 of 22, managing a mere eight points. He also missed all five shots from outside the arc. Meanwhile, Utah made 46 percent of its shots. Gobert converted all nine of his field goal attempts, many of them on rolls to the basket resulting in alley-oop dunks. The game remained close throughout with 14 lead changes and 15 ties. ""It was a physical game, and sometimes those games are hard to shoot,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""You've just got to keep playing."" TIP-INS JAZZ: Gobert recorded his 18th double-double. ... Hayward has 16 games with at least 20 points. ... Utah tied its season mark for blocks with 11. Grizzlies: Defeated Utah 102-96 on Nov. 14, the start of a six-game winning streak for Memphis. ... F James Ennis returned to action after missing 14 games with a right calf injury. ... Vince Carter entered in the first quarter, tying Mark Jackson for 20th in career regular season games played with 1,295. GOBERT THE DEFENDER Over the previous 10 games, Gobert had held opposing centers to 8.7 points and 5.6 rebounds. Gasol had eight points and seven rebounds in this one. ""He did a great job defensively,"" Diaw said of Gobert. ""He held (Gasol) to the fewest points he's probably scored all season."" It wasn't Gasol's lowest scoring game, but close. Gasol scored six points against Minnesota on Nov. 19. HILL ON HOLD Jazz guard George Hill missed his ninth game with a sprained left big toe, and Snyder suggested his return wasn't imminent. ""I guess I'm hopeful,"" Snyder said. ""I don't know exactly where it is, whether it is a week or two weeks. ... I don't think it is day-to-day. It's days-to-days, week-to-week."" CONLEY ACHING Conley continued to struggle in his second game back after missing nine due to a lower back injury. He's 5 of 23 in the two games, including 1 of 12 from outside the arc. ""He's fighting through a lot of pain,"" Fizdale said. ""He won't tell you guys that. ... He broke his back, and he doesn't take pain medicine.""","400899849"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid took some inspiration from a 76ers great. Embiid scored 17 of his career-high 33 points in the third quarter and hit a pair of crucial free throws with 12.5 seconds left to lead the Philadelphia 76ers over the Brooklyn Nets 108-107 on Sunday night in a matchup of two of the league's worst teams. Embiid added 10 rebounds and also dived over the first row in an effort to save a loose ball, a hustle play that thrilled Philadelphia's gritty fans. A leading Rookie of the Year candidate, Embiid said plays like that are modeled after Hall of Famer Allen Iverson, who the 76ers honored during Friday night's game against the Lakers. ""A.I. kind of helped me with that,"" Embiid said. ""It was like, `Play like it's your last game.' That's what I think I've been doing. I'm sorry for that person. I think I stepped on his shoulder. I'm sorry, but I'm going to give my all every time I'm on the court."" Embiid was 12 for 17 from the field, including 2 for 3 from beyond the arc, and 7 for 8 from the free-throw line. ""He wanted to dominate the game,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Ersan Ilyasova had 22 points for the 76ers, who snapped an eight-game home losing streak while winning for the third time in 13 games. Brook Lopez had 22 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the Nets, who lost their ninth in a row on the road. ""We just couldn't get over the hump,"" Lopez said. ""I don't know if there's that much analysis to it."" The Sixers (7-20) and Nets (7-19) are tied with Dallas and Minnesota for the fewest wins in the league. Philadelphia scored the first 11 points of the fourth quarter to take its largest lead, 94-86, with 9:09 remaining on Ilyasova's long jumper. Embiid, restricted to 28 minutes by the team, went to the bench at the tail end of the run. He re-entered with 4 1/2 minutes left and Philadelphia clinging to a 97-96 lead. Lopez's drive gave the Nets a 98-97 lead before Embiid's 3-pointer from atop the key ended a nearly five-minute field goal drought and put Philadelphia in front 100-98 with 2:43 left. Lin later stripped Embiid with the Nets down by one, but Brooklyn failed on two attempts to go ahead -- Trevor Booker missed a 3-pointer and Sean Kilpatrick misfired on a short jumper. Embiid got the rebound, was fouled and made both free throws with 12.5 seconds left to give the 76ers a 104-101 lead. Lin's tying 3-point attempt went off the rim. Lin, playing in his eighth game of an injury-riddled season, had 16 points. Joe Harris tied his career high with 19 points for the Nets. ""I like our competitive spirit,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""That's been us all year. We're a team that fights and competes. Down the road, I think it's going to pay off, that attitude and grit."" EMBIID, OKAFOR START Embiid and Jahlil Okafor started alongside each other for the third straight game. After saying Saturday that incorporating three big men -- Embiid, Okafor and Nerlens Noel -- into the lineup together would be an ""extreme challenge,"" Brown said before Sunday's game that Noel only would play if Embiid or Okafor got in foul trouble. Okafor went 0 for 10 from the field with three points but had 11 rebounds. NOEL BENCHED Noel complained about the crowded situation following Friday's 100-89 loss to the Lakers in which he scored two points in eight minutes. ""I think I'm too good to be playing eight minutes,"" he said. ""That's crazy. They need to figure this (stuff) out."" Brown's solution was to bench a healthy Noel, who missed the first 23 games while recovering from offseason knee surgery. ""He hasn't been part of us,"" Brown said. ""I don't believe at this moment (playing Noel) is best for our team."" In his 2 1/2-year career, Noel has averaged 10.4 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in 29.8 minutes per game. He didn't appear at all against the Nets. TIP-INS Nets: Lopez played in his 511th game with the Nets, moving into fourth on the franchise's career list. ... Brooklyn is 1-12 on the road this season. 76ers: Nik Stauskas (left knee soreness) didn't play. ... Philadelphia shot 12 for 28 (42.9 percent) from 3-point range.","400899850"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  After Atlanta's offense exploded on them two nights earlier, the Toronto Raptors faced a similar situation in the first quarter Sunday night -- they were leaving Orlando players open, and the inferior Magic were knocking down shots. Only this time, Toronto turned things around. It got back to its defensive principles in the second quarter, and by the second half, Orlando couldn't find an open shot while the Raptors pulled away for a 109-79 victory. Toronto limited the Magic to 28 second-half points and 41 percent shooting, which was in stark contrast to Friday night when Atlanta shot nearly 54 percent from the floor while beating the Raptors 125-121. ""That was big for us after a lackluster defensive game against Atlanta,"" said Toronto coach Dwane Casey, whose team has eclipsed 100 points an NBA-best 15 straight times. ""That's the way we have to play if we are going to be important, relevant in this league. We have to play with that defensive intensity every night."" The Raptors stepped up defensively in the second half, turning a four-point halftime lead into an 84-64 edge by the end of third quarter. Orlando, which has struggled offensively throughout the season, managed just 13 points in the game-changing third quarter. The Magic were 3 for 21 from 3-point range. Evan Fournier led Orlando with 15 points but was plagued by foul trouble and turnovers. ""We didn't start the game following our game plan very well. We had a good first quarter,"" said Orlando coach Frank Vogel, whose team dropped to 5-10 at home this season. ""We didn't play team basketball and it got worse as the game went on. They made their runs and we gave in versus responding."" Much of that was because the Magic had few answers for guard DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas. Aaron Gordon and Jeff Green took turns getting beat off the dribble and on pullup jumpers by DeRozan, who finished with a game-high 31 points for his fourth-straight 30-point effort. Valanciunas dominated his old teammates Bismack Biyombo and Nikola Vucevic in the post, getting 16 points and 13 rebounds. ""Just trying to bounce back from a loss, it sucks coming off a loss,"" DeRozan said. ""You just want to do whatever you can to get a win and that was my whole mindset tonight."" TEMPORARY PROMOTION Rookie Fred VanVleet benefited from extra playing time Sunday with Cory Joseph not dressed due to flu-like symptoms. VanVleet, who has been back-and-forth to the D-League this season, had four points, four assists and three steals in 22 minutes. ""He came in and there was no let up,"" Casey said with a smile. ""I told somebody Cory better hurry up and get well. Footsteps are behind him."" UNHAPPY REUNION Biyombo likely saw his first matchup with his former Raptors teammates going differently than it did Sunday night. He had eight points, three blocked shots and 12 rebounds, but the Magic center also had four turnovers and did little to slow Valanciunas. TIP-INS Raptors: Pascal Siakam had four blocked shots in the first half but also had four fouls before halftime. Magic: Guard Jodie Meeks got a flagrant-1 for a hard foul on Lowry with 6:28 play in the second quarter. ... Elfrid Payton scored 13 points on 6-of-8 shooting off the bench in the first half. ... Orlando has not won back-to-back home games since defeating New Orleans and Dallas on Nov. 16 and Nov. 19, respectively. The Magic beat Brooklyn at home on Friday night.","400899851"
"MIAMI --  Isaiah Thomas drew blood from Justise Winslow. Other than that, most of Miami's biggest problems were self-inflicted. And the Boston Celtics reaped the benefits. Thomas scored 23 points before getting ejected, Avery Bradley added 20 and the Celtics led by 22 points in the first half before hanging on to beat the Heat 105-95 on Sunday night. ""I thought we answered their runs well,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""You knew they were going to come. ... That's a hard-playing team."" Al Horford had 17 points, eight rebounds and seven assists to help the Celtics beat Miami for the fifth consecutive time. ""We're playing well,"" Horford said. ""It shows we can close out games on the road."" Miami turned the ball over 23 times, leading to 24 Boston points. And the Heat went 6 for 14 from the foul line in the fourth quarter, 14 for 25 in the game to further cement themselves as the NBA's worst free-throw-shooting team this season. ""Every time we had an opportunity, we coughed it up right as the momentum would shift,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""That's one of our most inefficient games of the year."" Goran Dragic led all scorers with 31 points for Miami. Hassan Whiteside finished with 23 points and 17 rebounds, all but one of those rebounds coming in the second half. Thomas was ejected with 3:02 left for elbowing Winslow in the face, bloodying the Heat forward and being assessed with a flagrant-2 after a review. Winslow needed sutures postgame, but said he didn't think Thomas had intent. Neither did Stevens. ""(Referee) Tony Brothers didn't think it was a flagrant-2 but he has to go with what they say,"" Thomas said. ""I'm happy we won but I'm disappointed that they kicked me out. There's no reason for that."" Winslow missed both resulting free throws -- part of that season-long Miami problem -- but the Heat seemed sparked nonetheless. In just over a minute after Thomas' ejection, the Heat had what was a 12-point deficit down to 97-93. Dragic connected on a 3-pointer from the right corner with 2:04 remaining and Tyler Johnson added a free throw not long afterward. But the Heat got no closer. ""We've got to figure out a way to get that second-half intensity in the first half,"" Winslow said. TIP-INS Celtics: Boston's 22-point lead was the biggest deficit the Heat have faced at home this season. Utah led Miami by 21. The Celtics also led by 19 at Miami earlier this season. ... Former Heat guard Gerald Green (sore left hip) was sidelined. ... The Celtics turned Miami's first five turnovers into 12 points. Heat: Dragic was 5 for 6 on 3s. ... Wayne Ellington (hamstring) was out. His absence made Josh Richardson a starter, giving Miami its ninth lineup. ... Dion Waiters (groin) missed his 12th consecutive game. ... Whiteside's third block gave him 457 with Miami, passing Joel Anthony for No. 4 in team history. ROAD WARRIORS Later this week, Boston will wrap up a stretch where 18 of its first 29 games came on the road. No team in the NBA has played fewer home games than the Celtics so far; Sacramento has also played 11, and San Antonio played its 12th on Sunday. ""It's part of it. You've got to play 41 road games. We're playing a lot of ours early,"" Stevens said. NOT FREE The Heat are on pace for the worst free-throw shooting season in franchise history. Sunday's 14 for 25 effort dropped Miami's season percentage to .662. The 2004-05 Heat shot .672 for the franchise low mark.","400899852"
"DALLAS -- <U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD> Even after scoring a season high in points, Dorian Finney-Smith wanted to talk about his defense. The rookie had 17 points, leading six Dallas players in double figures as the Mavericks beat the Sacramento Kings 99-79 Sunday. The Mavericks, who lost to Sacramento by 31 points at home 11 days ago, started fast. They made 11 of their first 15 shots and never trailed. Later, some of his teammates teased him for passing up open shots. ""When I get a hand on a ball or a tip, it gets me going,"" Finney-Smith said. ""I try not to lose focus on what I bring to the table, and that's defense. If I'm making shots, that's a plus."" Deron Williams, Harrison Barnes and Wesley Matthews each scored 15 for Dallas. DeMarcus Cousins scored 33 for Sacramento. The Kings were minus second-leading scorer Rudy Gay, who missed his third consecutive game because of a strained right hip flexor. A 10-0 Mavericks run early in the second quarter opened a 38-26 lead and the Kings never got closer than nine for the remainder of the game. ""We've got to come out and be the aggressor, that's just plain and simple,"" Cousins said. ""We can't get off to slow starts. We can't let a team gain confidence. We've got to be the aggressors every night."" It was barely 30 degrees in Dallas and the start time was moved up three hours to 3 p.m. -- that avoided a conflict with the Cowboys, whose home game against Tampa Bay was originally scheduled for the daytime and later switched to night. Following a 120-89 home loss to the Kings on Dec. 7, the Mavericks called a team meeting. They've won three of four at home since then and are 3-3 overall. ""We remember (the loss), but the biggest thing is that our demeanor has to be like this every night,"" Matthews said. TIP-INS Kings: Cousins had 23 of Sacramento's 44 points in the first half. ... Ty Lawson was the only other Sacramento player in double figures, with 10 points. Mavericks: The Kings scored just 14 points in the third quarter, a season low for a Mavericks opponent. ... Williams had seven assists and passed current Dallas television analyst Derek Harper for 21st place on the NBA's all-time assists list with 6,584. HARRIS A HERO Devin Harris had a season-high 14 points and seven rebounds for the Mavericks. He made a three-point play and a four-point play to cap a 12-2 Dallas run that gave the Mavs a 76-56 lead with 2:33 left in the third quarter. Harris had missed the team's first 16 games with a sprained right big toe. ""When he feels good physically, he moves with joy out there,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. LET IT BEE Kings coach Dave Joerger called for a truce in an ongoing spat between Cousins and the Sacramento Bee newspaper. Cousins recently confronted a Bee writer after a column that referenced the arrest of the 6-foot-11 star's brother. ""This guy is the face of our franchise,"" Joerger said. ""He's done and said some things that he wishes he could do over. He has improved."" ""I'm not justifying anything that he's done. What he did was excessive. But enough is enough,"" he said. TRIBUTE TO SAGER The Mavericks joined the list of NBA teams to hold a moment of silence before their game in honor of TNT broadcaster Craig Sager, who died Thursday. Team owner Mark Cuban remembered Sager fondly before the game. ""Smiles are underrated,"" Cuban said. ""Nice is underrated. Getting people to smile every time -- that's something not a lot of people have been able to accomplish.""","400899853"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Before retiring Tim Duncan's No. 21, the San Antonio Spurs paid tribute to their longtime teammate by playing the game as he did for 19 seasons. LaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points and the Spurs turned in a fundamentally strong performance in a 113-100 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday. ""It was a game that we had to win, that we wanted to win badly,"" San Antonio veteran Manu Ginobili said prior to the ceremony that followed the game. ""Even if we would have lost, this is way beyond it. ""Today's celebration is very, very important for his teammates, coaches and the whole franchise, the city. That guy is special. Even if we would have lost, it would have been an emotional night. I'm emotional now and it hasn't even started."" Duncan retired in the offseason after winning five championships and two MVPs in 19 seasons, all with San Antonio. ""For us, it's harder for us to stay focused for this game,"" Spurs guard Danny Green said. ""Coming in, we knew it was going to be a lot of fun, but we wanted to be focused and respect New Orleans."" Duncan's style of play earned him the nickname ""The Big Fundamental,"" and the Spurs honored him with their own rather seamless performance against the Pelicans. San Antonio had six players score in double figures, got 31 assists on 42 baskets, committed just 13 turnovers and shot 49 percent from the field. ""Our physical effort was pretty good,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Our mental effort was better than it has been. A lot of people participated and got involved, so that was good."" Ginobili and Tony Parker, who combined to form ""The Big Three"" with Duncan, combined for 29 points, seven assists and five rebounds. San Antonio won its fourth straight overall and fourth consecutive at home after a slow start at the AT&amp;T Center. Aldridge got the Spurs' first points on a 20-foot jumper. San Antonio signed Aldridge to play alongside Duncan last season and eventually replace him at power forward. ""He was very aggressive tonight,"" Popovich said. ""He wanted the ball. He demanded the ball, and he got the ball. He was very aggressive going to the hole. Taking shots that were open."" Aldridge shot 6 for 15 from the field in 26 minutes. Alexis Ajinca led New Orleans with 16 points. Anthony Davis was limited to 12 points on 5-of-12 shooting. The Pelicans lost for the eighth time in 10 games. ""We're very inconsistent,"" Davis said. ""One game we play well offensively, defensively we're talking, and another game we're not. We've got to figure out what team we want to be identified as. We can't keep going game from game with a different identity. We've got to come out the same way."" TIP-INS Pelicans: F Solomon Hill missed the game to be with his wife after the birth of their first child. ... Quincy Pondexter has not played this season after having arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in March 2016. ... The Pelicans are 13-41 against the Spurs in franchise history, including just four wins in 28 games in San Antonio. Spurs: San Antonio retired Duncan's jersey following the game. Among his former teammates in attendance to honor Duncan were David Robinson, Bruce Bowen, Sean Elliott, Malik Rose, Antonio Daniels and Will Perdue. ... The Spurs are 10-0 this season when Tony Parker scores in double figures. Parker had 12 on 6-for-12 shooting against the Pelicans. ... San Antonio has 30 alley-oop dunks in 26 games this season. They had 18 all of last season. IS THERE A PATENT? Popovich was asked if the Spurs played harder to ensure they didn't put a damper on Duncan's retirement ceremony. Popovich responded in typical Popovich fashion. ""I brought my `I want to play for Timmy Duncan tonight' gauge,"" Popovich said, ""but I left it in the locker room so I'm not exactly sure how fired up they were.""","400899854"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana's final offensive possession didn't go according to plan, though the Pacers won't complain. Paul George was supposed to get the ball with the game tied at 105 and 4.6 seconds left. Instead, it was Thaddeus Young who popped up to the top of the key to take Jeff Teague's inbound pass. Young squared up his defender, Markieff Morris, drove to the left side of the lane and tossed in a runner with 0.9 seconds remaining to give the Pacers a 107-105 victory over the Washington Wizards on Monday night. ""The plan was to get the ball to Paul for the last shot and they denied him,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Thad came to the ball and we wanted to attack the basket. Thad did what he was supposed to do. He put his head down and attacked the basket. When the game is on the line, you want to get the ball to your best player to get a shot or get a shot for an open teammate."" George scored 27 and finished with nine rebounds. Teague added 23 points to go along with his 10 assists, but the Pacers needed the last of Young's 12 points after the Wizards scored seven straight to tie it. Young also added 11 rebounds. Bradley Beal missed a potential winning 3-pointer at the buzzer and scored 22 points. Marcin Gortat finished with 21 points and 13 rebounds, John Wall added 19 points and 10 assists, and Otto Porter Jr. scored 17 points and grabbed nine rebounds. Myles Turner finished with eight rebounds to go along with his 20 points and five blocks, including an emphatic rejection in the third quarter that sent Wall's layup into the third row of the crowd. Turner fouled out of the game with a little less than two minutes remaining. George's jumper with 2 minutes to play gave Indiana a 105-98 lead, before the Wizards fought back with a 7-0 scoring run, tying the game on Beal's jumper with 15 seconds to go. The back-and-forth scoring was a common theme during the final quarter, and one the Pacers outlasted. ""We all stuck together and continued to play hard, continued to play through adversity,"" Young said. ""We had an answer for each and every time they scored."" The start of the game had a different theme, though. The Wizards stormed out to a 12-1 lead that forced the Pacers to call timeout less than three minutes into the game. Wall and Beal each scored 10 points in the first quarter. Indiana tied it at 57 at halftime. The Pacers led 88-79 at the end of the third quarter, but the Wizards' 9-0 run to start the fourth tied it at 88, setting up the final nine minutes. ""This (loss) was a little more frustrating,"" Wall said. ""We got stops when we needed to, we executed our offense down the stretch, and we also kept the ball out of their best player's hands."" TIP-INS: Pacers: Six players scored in double figures. ... Young recorded his fourth double-double of the season. ... Turner's five blocked shots were one fewer than the Wizards had as an entire team. ... Monday was the seventh time this season Turner scored 20 or more points. Wizards: Nine of Gortat's 13 rebounds came on the defensive end. ... Gortat has 15 double-doubles this season, tying Wall for the team lead. ... Beal led the Wizards in scoring for the 10th time this season.","400899855"
"CHICAGO --  For the Chicago Bulls, snapping out of their recent slump was as simple as putting the ball in the basket. Jimmy Butler scored 19 points, Rajon Rondo had 10 points, 14 assists and eight rebounds, and the Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 113-82 on Monday night to end a three-game losing streak. ""Everything looks better when you're making shots,"" Butler said. ""If you're not making shots, it's hard to win."" Taj Gibson added 16 points, Robin Lopez had 14 and Dwyane Wade, Doug McDermott and Nikola Mirotic had 13 apiece for Chicago, which had lost six of eight. Jon Leuer scored 16 points for the Pistons, who have dropped three straight and four of five. ""We got crushed,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""It was a disgusting performance by all of us, me included. I mean, it was unprofessional, embarrassing, humiliating. Whatever you want to say, it was terrible. ""It looks to me like a lack of effort and a lack of heart. And if you don't play hard, you're not going to have any confidence. We looked like we were hoping the game would be easy tonight, and it wasn't. And we just caved."" After scoring just 69 points in a 26-point loss to Milwaukee on Friday, the Bulls busted out for 69 points in the first two quarters, their best for any half this season. Chicago, which entered tied for sixth-worst in the NBA with a .436 field-goal percentage, made 17 of 21 shots (81 percent) in taking a 35-19 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Bulls had 15 assists on their 17 field goals, with Rondo (seven) and Butler (six) leading the way. ""That ball was moving so rapidly and everybody was getting rhythm shots,"" Butler said. ""When you see your first few go in, it's a long night for whoever's guarding you."" The Bulls still were shooting a blistering 72.7 percent at halftime -- they led 69-34 -- and even managed to knock down 4 of 6 3-pointers, which had been a problem during their recent struggles. The lead was 97-63 entering the fourth quarter, and the Pistons offered little resistance from there. None of the Chicago starters played in the fourth. ""Give the guys a lot of credit for stepping up,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""Last week was an embarrassing week for everybody."" TIP-INS Pistons: They held a players-only meeting following Saturday's 15-point home loss to Indiana, but Van Gundy didn't place much significance on it. ""Team meeting my (butt),"" he said. ""Like I said before, that stuff means nothing. It's what you do on the court. Talking's easy."" Bulls: They shot a season-best 59.8 percent from the field and tied a season high with 34 assists. Their 15 first-quarter assists are tied (with Golden State) for the most assists in a quarter this season. . Their previous high for a half was 65 points in the first half of a game Oct. 31 at Brooklyn. MIROTIC RETURNS After not playing the previous two games (both coach's decisions), Mirotic entered the game with 3:39 left in the first quarter. He hit his first three shots, including a 3-pointer, and finished with 10 points in 12 first-half minutes. ""The big thing was the way he performed at practice,"" Hoiberg said. ""He has been coming in to get to work. He was the first guy in the gym four or five straight days. I wanted to get him back in there and he hit a couple of shots."" FILM STUDY A large portion of Chicago's three-hour practice on Sunday was watching lowlights of the 95-69 loss to Milwaukee on Friday. ""Everybody came in with an open mind, took the criticism that they deserved and learned from it and got better,"" Butler said.","400899856"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul Millsap took advantage of a chance to show off his rare versatility. Atlanta's 6-foot-8 forward shifted to center because Dwight Howard was out and scored a season-high 30 points, including the go-ahead 10-footer with 12.7 seconds left. He helped the Hawks overcome Russell Westbrook's 46 points and beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 110-108 on Monday night. ""It took everything we had,"" Millsap said. ""It took everybody stepping up to get this win tonight."" After Millsap's late shot, Thunder center Steven Adams rebounded a missed 3-pointer by Westbrook and dunked it, but a review determined that the basket came just after time expired. Westbrook entered the game as the NBA's leading scorer with more than 30 points per game. ""If he gets his points -- he's going to get that regardless,"" Millsap said. ""The game plan was try to take everybody else out of it."" Westbrook, who made 16 of 33 shots and had 11 rebounds and seven assists, was unimpressed with his effort. ""No, we don't have any moral victories around here, buddy,"" he said. Dennis Schroder scored 31 points and made 10 of 16 shots for the Hawks, who have won four of six after a six-game losing streak. ""Pretty special effort by the guys tonight, to come in here down Dwight, without him, and to find a way to compete against a great rebounding team and an individual player that's playing just lights-out basketball,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I was very proud of our players."" Jerami Grant scored a season-high 15 points, and Andre Roberson matched a season high with 14 points for the Thunder. Westbrook scored 18 points in the second quarter to help the Thunder take a 53-48 lead. The Hawks shot 50 percent in the first half, but without Howard, they were outrebounded 27-14, and the Thunder outscored them 10-0 on second-chance points. Schroder scored 18 points in the first half, and Millsap added 16. The Hawks closed the third quarter well to take an 81-78 lead into the fourth, then Atlanta held on. ""They made some tough plays toward the end of the game,"" Thunder guard Semaj Christon said. ""We can do better on defense keeping the guys in front of us without fouling."" --- TIP INS Hawks: F/C Mike Muscala tipped the ball into his own basket while trying to grab a rebound in the first quarter.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Karl-Anthony Towns has watched his Minnesota Timberwolves give up so many leads this season that he had finally had enough. Once he made up his mind, the Phoenix Suns couldn't hold him down. Towns had 28 points and 15 rebounds, and the Timberwolves beat the Phoenix Suns 115-108 on Monday night. ""I was going to do everything in my power and my part to ensure we didn't come out of tonight with a loss,"" Towns said. Andrew Wiggins scored 26 points and Zach LaVine added 23 for the Timberwolves. Ricky Rubio had 12 assists and Minnesota picked up its first win at home since Nov. 17. Eric Bledsoe scored 27 points for the Suns, who have lost three straight and four out of five. Brandon Knight had 21 points off the bench and Devin Booker scored 18 on 6-for-15 shooting for Phoenix. The game figured to be heavy on offense, with two young teams far more concerned with putting the ball in the basket than stopping anyone on the other end. The Suns came into the game second in the league in pace, second in fast-break points and third in points off turnovers. And the Wolves are the first team in history to have three 21-year-olds averaging at least 20 points per game. ""One thing we know we need to get better at is our toughness,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""That's not a stat. We have to become more feisty because we are small on the perimeter."" The Wolves built a 14-point lead in the first half, but have given away double-digit leads all season long. They were coming off a particularly disheartening loss against Houston on Saturday night in which they blew a 12-point lead with two minutes to play before losing in overtime. Phoenix cut the deficit to two points several times in the fourth, but the Wolves had an answer each time. After Phoenix cut the Wolves' lead to 105-103 with four minutes to play, Towns grabbed two offensive rebounds against Tyson Chandler, who ranks fifth in the NBA in rebounding, and scored on the second putback after getting fouled. Towns let out a yell and pounded his bicep, then swished the free throw for a five-point lead. The play ignited a 10-2 run that put away the game. ""Even missing the first one, I was determined to get that second one,"" Towns said. ""I would've gotten a foul running over someone to get it. Every single ounce of energy I had left to make sure I go up and get that ball."" That kind of intensity is what Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau has been trying to instill from the start. ""Great, multiple-effort play,"" Thibodeau said. ""That's will and determination and often times that's the difference right there between winning and losing."" TIP-INS Suns: Knight made 8 of 13 shots, and his efficiency in the first half kept the game from getting away from the Suns while Booker and Bledsoe started 3 for 14. ... Jared Dudley scored 12 and Leandro Barbosa had 10 points for the Suns bench, which outscored Minnesota's 44-20. ... The Suns missed 10 free throws. Timberwolves: Rubio made two technical free throws to run his streak to 34 straight without a miss. That's the longest active streak in the league after Stephen Curry's ended at 44 in a row last week. ... The Wolves went 24 for 25 from the line. VOLATILE SUNS Marqueese Chriss and P.J. Tucker both picked up technical fouls for arguing with the officials, and the Suns had trouble keeping their composure for much of the night. Chriss was particularly erratic, barking at officials Monty McCutcheon, David Guthrie and Kane Fitzgerald and wrestling with Towns under the basket. Tucker voiced his displeasure often while guarding Wiggins, with officials not letting him play as physical as the burly forward likes to on that end. ""We let it get to us early as far as the refs and the other team, we let it get to us and we could never recuperate from it,"" Bledsoe said.","400899858"
"DENVER --  Foul trouble kept Nikola Jokic from playing more minutes the past two games. He showed what he can do when he stays on the floor. Jokic had 27 points and 15 rebounds, Gary Harris scored a career-high 24 points and the Denver Nuggets beat the Dallas Mavericks 117-107 on Monday night. Jokic finished an assist shy of his first career triple-double and tied his career high in points to help the Nuggets win their third straight game. Emmanuel Mudiay scored 18 points. Jokic averaged only 20 minutes in the first two games of the homestand after committing five fouls each game. It derailed potential big nights, but he had just one foul against the Mavericks and dominated. ""Mike told me he was going to beat me if I made more stupid fouls,"" Jokic said of coach Michael Malone. ""I listened."" Deron Williams led Dallas with 23 points and eight assists. Denver's recent offensive surge started after its 20-point loss in Dallas on Dec. 12. Malone shook up his starting lineup and the Nuggets have responded by scoring 30 or more points in eight of the last 12 quarters and are averaging 125.3 points since the change. They've gotten it done with contributions from different players and Harris was a big contributor Monday. The third-year guard out of Michigan State is averaging 19.3 points since returning from a foot injury. ""He has three games back and I don't think it's a coincidence that we have won three games in a row,"" Malone said. Harris got the Nuggets started early, scoring 16 in the first half as Denver overcame a 16-point deficit to lead by two at the break. The lead grew to 12 in the third but Dallas made a run to get within six late in the fourth. Jokic hit a 3-pointer, a short jumper and fed Wilson Chandler for a layup for his ninth assist. ""When you have a guy playing that well you want him to get it,"" teammate Jameer Nelson said of the triple-double. ""That's a heck of an accomplishment for an individual. It means he's playing the game the right way."" Jokic had a chance for his 10th assist but Mudiay missed his only 3-pointer off a pass. Jokic wasn't concerned about missing out on the feat. ""It doesn't really matter,"" he said. ""The game is more important than your name."" The Mavericks ran out of gas after playing Sunday afternoon. ""They wore us down as the game went on,"" Williams said. ""They came out and hit a lot of 3s in the second half and got the lead. We battled but we couldn't outlast them."" TIP-INS Mavericks: G J.J. Barea returned to the lineup after missing a month with a strained right calf. He had 11 points in 13 minutes. ... Andrew Bogut (right knee) and Dirk Nowitzki (right Achilles) are hoping to return for the start of 2017. Nuggets: G Jamal Murray played despite a sore right foot. He had three points in 14 minutes. ... C Jusuf Nurkic didn't play a game after logging just eight minutes. TALL TALE Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle joked before Monday's game that Jokic was taller than his listed 6-foot-11. ""That's (ridiculous). He is probably like 7-4,"" Carlisle said. ""His arms are crazy long. He's a guy that's plays an on-the-floor game but he is some player. Some of his passing is ridiculously creative and he can make shots. We know he can grab it and put in the basket because he did it about six times last game."" He was equally impressed after Monday's performance. ""He kicked our (butt) last game too,"" he said. ""It's not a surprise; he's good.""","400899859"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Anthony Davis and the Pelicans got going in a big way after a slow start. Davis had 31 points and 16 rebounds to lead New Orleans over the Philadelphia 76ers 108-93 on Tuesday night in a matchup of struggling teams. Davis scored 11 in New Orleans' dominant second quarter and Terrence Jones finished with 17 points and 10 boards for the Pelicans, who avenged a Dec. 8 home loss to the 76ers while winning for only the third time in 11 games. ""We just tried to make this a statement game for us,"" Davis said. Perhaps they were trying too hard in the opening quarter. Davis went 1 for 8 from the field, New Orleans was 6 for 22 and the Pelicans trailed 23-15 after one. ""We just had to find our rhythm,"" Davis said. ""We just weren't moving the ball in that first quarter."" They figured things out from that point on. Davis and Tim Frazier combined for 21 points in the second period as the Pelicans doubled up the Sixers 42-21 to take a 57-44 halftime lead. Davis missed eight of his first nine shots but finished 12 for 30. ""My jump shot wasn't on tonight, so I started going to the rim,"" Davis said. ""You just adjust to the game. I wasn't going to keep settling. I just had to attack, and that's it."" New Orleans shot 55.6 percent (15 for 27) from the field, including 66.7 percent (4 for 6) from 3-point range, in the second. The 42 points represented the most in a quarter for the Pelicans all season. ""I thought we did a good job of just moving the basketball, moving people into space and taking the opportunities that were there,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. Ersan Ilyasova had 14 points to pace Philadelphia (7-21). ""That was the game,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said of the second quarter. ""The other periods are acceptable."" The Pelicans (10-20) built on their 13-point halftime lead and were up 18 early in the fourth quarter. Philadelphia got as close as 95-88 on Nik Stauskas' 3-pointer with 5:25 left and had chances to pull closer, but misfired on two straight possessions. Ultimately, the Sixers couldn't overcome the second period. ""That's a lot of points for one period,"" Philadelphia's Jahlil Okafor said. ""That really got them going for the rest of the game."" New Orleans shot 48 percent (34 for 71) from the field after the opening 12 minutes. NOEL, NOEL Brown sat ineffective big men Joel Embiid and Okafor for most of the third quarter, instead inserting Nerlens Noel with 6:49 left in the period. Noel has been the odd man out at a crowded center spot. Brown said Sunday that Noel, a 2013 first-round draft pick who missed the first 23 games while recovering from knee surgery, won't be part of the regular rotation while he sees if Embiid and Okafor are a fit on the floor together. Embiid and Okafor started alongside each other for the fourth straight game. Both had 11 points. Fans gave Noel a rousing ovation when he entered and a louder cheer when he scored on a follow basket with 5:40 left in the third. ""I just really want to thank the fans for how they supported me,"" Noel said. ""That really meant a lot to me. I got the chills."" Brown also was grateful for the crowd's response. ""I can see why they would do that,"" he said. ""Nerlen plays hard, he plays defense, he's appreciated by the city. It didn't surprise me. I was glad they gave him a warm welcome."" HOT HIELD Pelicans rookie guard Buddy Hield scored 10 points and continued his strong shooting from outside. Hield was 2 for 2 from 3-point range and is shooting 52 percent (25 for 48) from beyond the arc this month. TIP-INS Pelicans: Tyreke Evans (rest) didn't play. ... Solomon Hill returned to the lineup after missing two games for the birth of his daughter. Hill had two points and three rebounds in 33 minutes. ... Jrue Holiday played his first four seasons with Philadelphia. 76ers: Stauskas returned from a one-game absence due to left knee soreness only to leave in the first quarter after going hard to the floor on a charge against Frazier. Stauskas returned in the third quarter. ... Philadelphia finished 1/3 on a four-game homestand.","400899860"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  After watching the Los Angeles Lakers set a season high in points in a half, knock down 12 of 18 3-pointers and seize a 73-59 advantage at intermission, Hornets coach Steve Clifford was unusually calm at halftime. ""I was surprised because he wasn't mad, actually,"" Charlotte guard Nicolas Batum said. ""He just told us to wake up."" The Hornets did. Led by 15 third-quarter points from guard Kemba Walker, 11 fourth-quarter points from Marco Belinelli and even a little bit of defense in the second half, the Hornets rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat the Lakers 117-113 on Tuesday night. Walker had 28 points and 10 assists and also contributed a key offensive rebound with 27.9 seconds left to set up a tiebreaking jumper by Batum with 13 seconds remaining. Batum had 23 points on 8-of-12 shooting and added 10 assists. Belinelli finished with 13 points. Jordan Clarkson paced the Lakers with 25 points behind 7-of-9 3-point shooting, and Nick Young added 24 points while hitting 5 of 10 from 3-point range. Los Angeles made 16 of 33 3-point attempts (48.5 percent), but the Hornets still secured their second straight victory. The Lakers, meanwhile, fell for the 10th time in their last 11 games. Los Angeles made four 3-pointers, including three from Clarkson, during a 15-0 run bridging the first and second quarters to lead 53-35. Clarkson made five 3-pointers before missing a shot from beyond the arc while the Lakers constructed that big halftime advantage. Los Angeles coach Luke Walton knew his team couldn't coast, though. ""You've got to know that when you're playing a playoff team that building up a lead in the first half doesn't really mean much,"" Walton said ""They're not going to fold. There's a reason they've had success the last couple years. You've got to be ready to match that intensity."" In the third quarter, the Lakers' lead evaporated when the Hornets mirrored the 15 unanswered points to close to 77-75 with 8:00 left in the quarter. Batum and Walker each had six points in that stretch. Walker made 7 of 11 shots in the third, helping the Hornets lead 88-83 with 4:15 left in the quarter. It quickly disappeared after an 11-point spurt by the Lakers. Belinelli made 3 of 5 3-point attempts in the fourth quarter to help the Hornets close the deficit, including a 3-pointer with 2:22 remaining to knot the score 113-113. ""It should have never been that close,"" Young said. ""It hurts."" TIP-INS Lakers: The Lakers' 16 3-pointers matched a season high. ... D'Angelo Russell returned after missing one game with a sore left knee. He had missed 12 games with the injury before returning Dec. 11. ... Forward/center Tarik Black missed the game with a sprained ankle. Hornets: Batum logged his eighth double-double of the season. . The Hornets have now twice overcome 19-point deficits for victories this season. They also did so Oct. 28 at Miami. . Charlotte held a moment of silence before the game for TNT sideline reporter Craig Sager, who died this week from leukemia. NANCE HURT Forward Larry Nance Jr. limped off the court holding his left knee with 4:15 left in the third quarter after scrambling for a loose ball. He did not return. Walton had no updates afterward, but was worried about the possibility of Nance missing time with the injury. INGRAM HOMECOMING Rookie forward Brandon Ingram hails from Kinston, about a four-hour drive from Charlotte. More than 500 people from his hometown made the trip to watch his first appearance in North Carolina since he played at Duke. Kinston's population is about 21,000. Ingram scored his first bucket of the game on a driving spin move with 3:01 left in the second quarter, earning a loud chorus of oohs and cheers from the Spectrum Center crowd.","400899861"
"TORONTO --  For the Toronto Raptors, one of the most enjoyable things about their latest victory was the way they got almost everyone involved. Kyle Lowry had 23 points and eight assists, Norman Powell scored a season-high 21 off the bench and the Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets 116-104 on Tuesday night. Lowry, who shot 8 of 12 from the field and 3 of 5 on 3-pointers, added four rebounds before sitting out the final 6 minutes as the first-place Raptors (20-8) won for the 12th time in 14 games. DeMarre Carroll added 17 points and Jonas Valanciunas had 10 points and 14 rebounds. Six different Raptors scored in double figures. Toronto, which has won five straight meetings with the Nets, never trailed and led by as many as 23. ""I had a lot of fun out there. I think the whole team did tonight,"" Powell said. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 19 points, six rebounds and three assists for the Nets (7-20), who lost their third straight and fifth in six games. Spencer Dinwiddie added 14 points, and Justin Hamilton grabbed a career-high 11 rebounds. It was the 10th straight road loss for the Nets. They are 1-13 away from home this season. ""We didn't have a lot of intensity,"" former Raptors big man Luis Scola said. ""We weren't really playing like we should have been playing. Eventually, they made a run."" The Raptors led 91-72 going into the fourth quarter thanks to a balanced offense. Five Toronto players scored in double figures through three, led by Lowry and Carroll with 17 apiece. The Nets shot just 36 percent from the field through three quarters, including 26 percent from 3-point range. The Raptors were at 49 percent overall, including 44 percent from beyond the arc. Toronto took a 64-46 lead into the halftime break. The Nets cut the lead to four on Jeremy Lin's 3 with 4:33 to go in the second, but the Raptors closed the half on a 17-3 run to take control. ""I was upset at halftime,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I told the team our inability to get back on defense just wasn't good enough. ""I was proud of the way our guys competed in the second half. In the first half, it wasn't good enough."" Nearly half of the Nets' field goal attempts in the first half, 22 of 45 shots, were from 3-point range. They hit seven of them, while the Raptors were 5 for 9 from beyond the arc through two quarters. The Raptors led 29-23 after one. They shot 52 percent from the field and every starter made at least one field goal. The Nets hit 43 percent from the floor in the quarter. Lin, who finished with 12 points and four assists, said it ""felt like we didn't play as hard as we were supposed to and that's never a good thing."" ""We didn't do a good job of getting stops,"" Lin said of Toronto's decisive run to close out the second quarter. ""They did whatever they wanted, killed us in transition, they got to the free throw line and they got offensive rebounds. ""We didn't play with heart tonight."" The comfortable lead gave the Raptors an opportunity to rest Valanciunas, who played just 22 minutes, and DeMar DeRozan, who had 15 points before sitting out the entire fourth quarter. ""Everyone is just involved and has the confidence to go out there and just play their game, and no one's worried about anything but us winning as a team,"" said Lowry, who logged 34 minutes.

"NEW YORK --  The New York Knicks hadn't won all season when trailing after three quarters, and it appeared they were falling too far behind for that change. But once Carmelo Anthony hit a few shots, it did. Anthony matched a season high with 35 points and the Knicks used a big second-half turnaround to beat the Indiana Pacers 118-111 on Tuesday night. The Knicks fell behind by 15 in the third quarter, then suddenly seized control to snap a three-game losing streak. Anthony scored 26 in the second half. ""Once we made some shots, we got some stops defensively, you could feel that momentum changing,"" Anthony said. Derrick Rose had 24 points and Kristaps Porzingis added 21 for the Knicks, who returned home after a poor finish to their five-game trip out West. They started slowly but improved to 10-4 at home. ""We were kind of playing like we did those last three games of the road trip,"" coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""Not a lot of energy, and then you get a couple shots to go down, all of a sudden you can build on that momentum."" The Knicks improved to 1-12 when trailing after three. Thaddeus Young and Myles Turner each scored 21 points for the Pacers, who seemed headed to a third straight victory for about 30 minutes. It was mostly all New York from there as Indiana had its seven-game winning streak in the series snapped. ""It's frustrating. We just can't get the job done,"" said Paul George, who was 1 for 8 in the second half. ""Inconsistent team. That's all there is about this team. It's just an inconsistent team."" With the Pacers playing for the second straight night and Hornacek saying his team looked a little tired Monday at practice after the long trip, the game had a sluggish start. It picked up in the second quarter before both teams had big moments in the third.

"MIAMI --  Being down five in the final minute of regulation did not doom the Orlando Magic, nor did a four-point deficit late in the first overtime. Instead, they fought back and got a rare win over their Florida rival. Nik Vucevic had 26 points and 12 rebounds, Evan Fournier scored 26 and hit the 3-pointer with 1:26 left that put Orlando up for good, and the Magic topped the Heat 136-130 in double overtime Tuesday night. ""We kept fighting,"" Fournier said, ""and it paid off for us."" Tyler Johnson had a career-high 32 points, the most any Heat reserve has ever scored in a game. Hassan Whiteside had 32 points and 15 rebounds for Miami, which wasted a five-point lead in the final minute of regulation and a four-point lead in the last 40 seconds of the first overtime. Goran Dragic added 19 for Miami. The Heat -- the NBA's worst foul-shooting team -- missed one late in regulation that could have made it a three-point game, and four straight from the line in the first overtime that proved costly. ""There's some really good things that happened over the course of the game,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""That's why I really feel for the guys in the locker room. Team really competed ... and I love going through those moments."" Elfrid Payton scored 22 points and Serge Ibaka added 20 for the Magic, who beat Miami for the third time in the last 19 meetings. The game came two days after the Magic lost by 30 at home against Toronto, and Orlando coach Frank Vogel wouldn't let his team forget. ""That was the challenge that was presented to each guy every time we got down tonight: `Are we going to give or are we going to fight?"" Vogel said. ""And our guys responded in a big-time way."" Miami led by 12 in the first half and by nine early in the fourth. But Orlando went on a 12-0 run later in the final quarter, then rallied twice more in the extra sessions.

""The bigger, more pressing question is why we haven't had success at home. I think we're a solid basketball team with realistic playoff aspirations.""

"MILWAUKEE -- LeBron James had a big night beyond the arc and capped it with three pivotal points. James buried a go-ahead 3-pointer with 24 seconds left in overtime and the Cleveland Cavaliers held on for a 114-108 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night to avenge a late November loss. ""It's something I practice before the game, it's something I do on practice days and I was shooting the ball extremely well tonight from the perimeter,"" said James, who matched his season high with five 3-pointers. ""So, I just trust it. I trust in what I've been doing and the work I've been putting into it and knock it down."" Milwaukee took a 108-107 lead on a tip-in by Giannis Antetokounmpo with 1:12 left. Cleveland's Kyrie Irving missed a 3-pointer from the left corner on the next possession, but Jabari Parker's lay-in attempt at the other end curled out. James was fouled on the rebound by Antetokounmpo, his sixth. James then hit the deep 3-pointer to put Cleveland up 110-108. ""That 3 hurt us,"" Parker said. ""He's the best player in the world. He doesn't care how far it is. You've got to respect him."" Parker was fouled on a layup attempt on the ensuing possession but missed both free throws. Irving hit a pair of free throws with 15.7 seconds left to make it 112-108. James had 34 points and Irving 28 for Cleveland, which had lost at Milwaukee 118-101 on Nov. 29. Parker had 30 points and Antetokounmpo added 25. The two teams meet again Wednesday night in Cleveland. ""Jabari took advantage of some of our smaller guys when we had them on him, getting to the basket, kind of being physical,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""So we've got to do a better job with that matchup."" The Bucks scored the final seven points of regulation to send it into overtime tied at 100. Parker scored on a drive to put Milwaukee up 104-102, but Richard Jefferson was fouled on a 3-point attempt and hit all three free throws to put Cleveland back ahead 105-104. Antetokounmpo answered with a short jumper from the lane to put the Bucks in front 106-105. Jefferson scored on a baseline drive, but Antetokounmpo made a tip-in to give the Bucks the 108-107 lead with 1:12 left. The Cavaliers took a 100-93 lead on Irving's 3-pointer with 2:32 left in regulation, but Greg Monroe's inside basket and Tony Snell's 3-pointer cut it to 100-98 with 47 seconds remaining. After a missed 3-pointer by James, Parker scored on an inside spin move from the left side to tie it at 100 with 15.5 seconds left. Irving missed a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 1 second left. ""We get them again tomorrow in Cleveland,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""We can watch video, clean up some mistakes and give them another run tomorrow. Understanding that small plays mean everything. Coming up with loose balls, being able to finish plays on the defensive end and, hopefully, a couple more shots go down for us tomorrow."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland was without F Kevin Love, sidelined with a bruised left knee. Jefferson started in his place. Love (22.3 points per game and team-high 10.7 rebounds per game) is questionable for Wednesday's game against the Bucks in Cleveland Bucks: Reserve F Michael Beasley (8.3 points per game), one of the top contributors off the bench, was out for the third straight game with a sprained left foot.

SMITH INJURES THUMB Cavaliers G J.R. Smith injured his right thumb late in the first half and did not return. He is scheduled to be examined Wednesday in Cleveland. LONG-RANGE CAVALIERS Cleveland's 17 3-pointers matched the most given up by the Bucks this season. The Cavaliers were 17 of 40 beyond the arc, while the Bucks were 7 of 27.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  After an anemic first half for the Boston Celtics, guard Isaiah Thomas knew things had to change. Thomas took it upon himself to push the Celtics past a 17-point second-half deficit and into overtime for a 112-109 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. Thomas scored a career-high 44 points, including 36 after halftime. He also matched his career best for 3-pointers, going 7 of 10 from outside the arc. ""I just told myself to be a little more aggressive and look for my shot a little more,"" Thomas said, later adding: ""I wasn't trying to get 40, but I knew I needed to be more aggressive."" After the Grizzlies took a 106-105 lead on a rebound basket by Tony Allen with 1:10 left in the extra period, Boston scored the next five points. Al Horford had 17 points and 14 rebounds for the Celtics, who won their third straight. Avery Bradley added 16 points. Memphis coasted to a 45-31 lead in the first half. Then the Grizzlies looked as though they were coasting through the second half -- and not in a good way. ""Basically, we stayed in the locker room at halftime,"" coach David Fizdale said. Marc Gasol and Troy Daniels led Memphis with 24 points apiece. Mike Conley had 19 points and eight assists for the Grizzlies, who lost their third in a row -- all at home. Both teams had last-second opportunities to win in regulation. Gasol's turnaround 8-footer with 2 seconds left in regulation bounced off the rim. With less than a second left, Horford failed to convert an inbounds pass at the rim, sending the game to overtime at 97-all. ""Coach (Brad Stevens) told us at halftime, `Just stay with it. Stay composed,"" Horford said. ""We had an awful first half, and he just said, `If you guys stay with it, I guarantee you that you'll get hot, you'll get to scoring.' ""We believed, and we kept playing."" TIP-INS Celtics: Thomas has led the Celtics in scoring the last three games. He scored 37 points two times previously this season.

Boston played its first overtime game of the season. Grizzlies: Gasol, who missed all nine of his 3-pointers over the last two games, converted his first two attempts against Boston. ... Memphis, which shot 30 percent in Sunday's loss to the Jazz, made only one of its first 11 shots. ... By the middle of the second quarter, Memphis already had 10 offensive rebounds, the 10th straight game in which the Grizzlies reached that mark. ...

MOTIVATING ISAIAH Thomas said he got some motivation from assistant coach Jerome Allen at halftime. ""He said, `We need 40 out of you to win,"" Thomas said, adding that Allen told the guard he wasn't built to score 40 points. ""We were joking around, but I was like, `I got you.'

"HOUSTON --  There was no trick or secret to how Patty Mills got wide open for the winning shot on Tuesday night. ""I have no clue, mate,"" he said. ""I didn't do anything other than just stand there. It was a (heck) of a pass right in the shot pocket."" Mills hit a 3-pointer with 12.9 seconds left to lift the San Antonio Spurs over the Houston Rockets 102-100. Eric Gordon missed a 3-point attempt after that before Manu Ginobili missed two free throws to give Houston one last chance, but James Harden's 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. ""The biggest thing that happened is that we had about three or four wide open shots we missed,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. The victory is San Antonio's fifth straight and improves the Spurs to 15-1 on the road. It also snaps Houston's NBA-best 10-game winning streak. Kawhi Leonard led the Spurs with 21 points, and LaMarcus Aldridge added 17 points with 10 rebounds. Harden finished with 31 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. ""It's real tough, especially when we let two big leads slip away,"" Harden said. ""We've got to close the game out. ... I didn't close the right way. We didn't close the right way as a team."" A 3-pointer by Danny Green with less than a minute left got the Spurs within 100-99. Houston then committed two turnovers in less than 10 seconds to give San Antonio the ball back with 28.5 seconds left and set up the wide-open shot by Mills, who had 13 points. The Rockets hadn't scored in more than two minutes when Harden drove into the lane and made a layup with 2:29 left. Trevor Ariza followed with a layup before stealing the ball from Leonard, making it 100-94. The Spurs were down by five midway through the fourth quarter before Houston used a 9-1 run to extend the lead to 96-83. San Antonio got hot after that, scoring the next 11 points to get within 96-94 with less than three minutes to go. The Spurs made three 3-pointers, capped by one from Green, to close the gap and were helped by two turnovers by Houston. San Antonio opened the fourth quarter with a 9-1 run to take an 80-79 lead with about 10 minutes left. Ginobili and Mills hit consecutive 3-pointers at the end of that span to spur D'Antoni to take a timeout. Houston's Sam Dekker got the crowd going soon after that when he leaped to steal a pass by Ginobili and crashed to the court as he was fouled after he drove into the lane for a shot on the other end. He made both free throws to leave Houston up 85-80. TIP-INS Spurs: Aldridge has scored at least 10 points in 23 of 25 games this season. ... Pau Gasol had 10 points and 10 rebounds. ... San Antonio made 12 3-pointers. Rockets: Nene had 10 points and seven rebounds in his first start this season. ... Dekker, who sat out all of his rookie season last year after back surgery, had 10 points to give him at least 10 points in nine games this season. ... Harden was named Western Conference player of the week on Monday. It was his 11th time winning the award and second time this season. ... Ariza had four steals to give him at least three in five straight games. CAPELA OUT Houston center Clint Capela is expected to miss at least four weeks after an MRI revealed he has a small fracture on his left fibula. Capela has averaged 11.8 points, eight rebounds and 1.6 blocks this season. SHOOTING WOES After making at least 15 3-pointers in an NBA-record five straight games, the Rockets struggled from long range, making just 6 of 38 tries. ""We got a break because they shot terribly,"" Ginobili said. ""We did a pretty good job of contesting many of them but they (missed) some open ones, too, and that's not what they usually do."" Houston shot a season-low 38 percent overall and fell to 1-2 this season when shooting below 40 percent. ""We missed 30 (something) 3's and we still had a chance to win the game,"" Harden said. ""We should have won the game but ... give them credit, they made shots.""","400899867"
"LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Clippers didn't miss a beat in their first game without Blake Griffin. J.J. Redick scored 27 points, including 7-for-9 shooting on 3-pointers, Chris Paul had 16 points, 15 assists and eight rebounds, and the Clippers defeated the Denver Nuggets 119-102 Tuesday night.. Los Angeles was playing for the first time since losing leading-scorer Griffin up to six weeks after knee surgery. Last season, Griffin missed 41 games with an injury. The Clippers stretched their lead to 29 points in the third quarter and then sat their starters the entire fourth quarter. ""They clearly know they have a much smaller margin for error without Blake,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Without him, this group knows we have to play very well to win games, and very hard, and I think you can see that."" DeAndre Jordan had 13 points and 13 rebounds, and Luc Mbah a Moute added 14 points for the Clippers, who won for the fifth time in six games. The Clippers got a solid defensive effort for most of the night, holding the Nuggets to 39.4 percent shooting through the opening three quarters. ""They came out and played with great energy and a great sense of urgency and we were just a step slow most of the night,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We struggled to score. We couldn't make a shot."" Will Barton led the Nuggets with 22 points off the bench, with Danilo Gallinari adding 17 points. Denver snapped a three-game win streak. The Clippers shot 44 percent on 3s (16 for 36), and hit 56 percent (38 of 68) overall. ""Especially with that first group having played so many games without Blake last year, there is some familiarity with that group,"" Redick said. The Clippers jumped out to 16-point lead in the first quarter, but the Nuggets rallied to pull within to 46-44. The Clippers closed the half with a 23-9 run. The Nuggets trailed by double-digits the rest of the game and were down by 23 after the third quarter. ""J.J. Redick was the story of the game,"" Malone said. ""We had no answers for him. They did a great job of getting him open and finding him."" TIP INS Nuggets: PG Emmanuel Mudiay struggled in his matchup against Paul. He missed all nine of his shots to finish scoreless, with five rebounds and one assist. ... Fellow starting guard Gary Harris was 1 for 6 for three points, meaning the Clippers starting backcourt outscored the Nuggets' 43-3. Clippers: Paul Pierce, 39, started in place of Griffin but played just 19 minutes. It was only his eighth game of the year and second start. He hit two of six field goals to finish with seven pints and one rebound. GRIFFIN SURGERY The Clippers called Griffin's right knee surgery to remove loose bodies a success and said he would be out between four-to-six weeks. The surgery was performed Tuesday by Dr. Neal ElAttrache. If Griffin is out the full six weeks he would miss 20 games. IS PAUL UP? Rivers said his lineup replacement for Griffin will depend upon the opponent, but there seems little doubt that long term Paul will have to pick up some of the missed scoring. ""The great players are a nice blanket for guys, but when you take that blanket away, now you have to play,"" Rivers said.","400899868"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry scored as many points as Utah's starting five combined. Yet it sure didn't look pretty early for the star-studded Warriors, who eventually found their groove in another lopsided result. Curry scored 25 points with four 3-pointers, Kevin Durant had 22 points and the Warriors whipped the Utah Jazz 104-74 on Tuesday night thanks to their defense following a slow start. Klay Thompson added 17 points and Draymond Green had 15 points, 11 rebounds and five steals as Golden State handed the Jazz their worst defeat of the season. Joe Johnson scored 14 points for Utah in its seventh straight defeat to the Warriors. The Jazz have also lost seven in a row and 10 of 12 at Oracle Arena. The teams combined to begin 2 for 25, but the Warriors got going in the second quarter and the rout was on. They shot 61.9 percent in the period to lead 55-33 at halftime, and Utah had the lowest total in any half by a Golden State opponent this season. ""It was cool to go through and cool to see how we guarded through the night,"" Durant said. JaVale McGee contributed eight points and seven rebounds off the bench for the Warriors. Utah shot 35.5 percent -- 9 of 30 from 3-point range -- and had a four-game winning streak snapped with just its second loss in the last nine games and third in 14. ""We looked like we were just scared, and we shouldn't be,"" Utah's Rudy Gobert said. The Warriors warmed up and the backups got more extended playing time down the stretch. Golden State beat the undermanned Jazz 106-99 on Dec. 8 when Utah was without starters Gordon Hayward and Rodney Hood because of injuries. This time, the teams combined to start 0 for 8, each missing its first four shots and seven of eight. The Warriors were 1 for 12 at one point and the Jazz 1 of 13. ""This is an ugly game, it's nasty,"" Green recalled thinking early on. Then, Golden State got defensive. ""If we keep a team under 80, I like our chances of winning most every night,"" Curry said. TIP-INS Jazz: Joe Ingles made three of Utah's nine 3s. ... The Jazz haven't beaten the Warriors since Jan. 30, 2015, at home. ... Hood went to the locker room midway through the opening quarter for a bathroom break and didn't return after halftime because of gastric distress. ... The 74 points was Utah's fewest in a game against Golden State. Warriors: Golden State has won its last two games by a combined 75 points. It beat Portland 135-90 on Saturday night. ... Ian Clark, who spent his first and part of his second NBA season with Utah, had six points after scoring a career-high 23 points against Portland. He landed hard on his back and a chest X-ray was negative. ... Golden State shot 26.9 percent the first quarter (7 for 26) in a rare cold start. ... Curry made his 1,700th regular-season 3-pointer and ranks 17th on the NBA's career list for 3s. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Fined, ejected and then retrieved from the locker room, DeMarcus Cousins capped a tumultuous day with his dominant performance on the court. Cousins returned from a brief ejection in the fourth quarter and finished with a season-high 55 points, ending a wild night for the hot-tempered big man and sending the Sacramento Kings past the Portland Trail Blazers 126-121 on Tuesday. Hours after he was fined by the Kings for his profanity-laced tirade against a newspaper columnist last week, Cousins pulled down 13 rebounds and rallied Sacramento in the fourth quarter. ""Kind of a crazy game,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""Certainly Cousins had a nice game. OK, that's an understatement. But I was very impressed. That any of us who would get thrown out in what we think is a questionable deal, then to come back and step out and make the free throw was very impressive."" Cousins hit two huge 3-pointers and scored 17 in the fourth, falling one point shy of his career high of 56. The win avenged an earlier overtime loss this season in Portland and snapped Sacramento's seven-game losing streak to the Blazers. Cousins made 17 of 28 shots, connecting on five 3s, and 16 of 17 free throws. He also had three blocks and five of Sacramento's 10 turnovers. ""No, we didn't stop him,"" Portland guard CJ McCollum said. ""We tried to make it difficult for him, but he's a skilled player. He's got a lot of ways to score. He hit some 3s tonight, got to the free throw line, played bully ball. He did a little bit of everything."" It appeared Cousins' night was over before the game even ended. In the final minute, the All-Star center put the Kings back in front when he drove the lane for a layup and was fouled by Mason Plumlee. But then Cousins initially was given a second technical foul and ejected for spitting his mouthpiece in the direction of Portland's bench after making the shot. He ran into the tunnel toward the locker room, but the officials huddled and changed the call. Lead official Brian Forte conferred with the others and determined Cousins ""did not throw the mouthpiece and that it came out of his mouth."" In a most unusual scene, Cousins then returned to the court and made the free throw for a three-point play, giving the Kings a 122-119 lead with 35 seconds left. ""When I was going to the locker room I was thinking what I was going to break up first,"" Cousins said. ""But when I heard I had to come back to shoot free throws, I had to calm myself down."" Immediately after the game, Cousins called the temporary ejection ""ridiculous"" and claimed he gets mistreated by officials ""on a nightly basis."" ""It's obvious what's being done out here,"" he said. ""I hope the world can see now what's going on."" But after watching the replay, he toned down his comments. ""I can see why people could be mad,"" he said. ""I was just talking to the bench and it came out. No intent. I would never spit on anybody. I'm not like that."" Blazers coach Terry Stotts had a little different version. ""From my vantage point, I thought that he taunted our bench and as he was taunting, the mouthpiece flew out,"" Stotts said. ""The referee asked me if it was his mouthpiece and I said that it was. Then he asked me if he threw it, then I said no he didn't, and that's why he came back. Whether it was intentionally spitting it out or not, I don't know the intention."" McCollum scored 36 points and Plumlee had a career-high 27 points to go with 13 rebounds for the Blazers, who have dropped three straight and seven of eight. Damian Lillard had 24 points and 15 assists. Cousins put the Kings ahead 119-117 with a 3, but Plumlee countered with a dunk at the other end to tie it with 46 seconds left. Trailing by six to open the fourth quarter, the Kings outscored Portland 17-4 to take a seven-point lead midway through the period. Ty Lawson put Sacramento in front for the first time, 102-101, with a baseline jumper. UNSUNG HEROES Lost in the shadow of Cousins' huge game was the play of Sacramento's bench, which outscored Portland's reserves 43-23. Lawson had 16 points, and both Arron Afflalo and Anthony Tolliver scored 11. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: McCollum had 14 points in 8 first-quarter minutes. ... Al-Farouq Aminu (bruised back) has not played in five of the past six games. ... The Blazers shot 65 percent in the first half and led 72-60 at halftime. ... Portland is 5-13 on the road. ... This was the final game of a three-game road trip and the last leg of a difficult December stretch in which the Blazers played eight of nine games and spent 16 of 17 days on the road.

"CLEVELAND -- Kyrie Irving didn't get tired of seeing the Milwaukee Bucks on consecutive days in December. In fact, he wouldn't mind playing them a few more times in late April, May or June when it really matters. ""I hope,"" he said. Irving had 31 points and a career-high 13 assists, and LeBron James scored 29 as the Cleveland Cavaliers won their second game in 24 hours over the young Bucks, 113-102 on Wednesday despite being without two starters. The NBA champions were not at full strength as Kevin Love didn't dress for the second straight game with a bruised left knee, and J.R. Smith sat out after breaking his right thumb Tuesday at Milwaukee. Smith needs surgery, and the Cavs won't have a timetable on his return until after the operation. They were barely missed as Cleveland's two biggest stars more than made up for the absences and the Cavs won for the eighth time in nine games. The only loss in that stretch was last week at Memphis when James, Irving and Love stayed home to rest. After his big performance Wednesday night, Irving was asked if he sees the Bucks as a contender, a team Cleveland could meet in the playoffs. Milwaukee beat the Cavs 118-101 on Nov. 29. ""I hope, man. It would be great, four games against them,"" Irving said. ""I'm fired up to go against them every time now, for real. Ever since they kicked our (butts) in Milwaukee it's been personal and it's going to continue to be personal."" Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 28 points and Jabari Parker 27 for the Bucks, who took the Cavs to overtime at home Tuesday but fell behind by 21 in the fourth quarter this time and couldn't come back. ""They're the champs,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""They showed that again tonight. They never panic. They've seen everything. For a young team like ourselves, we're going through that. Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes."" Tristan Thompson added 15 rebounds for Cleveland. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue wanted to rest Irving and James, who played a respective 47 and 45 minutes in Tuesday's overtime win at Milwaukee. ""He came to me and asked me how I felt. I said great,"" James said. ""He gave me a little look and I said, `I feel great,' and uh, that was it."" Like Irving, James sees the Bucks as a team to watch in the future, and a possible challenger to the Cavs in the East. Maybe not this season, but at some point. ""The next several years they could be really, really good,"" James said. ""For me, I'm ready for whatever matchup. It doesn't matter if it's this year, or if it's several years, I'm going to be ready for it."" Irving scored 14 in the third quarter, capping the period with a three-point play to put Cleveland ahead by 15. James made three 3-pointers in a span of 1:11 in the second to give Cleveland a 51-35 lead, but Lue, perhaps concerned about overworking his superstar, replaced him with Richard Jefferson. James had an incredulous look as he ran off the floor and seemed to wonder why Lue would pull him while on such a shooting tear. ""He was mad,"" Lue said. ""I wished he would've changed his mind,"" James said. ""I had made three straight 3s. I don't know. It's cool, though. We won."" HELLO, DELLY Matthew Dellavedova, who endeared himself to Cleveland fans with his tenacity for three seasons, was presented with his NBA championship ring before tip-off. The Cavs swarmed ""Delly"" and nearly knocked general manager David Griffin down as he was about to give Dellavedova the diamond jewelry, which was knocked from the GM's hands. ""A couple of guys got some shots in there. Tristan, maybe,"" Dellavedova said. ""It was a special moment. I loved playing here."" TIP-INS Bucks: F Michael Beasley missed his fourth straight game with a sprained left foot. ... Antetokounmpo is the only player in the NBA leading his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. Only four players -- James, Kevin Garnett, Dave Cowens and Scottie Pippen -- have done it for a season. Cavaliers: Jefferson was ejected with 3:19 left and tossed his jersey into the stands as he walked to the locker room. ""He lost it,"" Lue said. ... James is expected to have his minutes reduced next month. He's averaging 37.3 per game, but Lue said there are no plans to curtail James' playing time until the 31-year-old says so.","400899871"
"ATLANTA --  When the Minnesota Timberwolves won on Dec. 13 at Chicago, Karl-Anthony Towns sensed a change in the team's confidence. ""I think after the game in Chicago, we have a different swagger to us, a different walk, a different talk,"" he said. ""And that's a sign that we're growing."" Andrew Wiggins scored 19 points, Towns had 17 points and 18 rebounds and Minnesota beat the Atlanta Hawks 92-84 on Wednesday night. Zach LaVine added 18 points for the Timberwolves, who earned consecutive wins for the first time since April 5-9 and have won three of four overall. Dennis Schroder finished with 21 points and Paul Millsap had 18 points and 10 rebounds for Atlanta, which has lost six of seven at home. The Hawks have lost during that span to four teams -- New Orleans, Detroit, Orlando and Minnesota -- with losing records. Atlanta dropped its previous home game last Saturday to Charlotte, which had dropped four straight. The Hawks lost to the Hornets the night after winning at Toronto, the second-best team in the Eastern Conference. They lost to Minnesota two nights after an emotionally lifting victory at Oklahoma City. It was the Hawks' second straight game without center Dwight Howard, their leading rebounder and third-leading scorer. Howard is out with back tightness. Ricky Rubio stole the ball from Kyle Korver and fed LaVine for a fastbreak layup and an 85-80 lead with 5:07 remaining. The Hawks pulled within three on the next possession, but Minnesota was never threatened from that point on. ""That's life in the NBA, man,"" Millsap said. ""You win a big-time game on the road and then come home against a team you're supposed to beat and you lose. Every night you have to bring that same intensity. The OKC game was definitely a mentally and emotionally draining game for us."" Minnesota kept its composure late in the game, the kind of building block coach Tom Thibodeau has been seeking for his young team. The Timberwolves, who won despite 12 lead changes, blew a nine-point lead in the final minute of regulation in last Saturday's overtime home loss to Houston. They took an early lead in Monday's win over Phoenix and never trailed after the first quarter, but against the Hawks, Thibodeau was unnerved by late turnovers. ""Everything stresses me,"" he said. ""And again, you want to eliminate all the ways in which you beat yourselves."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Outrebounded Atlanta 52-35. ""We went in there attacking the paint,"" Towns said. ""We used the paint to our advantage, understanding they're missing one of their guys."" ... Improved to 3-0 on the road against the Southeast Division, 5-9 overall. ... Hawks: Tim Hardaway Jr. played just 1 minute of the first quarter before straining his groin and missing the rest of the night. ... Kyle Korver has made at least one 3 in 307 of 327 career games with the Hawks. ... Schroder has scored in double figures in 14 straight games. ... In the win at Oklahoma City, Schroder and Millsap became the first Atlanta pair to each score at least 30 points and shoot 60 percent from the field since Joe Johnson and Al Harrington did it against the New York Knicks on Dec. 16, 2015.","400899872"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  Marc Gasol knew his shot would come back eventually. It didn't take long. After shooting 29 percent during a three-game losing streak, Gasol went 14 for 17 and matched a career high with 38 points as the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Detroit Pistons 98-86 on Wednesday night. ""I knew I just had to keep shooting and keep trying to help the team as much as I could until things starting falling,"" said Gasol, who went 18 for 62 during the slump. ""Tonight I got going, and my teammates kept finding me. When you are making shots, everything seems easier."" Memphis coach David Fizdale wasn't surprised that his team turned things around one night after losing in overtime to the Boston Celtics. ""This group never stays down for long,"" he said. ""It's a tough-minded team and all I have to do is keep them coming back."" Detroit dropped its fourth straight, all by double figures. ""I was getting good looks, but everything was going in and out, which happens in this league,"" said Marcus Morris, who was 1 for 11 from the floor and guarded Gasol. ""Marc's a bad boy. He's 7-foot-1 and he's pump-faking before hitting 3s. That's tough to guard."" Detroit's defense, which had infuriated coach Stan Van Gundy over the last three games, improved against Memphis. The Grizzlies shot 42.7 percent from the field, but hit 40 percent of their 3-pointers and added 22 points on 17 Pistons turnovers. ""I thought the defense was good enough to win, even with Marc having a career night,"" Van Gundy said. ""So that was a positive, and I thought we got good looks. But we couldn't put the ball in the basket and we turned it over way too many times, so we're still frustrated on offense."" Memphis was boosted by the return of Chandler Parsons, who missed the previous 17 games with a bone bruise on his left knee. He had two points and two rebounds in 15 minutes. Gasol was the only Grizzlies player to reach double figures until JaMychal Green got there with 1:03 to play. Van Gundy had planned to change his starting lineup after three straight losses, but Jon Leuer missed shootaround after being in a car accident. Leuer played, scoring 18 points, but Van Gundy decided to hold off on starting him until Friday against Golden State. ""Jon's been our most consistent player lately, so we wanted him on the floor as much as we could,"" Van Gundy said. Reggie Jackson also scored 18 for the Pistons, while Andre Drummond had 13 points and 19 rebounds. ""This was definitely a step in the right direction,"" Jackson said. ""We need to get better, but we battled tonight. The effort was better than it has been. We just made too many mistakes."" For much of the first half, it looked as though the Pistons were headed for another blowout loss, as they trailed by as many as 18 points. A 16-2 run cut the deficit to 42-38, but Memphis pushed it back to nine at halftime. Detroit made another run in the third quarter, but was never able to get enough stops to pose a serious threat. Gasol scored 14 in the period -- his second double-digit quarter -- and Memphis took a 79-63 lead into the final 12 minutes. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Gasol gave Van Gundy a friendly pat on the backside after hitting a fadeaway jumper to give Memphis an 11-point lead late in the third. . The Grizzlies are 8-0 in the second game of back-to-backs. Pistons: Despite the accident, Leuer played 17:21 in the first half, including the entire second quarter. ... Memphis' 22 points off Detroit turnovers were the most the Pistons have allowed this season. CONCERN OVER JACKSON Jackson left the early in the first quarter with soreness in his left knee -- the one that caused him to miss the first 21 games of the season. He returned in the second period and played 23:31, but Van Gundy said the team will keep an eye on any continued problems with the knee. ""I thought I felt something in there, so I wanted to make sure everything was good, then I got back out there,"" Jackson said. FIRE DAMAGE The game was played less than 36 hours after several local fire departments were called to put out a kitchen fire at the Palace of Auburn Hills. The blaze was extinguished quickly enough to prevent damage to game-day operations. The Pistons are leaving the Palace at season's end to move to Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit.","400899873"
"CHICAGO --  All the Washington Wizards want for Christmas is Bradley Beal and John Wall at their healthy best. That's what Washington got in a 107-97 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night, when the Beal-Wall backcourt combined for 44 points, 14 assists, five steals and only four turnovers. The Wizards are 13-11 when both are in the starting lineup. ""We made a conscious effort about a dozen or 14 games ago to play faster,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""We've got all this athleticism and we have one of the fastest point guards (Wall) in the league. We want to be able to utilize it every trip down the court."" Wall finished with 23 points and nine assists, while Beal totaled 21 points and five assists. Neither played in the first meeting between the teams on Nov. 12, which the Bulls won 106-95 in Chicago. ""We are a totally different team when me and (Beal) are rolling,"" said Wall, who did not attempt a shot in the opening 9:30, then scored 19 points in the final three quarters. Washington also received a boost from reserves Trey Burke and Marcus Thornton, who sparked a key burst early in the fourth quarter. After the teams entered the period tied at 77, the two combined for 10 points to give the Wizards a 91-85 lead. Dwyane Wade's jump shot closed the gap to 97-93 with 2:54 left, but Beal, Marcin Gortat and Wall followed with baskets to seal it. ""(Wall) is the head of their snake over there,"" Wade said. ""And Bradley Beal has been playing amazing."" Gortat had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Burke scored 10 and Thornton six. ""There were so many parts of the game that were great for us tonight,"" Brooks said. ""Guys off the bench were terrific."" Jimmy Butler led a balanced Chicago offense with 20 points, and Wade added 19. Rajon Rondo had 10 assists. The Wizards overcame an early 13-point deficit to post their fourth victory in five games. They are 3-9 on the road. The Bulls lost for the fourth time in five games to conclude a 1-2 homestand. Chicago jumped out to a 33-22 lead on the strength of 62.5 percent shooting from the field. Butler and Taj Gibson led the way with nine and eight points, respectively. In the second quarter, Wall capped a late 9-0 run with a fast-break dunk that gave his team a one-point advantage. After a timeout, Chicago regrouped to take a 56-55 lead at halftime. ""We allowed them to get the momentum going into the half,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We lost our pace and never regained it."" TIP-INS Wizards: Wall was whistled for his eighth technical foul, one fewer than Sacramento center DeMarcus Cousins, the NBA leader. ... F Otto Porter (back spasms) sat out the second half. ... G-F Danuel House (broken right wrist) remained out. Bulls: Fell to 5-1 when Rondo has at least 10 assists. He shot 1 for 10 from the field ...

SILENT NIGHT The Bulls have lost five of their last nine at home, where lethargic crowds have been the rule of late. ""Fans aren't cheering, but we have to give them a reason to cheer,"" Gibson said. ""We have to play better."" MAHINMI ON THE MEND Wizards C Ian Mahinmi underwent platelet-rich plasma treatment on both knees. He will be sidelined approximately six weeks. ""(The prognosis) was day-to-day for a lot of the time when he was back the first time,"" Brooks said. ""But now we know he had the procedure done. Everything went well.""

"NEW ORLEANS --  Russell Westbrook's left-handed, inside-out dribble wrong-footed Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday, creating an open lane for a driving layup. That was one of many scoring highlights for the Oklahoma City star, who sometimes looked like he could have outscored New Orleans by himself. He didn't have to, though, thanks to a reserve unit led by rookie Alex Abrines that extended leads while Westbrook was resting on the bench. Westbrook had 42 points and 10 rebounds, Abrines hit five 3s and finished with a career-best 18 points, and the Thunder beat the Pelicans 121-110 on Wednesday night. ""We did a great job of just playing together,"" Westbrook said. ""It was great, man, to come in (during the fourth quarter) with everything under control. (We) did a great job of managing the game."" Abrines scored nine points during a pivotal 11-0 run early in the fourth quarter. The surge gave the Thunder a 100-87 lead with 9:18 left, and New Orleans never got within eight points after that. The 23-year-old shooting guard from Spain, who'd previously reached 10 points only once this season, said he could tell he was shooting well and gaining confidence. ""You get those feelings when you knock down a couple 3s and you're hot,"" Abrines said. ""You just receive the ball and you let it fly. You know it's going in."" Enes Kanter, who hit a hook shot during that spurt, finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds. ""We just couldn't get them stopped at all,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said of the Thunder, who scored 56 points inside and outrebounded New Orleans 49-34. ""Their inside play I thought hurt us."" Anthony Davis had 34 points and 15 rebounds for New Orleans. Holiday added 23 points and 10 assists, and Terrence Jones scored 21 points for the Pelicans, who've lost nine of 12. CRITICAL STRETCH Coming off a lopsided victory in Philadelphia a night earlier, New Orleans kept the game competitive through three quarters and trailed 89-87 after Tyreke Evans' 3-pointer with 11:10 left. That's when the Thunder suddenly pulled away by scoring 11 straight points over the span of just four possessions. Abrines hit a 3 and soon after converted a three-point play on a driving layup as he was fouled by Langston Galloway. After New Orleans missed its third straight shot, Abrines added another 3. ""The one kid came in and really changed the game,"" Gentry said of Abrines. ""That's kind of what got them separation."" Abrines finished 5 of 11 from 3-point range and was the leading scorer among Thunder reserves, who combined for 52 points. Westbrook sounded impressed by the shooting he's seen from Abrines in practice and was pleased to see it finally translate in a game. ""He works hard every day, works on his game and that's the best part about him,"" Westbrook said. ""There's going to be ups and downs the whole season, but tonight he did a great job of making shots."" SHOWMANSHIP One of the better crowds of the season, announced as 16,375, showed up for Westbrook's first visit this season, and he put on the type of scoring display NBA fans expect. There were end-to-end layups with strong finishes in traffic, pull-up jumpers, spot-up jumpers, step-back jumpers, gritty put-backs of his own misses and a couple 3s. He scored 16 of his points on 18 free-throw attempts. He capped his scoring with a 27-foot, straight-on 3, after which he did a little shoulder-shaking dance on his way back toward the Thunder defensive end. TIP-INS Thunder: The Thunder improved to 7-0 when outrebounding an opponent by 10 or more. ... Westbrook has scored at least 20 in 11 straight. ... The Thunder evened its road record at 6-6. ...

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Ty Lawson turned back the clock to his younger, more explosive days and DeMarcus Cousins played the closer role from the free-throw line, helping the Sacramento Kings rally from 20 points down Wednesday night. Cousins scored 21 points and the Kings beat the Utah Jazz 94-93. The Kings used an 11-3 run, led by Lawson and five free throws by Cousins, to take a 91-89 lead with 25.9 seconds remaining. It was their first lead since the first quarter. The Jazz led by 20 in the third quarter, but their defense disappeared in crunch time. Gordon Hayward was isolated against Cousins with 16.6 seconds remaining but missed a short fade-away with 5.9 seconds left that would have tied the game. Lawson set a season high with 19 points. ""He can do so many things with the ball, to be the smallest guy on the floor and getting in the battle with the trees,"" Cousins said. ""He does it all for us. The bench and his performance alone tonight they won the game for us. That is plain and simple."" Hayward led the Jazz with 28 points and 10 rebounds while Rudy Gobert recorded his ninth consecutive double-double with 17 points and 14 rebounds. He and the Timberwolves' Karl-Anthony Towns are tied for the longest active streaks. ""We've been down 20 before and we've come back to lose by five,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""When you are struggling a bit and trying to find yourself, guys stayed with it."" The Jazz used a 9-0 stretch in the third quarter to take a 62-42 lead but couldn't hold on in crunch time. A 13-2 Kings run spanning the end of the third and beginning of the fourth quarter cut the lead to five thanks to a barrage of 3-pointers. ""We were rolling,"" Hayward said. ""Felt like one of those games you kind of just get up 20, push it to 25-30 and cruise to victory. That didn't happen tonight at all. We let them kind of just chip away, chip away and now you have yourself a ballgame. Couldn't get stops and should have never been in that situation. ""We've done this four or five times already this season. This one finally came back to bite us. You can't keep blowing 20-point leads and win every single time. This one stings for sure. You can't relax."" TIP-INS Kings: Omri Casspi missed his second consecutive game due to an illness. ... Rudy Gay missed his fifth consecutive game with right hip strain.

"PHOENIX --  A night after their 10-game winning streak came to a halt with a two-point loss at home to San Antonio, the Houston Rockets looked ready to start a new run of victories. The Rockets went from making 38 percent of their shots, including just 6 of 38 3-pointers, to a 53.5 field goal percentage and 18 made 3s on 38 attempts. It added up to a 125-11 win over the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday. James Harden had 27 points and 14 assists, and the Rockets earned their 11th victory in 12 games. ""We've been playing good basketball. (Tuesday against) San Antonio is just a different animal,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It's a good bounce-back win, back-to-back, and the guys showed some heart."" Eric Gordon added 24 points off the Rockets' bench, shooting 7 of 13 on 3s. Patrick Beverley finished with a season-high 18 points, nine assists and nine rebounds. Harden's biggest shot came with 4:19 left, a pull-up 3 for a 120-100 lead. He bent down and moved his arms in a swimming motion in celebration as he ran back to the bench. ""He just knows when to pick the spots and he knows what he has to do, and he controls the whole game,"" D'Antoni said. Devin Booker's 28 points led the Suns, who have lost four in a row. T.J. Warren added 19 and Brandon Knight 17. Gordon hit back-to-back 3s midway through the fourth quarter, the second one at the 6:39 mark for a 110-95 lead. ""It's tough to really slow us down, knocking the 3s down and also making layups,"" Gordon said. ""Teams just have to pick their poison against us."" The Rockets led by as many as 13 in the third, only to see the Suns cut it to 86-84 on a tip-in by P.J. Tucker with 1:19 left. Harden drew a questionable foul call against Tucker on a 3-point try with 4.3 seconds left and made all three free throws to give Houston a 91-84 lead entering the fourth. The Rockets led 30-26 after the first quarter, when the Suns struggled to get back in transition. Houston scored 12 fast-break points in the period. Harden took only two shots in the quarter but excelled as a passer, handing out seven assists. ""Stopping people in transition, it's mostly on the defense. It's something we have been working on in practice but in game time we still are not doing,"" Booker said. ""Obviously, James being the playmaker, he finds the open man. When they have so many shooters on the floor, it's tough to guard."" Gordon hit four 3s in the second quarter, Harden drove for a layup with 0.3 seconds left and Houston took a 61-55 lead into halftime. TIP-INS Rockets: Before the game, D'Antoni reminisced about his time in Phoenix, where he was once a popular head coach. He received some applause when he was introduced. ""It's special, there's no doubt,"" D'Antoni said. ""It was special to live here, and the people and the fans, it was a good time."" ... F Montrezl Harrell made his first start of the season and second of his career. He scored 17 points, tying a career high. Suns: Tucker has become the de facto ""stopper"" on defense, asked to limit the opposing team's best player. He faced Harden on Wednesday. ""You go through and ask every (NBA) player, if you were to ask them about P.J. Tucker, I guarantee you every one would say he's one of the top defenders in the league,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ... The crowd of 18,055 marked the second home sellout of the season for the Suns. `BOOKED' FOR FLIGHT Booker, on the night of his bobblehead giveaway, had three dunks in the first quarter. Two came when he cut to the hoop and took feeds from Tyson Chandler and Tucker, respectively, before elevating to the basket. But Booker's best came with 29.1 seconds left in the game, when he jammed over the Rockets' Kyle Wiltjer. HARDEN'S DIMES The NBA's leading assist man, Harden didn't fail to disappoint. He fed Harrell with a behind-the-back pass for a layup in the first quarter, then did it again in the third, flipping another trick pass to Beverley for an easy basket.","400899877"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Wesley Matthews spent enough time with Damian Lillard in Portland to know exactly what he was going to do in the waning seconds Wednesday night. ""Dame to get the ball and Dame to shoot it,"" Matthews said. The former Trail Blazers guard pressured Lillard into missing a potential game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer, and the Dallas Mavericks held off a furious Portland rally for a 96-95 victory. ""Obviously, I've been his teammate so I know the kind of clutch gene he has,"" said Matthews, who played in Portland from 2010-15. ""We ended up getting the stop that we needed."" Harrison Barnes had 28 points and Deron Williams added 23 for the Mavericks, who led by 25 in the third quarter. Lillard finished with 29 points, including 20 in the third. It was Portland's fourth straight loss. The Blazers were slow to get going for the second of a back-to-back, but Lillard paced the comeback. His reverse layup pulled Portland to 88-82 with 6:31 remaining. Allen Crabbe pumped his fist after his 3 with 2:42 left trimmed it to 90-88. After Williams' jumper for the Mavericks, Al-Farouq Aminu made a 3 and the Blazers were back within two. The teams traded baskets but Dallas turned over the ball on a shot-clock violation leading 96-95 with 20.3 seconds to go. Lillard's turnover on the other end gave it back to the Mavs, but Mason Plumlee grabbed Williams' bad pass and Portland called a timeout with 9.8 seconds left. Then came Lillard's final attempt at the buzzer. ""There's nobody like Wes Matthews on defense at the end of the game,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""The guy's unbelievable -- one of the guys that really willed us to win."" Lillard said afterward that in the time it took to try and shake Matthews, the clock had run down and he was forced to shoot. But the star guard is confident the Blazers will pull out of the funk they're in. ""Our team has faith,"" he said. ""The best thing is we know we haven't shown our best."" The Trail Blazers were coming off an emotional game the night before in Sacramento, where they lost 126-121. The Mavericks were again without Dirk Nowitzki because of a strained right Achilles, but the 13-time All Star is nearing a comeback. Nowitzki could return as early as Friday night against the Clippers. Dallas will ease him back slowly. ""He's made gradual but steady gains in his recovery,"" Carlisle said. Portland was without reserve Evan Turner, who has an ankle injury and was wearing a boot before the game. But the Blazers did get back Aminu, who had been out the previous four games with a sore back. The Mavericks built a 12-point lead in the first quarter and Seth Curry hit a 3 at the second-quarter buzzer to send the Mavericks into halftime with a 62-38 advantage. In the second half, Barnes' 18-foot fadeaway put the Mavs up 69-44. Crabbe's 3 narrowed Portland's deficit to 88-80 with 7:24 left. TIP-INS Mavericks: J.J. Barea played 9 minutes in the first half but left the game because of left Achilles soreness. ... Barnes has scored 20 or more points 15 times this season. Trail Blazers: Maurice Harkless fouled out with 4:34 to play. ... Crabbe led all reserves with 14 points. ... Portland outscored the Mavericks by 23 points in the second half.

In an effort to promote literacy and career development, McCollum collaborated with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Portland to open the CJ McCollum Dream Center. The space will host different clubs, programs and speakers to inspire kids. SIMILARITIES Carlisle said in many ways the Blazers are similar to the Mavericks, in that both teams are struggling with early-season losses and establishing an identity. He emphasized that there's a lot of season left: ""We have to look at this as a big-picture situation and get better every day,"" he said.","400899878"
"NEW YORK --  The Golden State Warriors knew they would need energy and were missing the guy who often provides it, so they weren't totally surprised by their poor first half. ""It's kind of what we expected,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""I don't know I expected to be down 16 at the half, but I knew that they would come out and give us a hell of a fight."" The Warriors ended up winning easily. Kevin Durant had 26 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and Golden State turned an ugly start into an easy finish in a 117-101 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday night.

They didn't look ready while falling behind by 16 at halftime, but were back to their sometimes unstoppable selves while outscoring the Nets by 32 points over the final 24 minutes. ""I felt like we were all positive coming into the locker room,"" Durant said. ""No pointing fingers. None of that stuff. We knew it was just a matter of time."" Stephen Curry and Zaza Pachulia each finished with 15 points for the Warriors, who played without Draymond Green, who returned to the Bay Area early Thursday after the birth of his son, Draymond Jamal Green Jr. Brook Lopez scored 28 points for Brooklyn, but just five in the second half as the Nets dropped their fourth straight. They complete a back-to-back against the last two NBA champions when they visit Cleveland on Friday. ""I thought we stuck with it, we did a good job trying to stick with it, but again I think a lot of it is just more on us and what we stopped doing than anything,"" Lopez said. Golden State earned its sixth consecutive win and improved the NBA's best record to 26-4. The Warriors had won their last two games by a combined 75 points but didn't play much defense in the first quarter of this one, allowing 34 points, and then couldn't find their offense in the second, managing just 16 while the Nets dominated behind Lopez. Brooklyn led 65-49 at the break. Golden State returned with 12 straight to cut it to 65-61 on Curry's jumper, outscored the Nets 39-19 and took an 88-84 edge to the fourth. It was soon 103-91 after consecutive baskets by Shaun Livingston, and the Warriors kept pouring it on until they got their starters to the bench for good with a few minutes left.

Kerr said the Warriors don't know if Green will return on the road trip, but thought the Michigan State product might want to be back for Friday's game at Detroit. Nets: Jeremy Lin finished with 10 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. It was just his 10th game all season because of injuries and his first at home since Nov. 2, when he originally strained his left hamstring. FATHER KNOWS BEST? Kerr said he was disappointed with himself for not trying harder to persuade Green not to travel with the Warriors to New York on Wednesday. ""We had a good discussion after the Utah game about whether he should come or not and he was convinced that the baby was not going to arrive for about a week,"" Kerr said. ""Typical father. The women are right, the men are wrong in these things. But he was convinced that it wasn't going to happen for a week so we kind of relented and said all right come with us, and then of course we practice last night and then I woke up this morning, there was a text from him saying he had taken off back to Oakland."" BACK-TO-VAC Nets coach Kenny Atkinson was asked his reaction when he saw the schedule had given his team the Golden State-Cleveland back-to-back. ""I asked Sean if I could take the week off,"" Atkinson joked, referring to general manager Sean Marks.","400899879"
"NEW YORK --  From Derrick Rose's performance to a solid night for New York's reserves, there was plenty to like about this one for the Knicks. Rose scored 19 points, Kyle O'Quinn had 14 points and a career-high 16 rebounds, and New York beat the Orlando Magic 106-95 on Thursday. Carmelo Anthony and Willy Hernangomez each had 15 points for New York, which has won two in a row since a three-game losing streak. O'Quinn also blocked five shots, Kristaps Porzingis scored 12 points, and reserve Brandon Jennings had 12 assists in 22 minutes. ""O'Quinn was great on the boards and got blocked shots,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""Obviously, Brandon had a lot of assists. Again, big game for the bench."" Orlando led only once, 12-11 on D.J. Augustin's short jumper with 6:13 left in the first quarter. The Knicks responded with a 16-5 run for a 27-17 lead. ""We were sharing the ball. Everyone was hitting shots and we were having fun out there,"" Porzingis said. ""That's when we're the best."" Serge Ibaka led the Magic with 23 points and 10 rebounds. Evan Fournier scored 21 points. ""They outplayed us tonight. They played harder,"" Fournier said. ""They wanted to win more than we did. I think that is why we lost the game."" Ibaka connected on a hook shot and Fournier made a layup to get Orlando within seven with 1:16 left in the third. The Magic trailed 82-74 lead early in the fourth when the Knicks started to pull away. Hernangomez made three jumpers and a layup to help New York to a 90-76 lead with 9:13 to go. Justin Holiday's 3-pointer with 5:52 remaining extended New York's lead to 98-80. Orlando closed to 104-95 on Jeff Green's free throws with 1:29 left, but Rose scored with 1:08 remaining to help the Knicks close it out. ""We're building something,"" Rose said. ""This is the way the game is supposed to be played. It makes it easy. When the ball is hopping like that it's pretty hard to stop us."" Green, Nikola Vucevic and Elfrid Payton each scored 10 points for the Magic. ""Credit the Knicks, they played a great basketball game,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""They had everything going in the first half and they outplayed us."" TIP-INS Magic: Ibaka was 10 for 18 from the field, including a 3-for-7 performance from 3-point range. ... Orlando dropped to 8-8 on the road this season compared to only 5-10 at home. ... The Magic lead the all-time series against the Knicks 52-51. Knicks: Courtney Lee scored 10 points. ... The Knicks are 14-1 when leading after three quarters this season. JUST GETTING STARTED It was the first of four meetings between the teams this season. They face each other again on Jan. 2 back at Madison Square Garden. HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS The Knicks improved to 11-4 at home. They are 10-2 in their last 12 games at Madison Square Garden. ANTHONY STAYS MELLOW Anthony largely stayed away from a New York Post report that George Karl, his former coach in Denver, criticized the star in his soon-to-be published memoirs, ""Furious George."" ""It's irrelevant to me. I don't have to speak on it,"" Anthony said. ""Maybe when I write my book later on, `Staying Mello.' Nothing disappoints me anymore. I'm passed being disappointed.

"MIAMI --  Halftime was longer than usual on Thursday night in Miami, to accommodate the ceremony in which the Heat retired Shaquille O'Neal's number and raised a banner to the rafters. O'Neal said he was humbled. The Heat were apparently inspired. Down 11-0 to start the game and once facing a 19-point deficit, the Heat got 23 points and 13 rebounds from Justise Winslow and Hassan Whiteside and beat the Los Angeles Lakers 115-107. ""It felt like 2006 in the arena,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Our young players were sitting there, eyes wide open, and they saw a vision of what we're trying to build."" Winslow set a career high for points and tied a career best in rebounds. Goran Dragic scored 21 and James Johnson added 19 for Miami, which snapped a three-game slide. ""Emotions came out,"" Dragic said. ""I was really glad we were part of the Shaq retirement. It gave us an extra boost, extra energy."" Lou Williams scored 27 points for the Lakers, who fell to 5-14 on the road. Nick Young scored 20 and D'Angelo Russell had 17. ""We'll get there,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""I told the guys, we will get there. We're playing good basketball. We're not doing the little things that make you win ballgames very well right now."" Williams made three free throws with 1:01 to cut a six-point Heat lead in half. But on the ensuing possession, Whiteside tipped in a miss by Winslow to make it 112-107 and the Heat held on. O'Neal brought Heat captain Udonis Haslem to center court for part of the ceremony. Fitting, then, because both had a role in the Heat rally -- and neither played in the game. Haslem emotionally spoke in the timeout when the Heat trailed 11-0, and his words resonated. ""The point I was making to those guys was nobody could look each other in the eye and say they were giving their best effort,"" Haslem said. That wasn't the case in the second half, when Miami shot 53 percent, held the Lakers to 38 percent and outrebounded them 29-19. ""We're supposed to put the nail in the coffin when we got teams down by 18,"" Young said. ""We have to keep going and not let up.""

Luol Deng became the sixth player to record a start with both teams in the Lakers-Heat rivalry.... Larry Nance Jr. (bone bruise, left knee) will be evaluated again this weekend in Los Angeles. Heat: Miami's largest comeback win this season had been 14, against Milwaukee. ... Tyler Johnson addressed the crowd pregame, wishing fans a happy holiday season. ... Miami was again without Dion Waiters (groin), Rodney McGruder (ankle) and Wayne Ellington (hamstring). SHAQ'S IMPACT O'Neal not only has his numbers (32 in Miami, 34 with the Lakers) retired by both teams, he remains a fixture in their respective record books. O'Neal ranks among the top 10 for both franchises in several categories -- including field goal percentage (No. 1 with Heat, No. 2 with Lakers), points per game (No. 2 with Lakers, No. 3 with Heat), rebounds per game (No. 6 with Lakers, No. 7 with Heat) and blocked shots (No. 2 with Lakers, No. 6 with Heat). WITH SHAQ The Lakers were 9-2 against the Heat with O'Neal in the lineup. The Heat were 3-1 against the Lakers when they had the Hall of Famer on the court.","400899881"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Isaiah Thomas loves the fourth quarter, and he finished with a flourish Thursday night. Thomas scored 14 of his 28 points in the final period, leading the Boston Celtics to a 109-102 victory against the Indiana Pacers. ""Fourth quarter ain't for everybody,"" Thomas said. ""That's when it really matters. I just embraced the opportunity. ... I love when the game is close -- I want to be that type of guy. I just do what I've always done, I guess."" Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder each scored 15 points for the Celtics, who have won four in a row. Marcus Smart had 12 points, and Amir Johnson and Kelly Olnyk finished with 11 apiece. Boston outscored Indiana 29-9 in the second quarter, turning a nine-point deficit into a 51-40 halftime lead. The Pacers pulled within four late in the game, but were unable to catch the Celtics down the stretch. ""We got ourselves into a big hole in the second quarter, and that's hard to crawl out of,"" said Paul George, who scored 19 points for Indiana. ""We made them take contested shots, but all of their guys can shoot 3-pointers, which makes them hard to guard. The Celtics set the tempo, and it's up to us to match that."" Jeff Teague led Indiana with 31 points and eight assists. CJ Miles also scored 19 points, and Thaddeus Young had 15 points and 12 rebounds for his second straight double-double. Miles made a 3-pointer to trim Boston's lead to 87-83 with 5:26 left, but Al Horford responded with a reverse layup for Boston. Thomas then made two foul shots and a layup to make it 93-83 with 4:10 to go. Thomas and Crowder each made two free throws in the final 15 seconds to help the Celtics hold on for the win. Horford finished with eight points and 11 rebounds and Thomas also collected nine assists as Boston closed out a perfect three-game road trip. ""The last game of the trip is always the biggest one,"" Thomas said. ""We've had a successful road trip and we got some confidence from it.""

"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Clippers were already down one big star against San Antonio on Thursday night when another one got hurt late in the third quarter. Without forward Blake Griffin to start and Chris Paul to finish, the Clippers went exclusively to their bench in the fourth quarter to pull out a 106-101 victory over the Spurs. It was only San Antonio's second road loss this season in 17 games. The Clippers' bench outscored the Spurs' reserves 58-33. Los Angeles took an 81-73 lead into the fourth and coach Doc Rivers never did return to his starters. ""I just rode `em,"" he said. ""That was great. That just shows the confidence we have in our reserves."" Paul said he did not believe his left hamstring injury was serious and he was holding out hope he could play Friday against the Dallas Mavericks. ""I'm OK,"" Paul said. ""I think I just tweaked my hamstring. I'm glad I caught it when I did. It's probably going to come back, but hopefully I'll be ready for Dallas."" Griffin missed his second game following knee surgery Tuesday and is expected to be out up to six weeks. Paul still led the Clippers in scoring with 19 points, adding seven rebounds and six assists. Marreese Speights had 14 points and seven rebounds, and Raymond Felton scored 13 to lead the barrage off the bench. Los Angeles reserve Jamal Crawford and starters J.J. Redick and DeAndre Jordan each had 11 points. ""It is always fun to watch some of your teammates play well,"" Jordan said. ""Everyone in the second unit gave us a spark. I'm glad we're so much deeper than we were last year."" Kawhi Leonard led the Spurs with 27 points and nine rebounds. Pau Gasol had 21 points and nine rebounds. The Spurs outrebounded the Clippers 54-42 but shot only 40.2 percent from the floor. ""They are playing good defense, but we definitely missed some wide-open shots tonight,"" Leonard said. The Clippers built a 57-45 lead at halftime and never again trailed. They were up by 14 with 43 seconds left, but gave up consecutive baskets on inbounds steals to make the score more respectable for the Spurs. ""You have to play 48 minutes in this league, and we played 24,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""We played the last 24 minutes competitively, with some energy, some toughness, some fiber, whatever you want to call it. We didn't for the first 24 and they did it for 48."" The loss dropped San Antonio to 23-6, with two losses against the Clippers. The Spurs lost by 24 points to Los Angeles at home last month. TIP-INS Spurs: Leonard is averaging a career-high 23.9 points and 3.0 assists in the first season since Tim Duncan retired. ""Everything is better. He is shooting the 3 better; he just does everything,"" Rivers said. ""When you watch him on film it is just really impressive."" Clippers: Rivers maintains his lineup replacement for Griffin (knee) will remade fluid depending upon the opponent, but for the second time in as many games that Griffin has been out, Rivers started veteran Paul Pierce. REST AHEAD Popovich has spearheaded the movement to rest his veterans. He did not bring Manu Ginobili on the three-game trip and said he also would rest Gasol and Tony Parker on Friday in Portland. PUTTING TIME IN The 39-year-old Pierce passed former Celtics teammate Robert Parish for 15th in NBA history in minutes (45,712). THE BETTER TEAM Popovich feigned outrage over whether the Clippers' two victories meant they were the better team. ""Sure they are,"" he said. ""They just beat the hell out of us twice, does that mean we are better? That is a silly question.""","400899883"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Triple-doubles, flying elbows, two ejections and a revved-up crowd cheering until the end. Even Michael Jordan was there sitting courtside. It may only be December, but Friday night's game between the Charlotte Hornets and Chicago Bulls had all of the intensity of a postseason game. Nic Batum had 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his first triple-double of the season, and the Hornets beat the Bulls 103-91 for their third straight victory. ""That was like a playoff game tonight,"" Batum said. ""The crowd was into it and it was a good team in front of us. That's a great game for us to get a win against."" It didn't come easily. Charlotte had to hold off the Bulls in the fourth quarter in a game that ended with Robin Lopez and Taj Gibson getting ejected. The normally mild-mannered Lopez could face a suspension from the league after he simultaneously elbowed Cody Zeller and Marvin Williams in the face -- using both elbows -- with 38 seconds left and the outcome already decided. Gibson, who had picked up a technical foul for arguing a call earlier in the fourth quarter, got his second and was ejected when he debated the call. After watching the replay, referees sent Lopez to the locker room with a flagrant 2 foul. Lopez wouldn't say exactly what set him off. ""It was pretty contentious out there. We had tempers flare,"" Lopez said. ""Basketball is a passionate game and I play with passion."" Gibson was more outspoken. ""They can't let the game get out of hand like that,"" Gibson said of the referees. ""Guys are throwing elbows and throwing cheap shots. That's what I said, `They got to do a better job."" Kemba Walker chipped in with 20 points, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had 12 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots for Charlotte (17-13). The Hornets had a crucial four-point swing go their way with 3 minutes left when Batum hustled down the floor to block the 7-foot Lopez's layup off a fast break. Walker then converted a reverse layup on the other end. Despite the efforts of Jimmy Butler, who drained back-to-back jumpers, the Bulls could never quite claw back in it after that. TIP-INS Bulls: Dwyane Wade played despite battling a migraine headache most of the day and had 12 points on 5-of-16 shooting. ... Chicago outrebounded the Hornets 52-48. Hornets: Marco Belinelli left the game in the second quarter with a sprained left ankle and did not return. He hopped on one foot to the locker room after coming down wrong on his foot. ... Before the game, Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg called Walker one of the best guards in the NBA, saying, ""he's a guy that can take over games at any time. He can get into the paint. He does a great job getting into the bigs' bodies, keeping them off, where he can finish at the rim."" BLOCK PARTY The Hornets held the Bulls to 39.6 percent shooting and blocked a season-high 13 shots. ""I thought we started the game with the right attitude, right approach, right physicality,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""Our rebounding and our defense in the first half was really good. Second half, they hurt us some on the offensive glass, but our guys made a lot of good plays BUTLER STAYS HOT Jimmy Butler had 26 points for the Bulls (14-15), who have lost five of their last six to fall below .500 for the first time this season. Butler has scored at least 20 points in 24 of the team's 29 games this season. TOUGH STRETCH AHEAD The Hornets have a tough stretch coming up, including a home game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""Once we got back from our road trip we said we need to find a new intensity and I think we've done that these last few games and hopefully it keeps going,"" said forward Frank Kaminsky.","400899884"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- Most NBA games are decided in the last few minutes. The Orlando Magic's 109-90 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night may have been decided in the first few minutes. The Magic blocked eight of Los Angeles' first 16 shots and took a 10-point lead before the Lakers scored. ""That first quarter defensively set the tone for the whole game,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""It's not easy playing ahead in this league with the way teams are coming after you, but it's probably a lot easier than playing from behind. We've been in that situation a lot, when we're climbing uphill."" This time it was the Lakers trying to climb back and they never made it, losing for the 12th time in 13 games in the conclusion of a seven-game trip. The Magic blocked nine shots in the first quarter, a franchise record for a quarter. ""We've been playing good basketball offensively, but defensively not so good,"" said Bismack Biyombo, who had three of the blocks. ""We've got to get back to establish ourselves as a defensive team, and I think tonight we did a better job than last night (in a loss at New York)."" Elfrid Payton had 25 points and nine assists, and the Magic shot 51 percent. ""We went with the game plan, but guys were just making shots,"" said Jordan Clarkson, who led the Lakers with 18 points. ""He (Payton) got hot and made shots that we wanted him to take."" Serge Ibaka contributed 19 points, 11 rebounds and five of Orlando's 11 blocks. D.J. Augustin made two 3-pointers and a layup while the Magic blocked five of the Lakers' first seven shots, taking a 10-0 lead before Nick Young got the Lakers on the board with 6:51 left in the first quarter. Orlando ran off to a 25-point lead in the first half and led 57-40 at halftime. Clarkson made three 3-pointers and a dunk during a 16-2 run that helped the Lakers get within six, at 88-82, early in the fourth quarter. But C.J. Watson scored seven of 13 straight Orlando points to help the Magic put the game away. ""The problem when you get down big is that it takes a lot of energy to get back in it,"" said Lakes coach Luke Walton. ""Guys are dying out there, and we go to the bench and start playing guys that aren't used to playing."" MEEKS GETS FIRST MAGIC START Jodie Meeks had nine points and five rebounds in his first start for the Magic against his former team. Meeks played in 155 games over two seasons with the Lakers, averaging a career-high 15.7 points in 2013-2014. HOME NOT SO SWEET Friday night's win was only the third for the Magic in their last 10 home games. ""It's baffling that we haven't won more at home, but I think that will iron itself out as the season goes along. I think we'll finish with a plus-.500 record,"" predicted Vogel. ""I think it's some early-season struggle that we'll get past."" TIP-INS Lakers: F Julius Randle missed the game, having attended the birth of son Kyden in Los Angeles on Friday morning. . . . C Tarik Black (sprained right ankle) and G Jose Calderon (strained right hamstring) did not play, but both expect to play soon.

"CLEVELAND -- LeBron James and the Cavaliers look ready for the marquee matchup in the NBA this season, a Christmas Day game against the Golden State Warriors. James scored 19 points, Kevin Love added 14 points and 15 rebounds, and Cleveland rolled past the Brooklyn Nets, 119-99 on Friday night. Cleveland, which has won four straight and nine of 10, hosts Golden State on Sunday in a rematch of the last two NBA Finals. The defending champion Cavaliers (22-6) never trailed against the Nets and built a 46-point lead in the third quarter. The postgame talk focused more on Sunday -- which marks the second straight year Cleveland and Golden State have played on Christmas -- than the rout of the Nets. ""It's great,"" James said. ""Christmas Day for our fans is the biggest day for our season, besides we have All-Star and then finals. I'm happy I'm part of it once again."" The lopsided margin gave the Cavaliers a chance to rest their stars heading into Sunday's showdown. James, Love and Kyrie Irving, who had 13 points and 10 assists, were all removed with 3:57 remaining in the third quarter and Cleveland leading 90-48. ""There will definitely be high emotions in both locker rooms,"" Irving said. ""That's a given. If you're not getting up for this game, all the great players who will be on the floor at one time, you shouldn't be in there."" Tristan Thompson, who had 16 points and 11 rebounds, was also taken out late in the third. Love returned after missing two games because of a bruised left knee. Brook Lopez scored 16 points for the Nets, whose first possession of the game ended when Justin Hamilton's pass sailed into the third row of the seats. They have lost five straight, including games on back-to-back nights against the Warriors and Cavaliers. Cleveland's only loss in its last 10 games came when coach Tyronn Lue chose to rest James, Love and Irving against Memphis on Dec. 14, a 93-85 defeat. The Cavaliers will face the Warriors without starting guard J.R. Smith, who could be sidelined until the end of the regular season following surgery Friday for a broken right thumb. ""We're going against a great team,"" James said. ""They're a well-oiled machine."" Mike Dunleavy scored a season-high 14 points for Cleveland. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 13 points while Sean Kilpatrick added 12 for the Nets, who are 1-14 on the road and have lost 11 straight away from home. ""They came out and jumped on us immediately,"" Lopez said. ""We seemed a bit timid and tentative, and they're a team that definitely feeds off that."" TIP-INS Nets: F Anthony Bennett was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 draft by the Cavaliers, but only spent one year with them. He's averaging 4.7 points and 3.6 rebounds for Brooklyn, his fourth NBA team. ... G Joe Harris, drafted by Cleveland in 2014, is averaging 9.8 points. ... F Trevor Booker was given the night off to rest. Cavaliers: G DeAndre Liggins started for the second straight game in place of Smith and scored three points. Smith's injury is also expected to result in more playing time for Dunleavy, who came into Friday averaging 4.3 points. ... Cleveland is 9-0 against the Atlantic Division. HISTORIC MATCHUP? Golden State defeated Cleveland in six games in the 2015 finals. The Cavaliers rallied from a 3-1 deficit to win last season's championship. Lue was asked if their matchup can approach the Lakers-Celtics rivalry of the 1980s. ""Both teams stay together and continue to keep winning, it could be like that,"" he said. ""They have a great team and we have a great team, also. When you talk basketball, you're going to talk Golden State, Cleveland, San Antonio. It's a great place to be in.""","400899886"
"BOSTON -- With the clock running down and the Thunder falling behind, Russell Westbrook turned unstoppable. The Oklahoma City point guard had his 14th triple-double of the season and his third straight 40-point game, scoring 45 points with 11 assists and 11 rebounds on Friday night to lead the Thunder to a 117-112 victory over the Boston Celtics. Westbrook scored the last seven points of the first half after and Oklahoma City's last 15 in the game, including eight straight during a 10-0 run that gave the Thunder the lead for good. ""It's important for me to know how to close games,"" Westbrook said. ""All the best players figure out how to close games."" Enes Kanter and rookie Domantas Sabonis scored 20 points for Oklahoma City, which had lost three of its previous five games. Isaiah Thomas had 34 points and 10 assists and Al Horford scored 23 points for Boston, which had won a season-high four straight games. But Westbrook took control when it mattered, converting a three-point play to give the Thunder the lead with just under 3 minutes left, and then making two long 3-pointers in the final 75 seconds to ice it. ""We've got really good defenders on him and he made great plays,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""I don't know what to say other than `Hats off to him' for plays he made."" Westbrook didn't make his first basket until 4 minutes into the second quarter. But with 45 seconds left in the second quarter, Westbrook hit a 27-footer to tie the game 54-all and followed it with a layup to give the Thunder the lead. He closed out the half with two free throws, heading into the break with 16 points, nine assists and four rebounds. The Celtics tied it 96-96 in the third when Thomas drove and converted a three-point play with about 7 minutes left. As he stepped to the line to take the free throw, the crowd chanted ""M-V-P!"" Boston led 104-100 lead when Westbrook went off on another run. After Jerami Grant's dunk cut it to two points, Westbrook scored the next eight. In all, he scored Oklahoma City's final 15 points. TIP-INS Thunder: Thunder coach Billy Donovan coached Horford at Florida. ... Anthony Morrow had a block in the fourth quarter that ricocheted off the referee and into the stands. Celtics: Led for all but 65 seconds in the first half. ... Horford surpassed 20,000 minutes in his career. ... Boston's 17-13 record is the same after 30 games as last season. HACK-A-ROBERSON After Westbrook gave the Thunder the lead, the Celtics tried to climb back in front by intentionally fouling Andre Roberson. Twice in the final 3 minutes they sent him to the line -- he missed all four free throws -- but Donovan left him in the game. ""He's going to be in that situation later in the year,"" Donovan said. ""It's easy to pull the guy out and say `He can't make free throws.' But I think it's important to show confidence in him."" LIKE FATHER Sabonis was 7 for 7 for 17 points in the first half to surpass his career high of 15. The son of Hall of Famer Arvydas Sabonis scored only three points in the second but, along with Kanter, pulled enough defenders away from Westbrook to cause problems. ""I think if we shut one of those guys down we get this game,"" Celtics forward Amir Johnson said. ""Westbrook causes so much attention we leave those other guys open and they made shots.""","400899887"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- The Golden State Warriors gave the Detroit Pistons a shot at an upset, turning the ball over more than they had in any game this season. They made up for mistakes by making a lot of shots. Draymond Green had a tiebreaking dunk with 1:31 left and Kevin Durant scored 32 points despite playing in foul trouble, lifting Golden State to a 119-113 victory on Friday night. ""We can't win many games when we give up 33 points on turnovers, but we finished strong,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""Give them credit, too. That's a top-five defense, and they forced a lot of those turnovers."" Golden State had a season-high 23 turnovers, surpassing the 20 it had in a 20-point loss Nov. 4 against the Los Angeles Lakers. The NBA-leading Warriors have won seven straight, rolling with their new star, Durant, as they head into their Christmas NBA Finals rematch in Cleveland. Stephen Curry had 25 points and eight assists, Klay Thompson scored 17 points, including two on a lead-padding jumper with 22 seconds to go, and reserve JaVale McGee added 15. ""We couldn't guard them,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""Look at their numbers."" Golden State made 56 percent of its shots and was 11 of 27 from the 3-point line. The Pistons have lost five in a row. Detroit's Tobias Harris scored a season-high 26 points in his first game this season off the bench. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 25 points, Reggie Jackson scored 17 and Andre Drummond had 15 points and nine rebounds. ""When your team plays that hard and you still can't guard them, I need to look in the mirror because we didn't give them a good enough game plan,"" Van Gundy said. TIP-INS Warriors: Green scored just five points, but had game highs with 12 assists and 10 rebounds in his return from a one-game absence. Green said he was on an airplane in New York before it took off for San Francisco on Thursday morning and watched the birth of his son, Draymond Jamal Green , via FaceTime. He spent the day with his newborn son and girlfriend, Jelissa Hardy, in California before rejoining his team for Friday night's game. The forward had the option of staying home, but said it would've been selfish to accept the offer because his son and girlfriend were healthy and his teammates have kids of all ages they leave behind for games. ""My legs weren't really there, so my shots weren't falling, but you get used to tough travel in this league,"" said Green, who was 1 of 8. ""It was an amazing thing to be there and welcome my son into the world, and then to come and play here."" Pistons: Jon Leuer replaced Harris in the starting lineup and it might've served to motivate Harris. ""As a player, you shut up and put your big-boy pants on and play,"" he said. Van Gundy was pleased with how Harris handled being a reserve. ""He was disappointed by not starting, and got a season high plus seven rebounds,"" he said. ""That's a professional, professional performance. The lineup change didn't help Detroit early, as it fell behind before rallying in what was a closely contested game the rest of the night with 18 lead changes and 10 ties. In his first start of the season, Leuer had eight points, slightly less than his 11.2 average and fewer than the 17-plus points he scored the previous three games. FIRED UP Van Gundy looked and sounded livid the Pistons left Green open for a back-door cut on his go-ahead dunk late in the game. ""We showed that play in the timeout,"" he said. ""We expected the play. That's inexcusable."" IN THE RAFTERS The Pistons announced Friday they will retire Richard Hamilton's No. 32 jersey on Feb. 26 at halftime of a game against the Boston Celtics. The former Connecticut star, who led the Pistons in scoring in eight of nine seasons, helped the franchise win the 2004 NBA championship and advance to at least the Eastern Conference finals six years in a row. AT HOME ON ROAD The Warriors helped the Pistons pack The Palace and many in the sellout crowd of 21,012 were rooting for the visitors. ""I've been a fan in this building a lot of times, and I know the people here don't cheer for visiting teams, so it shows what being on this team is like,"" said Green, who is from Saginaw, Michigan, and starred at Michigan State.","400899888"
"MILWAUKEE --  For the first time in his NBA career, 22-year-old Giannis Antetokounmpo's dominance led to loud ""M-V-P"" chants from the crowd. Antetokounmpo had a career-high 39 points, eight rebounds and six assists and the Milwaukee Bucks had no trouble beating the Washington Wizards 123-96 on Friday night. ""We could sit here and talk about him all day,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""He was great."" Milwaukee scored a season-high in the first half to lead 73-58 and cruised to victory. It was the most points given up in a half this season by the Wizards. ""Everything went wrong,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. Antetokounmpo made 12 of 19 shots and 15 of 17 free throws in 33 minutes. With the Bradley Center crowd chanting ""M-V-P,"" the 6-foot-11 forward missed a free throw with just over 6 minutes left that would have given him 40 points. ""In my mind I was going `Wow,"" he said of the chants. ""But I'm not there yet. I'm going to keep working hard, keep helping my team to do things and get wins, and hopefully I can get there one day."" The Bucks led 109-82 at the time, and two possessions later Kidd removed Antetokounmpo for the rest of the game. ""What was special about Giannis tonight is we didn't call his number, the ball found him and he delivered,"" Kidd said. ""He did the hard work by putting the ball in the basket."" John Wall and Otto Porter scored 18 points each for Washington, but the Wizards trailed 100-78 after three quarters and neither played in the fourth. Wall had 10 assists in just under 32 minutes. ""They killed us in fast-break points, second-chance points and free throws,"" Wall said. ""All that. They beat us in all phases."" Jabari Parker added 21 points and eight rebounds for Milwaukee, which had lost five of seven. Malcolm Brogdon made all seven of his shots for 17 points, and added seven assists in 29 minutes. Bradley Beal missed seven of 10 shots and scored only 10 points in 31 minutes for the Wizards. He came into the game averaging 22.7 points. The Bucks took the lead for good, 17-16, on a free throw by Parker with 6:03 left in the first quarter, and extended it to 56-36 midway through the second. Washington never got within single digits the rest of the game. Antetokounmpo's previous high was 34 points, done twice, the latest on Nov. 29, against Cleveland. In addition, Milwaukee's reserves outscored Washington's bench, 42-28. TIP-INS Wizards: Porter started after missing the second half of Wednesday's game at Chicago with back spasms. ... Washington beat the Bucks 110-105 on Dec. 10. Bucks: F Michael Beasley missed his fifth consecutive game with a sprained left foot. ... G Rashad Vaughn sprained his left ankle during shootaround Friday and missed the game. ... G Khris Middleton, who underwent surgery on his left hamstring before the season, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he expects to play this year, but acknowledged he was a long way off from playing. OFFENSE ISN'T EVERYTHING Milwaukee's Mirza Teletovic missed all nine of his shots, but the Bucks outscored the Wizards by 23 points during his 24 minutes of action. ""That's pretty incredible,"" Kidd said. ""To not score a point and have that big of an impact on the game, so his defense must have been really good."" IN THE PAINT Before the game, Brooks said the key for his team was to stop Milwaukee from scoring inside, but the Bucks outscored the Wizards 66-46 in the paint. ""We can't expect to win on the road against a very athletic team giving up easy buckets around the paint. That's what they do. We didn't make them play to their weakness at all."" SEEING DOUBLE Milwaukee played two games with both Chicago and Cleveland before starting this back-to-back series with the Wizards. The Bucks beat Chicago twice and lost two to the Cavaliers. ""I've never seen anything like it in my playing or coaching career,"" Brooks said of the quirky schedule. ""It's almost like a playoff mentality."" The Bucks and Wizards play four times in 32 days this season.","400899889"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Mike Conley is starting to look like his old self again and so are the Memphis Grizzlies. Conley scored 24 points and Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol each added 16 to help the Grizzlies beat the Houston Rockets 115-109 on Friday night. ""It's good to see us slowly but surely getting back our team,"" said Memphis coach David Fizdale, who's seen Conley, Chandler Parsons, James Ennis and Vince Carter all return from injury this month. Memphis snapped a three-game home skid and ended Houston's road winning streak at five. Carter made a pair of 3-pointers during a 10-0 Grizzlies run early in the fourth quarter that broke it open. Houston led 78-77 to start the final period on a Patrick Beverley 3-pointer. But Memphis outscored the Rockets 21-5 over the next 5 minutes and took a 98-83 lead on Jarell Martin's putback dunk with 6:51 left. ""They made the run, but we gave them points, especially to start that fourth quarter off,"" Rockets guard James Harden said. ""You can't give a good team like Memphis, especially here, a (10-0) run. It makes it hard for anybody to come back. Tough. We fought back. We didn't give up, but you can't allow it to happen."" Ryan Anderson led Houston with a season-high 31 points. Harden had 16 points, 17 assists, seven rebounds and nine turnovers in 36 minutes. ""The guy is just reinventing the (point guard) position,"" Fizdale said about Harden, who finished 6-of-13 from the floor but attempted just three free throws. ""There's no other point guard in the league like that. ""Luckily we have a guy like Tony Allen who can at least make him work."" It was the Rockets' first road loss since Nov. 29, when they dropped a 120-101 decision at Utah. ""We weren't hitting our normal shots. That's not us,"" Anderson said. TIP-INS Rockets: The Rockets had won five straight games on the road, starting with a 132-127 double-overtime win at Golden State on Dec. 1. ... C Montrezl Harrell started for the second straight game after getting his first start of the season Wednesday at Phoenix. He finished with 16 points and 8 rebounds after scoring a career-high tying 17 in the Rockets' 125-111 win at Phoenix ... Anderson entered Friday's game averaging 15.8 on the road this season compared to 10.2 points at home. He finished 10-of-18 from the field Friday, including 8-of-14 from long range. Grizzlies: Parsons started his second straight game after missing the last 17 with a bone bruise in his left knee. Parsons had just two points (on 1-of-5 shooting) and two rebounds in 15 minutes in his first game back Wednesday against the Pistons. He wasn't much better Friday, contributing four points and three rebounds in 15 minutes. ... Conley needs five more steals to reach 1,000 for his career. ... It was the 1,299th game of Carter's career. He'll become just the 21st player in NBA history to reach 1,300 in the next game he plays, likely when the Grizzlies face Orlando on Monday. CONLEY SHAKES OFF RUST In his fifth game back since missing nine straight with transverse process fractures in vertebrae in his lower back, Conley went 9 of 17 from the field, including 3 of 6 from 3-point range. He had made a combined nine field goals in his previous two games, going 9 of 26 from the floor. ""He's back a month early and doing it without painkillers. That's as tough as it gets,"" Fizdale said before Friday's game. ""What he has is a really painful injury. I knew he was tough, but I didn't know he was that tough."" `IT'S BASKETBALL' Conley and Beverley were involved in a fourth-quarter scrum late in the game after they went after a loose ball. Beverley was assessed a technical foul on the play after getting tangled up with Conley. ""It's basketball. It's physical. If that was a pile-up at a football game, you guys wouldn't even be asking me that question,"" Fizdale said of the tussle. ""(Beverley) may have given him a little bit of extra, but that's part of the deal. When two really good teams are going at it, nobody is going to give it up. I wasn't worried about it at all.""","400899890"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis and the Pelicans only looked as if they were in trouble when Justice Winslow's emphatic dunk put the Miami ahead by 14 points late in the third quarter. ""We had a lot of miscommunication on defense, but we had a whole other quarter left,"" Davis said. ""We always play to the end, no matter what the score is. Coach just told us, `We got to make a run,' ... We ended up pulling it off."" Davis had 28 points, a career-high 22 rebounds and four blocked shots, and New Orleans strung together runs of 15-0 and 12-0 down the stretch to beat the Heat 91-87 on Friday night. Davis was at his best after halftime, when he led the comeback with 19 of his points and 14 of his rebounds. With coach Alvin Gentry opting to play Davis often at center as part of a small, quicker lineup down the stretch, Davis was able to assert himself under the basket on both ends to reach a new high in rebounds, which included seven on the offensive end, Jrue Holiday added 22 points for the Pelicans, who shot only 37 percent, but scored their last 37 points inside the final 16 minutes. ""When you don't shoot well, you've got to play well defensively and I think down the stretch that's what we did, and we started making shots, too,"" Davis said. ""We've got to realize that our defense fuels out offense, so when we play well defensively and into guys and being physical and rebound the basketball, then we're able to get out and run and it kind of gets our energy up."" Langston Galloway added 11 points, hitting a pair of 3s during New Orleans' late charge. Goran Dragic had 23 points for Miami. The Heat scored just 19 points during the final 15:21 of the game and committed six of their 15 turnovers in the fourth quarter. ""I feel like we controlled the game for 35 minutes and then they came out really aggressive and they played excellent defense,"" Dragic said. ""We didn't execute and in the end we fell short. No excuses. We need to do more."" Hassan Whiteside had 10 points and 18 rebounds for Miami. Winslow scored 12 points, but none after his dunk, missing his last four shots. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said his team's inability to keep the lead ""really started with our offense -- it really got stagnant."" ""We've been in so many of these close games. Our guys really care,"" Spoelstra added. ""It's kind of disappointing that we are not able to get the result."" DAVIS IN THE MIDDLE With coach Alvin Gentry opting to play Davis often at center as part of a small, quicker lineup down the stretch, Davis was able to assert himself under the basket on both ends to reach a new high in rebounds, including seven on the offensive end. ""He did a much better job on the offensive boards tonight,"" Gentry said. ""It wasn't so much the defensive rebounds because he's always come up with those."" TOUGH SLOG Stylistically, the game was marred by stretches of disjointed, stagnant play by both teams, resulting in possessions that ended with missed, low-percentage shots or turnovers. The Heat never trailed by more than five points and led throughout the second and third quarters, going up 68-54 with 3:22 to go in the third period. Gentry then called timeout and New Orleans scored the next 15 points during the next six minutes. Davis hit his second 3 of the game during the run, cutting Miami's lead to 68-64 as the third quarter ended, and New Orleans went up 69-68 on Solomon Hill's 3. Miami briefly retook momentum with a 9-0 run, fueled by James Johnson's 3 and his jumper. At that point, New Orleans was shooting worse than 34 percent, but still in the game, trailing 77-69 with half the quarter left. The Pelicans scored 12 straight to pull back in front, and Galloway's 3 a few possessions later made it 88-83 with 1:13 to go. TIP-INS Heat: Tyler Johnson and James Johnson each scored 11 for Miami. ... The Heat have lost five straight on the road. ... Miami lost despite outshooting New Orleans 41.4 percent to 37.1 percent and outrebounding the Pelicans 59-52. Pelicans: Reserve F Terrence Jones, who averages nearly 11 points, was out sick. ...

"MINNEAPOLIS --  In their first year under coach Dave Joerger, the Sacramento Kings are beginning to discover how they want to play, and the fourth quarter is quickly becoming theirs. DeMarcus Cousins scored 32 points, including 21 in the second half, and Sacramento came back to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 109-105 on Friday night for its third straight victory. Cousins hit three 3-pointers and added seven rebounds and seven assists for Sacramento, which has won four of its past five games. The Kings have come from behind in each game during their win streak and have outscored opponents 96-62 in the fourth. ""I think we're starting to realize what it takes to win games,"" Cousins said. ""We're doing a great job of playing together, moving the ball, getting everybody involved. Guys are having fun right now. Everything's just clicking."" Anthony Tolliver came off the bench to go 5 of 7 on 3s and score 17 points as the Kings hit a season-high 15 3-pointers in 29 attempts. Zach LaVine scored a career-high 40 points and tied a career best with seven 3s for Minnesota. Karl-Anthony Towns tallied his 10th straight double-double with 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who had won three of their previous four games. ""We didn't play any defense from start to finish,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""When we needed to play our best, we played our worst. So, disappointing."" Ricky Rubio had a season-high 13 points, all in the third, as the Timberwolves opened a nine-point lead. But just like in that last game in Utah, Cousins and the Kings took control in the fourth. Cousins had 12 points and Lawson had nine of his 15 in the period. Sacramento also held Minnesota to 6-of-21 shooting in the fourth. ""We didn't have a lot of pop and came out to start the fourth quarter, made a run right away and picked up our level of intensity,"" Joerger said. ""And then we made some great plays at the end."" The Timberwolves felt they were making similar progress in their first year with Thibodeau as coach after pulling out close wins against Chicago, Phoenix and Atlanta, and going to overtime against Houston. ""Every time you lose it's discouraging because, for us, we've been in a chance to win almost every game,"" LaVine said. ""It's annoying, but you just have to have thick skin and move on to the next one."" TIP-INS Kings: Rudy Gay missed his sixth straight game with a right hip flexor strain. Omar Casspi was available after missing four games due to an illness but didn't play. ... Starting in place of Gay, Matt Barnes scored 10 points, his first double-digit effort since Dec. 2. ... The Kings are undefeated when shooting at least 50 percent. Timberwolves: LaVine scored 19 points in the second quarter, his second-highest quarter of his career, trailing 20 in the fourth against Golden State on April 11, 2015. . Gorgui Dieng had two blocks. It was his sixth straight game with multiple blocks, the longest active streak in the NBA. . Minnesota hit 12 of 32 from 3, its ninth game this season with at least 10 3-pointers. It's the team's highest total since a club-record 18 occurrences in 2013-14. PLENTY IN RESERVE A big reason for Sacramento's streak has been the play of the team's bench. After outscoring Utah's reserves 49-21, the Kings' bench outscored Minnesota's reserves 45-11. ""Our bench has been incredible,"" Cousins said. ""Our bench has won us some games this year. There have been some games where the first group has just been completely off. So, our bench has been incredible this year. They're stepping up, they're ready to play."" GOING DEEP LaVine's continues his progression in his third season, particularly from the outside. LaVine has shot 24 of 48 from 3-point range over the last six games.

"DENVER --  With Dwight Howard out again, Paul Millsap stepped up and delivered for the Atlanta Hawks. Millsap capped a 9-0 run in the final 1:43 with two free throws and the Hawks rallied to beat the Denver Nuggets 109-108 on Friday night. Dennis Schroder had 27 points and Millsap finished with 20 points and eight rebounds for the injury-depleted Hawks. Atlanta played its third straight game without Howard because of lower back stiffness. Kyle Korver also was unavailable and Tim Hardaway Jr. was nursing an injured groin. Still, the Hawks won their fourth straight on the road. ""We dug deep,"" Millsap said. ""We were without three of our top-minute guys and we were able to get the win. It means a lot but it means nothing if we don't take it to the next game."" The Nuggets led 108-100 but Atlanta scored seven straight points from the line to make it a one-point game with 42.8 seconds left. One of the free throws came after Denver coach Michael Malone was hit with a technical. Schroder made the free throw, and Thabo Sefolosha sank two more to pull the Hawks within 108-107. ""Obviously, the technical was a big play. I apologized to our team,"" Malone said. ""I did not realize what I said was something you could get a technical for. I think it's a slightly ridiculous call, considering the time and score of the game."" Wilson Chandler missed on the other end, and Millsap was fouled on the baseline by Darrell Arthur. He calmly hit two free throws with 6 seconds remaining to put Atlanta ahead. ""You never know in this league how you can win games,"" Millsap said. ""Tonight we were able to do it through free throws and being aggressive, getting rebounds and frustrating their coach to get a technical. We found a way to win."" Chandler missed a runner in the lane and Millsap got the rebound to seal the win. ""We got some tough calls, some questionable calls, and we didn't execute down the stretch,"" Chandler said. ""I had a good look at the end it just didn't go down."" Danilo Gallinari had 21 points and a season-high 11 rebounds for the Nuggets. Chandler had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Emmanuel Mudiay scored eight of his 17 points in the fourth quarter. Mudiay hit four straight foul shots to put Denver ahead 108-100 before the Hawks started getting to the line to spark their comeback. ""Give them credit, they just made the plays at the end and we didn't,"" Denver guard Will Barton said. TIP-INS Hawks: Coach Mike Budenholzer said he doesn't think Hardaway's groin injury suffered Monday will be a long-term situation. ... Korver was ruled out just before the game because of illness. Nuggets: Jusuf Nurkic did not play and has fallen out of the rotation. He has not played the past two games and has logged only 13 total minutes in the last four games overall. ... Nikola Jokic led the Nuggets with six assists. WORKING HIS WAY BACK Budenholzer sounded optimistic that Howard would not miss many games. The Hawks left him home for the game in Denver to expedite his recovery. ""I'd actually say he's going in the right direction,"" Budenholzer said. ""Part of not traveling was hoping that we could keep it going in the right direction and probably be extra cautious, extra conservative or conservatively aggressive. I think we're all hopeful he'll be able to play very soon. We'll see between now and the 26th.""","400899893"
"SALT LAKE CITY -- The only thing that could stop Kyle Lowry against Utah was a collision with Gordon Hayward that resulted in a cut above his lip. While Lowry was out getting a couple of stitches in the third quarter, the Jazz regained the lead but the Toronto Raptors point guard returned with even more determination. Lowry took advantage of a depleted Utah guard corps by scoring a season-high 36 points, including 19 in the fourth quarter, to lead the Raptors to a 104-98 victory over the Jazz on Friday night. ""For me, it's all about winning games. That's all that matters. I'll do whatever it takes to win games,"" Lowry said. Lowry was nearly unstoppable whether he pulled up for a 3-pointer or drove the lane unfazed by the lurking Rudy Gobert. He shot 9 for 10 in the final quarter as the Raptors set a franchise record with six straight wins on the road. ""This team just loves the game of basketball. It doesn't matter where we're playing, whether we're in tough environments or not,"" Lowry said. The Jazz led 84-83 with the crowd in full throat before Lowry took over the game with dazzling drives and high-arcing jumpers. ""He just gives us fight and grit. He dove on the floor for a loose ball. Didn't even hesitate and came back with stitches. That's the kind of spirit and toughness you got to have to win in this league,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. DeMar DeRozan, who had 24 points, regained his composure from a cold shooting stretch and a flagrant foul to make two key baskets as the Raptors topped the century mark for the 16th straight game, one behind Houston's league-leading 17. ""We're a team that's just going to keep playing even if things aren't going our way. Even if we're missing shots, we have the type of team where any guy is liable to get going and carry us,"" DeRozan said. Gordon Hayward led Utah with 23 points, Trey Lyles had 19 and Shelvin Mack added 17 for the Jazz, who have dropped three straight after winning seven of eight. DeRozan had missed five closely contested jumpers in the third quarter and his frustration was showing as he glared at the officials. With 38 seconds left in the quarter, DeRozan plowed unabated into Lyles when he wasn't looking and received a Flagrant 1 foul. Lyles made one free throw and then Joe Johnson made a 3-pointer to give the Jazz a 74-71 lead, their first since early in the second quarter. Lyles had eight points in the 14-1 run that turned the tables. The Raptors, who shot 53 percent, have won seven of their last eight games. DeRozan led the hot-shooting Raptors (58 percent) with 16 first-half points as Toronto took a 56-51 lead. TIP-INS Raptors: Lucas Nogueira made his first 3-point attempt of the season and just the second 3 of his career. ... Toronto was plus-21 in the 33 minutes that Lowry was on the court. ... The Raptors had only 12 assists, five by Lowry, on their 43 field goals. Jazz: Dante Exum joined Alec Burks (ankle) and George Hill (toe) on the injured list with knee tendinitis. Hood was questionable with the flu but ended up starting and scored just two points in 14 minutes. ... Gobert has 10 consecutive double-doubles, longest streak by a Jazz in seven seasons. ... Joe Ingles, who leads the NBA in 3-point percentage, made 2 of 4 from beyond the arc. STAT LINE Lowry hasn't scored this many points in a win since his epic 43-point, buzzer-beating performance in a 99-97 victory over Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2016. Lowry shot an identical 15 for 20 from the field in that game. QUOTABLE ""I'm going to bust Kyle's lip some more if that's what it takes to get him going,"" DeRozan said. ""When your point guard is capable of doing all things he was doing tonight, it makes everything so much easier for us. ... It felt like every time the ball left his hands it was going in.""","400899894"
"PHOENIX -- The Phoenix Suns sleepwalked through the first half and steamrolled through the second.

Devin Booker added 23 points for the Suns, making four 3-pointers, and T.J. Warren scored 19. ""They have dynamic guards (Bledsoe, Booker and Brandon Knight),"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""...We had a hard time defending their backcourt."" Joel Embiid, the highest-scoring rookie in the NBA, scored 27 points for the 76ers in the opener of a four-game trip to the West. Sergio Rodriguez added 21. Philadelphia led by as many as 14 in the first half and was up by 13 at the break. The Suns built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter before Philadelphia cut it to four in the waning seconds. ""At the start of the fourth quarter we just turned the ball over,"" Embiid said. ""We took a lot of bad shots and they just made a lot of shots, too. They've got good guards and got the shots they wanted."" The Suns outscored the 76ers 70-50 in the second half, 42-31 in the fourth quarter. Bledsoe said that coach Earl Watson spent halftime ""cussing us out."" ""He did what he should have done,"" Bledsoe said. ""We played like crap and he came out and did what a great coach should do: tell us what we did wrong, chew us out about it. Everybody got pumped up for the second half and it made a big difference."" Phoenix's 123 points were a season high. ""Defense always creates offense,"" Watson said. ""It's easier to score when you have teams in transition."" Phoenix took control for good with a 19-7 run that began with 8 1/2 minutes to play and ended on Warren's 3-pointer that put the Suns ahead 109-97 with 3:38 remaining. ""Especially toward the end of the game, we really locked in defensively and got the stops when we needed to,"" Warren said. ""We just need to get consistent, get defensive stops and execute on offense."" Trailing by 13 at the break, the Suns made four 3-pointers, two by Booker, to open the second half with a 16-2 run, briefly taking the lead at 69-68 on P.J. Tucker's 17-footer. But Embiid sank a 3 at the other end and Philadelphia never trailed again in the quarter, leading 85-81 entering the fourth. TIP-INS 76ers: Philadelphia was without reserve guard Nik Stauskas (bruised right knee). ... Richaun Holmes remains in the concussion protocol and is not with the team. ... Embiid entered the averaging 17.9 points. ... The 76ers' 31 first-quarter points were a season high. Suns: Phoenix committed five straight turnovers in a stretch of the first quarter but Philadelphia got only two points off them. ... At one point in the second quarter, a fan yelled at Watson: ""Coach, this ain't Golden State. How about playing some defense?"" ... The Suns' four-game losing streak had matched their longest of the season. ... Phoenix split the season series with Philadelphia 1-1. BIG FIRST HALF The 76ers had their highest-scoring half of the season, leading by as many as 14 and taking a 66-53 lead at the break. Philadelphia shot 52 percent in the first two quarters and was 16 of 16 from the foul line. T.J. McConnell's 3-pointer put the 76ers up 51-38 with 6:01 left in the half and Embiid's 15-footer gave Philadelphia a 61-47 lead. Phoenix cut it to eight but Philadelphia scored the last five points of the half, capped by Rodriguez's 3 to make it a 13-point game at the half.","400899895"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The San Antonio Spurs were determined not to make the second of a back-to-back turn into two straight losses. Coming off a loss to the Clippers in Los Angeles the night before, the Spurs dominated the Portland Trail Blazers 110-90 on Friday night despite resting key players. ""We wanted to get one back,"" said Kawhi Leonard, who led San Antonio with 33 points. ""We definitely didn't want to lose two games in a row."" Patty Mills added a season-high 23 points off the bench for the Spurs, who led by as many as 21 points in the second half. Former Blazer LaMarcus Aldridge had 18 points and 14 rebounds. Damian Lillard had 16 points and 10 assists for his seventh double-double of the season for the slumping Blazers, who have lost five straight and nine of their last 10 games. The loss may have been costly. Lillard rolled his left ankle midway through the fourth quarter and afterward coach Terry Stotts said it was sprained. X-rays were planned later Friday night. ""I know I rolled it good. I went back in the game because I wanted to test it, and it hurt,"" Lillard said. ""Went out there for a few possessions and it didn't make sense to even be out there."" Lillard was asked how long he might be sidelined. ""I don't know how well y'all know me, but I don't plan on sitting out,"" he said, vowing to do everything possible to get back in time for Monday's game against the Raptors. The Spurs rested Pau Gasol, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Coach Gregg Popovich said the night off was necessary because the Spurs ""play four games in 5 1/2 days."" ""The guys that have a little age on them, there's no way they can play that many games,"" Popovich said. The trio has 44 years combined in the NBA. The Spurs, who had their five-game winning streak snapped Thursday, have won nine of 11. Replacing Parker and Gasol in the starting lineup were DeWayne Dedmon and rookie Dejounte Murray. It was Aldridge's second trip back to the Moda Center with San Antonio. Aldridge played for the Blazers for the first nine seasons of his career before heading to the Spurs in 2015 as a free agent. Some fans apparently hadn't gotten over his departure, and booed him at introductions and when he had the ball. Portland was without Evan Turner, who missed his third straight game with a sore ankle. Aldridge's turnaround hook gave the Spurs a 43-33 lead midway thought the second quarter. The Spurs pushed the lead to 52-40 on Jonathan Simmons' basket and went into the break ahead 57-45. Lillard struggled in the first half, making just two of eight shots from the floor with five points, but he had six assists. Mills' 3-pointer pushed San Antonio's lead to 83-66 in the third quarter, and Leonard's fast-break layup made it 96-78 with 7:15 left. ""I thought we were excellent. It was one of our better defensive performances and I thought we played with great intensity,"" Popovich said. TIP-INS Spurs: The Spurs are one of 10 NBA teams playing on Christmas Day this year. San Antonio will host the Chicago Bulls. Popovich was asked before the game what he thought of the holiday tradition. ""They're pretty exciting, actually. Sure, I'd rather spend it with my family, but the fans love it,"" he said. ...  It was the eighth time this season that Leonard has scored more than 30 points. Trail Blazers: Lillard made a three-quarter court basket at the half just after the buzzer as the teams left the court. ... Meyers Leonard had a season-high 16 points off the bench. ... Portland has lost four straight to the Spurs. UNBOTHERED BY THE BOOS ""After last year it kind of got to me, but this year I kind of embraced it and kind of had fun with it,"" Aldridge said, adding that the boos get him going. And it doesn't taint his love for Portland. ""I feel like this is always going to be a special place for me,"" he said. UP  NEXT Spurs: The Spurs host the Chicago Bulls on Christmas Day. Trail Blazers: The Blazers host the Toronto Raptors on Monday. Kenyon Martin Jr. rises up to block Boban Marjanovic's shot.

"LOS ANGELES --  It was a play the Dallas Mavericks had run countless times, although seemingly always for veteran Dirk Nowitzki. This time the call went to forward Harrison Barnes and the emerging star delivered, hitting a tough 10-foot floating jumper with 3.7 seconds left Friday night to give the Mavs a 90-88 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. ""(Nowitzki) reminds be frequently that he wrote the playbook,"" Barnes said. The jumper provided the last of Barnes' team-high 24 points. Nowitzki, returning to play in the first half after missing 14 consecutive games with a strained right Achilles' tendon, added 17 points and Wesley Matthews 16 for Dallas. The Clippers were playing without both their stars, Chris Paul (hamstring) and Blake Griffin (knee). Their bench stepped up for the second consecutive night, outscoring the Mavericks' reserves 54-21. They outscored the Spurs' bench Thursday 58-33. But the Clippers were done in by turnovers (20 to Dallas' 12), the Mavericks controlling the offensive boards (14 to six) and the inability of center DeAndre Jordan to convert from the free throw line. ""What killed us, honestly, wasn't (Barnes), it was the 20 turnovers and the offensive rebounds,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. ""We tried to do too much with the ball tonight."" With the score tied at 80 with 27.4 seconds left, Jordan missed a layup but was fouled. A 55 percent free-throw shooter on the season, he missed both opportunities to set up Barnes for his first game-winning shot as a Maverick. He spent his first four seasons with the Golden State Warriors. ""It felt good,"" Barnes said. ""It means a lot when the coaches and players trust you to take that shot."" The 6-foot-8 Barnes, 24, is averaging a career-high 20.4 points. Led by reserve Jamal Crawford's 26 points, the Clippers led for most of the night but could not come up with the big play at the end. ""We can't have 20 turnovers ever,"" Jordan said. ""We can't do that. It's just about getting back to our defense, limiting teams to one shot and not giving them 14 offensive rebounds."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said guard Jose Juan Barea had an MRI that confirmed a mild left leg strain and only expects him to miss a short period. ... Nowitzki has missed 22 games overall. Clippers: Raymond Felton started in place of Paul (left hamstring strain), who is hopeful he can return for their next game Sunday. ... Paul Pierce started his third consecutive game for Blake Griffin (knee surgery). FELTON PRAISED Guard Raymond Felton spent last season with the Mavericks, playing in 80 games with 31 starts, averaging 9.5 points. Said Carlisle: ""He's a winner, always ready and a great competitor. Really he was one of our X-factors for getting into the playoffs last year. That was a very underrated move when they signed him."" Felton, however, had a rough night. He hit just three of 11 field goals and had two assists. DOWN TWO Rivers simply shrugged off not having Paul and Griffin. ""Not having Blake, not having C.P., you have to find different ways to defend, different ways to score,"" Rivers said. ""We've got a lot of guys that can play. My saying is: We play them all. We don't just play one or two guys.""","400899897"
"On Dec. 25, 2011, Derrick Rose pulls up and hits a floater in the paint over Pau Gasol with 5 seconds left in the fourth quarter to win the Bulls' Christmas Day matchup against the Lakers. (0:27) NEW YORK --  When the Knicks tried to make a Christmas comeback, the Celtics' response was strong and Smart. Isaiah Thomas scored 27 points, Marcus Smart made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 47 seconds left after Boston blew a late lead, and the Celtics beat New York 119-114 on Sunday. The Knicks wiped out a late nine-point deficit with an out-of-nowhere 11-2 run in a little more than a minute, but Smart answered with his shot and Avery Bradley and Al Horford made big defensive plays afterward. ""We did a good job of just being calm and gutting out the win,"" Thomas said. Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk each had 16 points for the Celtics, who won for the fifth time in six games. Carmelo Anthony scored 29 points and Derrick Rose had 25 for the Knicks, who fell to 22-29 in their NBA-record 51 Christmas appearances. ""You don't want to lose at all but to lose today, it was a tough loss,"" Anthony said. Crowder made three straight 3-pointers in the second quarter as Boston took a 56-48 halftime advantage. The Celtics rarely built the lead much bigger in the second half, but also never let the Knicks make much of a dent in it, always coming up with some stops and points whenever it got within a couple of possessions. Suddenly Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis scored all the points in the run that tied it at 112 on Anthony's layup with 1:06 to play, but Boston wasn't rattled. ""They had the crowd behind them on a very special day and this team just did a really good job of making sure when they punched us we punched right back,"" said Smart, whose mouth was bloodied earlier when Rose crashed into him on a drive to the basket. The Celtics worked it around to Smart for his 3, and Bradley forced Anthony to turn it over on New York's next possession. Thomas hit a free throw to make it a four-point game and it stayed that way when Horford blocked Porzingis' shot. ""I thought our guys really battled and the response was great when they did tie it up,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. The Knicks have lost their last four Christmas games. Their last victory on the holiday was in 2011 over the Celtics in what was the NBA season opener following a lockout. ""We just couldn't finish it at the end, but that's not only the end part, it's throughout the whole game that we can be better,"" Porzingis said. TIP-INS Celtics: Boston beat New York for the fourth straight time. ... Horford and Smart each scored 15 points. Knicks: Anthony shot 9 for 24 and felt short of the 34.3 points he was averaging on Christmas, which was tops among active players. He did pass Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor to move into 28th place on the NBA career scoring list with 23,156 points. Baylor had 23,149. ... Porzingis finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds. CAR-MELO Anthony met with the family of Jarell Lara, a 17-year-old from New York who suffers from a rare form of cancer called Langerhan's Cell Histiocytosis. Anthony partnered with the Garden of Dreams on behalf of the Carmelo Anthony Foundation to present the family of four with a 2017 Kia Sorento, as the family shared one old car that frequently broke down and didn't have working back doors. ALL IN THE FAMILY There were kids everywhere running around in Celtics jerseys, as many family members made the trip since Boston hasn't been home much during a road-heavy month. ""We've only had, I think, two nights at home since Dec. 2. So it hasn't been an easy month on a lot of our players and coaches, so we wanted to bring as many as we possibly could with us,"" Stevens said, adding that there's always kids running around the team bus and plane.","400899898"
"CLEVELAND -- With another clutch shot, Kyrie Irving took the Warriors on a trip down memory lane. Irving dropped a short, turnaround jumper over Klay Thompson with 3.4 seconds left as the Cleveland Cavaliers rallied just the way they did in June's NBA Finals to defeat Golden State 109-108 on Sunday in a marquee Christmas matchup that more than lived up to the hype. Down by 14 early in the fourth quarter, the Cavs chipped away and then put the ball in the hands of Irving, whose step-back 3-pointer over Stephen Curry on June 19 helped seal Game 7 and gave Cleveland its first major pro sports championship since 1964. This time, Irving went deep in the lane before spinning and making his shot over Thompson, one of the league's best defenders. ""The kid is special,"" LeBron James said of his teammate. ""It was never in doubt."" Golden State had one last chance but Kevin Durant, who led all scorers with 36 points in his first game in the league's hottest rivalry, lost his balance coming off a screen and couldn't get off a shot as time expired. Durant felt he was fouled by Richard Jefferson. ""I was trying to make a move,"" he said. ""I didn't fall on my own."" James scored 31 points with a season-high 13 rebounds, Irving added 25 points and Kevin Love 20 for the Cavs, who were down 3-1 in the Finals before storming back to stun a Warriors team that won 73 games during the regular season, but came up one victory short of winning their second straight title. Thompson added 24, Draymond Green 16 and Curry 15 -- on 4 of 11 shooting -- for the Warriors, who had their winning streak stopped at seven and fell to 9-1 against Eastern Conference teams. The biggest present under the tree for basketball fans this holiday was filled with drama, intensity and more than a few moments that sparked reminders of last season's brilliant Finals. ""It lived up to what everyone wanted it to,"" James said. Irving drained a 3 from the wing that looked a lot like the one he made on June 19, but his bucket over Thompson had a higher degree of difficulty. ""That's a really hard shot,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""I thought Klay played tremendous defense. You don't do anything different."" The Warriors set up a game-winning chance for Durant, but he stumbled with pressure applied by Jefferson and fell to the floor and watched helplessly as Cleveland's fans roared and Cavs coach Tyronn Lue clapped and screamed. ""We all think we're fouled on every play in every single game,"" Jefferson said. ""That's why I say I know the referees have a very hard job. I switched to his body. He looked like he lost his balance. He was trying to regain his balance and as soon as I saw him start to stumble, I ran off."" The teams will meet again Jan. 16 and then not again unless they make it back to the Finals -- a ""three-quel"" that would be the first in league history. To remind their guests of what happened in June, the Cavs left a door propped open just down the hallway from Golden State's locker room where a large photo of James' game-changing, career-defining block of Andre Iguodala in Game 7 was on display. The picture had been doctored with a Cavs championship ring taped over James' left index finger. If there was any doubt that this game meant more than the other 81 to both squads and fan bases, Green took care of that in the opening minutes. After being called for his second personal foul, Green stormed off the floor, cursing with every step on his way to the bench. Green, whose suspension from Game 5 of the Finals helped swing the series to Cleveland, was slapped with a technical and several of his teammates came over to calm him down before things got worse. GRUMPY OLD MAN Jefferson still has some hops at 36. His dunk over Thompson in the fourth quarter sparked a 14-3 run by the Cavs. Following the play, Jefferson, who missed his first eight shots, was called for a technical for winking at Durant. ""I was a little bit surprised by it, but I think they were trying to rein it in,"" said Jefferson, who was ejected from a game earlier this week. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State fell to 11-15 on Christmas Day, 3-11 on the road. ... Curry's shooting a career-low 40 percent on 3-pointers, but Kerr is confident he'll find his touch. ""The great thing about Steph is he doesn't worry about it too much,"" Kerr said. ""He's got the confidence of M.J. (Michael Jordan). Very few players I've ever seen can miss 10 shots in a row and then make the next one like it's nothing. Steph's done it his whole career."" Cavaliers: James (301) became the third player to surpass 300 points on the holiday, joining Kobe Bryant (395) and Oscar Robertson (377). ... Cleveland has won 10 of 11. ... Irving added 10 assists. .... James brought the crowd to its feet by blazing across the lane to swat a layup by Zaza Pachulia in the first half.","400899899"
"LaMarcus Aldridge could not miss in the first quarter, shooting 9-for-9 from the quarter and scoring 20 points against the Bulls. (0:59) SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs demand selfless play from the entire roster -- except LaMarcus Aldridge. In fact, San Antonio likes it when the 6-foot-11 forward gets a little aggressive, and his performance Sunday showed why. Aldridge had a season-high 33 points and the Spurs held on to beat the Chicago Bulls 119-100 after nearly blowing a hot start. ""When a player goes off like LaMarcus did today, it opens things up,"" Spurs center Pau Gasol said. ""It definitely creates an impact right away on the game."" Chicago rallied from a 20-point deficit to lead by three points midway through the third quarter but could not sustain the push, taking its third straight loss. Aldridge had his second-highest scoring output since joining the Spurs prior to last season. He made his first nine attempts while scoring 20 points in the opening period, his most in any quarter with the Spurs. Aldridge has struggled at times to manage his aggression with coach Gregg Popovich's ""good-to-great"" shot philosophy, but he found a balance against the Bulls. ""Pop is very picky on what is a good shot at times,"" Aldridge said. ""Of course, I have a little leeway, but it's tough for me because I always feel like I'm open even when a guy's guarding me. I'm trying not to be myself as much to take those tough shots. Try to mix in some good-to-great shots. I'm getting better at it."" Aldridge's hot hand helped the Spurs shoot 82 percent in taking a 36-25 lead after the first quarter. San Antonio doubled its lackluster 17-point opening quarter in its first meeting with Chicago on Dec. 8. ""They hit their shots,"" Chicago guard Dwyane Wade said. ""We came out with a game plan. The same game plan we had the first time we played them in Chicago. They didn't make those shots, they made them tonight."" Aldridge made his first 11 attempts, finishing 15 for 20 from the field. ""He's aggressive every night,"" said Kawhi Leonard, who finished with 25 points, 10 rebounds and four assists. ""He's doing his job."" With Aldridge rolling, Leonard hit consecutive 3-pointers for a 14-3 lead. Aldridge and Leonard combined for 41 points in the opening period, but the Bulls kept pace with a balanced scoring effort fueled by their bench. Jimmy Butler's 3-pointer gave Chicago its first lead at 70-67 with 5 minutes remaining in the third. San Antonio regained its double-digit edge at 95-82 on consecutive 3-pointers by Danny Green with Wade shaking his head after running over late to defend. Wade led the Bulls with 24 points, including 10 in the final quarter. Butler added 19 points, and every Chicago starter but Rondo scored in double figures.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook often has taken over as a scorer in the second half when his team has needed scoring punch. This time, he pushed his Oklahoma City Thunder over the top as a facilitator. Westbrook still scored 31 points, but he had 10 of his 15 assists in the second half of a 112-100 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night. Steven Adams scored 22 points and Enes Kanter added 20 for the Thunder. Westbrook enjoyed helping them get baskets. ""I just go out and have fun,"" he said. ""I don't know if it's the most fun I've had, but it's definitely at the top because the group of guys we have -- everybody is so unselfish. Everybody is willing to do great things, and everybody wants to get better."" Westbrook fell short of becoming the first Thunder player to score at least 40 points in four straight games, but he still dominated. Adams, who scored 12 points in the third quarter, said Westbrook makes his job easy. ""It was cool,"" Adams said. ""It's cool just getting layups and stuff. It was all Russ. I just finished it off. Can't take credit for that one."" The Thunder shot 51.2 percent while winning their third straight. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 26 points and Andrew Wiggins had 23 points for the Timberwolves. Minnesota had won three of five, including wins at Chicago and Atlanta. Towns kept Minnesota ticking in the first half with 16 points on 6-for-10 shooting. Adams put up more resistance after the break, and Towns had 10 points on 4-for-10 shooting in the second half. ""With those players, you just have to make them take the shots that you want,"" Adams said. ""If he makes it, you've just got to live with it. He's pretty much got the whole repertoire -- drives, put it on the ground, 3s, whatever. So as long as you just try to keep him within a box, and that's the lowest percentage shot he can get, that's what you have to live with.""

"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers feel like they've spent at least a month short-handed due to injuries and weary from an extraordinarily grinding schedule. When they finally found an opponent with even more ailments and exhaustion, the Lakers didn't waste the opportunity to snap an embarrassing rivalry losing streak. Nick Young and Timofey Mozgov scored 19 points apiece and the Lakers ended their 11-game skid against the Los Angeles Clippers with a 111-102 victory Sunday night. Lou Williams and D'Angelo Russell added 14 points each for the Lakers, who hadn't beaten their Staples Center co-tenants since opening night of the 2013-14 season. The streak was tied for the Lakers' longest against any team since moving to Los Angeles a half-century ago, and it was the Clippers' longest active winning streak against any opponent. With Clippers cornerstones Blake Griffin and Chris Paul sidelined by injuries, the Lakers won with a season-high seven scorers in double digits. ""It was needed, it was,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""It felt good to get this one back home. It's been a tough couple of weeks, and we had to come together to win that one."" The Lakers surged from a halftime deficit to an 18-point lead during a dynamite third quarter for their second win in 14 games. They also won on Christmas for the 22nd time, matching the Knicks' NBA record. ""A win is a win, and nobody makes excuses for us when we have guys down,"" Williams said. ""We got stops in the third quarter, and we were able to put a few (baskets) together. We were the most aggressive team coming out of the locker room."" J.J. Redick scored 22 points before sitting out the fourth quarter with a sore left hamstring for the Clippers, who couldn't overcome the absence of their two best players and top scorers in just their third loss in nine games. Griffin is out for at least a month after right knee surgery, while Paul was a late scratch for the second straight game with a left hamstring strain. Jamal Crawford also scored 22 points, and DeAndre Jordan had seven points, 10 rebounds and a career-high six assists as the Clippers played the fourth of eight games in a 12-day stretch. ""We understand there's going to be times like this, weeks like this,"" said Marreese Speights, who scored 15 points. ""We just have to fight through it and be a better team."" THIRD BASE The Clippers held an 11-point lead during the first half, but the Lakers scored the first 11 points out of halftime and eventually stretched their run to 28-12, taking a 15-point lead into the fourth. They outscored the Clips 34-16 in the third quarter. ""I thought we took our jobs very seriously in the third quarter,"" Walton said. RIVALRY RENEWED The Lakers returned from a discouraging 1-6 road trip to begin a five-game homestand with their first meeting of the season against the Clippers, who have supplanted their 16-time champion neighbors as the most competitive team in basketball-crazy Los Angeles.

INJURIES INCREASE Paul is likely to sit out again Monday against Denver before the star point guard tests his leg, coach Doc Rivers said.

""We all came out with a sense of urgency and got some big stops in a row,"" Wall said. They had a couple turnovers and took a couple bad shots. We found Brad and got him going, and Otto was very big for us."" Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 22 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for the Bucks, but only after he had a career-high 39 points against the Wizards Friday. Milwaukee's Tony Snell made a career-high six 3-pointers and set a season high with 20 points, but missed a baseline 3-point attempt late that could've tied it at 105-all. Snell and Antetokounmpo combined for just 11 points after halftime. ""They got a little physical with us,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""And our patience, being able (to deal with) screens, and set up guys -- we have to get better with that."" Beal and Porter began the decisive run with 3-pointers and Wall hit a runner before finding Morris for a baseline jumper that put Washington up 99-98 with 3:10 left.

He scored 16 of his points after halftime and reached his team-leading 18th double-double before the third quarter was over. CLOSE BUT NOT QUITE The Bucks are now 3-9 in games decided by seven points or fewer, something Parker said needs to change.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic have played without leading scorer Evan Fournier the last two games and cruised to double-digit victories both times. The Magic rolled past the Memphis Grizzlies 112-102 on Monday night with all five starters scoring in double figures, led by Aaron Gordon's 30 points that included 4-for-4 shooting from behind the 3-point line. ""The ball was moving, and my teammates did a great job of finding me,"" said Gordon, who hit 11 of 15 shots. ""They realized I had a hot hand and kept coming to me. I was just being present, just playing the game of basketball."" Serge Ibaka added 16 points and Bismack Biyombo had 10 points and 12 rebounds. Elfrid Payton contributed 16 points and seven assists off the bench. Backup center Nikola Vucevic had 13 points and nine rebounds for the Magic, who routed the Los Angeles Lakers 109-90 in their previous game. ""When a top guy goes down in the NBA, everyone else gets an opportunity,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""Other guys get a chance to show what they can do and rise up. It's not uncommon for that to happen, but I don't think that is something that is sustainable for us."" Nevertheless, the Magic had an easy night against a Memphis team that entered best in the NBA in field goal percentage defense (42.7 percent) and second-best in points allowed (97.3 per game). Orlando shot 50.8 percent from the field, including 13 of 26 from 3-point range. ""I thought we did move the ball well, but we made some guarded shots, too,"" Vogel said. ""Guys were stepping up and making plays."" Memphis got 17 points from Mike Conley. Troy Daniels had 16 and Zach Randolph 13, but the Grizzlies were down early and never recovered. Orlando built a 25-point halftime lead and traded baskets with Memphis most of the final 24 minutes. The Grizzlies got to 109-94 with 3:15 left before Gordon hit a deep 3-pointer. ""We were dead tonight for whatever reason,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""We had nothing in the tank. We haven't shown that we can put together a true, consistent effort with the guys that really are going to play minutes for us.""

"NEW YORK --  Randy Foye might not even have been in the game if not for Jeremy Lin's injury. The Brooklyn Nets were lucky he was. Foye made a 3-pointer to beat the buzzer and give the Nets a 120-118 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night. The Nets overcame the loss of Lin and a 14-point deficit in the third quarter to stop a five-game losing streak. Foye played a little with Lin in the first half, then was on the floor the entire fourth quarter after the point guard exited. ""We were already playing together in the second quarter, but when he went out, the next man had to step up,"" Foye said. Bojan Bogdanovic led Brooklyn with 26 points, Sean Kilpatrick had 23 and Brook Lopez scored 10 of his 21 in the fourth. Nicolas Batum had 24 points and Jeremy Lamb added 17 for Charlotte, but the Hornets had their three-game winning streak snapped. ""We kind of relaxed for a little while,"" center Cody Zeller said. ""We can't play in spurts like we did tonight, like we have early on in the season."" Lin strained his left hamstring in the third, the same injury that forced him to miss 17 games earlier this season. Lopez scored 10 straight Brooklyn points and then the Nets went outside, with Kilpatrick making a 3-pointer with 1:36 left and Bogdanovic adding another 30 seconds later to make it 117-113. But Batum nailed a 3, and after Bogdanovic missed, Kemba Walker drove to the basket. His shot was blocked, but Zeller followed it up to put Charlotte ahead 118-117. The Nets called timeout and inbounded from the sideline. Foye caught the pass on a play he said was supposed to be for Lopez -- and hit the second game-winner of his career. Lin landed awkwardly and limped to the line after he was fouled on a drive to the basket early in the third quarter. He made the free throws to start a 15-0 run that erased a 14-point deficit. But he didn't run back down court after missing a reverse layup with about eight minutes left in the period, instead walking toward the bench to say he needed to come out. Bogdanovic's three-point play on the Nets' next possession culminated the run and gave them a 69-68 lead, but Charlotte quickly went back ahead and stayed there until Lopez converted his second straight three-point play to tie it at 98 with 7:40 remaining. TIP-INS Hornets: Walker and Zeller each finished with 15 points. ... G Marco Belinelli missed his first game of the season after spraining his left ankle Friday in a victory over Chicago. Nets: F Joe Harris made his first start with the Nets and second of his career but didn't do much with his chance, going scoreless and taking just two shots in 12 minutes. ... Brooklyn ended an 11-game losing streak against Eastern Conference teams. WALKER'S WOES On the day the Hornets launched their push to get Walker to the All-Star Game at www.walkercharlotteranger.com, the point guard was scoreless in the fourth quarter and 1 for 8 in the second half. ""It happens. The ball just didn't drop,"" he said. ""I've got to be better for my team offensively because they depend on me for that, but unfortunately the ball just didn't drop."" HEALTHY, THEN HURT AGAIN The Nets had their full roster healthy and available for the first time all season before Lin's injury. ""With guys in and out, we've been trying to find the right lineups and right combinations, and you do need a certain -- statistically and from a coaching standpoint -- you need a certain sample size to see a group together to have more of an idea,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game. ""So we're still trying to grasp what our best lineups are and when to put in the best lineups, just trying to figure that whole puzzle out right now.""","400899905"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- LeBron James took the night off, and that was exactly the break the Detroit Pistons needed. Tobias Harris scored 21 points to help the Pistons snap a five-game losing streak by beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 106-90 on Monday night while James sat out resting. ""Any time you go through a stretch like that, you're just fighting for a win,"" Harris said. ""It could change a lot, so hopefully we take this one and move forward and continue to build some consistency."" James missed his third game of the season, and Cleveland has lost all three. The Cavaliers had their five-game winning streak snapped on a night they never led. Cleveland was playing its fifth game in seven days and coming off a thrilling win Sunday over Golden State. So James sat, and the Pistons took advantage. ""They haven't played since Friday and they've been sitting here waiting for us. Give them credit, because that's what they are supposed to do,"" Cleveland's Kyrie Irving said. ""They knew we were flying in here after the Golden State game, and they were resting up and waiting for us. They jumped on us early, but it might have been different if they were coming off a back-to-back and we had two days of rest."" The Cavs were also playing their fourth game without starting guard J.R. Smith, who is expected to miss three months because of a broken right thumb. Detroit scored the first eight points, led 50-44 at halftime and took control near the end of the third quarter. Harris and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made 3-pointers early in the fourth, and the Pistons led 82-65. Kevin Love had 17 points and 14 rebounds for Cleveland. There was some booing when James was announced as a scratch before the game. Although the crowd was certainly happy to see the Pistons play well, the atmosphere wasn't quite as raucous as it surely would have been had Detroit routed the Cavs with Cleveland's top player in the lineup. ""LeBron is obviously a great player who opens up the floor for his teammates, so other guys have to step up,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. ""I thought we tried to do that tonight, but it didn't happen."" The Pistons went 16 of 28 from 3-point range, and Andre Drummond had 11 points and 17 rebounds. NEW LOOK Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy changed his starting lineup Friday in an attempt to shake the Pistons out of their funk, starting Jon Leuer in place of Harris. Detroit played decently in that game but lost to Golden State before ending the skid Monday. ""It's two games,"" Van Gundy said. ""I'm not going to go crazy, like, deciding that that's the great move. We didn't win both games. We're 1-1. We'll see how it goes, but I've been happy with the two games."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Tristan Thompson became the first player in franchise history to play in 400 consecutive regular-season games. ... Irving had 18 points and eight assists. Pistons: Detroit fell one 3-pointer short of the franchise record of 17. ... The Pistons scored 29 points off 22 Cleveland turnovers. Detroit turned the ball over only 12 times. FAMILIAR FACE Cleveland G Kay Felder, a rookie who played collegiately just a few minutes away at Oakland University, scored 11 points in his return to Michigan. ""I thought we played hard. We just gave some young guys a chance to play and looked at a few different things,"" Lue said. ""The biggest factor in the game was them hitting 16 out of 28 3s. That's just great shooting.""","400899906"
"CHICAGO -- Less than two weeks after falling out of the rotation for a couple of games, Nikola Mirotic is playing again and proving his worth to the Chicago Bulls. Dwyane Wade scored 21 points, Mirotic added a season-high 20 -- including a key basket down the stretch -- and Chicago survived a poor shooting performance for a 90-85 victory over the Indiana Pacers Monday night to snap a three-game losing streak. ""We need him to win; it's as simple as that,"" Wade said of Mirotic. ""We need him to play big and he's knows that we believe and trust in him. ""Tonight he made big shots and obviously made the biggest one at the end."" Jimmy Butler had 16 points despite making only 3 of 12 field-goal attempts. Chicago, which had dropped nine of 12, was 32-for-83 (38.6 percent) from the field for the game. Aaron Brooks had a season-high 19 points to lead the Pacers, who have lost three straight. Indiana, which dropped to 4-12 on the road, has lost five straight and eight of nine at the United Center. ""Aaron did a good job out there,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Our second unit got us back in the game."" Mirotic pumped in 14 points in 12 first-half minutes to pace the Bulls to a 51-41 halftime lead. He made three 3-pointers to provide the kind of spark Chicago had been looking for from him on a consistent basis. However, the Bulls' offensive woes returned at the start of the second half. They managed just 12 points in the third quarter as Indiana closed within 63-61 heading into the fourth. Just 30 seconds into the final quarter the Pacers pulled even at 64 on a 3-pointer by Brooks. The Bulls, though, answered with 10 straight points for a 74-64 edge. Midway through the quarter Indiana ran off eight straight points to trim the deficit to 76-74 and pulled within 86-85 in the final minute on a 3-pointer by Paul George. But Mirotic hit a long, contested two-pointer with 21.2 seconds left -- and the shot clock running out -- for an 88-85 lead. ""I tried to go to the basket with my left hand, but he played great defense -- Thaddeus Young -- and I had to step back,"" Mirotic said. ""I feel comfortable with that shot, but maybe it's not the best shot."" Wade then followed with a steal and basket to wrap it up. ""I kind of played free safety on that and baited them to throw it a little bit,"" he said. TIP-INS: Pacers: G Rodney Stuckey (left hamstring) returned after missing two games but lasted only six minutes before reinjuring it. ... G Monta Ellis (strained right groin) missed his fifth straight game and there is no timetable for his return. ""He is getting better, but he hasn't done anything (in practice) with the team,"" McMillan said. Bulls: F Doug McDermott didn't play because of a left shin injury suffered Sunday at San Antonio. The third-year forward missed 10 games earlier in the season because of two concussions. ""It's unfortunate,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""You could tell Doug's been getting more comfortable as we've been going on and he's been shooting the ball with more confident."" RONDO SITS Rajon Rondo didn't play in the fourth quarter after playing 24 minutes in the first three. ""It's just the way the game was going,"" Hoiberg said. MCW RETURNS Michael Carter-Williams returned to the Bulls lineup after missing nearly two months with left knee and left wrist injuries. He finished with one point (0-for-5 from the field) in 19 minutes. FREE-THROW WOES Chicago had a 28-10 edge in free-throw attempts, which left Indiana complaining about the officiating. ""(The referees) have got to give us more respect,"" McMillan said. ""We shot only 10 free throws. Paul shot only one free throw the entire game, played 39 minutes. Butler shoots 12 free throws tonight. I mean, they've got to call the game both ways.""","400899907"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans are giving themselves hope of becoming relevant in the Western Conference playoff picture by doing something they couldn't in numerous narrow losses early this season -- close out games. Davis scored 28 points -- including six in the final 2:12 -- and grabbed 16 rebounds, and New Orleans beat the Dallas Mavericks 111-104 on Monday night for the Pelicans' third victory in four games. ""Our season's on the line,"" said Davis, whose team has won just 12 of its first 33 games but sits three games behind Sacramento for the last playoff spot in the West. ""We've got a lot of games coming up, but we've got to win them at home."" Pelicans reserve guard Langston Galloway made all five of his 3-point shots, hitting a couple with quick, decisive releases from 26 feet, and finished with 17 points. ""As soon as I cross past half court, I feel like that's my range and I'm shooting from wherever,"" Galloway said, grinning but perhaps only partly joking as teammate Solomon Hill mocked him playfully from a neighboring locker. Davis finished his scoring with four important free throws and a 19-foot jumper. He also got one of his two blocks when Harrison Barnes attempted a layup with 22 seconds left. ""Davis is going to get his 28 points. ... We did a decent job on him,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""The guy that beat us tonight is Galloway. He made five 3s and we never got close enough to him to even contest them."" Deron Williams scored 24 points for Dallas, while Wesley Matthews scored 17 and Seth Curry 16. NOWITZKI'S NIGHT Dirk Nowitzki, who's been nursing a sore right Achilles tendon, scored 10 points in 17 minutes. As the Mavs have done lately, they gave Nowitzki all of his playing time in the first half. Nowitzki is optimistic the Mavs can start winning more during a January schedule that should give the club more rest. ""We'll fight through it and somehow find a way to win some and get healthier and get going,"" Nowitzki said. Carlisle said he wasn't sure whether Nowitzki would play Tuesday night. CRUNCH TIME The Pelicans appeared primed to pull away when Galloway's fourth 3 gave New Orleans an 88-77 lead early in the fourth, but Dallas responded with an 11-2 run that included 3s by Curry and Justin Anderson. Galloway's fifth 3 briefly gave New Orleans some breathing room, but Williams responded with a pair of 3s to make it 95-94 with 4:35 to go. ""We had a lot of miscommunication on two Deron Williams 3s, but coach called time out, we figured it out, we were able to make them take tough shots at the end,"" Davis said. ""We did a good job of closing this one out."" Dallas didn't hit another field goal until Williams' layup with 47 seconds left. TIP-INS Mavericks: Barnes finished with 15 points for Dallas, which shot 49.3 percent (37 of 75) and combined for 13 3s. ... While center Andrew Bogut missed his 11th straight game with a right knee injury, Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said Bogut is ""close"" to returning and could play sometime this week.

"HOUSTON --  Ask most anyone associated with the Rockets about Montrezl Harrell, and inevitably, they'll talk about his energy. Now that Harrell is starting, Houston is starting to see more of how that vigor can help the team. James Harden had 32 points and 12 assists in three quarters, Harrell added 14 points and the Rockets never trailed in a 131-115 win over the Phoenix Suns on Monday night. It was the third double-digit scoring game in a row for Harrell while filling in at center for Clint Capela, who is out for at least a month with a small fracture on his left fibula. Nene started the first game after Capela was injured before coach Mike D'Antoni decided to go with Harrell, a second-year player out of Louisville. ""He's playing great -- just his energy,"" D'Antoni said. ""His defense is really good, we can switch a lot and we can do different things. He covers up for a lot of people, he takes charges. I think he's been playing terrific."" Harrell said his mindset didn't change when he was moved into the starting lineup. ""Just playing the game, that's all I got to do,"" he said. ""Come in with a lot of energy and try to bring that spark to my team every night. My team feeds off it great and I just try to keep it going. I'm not doing nothing special."" It was the 12th 30-point game this season for Harden, who made 12 of 15 free throws, and he had at least 30 points and 10 assists for the ninth time this season. ""They are a great all-around offensive team,"" Phoenix's Eric Bledsoe said. ""James pretty much controls everything out there. There's really nothing we can do about it now."" Houston led by at least 20 points for most of the night and was up by 27 entering the fourth quarter. Harden didn't play after that, and D'Antoni had the rest of his starters on the bench by the middle of the fourth quarter. Bledsoe led the Suns with 24 points, and Brandon Knight added 21 off the bench. The Rockets led by 26 at halftime and opened the third quarter with a 12-4 spurt to extend their advantage to 81-47. Patrick Beverley got things going with a 3-pointer, and Harden added a 3. ""GRANNY"" STYLE HITS THE NBA Rockets rookie Chinanu Onuaku made his NBA debut in the fourth quarter and hit a pair of free throws underhanded late. Onuaku has been using the ""Granny"" style at the free-throw line at least since he was in college at Louisville. He finished with six points and three rebounds. TIP-INS Suns: Bledsoe received a technical foul in the third quarter. ... Devin Booker fouled out with 7.9 seconds left in the third quarter. He finished with 16 points. ...

The Rockets had 69 points in the first half to give them at least 60 points before halftime for the 17th time this season. ... Trevor Ariza tied a season high with 10 rebounds. ... Beverley left the game in the fourth quarter with a bruised left thigh, and D'Antoni said he might have to sit out Tuesday. GETTING A BREAK Harden hasn't missed a game since the 2014-15 season when he had to sit one out because of a suspension. For a player who logs so many minutes, a game like this one where he could take the fourth quarter off was a nice break on the front end of a back-to-back. ""It's good,"" he said. ""I've had several of those this season and I don't remember the last time I had (so many). So it feels good, guys are playing well. We're confident in each other and another test for us tomorrow.""","400899909"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  With so much young talent, the future is bright for the Minnesota Timberwolves. The present has been painful while the pups go through their growing pains, but then there are nights like Monday when everything just clicks. Karl-Anthony Towns had 22 points and 11 rebounds, and Zach LaVine hit six 3-pointers to lead the Timberwolves to a 104-90 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. LaVine scored 21 points, Andrew Wiggins had 21 and was 4 for 6 on 3-pointers, and Towns was 8 for 8 from the field, including 3 for 3 from 3-point range. Minnesota hit a season-high 15 3s and led by as many as 29. ""We can all go out there and have the kind of nights where we light up the NBA,"" Towns said. Dwight Howard had 20 points on 9-for-9 shooting and 12 rebounds for the Hawks in his return from a back injury. But Paul Millsap was just 2 for 13 from the field, and Atlanta's 19 turnovers led to 22 points by the Timberwolves. After hanging on to beat a Hawks team minus Howard in Atlanta last week, there was no such suspense for the Wolves this time around. A 14-0 run in the third quarter included 3s by Wiggins, LaVine and Shabazz Muhammad for an 86-58 lead, and Minnesota never looked back. The Timberwolves' overused starters got a much-needed light night on the second night of a back-to-back. Gorgui Dieng added 14 points and seven rebounds and was the only Minnesota starter to play more than 30 minutes. Millsap missed 12 of his first 13 shots and also left the game briefly after being poked in the eye. He scored seven points. The Hawks have wins over Houston, Cleveland, Toronto and Milwaukee (twice), but have lost to the Wolves and Lakers twice and the Suns and Magic as well. ""It's for sure frustrating, but we've got to find a way,"" Hawks point guard Dennis Schroder said. ""It's still early, but we need to figure it out now. We can't keep talking about it. We've got to change something and we don't. So, we've got to be on the same page and try to get more wins."" TIP-INS Hawks: Tim Hardaway Jr. was a late scratch because of a groin injury after being listed as probable for the game. Hardaway warmed up before the game and felt it tighten up, so the Hawks played it safe. ... Kyle Korver returned after missing the previous game with an illness. He scored six points on 2-for-7 shooting. Timberwolves: LaVine had his 12th career game with at least five 3s, second only to Kevin Love's 16 in franchise history. ... Cole Aldrich did not play for the second straight game. RUBIO'S RUNS Ricky Rubio had 10 assists and zero turnovers for Minnesota and has played 67 minutes, 40 seconds since he last had a turnover. He has 22 assists in that span. ""I'm controlling the tempo of the game and I'm not making mistakes on offense,"" Rubio said. ""I'm feeling good."" HOWARD RETURNS The Hawks' big man missed the previous three games with tightness in his back, but made his presence felt early and often. He was so effective in the first quarter that coach Mike Budenholzer left him in the game even after picking up two quick fouls. Howard threw down a dunk off the glass on a pass from Schroder and scored the Hawks' first six points of the third, all on putbacks off the offensive glass. It was his 19th double-double of the season. ""Some positives, him on the offensive boards, him finishing around the basket,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think there are some positives. I think his activity and reactions, some other situations, just like all the rest of us, need to be better.""","400899910"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  No matter what city they visit lately, the Toronto Raptors feel right at home. Kyle Lowry scored 27 points and the Raptors won their franchise-best seventh consecutive road game Monday night with a 95-91 victory over the skidding Portland Trail Blazers. It was the second stop on Toronto's six-game swing out West, which will take the Raptors (22-8) to tough places such as Golden State and San Antonio. But home or road these days, Toronto is proving to be a very difficult opponent. Though the Raptors' usually prolific offense was slowed by Portland's trapping defense, they found a way to pull out a highly competitive game in which neither team led by more than six points. Toronto, which had reached 100 points in 16 straight games, used its defense and gritty play during the final five minutes to win its fourth in a row. ""A few years ago our guys would have kicked that one away by 15 or 20 points,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. Toronto ran into a short-handed but extremely motivated Portland team that ultimately lost its sixth straight. The Blazers (13-20) were without star guard Damian Lillard, who sat out with a sprained ankle. Lillard, averaging 27 points per game, was injured last Friday against San Antonio. ""Dame not playing, that's a big chunk of potential 30-, 40-point game, but they're still a very talented team. It was a tough task for us either way,"" said Toronto guard DeMar DeRozan, who nearly had his first triple-double of the season with 20 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. C.J. McCollum scored 27 points to lead the Blazers, who have lost 10 of 11. Toronto kept Portland's runs to a minimum. The Raptors were particularly effective down the stretch, when they took the lead for good at 82-81 with 5:50 remaining on two free throws by Jonas Valanciunas. ""We got every rebound that came off a long shot, and that gave us an opportunity to keep the game in our favor,"" DeRozan said. ""We knew early on we were missing a lot of easy shots, and that we'd have to rely on our defense. That's what we did."" Toronto, averaging 112 points per game this season, scored only 43 during the first half and had just 22 in the fourth quarter. Portland's blitzing, trapping defense made life difficult for the Raptors. Lowry and DeRozan combined to make 16 of 40 shots. ""Their defensive scheme was unbelievable tonight. Their bigs moved their feet well and I had a couple of turnovers trying to get around them,"" Lowry said. Portland coach Terry Stotts said ""it might have been our best defensive game of the season. We played with a lot of energy."" Patrick Patterson scored 15 points for Toronto, while Valanciunas had 12 points and 12 rebounds. Mason Plumlee had his fifth double-double of the season with 13 points and 15 rebounds for Portland. Neither team could find an offensive rhythm in the first half. Toronto grabbed a 43-42 halftime lead on a free throw by DeRozan with two seconds left in the second quarter. The 43 first-half points given up by Portland tied a season low. Toronto got it going in the third quarter, hitting seven 3-pointers, but Portland nearly matched the Raptors point for point and trailed 73-68 heading into the fourth. Toronto finally put the game away at the free throw line, where Cory Joseph and DeRozan made four foul shots in the final 16 seconds. TIP-INS Raptors: DeRozan moved within 14 points of tying the franchise record. Chris Bosh holds the mark with 10,275 points. ... Patterson hit a season-high five 3-pointers, three in the third quarter. ... Toronto has won three consecutive games against Portland. Before that, the Raptors were 1-12 against the Blazers. Trail Blazers: Lillard missed his first game since Jan. 3 last season, when he was out for two weeks with a foot injury. During that stretch, the Blazers went 4-3, including a 105-76 win over eventual NBA champion Cleveland. ... Former Blazers star Brandon Roy, the sixth pick of the 2006 NBA draft and a three-time All-Star, returns to Portland this week as a first-year high school coach. Roy's team, Nathan Hale of Seattle, plays in the Les Schwab Invitational, one of the country's top holiday high school basketball tournaments. STATUS UNKNOWN Stotts wouldn't speculate about whether Lillard might play in Portland's next game, Wednesday against Sacramento. Even though his team was missing its All-Star guard, Stotts wasn't discouraged by the offensive performance. ""The offense was OK. I don't know what we were really expecting, but I thought we moved the ball well. We didn't finish in the fourth quarter, but in the fourth quarter sometimes it's hard to score,"" Stotts said.","400899911"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Denver Nuggets have known their share of injuries, so they weren't feeling much sympathy for the short-handed Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night. The Clippers were without their three leading scorers: Blake Griffin (knee surgery), Chris Paul (hamstring) and J.J. Redick (hamstring). But they were able to fight back from a 17-point deficit to start the second half and take a seven-point lead in the fourth quarter. In the end, though, the Nuggets had Nikola Jokic and too much depth as they held off the Clippers for a 106-102 victory. ""Even though they are undermanned, we don't care about that,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""Pressure on the road and they have all the momentum, we stepped up and made enough plays down the stretch."" Jokic had 24 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and three steals. Danilo Gallinari and Will Barton each scored 23, and the Nuggets outrebounded the Clippers 51-38. Jokic scored 10 points in the fourth quarter, including a key 3-pointer that broke a 95-all tie and gave the Nuggets the lead for good. ""He was good tonight,"" Los Angeles guard Austin Rivers said. ""He is a really good player."" The Clippers were led by Jamal Crawford's 24 points and six assists. Rivers had 19 points and five assists. Those two started in place of Paul and Redick, which left little on the bench for Los Angeles. ""I thought we lost our energy,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""I did see fatigue down the stretch."" The Nuggets held the Clippers at the 95-point mark for 5 minutes. Crawford missed three shots in that stretch, Austin Rivers turned the ball over twice and missed a shot, and Raymond Felton also missed a shot. Los Angeles did not score again until Crawford hit a layup with 1:14 left. ""Story of the game is fourth quarter, only one turnover and we held them to 43 percent (shooting),"" Malone said. It was the third consecutive loss for the Clippers, all without Paul. Meanwhile, the Nuggets avenged a 17-point defeat in Los Angeles last week. In that game, the Clippers had more firepower available. ""They wouldn't have cared if we were short-handed,"" Barton said. ""This is the NBA and they still have good players out there. No one wants to hear it. You either win or lose in this league."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Wilson Chandler, who missed last season following hip surgery, started his sixth consecutive game. In his previous seven starts, he was averaging slightly more points (19.3 to 16.1) than as a reserve this season. He scored two points Monday. Clippers: Los Angeles has played four games in five days. ""Almost as bad as the injuries,"" Doc Rivers said. ... For the first time in the five games Griffin (knee surgery) has been out, Paul Pierce did not start. He was averaging only 13 minutes per start. ... C Diamond Stone, 19, was sent down to the Salt Lake City Stars of the NBA Development League. DOWN ANOTHER STARTER The Clippers were already playing without their two biggest stars -- Paul and Griffin -- when they had to go without Redick on Monday. The team's starting shooting guard injured his hamstring Sunday against the Lakers. Doc Rivers is uncertain when Paul or Redick will return. ""You just don't know with hamstrings. The one thing you do know that I think we've learned over the years is that you have to be more cautious than if it was a sprained ankle,"" the coach said. BARTON'S IMPACT In addition to his 23 points, Barton had eight rebounds and six assists off the bench. ""I take a lot of pride in closing games out. I want to be our closer, fourth quarter when the game's on the line. I will do anything it takes to get a win,"" he said.","400899912"
"DeMarcus Cousins has high praise for 76ers forward Joel Embiid but has even higher praise for himself. (0:21) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- DeMarcus Cousins and the Sacramento Kings have put together an impressive four-game winning streak by doing the little things needed to pull out victories. Faster starts, an uptick in fourth-quarter defense and a few key shots on the offensive end. Small steps for a team that's struggled most of the season, for sure, but a definite move in the right direction as far as Sacramento's big man is concerned. Cousins made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 20.9 seconds remaining and added a clutch free throw moments later, lifting the Kings to a 102-100 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night. ""Guys are really starting to buy in,"" Cousins said. ""We're starting to realize what's going to win games for us and it's not who can score the most points. It's us playing defense, us getting stops in a row. Guys are starting to buy in and we're on the right path."" After Ersan Ilyasova drove around Rudy Gay for a layup that put the 76ers ahead 97-96, Cousins made his second 3 of the game to put Sacramento ahead. Garrett Temple, who had put the Kings up 96-94 with his own key 3-pointer with 58.7 seconds left, followed with two free throws. Sergio Rodriguez's 3-pointer pulled Philadelphia within 101-100 before Cousins made the second of two free throws. Sacramento's 6-foot-11 center then sealed the win by blocking Joel Embiid's 3-pointer. Embiid got the ball back but shot an airball at the buzzer. ""He's blocking shots and taking charges,"" Cousins' teammate Ty Lawson said. ""He's the leader of this team and those are the things you have to do, especially when you're trying to get to the playoffs."" Cousins finished with 30 points, seven rebounds and five assists while helping the Kings extend their winning streak to a season-high four games. Rudy Gay added 17 points and nine rebounds in his return to Sacramento's lineup following a two-week absence. Embiid had 25 points and eight rebounds while Rodriguez scored 18 for the 76ers. ""I thought I did a pretty good job on (Cousins) but he scored when it mattered,"" Embiid said. This was the first game between the two teams after their Nov. 30 game was postponed due to unsafe conditions on the court at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. Dario Saric scored 12 of the final 14 points for the 76ers in the third quarter, including a pair of 3s, to help Philadelphia go up 77-70. Sacramento answered with a 13-0 run early in the fourth quarter but had trouble shaking the 76ers in a game matching two struggling teams. HENDERSON'S HIP ISSUE 76ers starter Gerald Henderson did not play over the final 8 1/2 minutes left because of an ongoing hip issue. Henderson was slow getting down the court when Philadelphia coach Brett Brown noticed and ran nearly to midcourt to call a timeout. ""He pulled himself out,"" Brown said. ""He couldn't go in. He has a problem that we will deal with, his hip, but he's been gutsing through a lot."" COUSINS LIKES EMBIID'S GAME Even though Embiid's playing time continues to be limited as he works his way back into shape after missing two seasons with foot injuries, Cousins came away impressed with what he saw from the 76ers rookie after the two spent most of the night defending each other. ""That kid is special, man,"" Cousins said. ""All jokes aside, I really think he's a good player. This is my first time ever interacting with Embiid and also feeling how physical he is as well. His talent is through the roof. Once he gets a better understanding of the game, it's going to be scary."" TIP-INS 76ers: Philadelphia trailed the entire first half and didn't take its first lead until Gerald Henderson's jumper midway through the third quarter. .. Embiid, Saric and Ilyasova combined for 22 of Philadelphia's 30 points in the third quarter. ... Ilyasova has scored in double figures in all but four games since being acquired in a trade from Oklahoma City in early November. Kings: With Gay back in the lineup after sitting out two weeks with a hip injury, Aaron Afflalo was a healthy scratch before the game. . Willie Cauley-Stein started the second half in place of Kostos Koufos when coach Dave Joerger went with a more athletic lineup.","400899913"
"BOSTON --  Boston didn't need overtime to beat Memphis for the second time in a week, although the Celtics may have felt like they went an extra round before finally putting away the Grizzlies. Avery Bradley scored 23 points and Isaiah Thomas had 21 points and seven assists in the Celtics' 113-103 victory on Tuesday night. Boston led by just four points with 1:29 remaining, but clinched it with six straight free throws in the final minute. ""They made plays. We stood our ground and stuck out a win,"" said Thomas, who made all eight of his attempts from the foul line. Boston made 19 of 21 free throws and outrebounded Memphis 47-37. The Celtics won for the sixth time in seven games and beat the Grizzlies for the second time in a week. The Celtics needed overtime and a career-high 44 points from Thomas for a 112-109 win in Memphis on Dec. 20 and the rematch was almost as close. Marc Gasol had 26 points and nine assists for Memphis. Zach Randolph scored 10 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter to help keep the Grizzlies close and pulled down 10 rebounds. Tony Allen had 17 points and eight rebounds for Memphis, which was coming off a 112-102 loss in Orlando the night before but hung with Boston until the final minute. ""They still scored way too many points to my liking, but I liked the fact that we came back and competed,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""We didn't get the stops necessary like we usually do. But we gave ourselves a chance to win on the road and that's all you can ask for."" The Grizzlies have lost five of seven. Gerald Green added a season-high 19 points for Boston, including nine in the fourth quarter. ""He just brought more intensity,"" said Marcus Smart, who scored 13 for Boston. ""You could definitely tell that the intensity changed when he stepped on the floor."" After falling behind by 13 in the second quarter, Memphis pulled within 56-48 at halftime and cut the margin to 69-67 on Allen's layup with 5:16 left in the third. Boston led 84-77 after three, but Randolph scored Memphis' first six points of the fourth and Gasol pounded the Celtics inside and out, converting a three-point play early and adding a 3-pointer with 5 minutes remaining to cut Boston's lead to 100-97. The Celtics didn't falter, getting a pair of free throws from Green and a three-point play by Thomas to make it 105-97 with 3:06 left. They put away Memphis down the stretch after the Grizzlies pulled within 105-101 on a 3-pointer by James Ennis III. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Fell to 9-5 in December, remaining tied for the franchise record for most wins in the month. ... Mike Conley (left big toe), Chandler Parsons (rest) and Brandan Wright (left foot) did not dress. ... The Grizzlies, ranked second in the NBA in points allowed (97.7 per game), have given up more than 100 points in three straight and four of five. Celtics: Kelly Olynyk picked up his fourth foul with 5:15 left in the second quarter. ... Green's previous high for the season was nine points. He scored 10 in the second quarter alone Tuesday and Amir Johnson, the only Boston starter not to score in double figures, pulled down 10 rebounds to go with his four points. TOUGH D Boston won despite committing 18 turnovers, including seven in the fourth quarter. ""We need to be stronger with the ball, including myself,"" Thomas said. ""They're one of the top defensive teams in the NBA."" BACK-TO-BACK The Grizzlies fell to 8-1 in the second of back-to-back games this season, although fatigue did not appear to be a factor. The Grizzlies answered each time the Celtics started pulling away right up until the final minute.","400899914"
"MIAMI -- Russell Westbrook took a charge in the final minutes with the outcome already decided, was diving for loose balls and grabbed more defensive rebounds than any four Miami Heat players did combined. Forget the triple-double. It was everything else that had Heat coach Erik Spoelstra marveling. Westbrook scored 29 points, grabbed 17 rebounds -- all defensive -- and added 11 assists for his 15th triple-double of the season, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Heat 106-94 on Tuesday night for their fourth straight win. ""He's competing until the very end,"" Spoelstra said. ""Every single possession is the most important possession to him. Great, great lesson ... from somebody's that is really imposing a competitive will on every contest. He did what he does. What defines greatness is consistency, and that's what you can book pretty much every night."" Westbrook nearly had the triple-double by halftime, falling two rebounds shy. He got those in the first 5:21 of the third quarter. ""I thought our team did a great job of focusing in on what we do as a team and came out and put our foot down early,"" Westbrook said. Enes Kanter scored 19 and Steven Adams added 15 -- including a highlight-reel dunk in the first half -- for the Thunder. Josh Richardson tied a career high with 22 points for the Heat. James Johnson scored 16 and Tyler Johnson added 15, both off the bench, for Miami. Oklahoma City's frontcourt limited Miami center Hassan Whiteside to 12 points and eight rebounds, most of that coming in the fourth quarter. ""They just used their strength,"" Westbrook said. ""Steven does an amazing job and Enes ... those guys do an amazing job."" The Heat were without point guard Goran Dragic, sidelined by back spasms. Oklahoma City dominated in the paint, outscoring Miami 58-32. And Westbrook scored 11 points in the fourth to help the Thunder close out the win. ""He's like an idol,"" said Oklahoma City's Alex Abrines, who scored 14 off the bench. ""He goes 100 percent every play."" Westbrook grabbed the game's final rebound, dribbled out the clock and then slapped high-fives with fans who waited until the end just to see him depart. ""They see the numbers and what he does in games. They don't get a chance to see behind the scenes,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""The one thing I admire about him is he practices every single day. He has great energy every single day. He comes to every shootaround and he practices. He puts the time in and that's the reason why he's as successful as he is."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City improved to 12-3 this season and 45-7 all-time when Westbrook has a triple-double. ... Westbrook had four assists and three rebounds in the first 11:59 -- matching the Heat totals in that span. ... Victor Oladipo missed his eighth game with a right wrist sprain. ... Donovan got big hugs both pregame and postgame from Heat forward Udonis Haslem, who played for him at Florida. Heat: Josh McRoberts (stress fracture in left foot) is out indefinitely, the team announced Tuesday. McRoberts said he will be back this season. ... In tribute to the late George Michael, the Heat played a number of his hits during stoppages in play. ... Actor and comedian Chris Rock sat courtside, as did Miami Dolphins running back Jay Ajayi. AGAINST MIAMI Westbrook is the sixth opposing player to visit Miami and post a triple-double, joining Clyde Drexler, Scottie Pippen, Magic Johnson, Andre Miller and Rajon Rondo. (Pippen and Rondo did it in playoff games.) He also became the third player to record multiple triple-doubles against Miami. Jason Kidd and Rondo are the others, both with three. Westbrook's other one against Miami was Jan. 17.","400899915"
"DALLAS --  James Harden was called for one of the eight technicals in a game that turned tense when Dallas center Andrew Bogut received a flagrant foul on a hard screen that staggered Houston's star guard. Despite 34 points and an easy 123-107 victory that completed a four-game season sweep of the last-place Mavericks on Tuesday night, Harden wasn't happy. ""That other team was trippin' tonight, just disrespectful, unprofessional, players and coaches,"" Harden said. ""I don't know what was their problem, but I think that got us going. They wanted to throw a little cheap shot and just woke us up a little bit and it was over from there."" Bogut was equally frustrated in his return after missing 11 games with a right knee injury. The call came in the second quarter, near the end of a 16-0 Houston run that broke a 37-all tie. Harden doubled over after running head-first into the 7-foot, 260-pound Bogut's shoulder. ""If you watch the replay, yeah, he made no effort to run around my screen,"" said Bogut, who had a couple of sharp verbal exchanges with Harden. ""Yeah, it was a hard screen and I set hard screens. But to get a flagrant for it is kind of head-scratching. ""You admire the effort the league's putting in in Secaucus (New Jersey) with that beautiful facility where they watch replays and watch TV and have leather chairs and all that kind of stuff. But you scratch your head at a lot of these things and it becomes very, very frustrating."" Trevor Ariza was ejected after his second technical during the break after the third quarter, when five technicals were called. After the game, he was waiting outside the Dallas locker room for Mavericks center Salah Mejri. Security had to make sure the pair didn't interact after an exchange during the game that led to Ariza's first technical. Houston was called for five and Dallas three. ""It wasn't even basketball,"" Dallas guard Wesley Matthews said. ""Tempers, two in-state teams, we play each other four times, we've had battles in the past, so it is what it is. But we've got to be better than that. That was an opportunity for us to channel it into basketball and we didn't do that."" Harden had 24 points at halftime and finished with 11 assists without playing in the fourth quarter. The Rockets improved to 13-2 in December. With two games left in the month, Houston can tie the franchise record of 15 wins from November 1996. Harrison Barnes scored 21 for the last-place Mavericks, who lost their second straight following their first two-game winning streak of the season. There were also two flagrant fouls, both against Dallas. Most of the technicals came during dead-ball situations, with players and Dallas coach Rick Carlisle complaining to officials. Carlisle mockingly clapped at the refs, saying ""good call,"" after he was whistled for one. ""They tried to defend by being real physical and thinking that's the way to do it,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""I don't really want to get into it just because it doesn't serve any purpose. We needed the win. We came out and we took care of business."" TIP-INS Rockets: G Patrick Beverley sat out with a left quadriceps contusion. It's not expected to be a long-term injury. ... Sam Dekker had a game-high 11 rebounds. ... The Rockets are 7-0 on the second night of back-to-backs this season. Mavericks: G Pierre Jackson was signed off the Mavericks' NBA Development League team, and G Jonathan Gibson was waived. Jackson, a former Baylor guard who was drafted in 2013, made his NBA debut in the fourth quarter and scored seven points. ... Matthews had 19 points. BESIDES THE TECHS There were a couple of face-to-face confrontations, the first ending in double technicals in the second quarter for Dallas' Justin Anderson and Nene. Later in the quarter, Houston's Ryan Anderson went nose-to-nose with Dallas star Dirk Nowitzki without a technical being called. RARE GATHERING The Mavericks had their projected starting five for just the fourth time, and first since a 128-90 loss at Cleveland on Nov. 25. The lineup is winless. Bogut and Nowitzki, in his third game back from his latest absence for a sore right Achilles tendon, stayed in the locker room at halftime. Bogut went scoreless with six rebounds in 10 minutes, and Nowitzki scored seven points.","400899916"
"LOS ANGELES --  Joe Ingles probably wasn't the guy the Los Angeles Lakers figured would take the shot in the closing seconds to beat them. The 29-year-old forward is the definition of journeyman, playing in three different countries -- Australia, Spain and Israel -- before coming to the United States. But the ball found its way to Ingles all alone beyond the 3-point line with 21.6 seconds left Tuesday and he calmly swished the shot to lead the Utah Jazz to a 102-100 victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. ""Joe (Johnson) set a great screen,"" Ingles said. ""Obviously the play wasn't set up for me. I was wide open and got a good look."" Ingles is only Utah's ninth-leading scorer (6.5 points per game), but he leads the NBA in 3-point field-goal percentage (.477). Gordon Hayward led the Jazz with 31 points and nine rebounds. Ingles finished with 13 points and Rudy Gobert had 12 points and 11 rebounds. The Lakers had a last chance to win the game in the final seconds. Coach Luke Walton called a play for D'Angelo Russell to hit Lou Williams off a screen, but Utah coach Quin Snyder surprised the Lakers by putting the 6-foot-10 Ingles on the 6-1 Williams. Ingles had him smothered and Russell forced a 3-point attempt that was an airball. ""D'Angelo ended up taking a tough shot,"" Walton said. ""He's trying to run the play the coach called. I give him respect for that. That last possession is on me."" Julius Randle had 25 points and 12 rebounds for his team-high ninth double-double for the Lakers, who have lost 13 of their last 15. Williams added 22 points off the bench, including nine in the fourth quarter. ""When we defend down the stretch and get stops, that's when we win,"" Snyder said. ""It happened that we hit a couple of shots too, but that's been the pattern with this group."" It was a rough night for the Lakers' two No. 2 picks. Russell went 2 for 11 from the field and Brandon Ingram was 2 for 5. ""We think we have one of the best defenses in the league,"" Ingles said. ""Defensively we were very good."" TIP-INS Jazz: Guard Rodney Hood made his second start since being out one game with the flu and dropping 10 pounds. ... Guard George Hill remained out with a sprained left big toe. Lakers: Assistant coach Mark Madsen missed the game after an emergency appendectomy. ...

Forward Larry Nance Jr. (bone bruise left knee) is off crutches and two days into his rehab. THAT'S A SERIES Lakers center Timofey Mozgov had a series to remember, or forget, with just over 4 minutes to play in the first quarter. First he went up for an uncontested slam and missed. The rebound went to teammate Jordan Clarkson, who passed back to Mozgov under the basket. He bobbled it for a turnover. Then seemingly eager to make amends, he went down on the other end to grab a rebound off a shot by Utah's Rudy Gobert, but tipped it in. HAYWARD HOT The smooth-shooting forward hit on 10-of-17 field goals, going 3 of 6 on 3-point attempts. The 26-year-old Hayward is averaging a career-high 22.0 points.","400899917"
"WASHINGTON --  Losing shooting guard Bradley Beal for the second half against the Indiana Pacers could have been trouble for the Washington Wizards. These days they're playing well enough to overcome it. John Wall had 36 points and 11 rebounds, and the Wizards held off the Pacers 111-105 on Wednesday night despite losing Beal to a sprained right ankle. Wall, who started 1 of 5 from the field, finished 11 of 19 and scored 23 points in the second half. ""I was just still trying to be aggressive, but get everybody involved,"" Wall said. Otto Porter Jr. added 22 points for Washington, and Wall finished one assist shy of his first triple-double of the season. Marcin Gortat had 13 points and 16 rebounds, while Beal scored 12 points in 18 minutes. The Wizards are 8-3 in their last 11 games, and have won seven straight at home. They're within a game of .500 for the first time since losing their opener en route to a 2-8 start. ""This is a classic example of how we have to continue to play,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""When some guy is out, next guy has to step up and give us some minutes."" Paul George scored 34 points and Jeff Teague added 19 points and 11 assists for the Pacers, who trailed by 11 after three quarters and cut the deficit to two late in the fourth. Indiana has lost four straight since beating Washington on Dec. 19. Washington outrebounded the Pacers 54-34 and scored 15 second-chance points. ""I thought there were some times when they, just, we got pushed around,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""You've got to man up down there, and we need our guards, everybody to come down and get involved. That's something that we've talked about all season long."" After Indiana closed to 71-68, Wall scored 12 straight Wizards points as they built the lead to 85-74 after three quarters. George hit a 3-pointer with 3:04 to play and Indiana trailed 96-94. Porter pushed the lead back to five when he sank a 3-pointer from the wing with 1:40 left and Indiana got no closer than 109-105 with 26 seconds left, and Wall then hit two free throws. Beal fell when he was fouled by Monta Ellis while driving for a layup late in the first quarter. He limped to the foul line and remained in the game. After the quarter ended, the trainer examined Beal's right ankle and Beal then went to the locker room. He returned to the game with 5:52 left in the first half, but didn't play in the second half after being listed as questionable. TIP-INS Pacers: Ellis (strained right groin) returned after missing five games. Guard Rodney Stuckey (left hamstring) did not play. ... The Pacers are 1-13 when trailing after three quarters. ...

PAYING THE PRICE George was fined $15,000 and McMillan $10,000 on Wednesday by the NBA for public criticism of officiating following Monday's 90-85 loss at Chicago.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Nicolas Batum's teammates are well aware of how talented he is. Now, opponents are taking notice, too. Batum could have had his second triple-double in a week Wednesday night, but the Charlotte Hornets didn't need him in the fourth quarter of a 120-101 rout against the Orlando Magic. Charlotte won its fourth in five games as Batum had 20 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in just under 30 minutes. Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 21 points and five assists, and Charlotte's guards outscored Orlando's starting backcourt 41-18. ""Nicolas Batum is one of the most underrated players in the NBA,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""We had trouble containing him and (Kemba) Walker and all the chain-reaction rotations those guys create when driving the ball to the basket. Those guys were really sharp."" Batum played all 12 minutes of the third quarter, when Charlotte outscored Orlando 35-13 to take a 97-68 lead into the final period. He shot 4 of 5 from the field, grabbed eight defensive rebounds and handed out four assists. ""Filling up the boxscore, that's every night with Nic,"" Walker said. ""Defensively, he can guard anybody, and offensively he can make any play on the court. People don't get to see us much and see how good he is, but we know how important he is to our team."" Orlando had no counter-punch on its side. The Magic were trying to sweep a three-game homestand after defeating the Lakers and Grizzlies, but couldn't find an answer when Charlotte got hot in the second half. Serge Ibaka scored all 20 of his points in the first half. Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 21. ""We were getting good shots in that third period, we just didn't make anything,"" Vogel said. ""We went stone cold and if you can't beat them from the perimeter, you're going to have a long night."" Jeremy Lamb scored 14 points and Ramon Sessions added 13 off the bench as the Hornets shot 54.8 percent, including 10 of 24 on 3-pointers. Jodie Meeks scored 11 for the Magic, who won their previous two games. The Hornets, who allowed Orlando to shoot 59 percent in the first half, were much more active on defense in the third quarter. Charlotte got points from six players during a six-minute stretch in the middle of the period when it outscored the Magic 28-2. Most of the shots came in the open court following Magic turnovers or long rebounds off missed shots. Orlando shot 1 for 11 and committed four turnovers during that stretch, falling behind 92-61. Jeff Green finally ended the misery with a three-point play, but by the end of the period, the Magic had made only five of 22 shots and trailed 97-68. Neither team seemed particularly interested in playing defense during the first half. Walker and Batum combined for 26 points and seven assists as Charlotte shot 54.5 percent to take a 62-55 halftime lead. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte has beaten Orlando five straight times and won seven of the last eight meetings. ... C Cody Zeller cut the ring finger on his right hand but returned for the second half. ... Charlotte leads the NBA in fewest turnovers with just 11.7 per game.

"ATLANTA --  Thabo Sefolosha didn't exactly gain much respect for Carmelo Anthony on Wednesday night. ""He threw a punch,"" Sefolosha said. ""A fist right to my face. It's whatever. The referee -- I'm glad they looked back at it -- they made the right call."" Dennis Schroder scored 27 points, Dwight Howard added 16 points and 22 rebounds, and the Atlanta Hawks took advantage of Anthony's second-quarter ejection to beat the New York Knicks 102-98 in overtime. Anthony refused to speak with reporters as he walked slowly to board the team bus after the game. Derrick Rose finished with 26 points for New York, but the star point guard fell as he was dribbling against Sefolosha near the Knicks' basket and lost his footing with 6 seconds left in overtime and Atlanta leading by one. ""It's no excuses,"" Rose said. ""We still had a chance to win the game. I put a lot of that on myself."" Schroder followed with a pair of free throws to make it 100-97. Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 24 points, was fouled by Sefolosha as he shot a 3-pointer on the ensuing possession, but he made just one of three free throws -- missing the last on purpose -- to end the suspense. ""I'm super disappointed that I missed such an important free throw,"" Porzingis said. ""I'm probably going to think about it tonight."" The Hawks had lost three straight and six of seven at home. They are just 7-14 since beginning the season 9-2. Atlanta didn't trail again in overtime after Sefolosha's 3 made it 89-88 with 3:54 left for the game's 16th lead change. ""Kyle (Korver) hit so many big shots down the stretch, and Paul (Millsap) got a few big buckets down the stretch,"" Sefolosha said. ""We just played better offensively, hitting the open man and making shots."" In the closing seconds of regulation, Rose and Schroder both missed a potential game-winning jumper. It was a chippy, emotional night by both teams, but the most dramatic moment came with 3:08 remaining in the second. Anthony and Sefolosha were tied up near the basket, positioned for a rebound, when the Knicks star lost his cool with a forearm jab to Sefolosha's face. The two players exchanged heated words and were separated. Players and assistant coaches on both benches stood up, and security personnel for each team came onto the floor. Anthony, a nine-time All-Star, followed Sefolosha to the Hawks' end of the floor, but the situation calmed down as the officials watched a replay. It first appeared that the officials might just call offsetting technicals and give Anthony a break. ""That would've been terrible,"" Sefolosha said. ""So I'm glad they switched the call and actually took another look at it."" Anthony left with 10 points in 15 minutes and Atlanta leading 43-38. In the third, Rose was driving for a layup and was fouled by Howard, who was cited for a flagrant 1. Replays showed that Kent Bazemore, not Howard, likely should've been whistled. TIP-INS Knicks: Rose went 9 for 28 from the field. ... In his first 30 career games against Atlanta, Anthony averaged 26.1 points and 7.6 rebounds. ... F Maurice Ndour missed his fourth straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... New York is 5-10 on the road. Hawks: Howard had his third 20-rebound game this season. ... Tim Hardaway Jr. went scoreless in 7 minutes, missing all seven of shots from the field. He missed the last two games with a sore groin. LEE SIDELINED Knicks G Courtney Lee, the team's fourth-leading scorer with 10 points per game, did not dress because of a sore right wrist. An MRI showed nothing broken, but Lee said he felt his fingers and knuckles crack when he was injured early in a home loss Sunday to Boston. Lee had hoped not to miss a game after playing 34 minutes and scoring 11 points against the Celtics, but three days later, he felt too much discomfort in the morning shootaround. Sasha Vujacic started in Lee's spot and scored two points on 1-for-7 shooting. SPORTING BOLD LOOK Millsap still has a black right eye after Howard accidentally elbowed him in Monday's loss at Minnesota. ""He looks like a boxer but he's ready for Round 2,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. Millsap had 12 points, seven rebounds and six assists, but he went just 5 for 20 from the field in 41 minutes.","400899920"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  Barring an unlikely playoff matchup, the Milwaukee Bucks played their final game at the Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday night. They will be taking away a lot of good memories. Jabari Parker scored 31 points and Giannis Antetokuompo had 23 points and eight assists as the Bucks beat the Detroit Pistons 119-94. Milwaukee scored 58 points in the paint, hit 50 percent of its 3-pointers and had 36 assists on 48 field goals. ""We were moving the ball really well, and J.P. was getting to the rack,"" Antetokuompo said. ""We both had a lot of open looks and our teammates got us the ball. That's when we're going to win."" Greg Monroe added 14 points, six assists and five rebounds against his former team to help the Bucks win for the second time in five games. Tony Snell and Matthew Dellavedova each scored 11. ""Any time you have two guys getting it going like Jabari and Giannis, it makes the rest of us better,"" Monroe said. ""They are doing their jobs, so everyone has to come in and feed off them."" Tobias Harris had 23 points and 12 rebounds off the bench for Detroit, which has dropped six of seven. The Pistons ended a five-game losing streak Monday with a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, who rested LeBron James, but weren't competitive against visiting Milwaukee. ""They got everything they wanted,"" Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson said. ""I don't think we executed our game plan. They beat us across the board and definitely brought more energy."" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy is usually willing to call out his players after poor performances, but he refused to do that in a brief postgame press conference. ""This is entirely on me,"" he said. ""We have had too many games where we are getting buried. I'm embarrassed right now, and I have a lot of thinking to do to find a way to get this fixed. ""This is brutal."" The Bucks (15-15) are two games ahead of the Pistons (15-19) in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Milwaukee led by as many as 11 in the first half, thanks to seven 3-pointers, but Jackson's emphatic dunk at the end of the second quarter pulled Detroit to 62-54. The Bucks outshot the Pistons 54.5 percent to 50 percent, but Milwaukee had four more 3s and six more free throws. The Bucks used their outside threat to get the ball to the rim in the third quarter. They scored 14 points in the paint and added enough jumpers to push the lead to 19. ""I thought we did a good job of coming out in the second half and playing even better,"" Monroe said. ""The ball kept moving, we were making the right plays and helping on defense. That gets us out into transition and makes us even better."" The margin was 90-75 going into the fourth, and the Pistons never got enough stops to threaten a rally. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee came into the game ranked 28th in the NBA in 3-pointers, after finishing 30th a season ago. The Bucks hit seven of 11 attempts in the first half. ... Monroe was booed when he entered the game. He started his career with the Pistons before going to Milwaukee as a free agent in the summer of 2015. Pistons: Van Gundy went to a little-used combination to try to change things up in the second quarter, playing Jackson and fellow point guard Ish Smith together. They came into the game having played only three minutes together all season. ... Andre Drummond had 16 points and nine rebounds. Jackson scored 14, but Smith had only two points on 1-of-5 shooting in 20:32. STILL STRUGGLING While Drummond has improved his free throw shooting from last season's NBA record-low 35.5 percent, he's at just 44.2 percent after going 3 for 13 in the last two games. Only he, DeAndre Jordan and Ben Wallace have had full seasons that bad in the last 40 years. ON TARGET Milwaukee shot at least 60 percent from the floor in three of the four quarters, and scored 31 points while hitting 45.5 percent in the second. ""Let's make one thing clear,"" Van Gundy said. ""They played a very, very good basketball game."" DEFENSIVE COLLAPSE The Pistons allowed 1.00 points per possession through their first 27 games, one of the best marks in the NBA. During their 1-5 stretch, though, that has jumped to 1.15 points -- about 14 more per game given their usual playing pace. RELISHING HIS ROLE The Pistons are 1-2 since Van Gundy moved Jon Leuer into the starting lineup ahead of Harris, but Harris has done a nice job in his new role. Including his 23 points against the Bucks, he's scored at least 21 in each game as a reserve.","400899921"
"CHICAGO --  With just under five minutes left, Jimmy Butler had to be helped to the bench and couldn't seem to put any weight on his right ankle. It appeared his night was over. He was far from finished, though. Butler matched his season high with 40 points and hit a 20-footer at the buzzer Wednesday to give the Chicago Bulls a 101-99 comeback victory over the Brooklyn Nets. Butler scored nine points in the final 2 1/2 minutes to rally Chicago. He finished 11 for 11 from the free throw line and grabbed 11 rebounds as the Bulls overcame a seven-point deficit in the final three minutes for their second consecutive win. ""He was phenomenal, obviously,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""He put the team on his shoulders. He willed them to the finish line."" Butler also willed himself because he acknowledged his ankle -- hurt when he landed on the foot of Brooklyn's Randy Foye -- still was aching after the game. But with Dwyane Wade already in the locker room due to a migraine, Butler never doubted he would return. ""When the adrenaline kicks in and the crowd's getting into it, I was ready to go,"" he said. Brook Lopez had 33 points -- including a career-high five 3-pointers -- as the Nets dropped their 12th straight road game. ""Chicago made a great push; they hit a lot of tough shots,"" Lopez said. ""I'm disappointed in myself. I definitely should have converted on a few of those last possessions, but I let them get back in the game."" Lopez had 19 first-half points to spark Brooklyn to a 49-46 halftime lead. The 7-footer was 4 for 5 on 3-pointers in the first 24 minutes and celebrated by holding up three fingers as he ran down the court following each one. Brooklyn had a 97-90 lead with just more than two minutes to play and appeared headed for a comfortable win, but Chicago stormed back. Michael Carter-Williams tied the game at 97 with 1:22 left. Following a Nets turnover, Butler gave the Bulls their first lead of the second half with a 15-footer with 27.7 seconds to go. Lopez, though, tied it with 12.6 seconds left on a dunk over his brother, Robin Lopez. That set the stage for Butler's step-back winner. ""That was a big-time shot,"" Wade said. ""I'm just proud of him."" TIP-INS Nets: There's no timetable yet for how long G Jeremy Lin (strained left hamstring) will be sidelined, but expectations are it will be a long absence. He missed 17 games earlier in the season with the same injury and has only played in 12 games this season. ... G Joe Harris, who sat out with a hip pointer, is listed as day-to-day. Bulls: F Doug McDermott returned after missing one game with a left shin injury. That meant all the team's players were healthy for the first time since Oct. 31. ""It's good to have your full roster available to play,"" Hoiberg said. HEAD GAMES Wade didn't play in the final 8:22 because of the migraine. ""I lost a little vision,"" he said. ""I went on the court and couldn't see the rim and decided to come out and put some ice on it."" ROAD WOES Brooklyn dropped to 1-15 on the road. The team's only win away from home was a 122-104 victory in Phoenix on Nov. 12. ""We were down a few guys and on the road,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Our guys had a lot of resilience, and I feel bad we didn't get the win."" SLOW START Hoiberg was happy with the win, but didn't gloss over the fact his team dug itself a deep hole against a team with eight wins. ""It was disappointing; I'm not going to lie to you,"" he said. ""The way they came out and were the aggressors, it seemed like we were fighting uphill. ""We finally strung together some stops and got the win.""","400899922"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry got ejected, Anthony Davis struggled to get rebounds and it was just the Pelicans' luck that Clippers guard Chris Paul would return from a three-game absence in New Orleans. Yet a Pelicans squad that couldn't do anything right early this season overcame it all. Davis highlighted a 20-point performance with a soaring, one-handed alley-oop dunk during a pivotal fourth-quarter spurt, added a critical steal in the final minutes, and the suddenly surging Pelicans beat Los Angeles 102-98 on Wednesday night. ""We're just maturing as a team,"" said Davis, whose team has won three straight and four of five. ""We're trusting each other. We're playing for each other ... and we're just locked in more down the stretch."" Paul, who'd been sidelined by a sore left hamstring, scored 21 points, but couldn't lift the Clippers out of a funk that has seen them lose four straight. Paul played 30 minutes while on a minutes restriction. ""Given my minute restriction and stuff like that, we had to think long-term,"" Paul said. ""All in all, I think we're going to be OK. ... At the end of the day, we want to be healthy at the right time."" Marreese Speights, whose 11 points included a vicious driving dunk over Tyreke Evans, had a chance in the final seconds to tie the game with a straightaway 3-point attempt. It rimmed out and Davis tipped the ball to Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday. Austin Rivers scored 22 points for Los Angeles, including a late 3 to tighten the finish, and DeAndre Jordan had 25 rebounds to go with 13 points. Despite playing center instead of power forward, where he's played much of the season, Davis didn't have his usual double-digit rebound totals. But he had two blocks and three steals, none more important than when he tipped Jordan's outlet pass to himself near the Clippers' basket and immediately converted a short one-handed floater to make it 101-93 with 1:41 left. ""Our season is in jeopardy throughout this stretch,"" Davis said. ""We just want to come out and win knowing that our goal is the make the playoffs and we're trying to do whatever we have to."" TIP-INS Clippers: Guard J.J. Redick, who's averaged 15.4 points this season, missed his second straight game with a sore left hamstring. Rivers said Redick has ""looked good"" running and shooting, but wasn't quite ready to play in New Orleans. ... Rivers said Jordan was fortunate to have been uninjured in a car accident before the Clippers' departure for New Orleans on Tuesday. He then joked that he still fined Jordan for being late and also fined Paul, who fetched Jordan after the wreck. Rivers added that he's been in the NBA so long that when he hears a player is late because of a traffic accident, he's inclined to believe it's a made-up excuse, but added that Jordan had photos to prove it. Pelicans: Holiday had 11 points and nine assists. Buddy Hield scored 17 points, while Evans added a season-high 12 points in his sixth game back from a right knee injury. ... With Davis at center, New Orleans' pair of 7-footers, Omer Asik and Alexis Ajinca, didn't play. EJECTED GENTRY New Orleans played more than half the game without Gentry, who was ejected while arguing over a three-shot foul called against Holiday as he defended Paul on the perimeter. Paul appeared to draw contact by swinging the ball laterally through Holiday's outstretched hand, then quickly tossed up a shot as official Lauren Holtkamp blew the whistle. Holtkamp called the first technical on Gentry and fellow official Kane Fitzgerald called the second. Top Pelicans assistant Darren Erman took over for Gentry after that. Afterward the game, Gentry said he had plenty to say if anyone in the media was willing to reimburse him whatever the NBA would fine him. Holiday said he was ""not really sure the refs knew what they were doing."" Davis said Erman and other assistants ""did a great job"" and that the ejection ""definitely fueled us.""","400899923"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs relied on experience and the surprisingly spry legs of Manu Ginobili to overcome the energy of the Phoenix Suns. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 27 points and San Antonio rallied to win without leading scorer Kawhi Leonard, beating Phoenix 119-98 on Wednesday night. ""They really got into us physically and did a great job denying passing lanes and really gave themselves a chance to win,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I just think our experience kind of took over in the end."" After trailing by as many as 10 points, San Antonio forced seven turnovers while outscoring Phoenix 30-16 in the final quarter to capture its sixth straight win at home. The Suns were held to 34 points in the second half after scoring 64 in a blistering first half. After being held scoreless in the first half, Ginobili responded with 12 points, including a dunk, and three blocked shots in the second half. ""I try to bring it every game,"" Ginobili said. ""Sometimes it's hard, sometimes things don't go your way. At halftime, we were frustrated with the way we were playing. So, we all brought it in the second half. We played a lot better."" The 39-year-old veteran's energy drew praise, as well as some teasing, from teammates. ""I hope he can walk tomorrow,"" Aldridge said, laughing afterward. The Spurs' needed the lift while playing without Leonard for the first time this season. The 6-foot-7 forward, who has a stomach virus, was replaced in the lineup by Kyle Anderson. ""Yeah, we missed him for sure,"" Ginobili said. ""I think we should have played much better anyway. The ball should have moved faster, but they are physical, strong, young (team)."" T.J. Warren led Phoenix with 23 points, going 10 for 10 on free throws. Brandon Knight added 14 points and Marquese Chriss and Eric Bledsoe each had 13. The Spurs had trouble slowing the Suns, who are second in the league at 103.8 possessions per game and averaging 107.3 points. ""We're a fast-break team,"" Chriss said. ""I think that is what our strengths are."" Although Anderson finished 0 for 6 from the field, San Antonio missed Leonard's defense more than his team-high 24.4 points per game. Aldridge and Pau Gasol combined for 29 points in the opening half, but the Suns countered with 34 points in the paint. The Suns attacked the rim, earning 11 free throws against a Spurs defense that was allowing only 20 per game. Phoenix limited Aldridge to three field goal attempts in the first 19 minutes. He finished the game 10 for 12 from the field and 7 for 9 on free throws. ""We're not surprised,"" Watson said. ""LaMarcus has always been an All-Star in this league. He was my teammate in Portland. To me, he's the best power forward in the game."" TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix is 1-5 in back-to-back games entering Thursday's home game against Toronto. ... The Suns' last win in San Antonio was Feb. 27, 2013, snapping the Spurs' 18-game winning streak at the AT&amp;T Center in their first home game following their annual rodeo road trip. Spurs: Leonard has missed four games in his career due to a stomach ailment. ""He just couldn't keep anything down today,"" Popovich said. ""So, he just stayed home."" ... Anderson made his seventh start of the season, but his first at small forward. The 6-9 wing started six games at shooting guard in place of Danny Green to open the season. IMPROVING The development of rookie point guard Dejounte Murray allowed the Spurs to part ways with Nico Laprovittola. Laprovittola, a 26-year-old rookie from Argentina, was waived Tuesday. Murray is averaging just 2.2 points and 0.6 assists in 5.5 minutes with the Spurs, but has flourished in 11 games with the team's Development League affiliate. The rookie from Washington is averaging 15.8 points and 6.9 assists in 34.2 minutes with the Austin Spurs. ""With Dejounte, it's about minutes,"" Popovich said. ""The more minutes he gets, the better (he will be). He'll still play some minutes in the D-League. I don't think it will do him much good just to sit on our bench the whole time. He needs to get repetitions with the pick-and-roll, making decisions on a fast break, all that sort of things.""","400899924"
"DENVER --  Andrew Wiggins beat Wilson Chandler by a half-step on his drive to the basket. Chandler, though, beat Wiggins to the rim. Chandler scored 17 points and swatted away Wiggins' attempted layup with a soaring block in the final seconds, helping the Denver Nuggets hang on to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 105-103 Wednesday night. ""I got lucky,"" Chandler said. ""When he turned the corner, he had a little edge on me. I just jumped up. I thought he was going to dunk it but I was going for the block regardless."" Denver also overcame a triple-double by Karl-Anthony Towns, who had 15 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for the Timberwolves. Double-teamed much of the night, Towns put together a big fourth quarter, when he scored 11 points and grabbed eight rebounds to go with two assists. ""When teams double-, triple-, quadruple-team you, you just have to pass it out and trust your teammates to hit shots, and our team is working hard to hit shots,"" Towns said. ""We wanted to get out of here with a win. We fought and clawed back. We could have won that game."" But Danilo Gallinari, who finished with 18 points, hit the go-ahead basket with 27 seconds left for the Nuggets. Nikola Jokic was two rebounds shy of his own triple-double, finishing with 16 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. Wiggins had 25 points for the Timberwolves, and Gorgui Dieng added 20. A tip-in by Wiggins tied the score 64-all with 5:30 left in the third quarter. Denver responded with a 13-2 run that included three straight baskets by Gary Harris over the next four minutes and took an 81-73 lead into the fourth. Jokic helped the Nuggets open a 93-83 lead with 7:22 left, grabbing a defensive rebound and leading the break down court before dishing a lead pass to Chandler off a behind-the-back dribble. With a clear path to the basket, Chandler went in for a dunk. Minnesota tied it again at 103 when Wiggins made one of two free throws, but Gallinari banked in a contested jumper over Wiggins for the decisive basket. ""As soon as I got the ball I was trying to shoot the ball, but I saw Wiggins coming,"" Gallinari said. ""He was kind of being aggressive with me so it gave me the chance to drive, but he's a very good athlete and he closed out the drive so I tried to find another way to get the space. I spun around and I saw him jumping very high, so I had to throw the ball up a little higher than usual. I'm glad it went in."" Chandler helped to preserve the victory when he shadowed Wiggins on a drive and blocked his layup attempt with 8.8 seconds left. Harris got the rebound for Denver and tossed the ball down court to try to run out the clock -- the Nuggets had no timeouts. Zach LaVine chased it down for a steal, however, and just missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. The Timberwolves led by 13 early but the Nuggets made up ground in the second quarter, outscoring Minnesota by nine points in the period. Wiggins, who had 20 in the first half, banked in a 3-pointer near the end of the second to help the Timberwolves salvage a 49-all tie at halftime. TIP-INS Timberwolves: After beating Atlanta on Monday, the Timberwolves were denied in their bid for back-to-back wins for the second time this season. ... Minnesota has dropped 10 games this season in which it led by 10 or more points. ... The triple-double by Towns was the first of his career. Nuggets: Jokic has had a double-double in six of his last 11 games. The 11 assists represented a career high. ... Denver improved to 7-8 at home. ... Denver won for just the second time in the last 13 games in which an opposing player registered a triple-double.","400899925"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  As CJ McCollum sees it, there's no time like the present for the Trail Blazers to snap out of their defensive funk. McCollum scored 20 points and Portland snapped a six-game losing streak with a 102-89 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. The win ended the Blazers' longest skid of the season and was the second straight game they have shown intensity on defense -- something that has eluded them at times this season. ""The sense of urgency has risen. We understand where we're at in the season. We understand where we turned the corner at last year, about the same time. So if we want to get better, the time is now,"" McCollum said. Meyers Leonard added 16 off the bench for the Blazers, playing without leading scorer Damian Lillard for the second straight game because of a sprained left ankle. DeMarcus Cousins scored 28 points but the Kings had their four-game winning streak snapped. ""You could tell their game plan was to make everybody else have big games instead of myself,"" Cousins said. ""It was successful tonight. It worked."" The Kings trailed by as many as 20 points in the second half. Matt Barnes' corner 3-pointer with 2 minutes to go pulled Sacramento within 98-87, before Cousins hit on a floater to get closer. Mason Plumlee answered with a dunk for Portland and the Kings couldn't catch up. Plumlee finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds. The teams last met on Dec. 20, a 126-121 Sacramento victory that was marked by drama -- namely an ejection reversal -- involving Cousins. Cousins scored 55 points in the win. But with less than 2 minutes remaining, he was celebrating a foul call on his go-ahead basket and he appeared to spit his mouthpiece at the Blazers' bench. Cousins was hit with a technical, his second, and headed off to the locker room. But moments later he was called back when the officiating crew reversed the call. He sank the free throw and later in a postgame TV interview called the whole drama ""ridiculous."" That victory touched off the Kings' four-game winning streak. Cousins hit the first basket Wednesday night, but Portland led by as many as 17 points in the first half, taking a 60-44 lead into the break. Allen Crabbe, who replaced Lillard in the starting lineup, led all players with 13 points. Cousins, booed whenever he touched the ball, had three fouls at halftime. McCollum hit a 3-pointer that pushed Portland's lead to 67-47. Cousins made a 3-pointer, his first of the game, pulling the Kings to 73-61, then made another that narrowed it to 77-69 early in the fourth quarter. ""I don't think we were aggressive enough,"" Cousins said. ""We know what type of team Portland is. They're a jump shooting team and they have a lot of motion, constant movement. When it came to switching we weren't aggressive enough."" TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento was without Rudy Gay because of a right hip flexor strain. Gay had played Monday in the 102-100 victory over the 76ers. ... Garrett Temple had 14 points off the bench. Trail Blazers: Portland has won eight straight against the Kings at the Moda Center. ... It was just the ninth game Lillard has missed in his career. ANSWERING KARL Longtime NBA coach George Karl caused a bit of a stir in Portland with comments he made to New York Magazine about Lillard. ""I was watching the Portland Trail Blazers play, and I was trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with this team?"" Karl asked. ""My conclusion is that Damian Lillard is getting too much attention."" Blazers coach Terry Stotts, asked to respond before the game, said: ""When it comes to my team and my players, he needs to stay in his own lane."" PERSPECTIVE ""I don't want guys to get too down and get drained and start thinking negative because we lost one game,"" Cousins said. ""This is the NBA. We weren't going to go undefeated the rest of the season.""","400899926"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- The Golden State Warriors played one of their most dominant quarters to start the game, building a 25-point lead. Then, there were turnovers and second chances for Toronto and they had to hold off the Raptors at the end. Kevin Durant had 22 points, matched his season best with 17 rebounds, and added seven assists and five blocks as the Warriors beat the Raptors 121-111 on Wednesday night. Stephen Curry added 28 points, seven assists and seven rebounds, and Klay Thompson scored 21 points for Golden State, which showed that if you make these Warriors a little mad one game, they might just play far better the next. They did just that, for a stretch. ""We're still getting wins,"" Thompson said. ""That's all that matters."" Upset with themselves for blowing a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter to lose 109-108 at Cleveland in an NBA Finals rematch on Christmas Day, they took it out on Toronto three days later. DeMar DeRozan scored 29 points and became Toronto's career scoring leader (10,290), passing Chris Bosh's 10,275 points, but the Raptors had their franchise-record, seven-game road winning streak snapped. Curry, Durant and Thompson scored 20 or more points each in the same game for the 11th time. Golden State dished out 30 or more assists for an NBA-best 22nd time and shot 56.8 percent in a 12th straight home win against Toronto. Curry's snazzy behind-the-back pass to Thompson for a 3-pointer late in the third put the Warriors up 95-75, but they had to deliver late. Curry rebounded a missed 3 by Durant and converted two key free throws with 2:04 to go, then Durant blocked a shot by DeRozan on the other end. He blocked another shot in the final seconds. Golden State has now gone 119 straight regular-season games without losing back-to-back contests since April 2015 and has won 15 in a row after a defeat, going 5-0 this season. Andre Iguodala scored in double figures off the bench for the seventh time this season with 11 points, making all five of his shots. Golden State made nine of its first 10 shots with a pair of 3s by Thompson, a long 28-footer by Curry and another from Durant to jump to a 22-4 lead. The Raptors called their second timeout with 7:40 left in the first. ""We put ourselves in a hole, we dug our way out of it, but we didn't have enough to finish it,"" Toronto's Kyle Lowry said. Toronto started the second with a 19-6 spurt to get back within 12 but the Warriors closed the half on a 16-4 run to lead 72-55 at the break. ""It was the most bizarre box score I've ever seen at halftime,"" coach Steve Kerr said. TIP-INS Raptors: Coach Dwane Casey was still feeling the effects of the flu a day later but much better. ... The Raptors are 11-4 on the road, 0-3 vs. the Pacific Division. Warriors: Golden State's 42 points in the first period were its most this season and its NBA-leading seventh 40-point quarter. The Warriors shot 72 percent (18 for 25). ... The Warriors had 33 assists to 20 turnovers. DEROZAN'S RECORD Casey couldn't be happier with how DeRozan represents the franchise. ""I think he's grown in every aspect of his game except probably his 3-point shooting, but he's probably one of the best in-between shooters in the league,"" Casey said. ""He's one of those guys that he's always brought something new to the table each and every year. I couldn't think of anybody who deserves that honor or record or whatever you want to call it more than DeMar. I think he's the face of our franchise. He represents it in a first-class way.""","400899927"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Nicolas Batum isn't sure what has been happening in third quarters lately for his Charlotte Hornets, though he'd like to bottle it up for whenever it's needed. ""We're just really good,"" Batum said. ""If we could start the game the same way we start the third quarter, we'd be a really, really good team."" Thanks to another dominating third quarter Thursday night, Charlotte beat the Miami Heat 91-82. Batum had 16 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists, and sparked the Hornets with nine points, five rebounds and four assists in the third period, when they outscored Miami 31-17. Kemba Walker led Charlotte with 22 points on 8-for-20 shooting. The Hornets improved to 19-14, and have won five of their last six games. Josh Richardson led Miami with 20 points on 8-for-14 shooting. The Heat fell to 10-23. The Hornets' third-quarter dominance has become habit. One night earlier, they outscored the Orlando Magic 35-13 in the period to grab a lead they held onto until the end. Charlotte began the third with an 8-0 run and never relented. Though they shot 38.7 percent overall, the Hornets connected on 13-of-23 attempts (56.5 percent) in the third. ""I have no idea (why),"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said of his team's third-quarter performances. Clifford is more concerned with Charlotte's fourth-quarter defense. Limiting the Heat to 16 fourth-quarter points was a major victory in Clifford's eyes. ""It's been a problem, and tonight it was much better,"" he said. Miami, meanwhile, is struggling to find its footing overall and used its 12th different starting lineup of the season. The Heat had 17 turnovers, which led to 21 points for the Hornets. ""We just weren't coherent, didn't get organized and made some sloppy turnovers and we paid the price for it,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. Richardson seemed to have a breakthrough when he had 13 points in the second quarter on 5-for-7 shooting to lead the Heat to a 49-42 halftime edge. Miami outscored Charlotte 13-6 in the final 4:15 of the quarter, a span that included eight points, including two 3-pointers, from Richardson. Richardson was just two points shy of his career high of 22 points set earlier this season. Hassan Whiteside, from nearby Gastonia, North Carolina, had eight points and 10 rebounds for Miami. Justise Winslow had one point and did not sink any of his nine field goal attempts. ""The ball wasn't going for me but I tried to defend, rebound and make plays for other guys,"" Winslow said. ""When your shot's not falling, you try to still make an impact on the game. It was just one of those nights."" TIP-INS: Heat: Goran Dragic started, although he had been questionable with lower back spasms. He missed Tuesday's game against Oklahoma City. ""Goran probably shouldn't have been out there,"" Spoelstra said. ""But he wanted to be out there for his team. He was probably about 50-60 percent."" ... Miami's 10-22 record after 32 games is the worst for the franchise since the Heat began 2007-08 with 24 losses in that same span. The Heat lost 67 games that season. Hornets: Walker recorded his 7,000th point with the Charlotte franchise when he hit a 3-pointer with 4:16 left in the first quarter. Walker is the fourth player in franchise history to reach that mark, and became the second-quickest by doing so in his 396th game. Larry Johnson passed the mark in his 355th career game with the Hornets. ... Marco Belinelli missed his third straight game with a sprained left ankle. TRIPLE THREAT Only Anthony Mason (seven) and Larry Johnson (five) have logged more career triple-doubles with the Hornets than Batum, who has three with Charlotte and seven in his career.","400899928"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies were already rolling when Russell Westbrook took his leave -- ejected after a pair of technical fouls. From there, the Grizzlies just continued to pile on the points. Marc Gasol scored 25, Zach Randolph added 21 and the Grizzlies built their fourth-quarter cushion to 37 before coasting to a 114-80 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday night. Troy Daniels helped the lead swell in the fourth, shooting 6 of 8 from outside the arc in the final period while scoring all 22 of his points. ""I just was happy with the effort,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""That's all I cared about -- seeing us play harder. Sprinting back on defense, diving on the floor for loose balls."" Memphis weathered a bit of an early second-half rally and still led 61-45 when Westbrook was whistled for two technicals with 6:41 left in the third. ""Honestly, it's crazy, man, especially to be ejected when I didn't do nothing,"" Westbrook said. ""It was just crazy, especially for me because I don't feel I get the benefit of the doubt most of the time, especially throughout the game, with the refs."" Westbrook, the NBA's leading scorer at 31.7 points per game, left with 21 points, five rebounds and no assists. Enes Kanter scored 19 as Oklahoma City set a season low for points. ""I thought (the Grizzlies) did a terrific job defensively,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""They've been good defensively all year long. I think there are some things that we certainly could have done a whole lot better."" The loss snapped Oklahoma City's four-game winning streak, while Memphis ended a two-game skid. The Thunder never got the Memphis lead under double digits in the second half. TIP-INS Thunder: G Victor Oladipo missed his ninth game with a right wrist injury. Anthony Morrow, the most common replacement for Oladipo, started his seventh game of the season. ... The Thunder had six turnovers in the first quarter, all by Westbrook. Grizzlies: Have 10 wins in December, the first time they've accumulated double-digit wins in the month. ... Randolph played in his 1,012th career regular-season game. Exactly half of them (506) have come in a Memphis uniform. ... Daniels' 22 points in the fourth tied a franchise record for one quarter. Greg Anthony had 22 in a quarter against Detroit on Dec. 7, 1995, when the team was in Vancouver. BIG TOE, NO-GO Memphis PG Mike Conley missed his second game with a bum left big toe. Fizdale said it was caused by ""a broken toenail type of thing,"" adding: ""When those 7-footers step on your toes, that's not pleasant."" TRIPLE-DOUBLE ZERO Westbrook's ejection assured Memphis would maintain its streak of not allowing a triple-double in 176 games -- the longest current run in the league. The Grizzlies haven't allowed a triple-double since Dec. 13, 2014, when Michael Carter-Williams had 16 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists for the Philadelphia 76ers. MORE FROM WESTBROOK ""I get so many techs just for talking. I can't even say nothing when I'm getting hammered every time I go to the damn basket through the games and previous games,"" Westbrook said. ""Not tonight, but every night. I just don't get reffed the same way as other people, and I don't appreciate it."" AND NOW FROM THE CHIEF Jason Phillips, the officiating crew chief, speaking to a pool reporter, said Westbrook's beef was about a shot clock reset regarding whether a Grizzlies shot hit the rim. Phillips used the term ""adamant"" several times in describing the Thunder guard's complaint. Officials advised Westbrook they heard his point, and it was time to move on. Westbrook continued to gripe, drawing the first technical. The complaint continued ""and then even proceeds to use some profanity,"" Phillips said. ""At that point, he's issued a second technical foul.""","400899929"
"CLEVELAND -- LeBron James accepted ""Happy Birthday"" wishes as he walked out of Cleveland's locker room He was in no mood to party after his final game as a 31-year-old. ""I was horrible,"" he said. Kyrie Irving scored 32 points and made two critical layups before leaving with a hamstring issue and Kevin Love scored 30, helping the Cavaliers hold off a late rally for a 124-118 victory over the Boston Celtics on Thursday. The Cavs led by 20 points in the third and 18 at the start of the fourth but couldn't close out the Celtics, who pulled within one point three times in the final two minutes. But the NBA champions made plays down the stretch and won for the eighth time in nine games over Boston. ""We were still able to keep our composure even when it was down to a one-point and made timely shots,"" James said. However, the league's best all-around player was upset with how he played despite nearly recording a triple-double. He committed eight turnovers, including one inexcusable miscue to aid Boston's rally. ""I was pretty bad and it's unacceptable and I can't do that if I want to help our team get to where I want to get to,"" James said. ""As a report card, I give myself an `F' for tonight's performance. I've got to be better."" Irving bailed out his more celebrated teammate by coming up with his big baskets. But he was forced to leave and the Cavs had to fend off Boston over the final 53 seconds as their star guard grabbed his right hamstring and went to the bench. Afterward, Irving said his hamstring tightened up and he received treatment. Irving said he won't know until Friday if he'll miss any time. James apologized to his teammates following the game, but Irving said that wasn't necessary. ""That guy is so special,"" Irving said. ""He gives himself an `F' and he still ends up with 23, 8 and 11. He took full accountability just like anyone else in this locker room would, but as the leader of this team, we demand a lot from him. He understands that, he wants it, he thrives in that and I think it's good."" Isaiah Thomas scored 31 and Avery Bradley had 23, but both players were on the bench when the Celtics' reserves kept chipping away in the fourth. Bradley and Thomas then both made layups as the Celtics twice got within a point, but Irving countered on consecutive possessions for Cleveland. Boston was down 120-118 with a chance to steal it, but Jae Crowder missed a 3-pointer with 8.5 seconds left and the Cavs finally sealed it as Richard Jefferson and Love knocked down two free throws apiece. ""I thought it was good. I had a good look at it,"" Crowder said. ""My coaches had confidence in me to make that. I'll step into it a 100 more times."" Following the Cavs' emotional win over Golden State on Christmas -- a rematch of the past two NBA Finals -- James was given the next night off in Detroit and Cleveland was thumped 106-90. The loss dropped the Cavs to 4-18 without James the past two years and raised questions about whether they can survive without him. On Thursday, they won without him at his best. ""I was happy that I got two All-Stars alongside me,"" James said. TIP-INS Celtics: Thomas has scored at least 20 points in 17 straight games, the league's longest current streak. ... Bradley jammed his left thumb during the first half but returned. ... Stevens' wife is from the Cleveland area, and on a recent trip to Columbus for a wedding he got to see an Ohio State football practice. Stevens was an assistant at Butler under Buckeyes basketball coach Thad Matta. ""He's got some pull down there, it seems like,"" Stevens said. ""So we sat over there. They're pretty impressive. My dad went to medical school at Ohio State. It's pretty cool to follow their success."" Cavaliers: Love added 15 rebounds. ... Cleveland is 10-0 against the Atlantic Division. ... James (721) moved past Bingo Smith (720) for the third-most games in franchise history. Only Zydrunas Ilgauskas (771) and Danny Ferry (723) have played more. DON'T CALL IT A COMEBACK Boston coach Brad Stevens didn't take any solace in his team's rally. ""If they have 100 points after three quarters, you don't have a real chance to beat them,"" he said. ""We've got to play a lot better than that.""","400899930"
"SALT LAKE CITY -- George Hill felt rusty and tired but he wanted to be on the floor when it counted. With his team down by four entering the fourth quarter, Utah's starting point guard gathered the Jazz before going back on the court. ""`Hey, we've got to make a push. Let's get a couple stops here and get out quick on offense and string some good possessions together,"" Hill said. His teammates listened and the Jazz promptly broke the game open. Hill had 21 points in his return to the lineup after missing 13 games with a sprained toe, and Utah blitzed the Philadelphia 76ers in the fourth quarter to win 100-83 on Thursday night. Gordon Hayward and Rodney Hood each added 20 points for the Jazz (20-13), who outscored Philadelphia 30-9 in the final period. They shot 58 percent from 3-point range overall to win their second consecutive game after dropping three in a row. ""Our guys started to take things away from them on offense and get up into them. We relied on each other defensively and that's what broke the game open,"" said Hill, who also had eight rebounds and six assists. Ersan Ilyasova scored 16 points and Nerlens Noel and Dario Saric both added 14, but the anemic fourth-quarter performance contributed to the 76ers' fourth straight loss. Philadelphia, playing without leading scorer and rebounder Joel Embiid, surprisingly led for most of the game until collapsing late. The 76ers (7-24) shot 4 for 23 in the final 12 minutes. Until that point, Utah's vaunted defense, ranked at the top of the NBA in many categories, was late closing out on shooters. On the other end, the Jazz were missing free throws and turning the ball over. Then, they instantly reversed their lackadaisical play. ""They weren't just out there. They were out there with a purpose,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said about the game-changing run. The 76ers led 74-70 entering the final quarter, but the Jazz quickly went on a 21-2 run with primarily reserve players (and Hill) to gain control. Trey Lyles blocked a shot and hit two 3-pointers to power the decisive surge. ""We were getting out on the break and really pushing the ball and finding open guys,"" Lyles said. ""We were more active with our hands and getting deflections and making them turn the ball over."" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown saw his team get taught a tough lesson. ""It's a classic example of how fourth periods in the NBA are different from periods one through three,"" Brown said. ""We got jumped."" Because of a slew of injuries, the game marked the first in which Utah started its preseason projected lineup of Hill, Hood, Hayward, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert. The Jazz, who are 9-3 when Hill plays, outscored the 76ers by 33 in the 29 minutes he was on the court. TIP-INS 76ers: Jahlil Okafor had all 13 of his points in the first half. ... With Gerald Henderson out due to left hip soreness, Philadelphia used its 13th different starting lineup this season. ... Ilyasova's streak of games with a 3-pointer stretched to 28, second only to James Harden's 33. Jazz: Utah has won nine straight against Philadelphia and 12 consecutive at home in the series. ... Gobert's streak of double-doubles ended at 11 games, the longest for the Jazz since Paul Millsap had 19 straight in 2008-09. Gobert had nine points and 13 rebounds. ... The Jazz are 15-5 when Hayward scores 20 points or more. STAT LINE The Jazz, who hit five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, shot better from beyond the arc (15 of 26) than they did from the free throw line (15 of 28). QUOTABLE ""We still have to figure out our rhythm a little bit and figure out the spacing and what works. For the most part, it felt good to have the starting unit back out there,"" Hayward said. Utah's starters had played only 12 minutes together all season before this game.","400899931"
"PHOENIX --  The young Phoenix Suns might be pushovers to some in the NBA. On Thursday night, they sought to be the aggressors. It worked in the second half, as the Suns showed grit on both offense and defense in beating the Toronto Raptors 99-91. Eric Bledsoe scored 22 points, Devin Booker had nine of his 19 in the fourth quarter, and the Suns held the Raptors to 40 percent shooting. The Raptors, in second place in the Eastern Conference, lost consecutive games for the first time since Nov. 20 and 21.  Both teams played the second of back-to-back games. ""A lot of teams or coaches say, `If they hit us, we have to sustain that hit and come back.' Our thing is, let's be the first one to hit,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""We came out in the third quarter and did a great job."" The Raptors trailed for most of the second half and cut a 14-point deficit to 90-85 on a layup by DeMar DeRozan with 3:25 to play in the fourth quarter. But the Suns hung on, winning for just the second time in eight games. They have won back-to-back home games for the second time this season. DeRozan and Kyle Lowry scored 24 points apiece for the Raptors. Booker made a layup and a free throw, then a 3-pointer on the next possession to give the Suns a 96-85 lead with 1:51 to play. The Raptors were too far behind to catch up. ""I'm not shooting the best,"" said Booker, who went 6 for 19, ""but I just stick with it. My coach still trusts me, my team still trusts me."" With the Raptors struggling at both ends, Phoenix went up 72-58 on Booker's layup with 46 seconds left in the third quarter. T.J. Warren's 10-foot floater at the buzzer had the Suns in front 76-62. ""A lot of it is mental. We catch ourselves standing, we catch ourselves playing in mud,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""Playing in mud for three quarters."" The Suns led 12-4 and the Raptors started the game shooting 1 for 10. But Toronto went on a 14-4 run over the last 5:04 of the first quarter and led 18-16 when it ended, despite making just 6 of 18 shots. TIP-INS Raptors: F Patrick Patterson left the game in the first half with a strained left knee and did not return. He played 8 1/2 minutes and did not score. ""I just know I felt a sharp jolt pain in my knee and after that I tried to run it off, but it wasn't happening,"" Patterson said. ... F DeMarre Carroll started back-to-back games for the first time this season. The Raptors played their sixth back-to-back set. ... The Raptors are 5-19 against Phoenix since Dec. 26, 2004. Suns: G Tyler Ulis matched his season and career high with 10 points in 15 minutes. ... The 40 points were an opponent season-low allowed by the Suns in a first half. ... F Jared Dudley missed his third straight game, not playing per coach's decision. FIESTA TIME With the Fiesta Bowl college football playoff game two days away, Clemson coach Dabo Swinney attended Thursday night's game. His Tigers face Ohio State in nearby Glendale, Arizona. ASSIST MAN Bledsoe had 10 assists, two on lobs for dunks. He fed Chandler for one in the first quarter and Marquese Chriss for another in the fourth, the latter giving the Suns a 78-65 lead. BIG BLOCK Watson and Bledsoe made mention of a key blocked shot by center Alex Len early in the fourth quarter that energized the Suns and many in the sellout crowd. Len dismissed a dunk attempt by Pascal Siakam, and the play resulted in one of Toronto's 19 turnovers.","400899932"
"LOS ANGELES --  Victories have been elusive for the Dallas Mavericks of late, unless they happen to be playing the Los Angeles Lakers. The Mavericks can beat the Lakers, as they showed again Thursday night with 101-89 victory. The Mavs have won only 10 games this season, but two have come against the Lakers. That should come as no surprise, with Dallas now having beaten the Lakers 12 consecutive times. ""Wins here are difficult to come by,"" said Mavs coach Rick Carlisle. ""We're a very humbled group, for obvious reasons."" Dallas pulled off Thursday's victory with a third quarter that devastated the Lakers, outscoring them 31-13. Wesley Matthews scored 20 points to lead the Mavericks, including 16 points in the decisive third quarter. ""Matthews' big second half really keyed us,"" Carlisle said. ""His shot making energized our defense even more and guys kept finding him."" The Lakers lost for the 14th time in 16 games. ""I really thought we had turned the corner a little bit,"" said Lakers coach Luke Walton. ""It's disappointing to see we had the same type of result again in a similar game in what we've seen the last week or two. ""I'm still confident our group is going to get it. Unfortunately, it seems like we're going to have to take a lot of these lumps before it really kicks in."" The Lakers led 27-26 at the end of the first quarter and 57-50 at the half. They were still up 65-60 in the third quarter when Matthews ignited a 21-5 Dallas run. Harrison Barnes had 17 points and nine rebounds, and Dwight Powell and Devin Harris each scored 14 points off the bench for Dallas. ""One thing we've struggled a little bit with is playing with the lead,"" Matthews said. ""We know what (the Lakers) are capable of and we know they've had some pretty good wins this season. We just were grinding."" The Mavs forced 15 turnovers, which equaled the amount of assists the Lakers managed. After the Lakers fell behind, they too frequently reverted to going 1-on-1. ""Tonight we did for sure,"" Walton said. ""When we are at our best, that's not the case. We kept trying to get it all back in one play."" Julius Randle scored 18 points and Nick Young had 17 for the Lakers. TIP-INS Mavericks: Forward Dirk Nowitzki missed the game with a fever. ... Guard Jose Juan Barea was out with a left leg muscle strain. ... Barnes continues to emerge for the Mavs, having led them in scoring in 17 of their first 31 games. Lakers: Journeyman forward Thomas Robinson, signed as a free agent in September, continues his recent roll of valuable minutes. He scored a season-high 10 points Tuesday and in his last four games has shot 72.2 percent (13 of 18). .. Assistant coach Mark Madsen remains out following his appendectomy Tuesday. YOUNG ENOUGH Young hit his first six shots, including his first five 3-pointers, before missing his final two shots. He did not score in the fourth quarter. ""We just got outside ourselves,"" Young said. ""We weren't looking to pass the ball. A lot of 1-on-1 in the second half. That's weak basketball."" POWELL IMPACT The third-year forward out of Stanford made 7-of-9 field goals, and added six rebounds to go with his 14 points in 14 minutes. ""Dwight was terrific,"" Carlisle said. ""He was making a huge impact with rolls to the basket.""","400899933"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Paul George took out his frustrations on the Chicago Bulls, and the Indiana Pacers finally had some fun Friday. It's about time. George scored 32 points including 11 during a closing flurry to help the Pacers snap a four-game losing streak with a 111-101 victory. ""We have a great time in the locker room,"" George said. ""I was questioning my team to show that on the court."" They did one day after the three-time All-Star acknowledged publicly he hasn't had much fun this season. So less than two hours before tipoff, coach Nate McMillan offered a solution -- keep the focus on basketball. George &amp; Co. made it work all night. They started fast, making their first seven shots, closed it out by scoring nine of the last 11 points and in between mostly kept the Bulls an arm's length away. George was 10 of 20 from the field and was 9 of 9 from the free-throw line. And there was plenty of help to go around. Myles Turner scored 15 points despite getting into foul trouble, and Jeff Teague had seven points and a career-high 17 assists. ""We had a little more energy, just talking to each other and smacking each other on the back,"" Teague said. ""We've got to continue to play like we did tonight."" Jimmy Butler scored 25 points and Dwyane Wade added 20, but the Bulls never quite figured it out after facing an early 20-8 deficit. They didn't closer than three until Michael Carter-Williams' three-point play finally tied the score at 95 with 6:03 to go. After tying it again at 97, George answered with three free throws and a layup to give Indiana a 102-99 lead that it never relinquished. ""We didn't get stops early or late,"" Butler said. ""Our play at the very end was frustrating because we came all the way back. Credit Paul George, he's a heck of a player and can definitely finish."" TIP-INS Bulls: Despite having seven turnovers in the first quarter, Chicago trailed 28-22.  ... Wade left the game with 7:28 to go after appearing to hurt his left wrist after taking an awkward tumble. He returned with 4:07 to go. Even before the game, coach Fred Hoiberg wouldn't commit to using Wade on Saturday. ... Chicago was 6 of 23 on 3-pointers. Pacers: Scored a season-high 62 first-half points to take 62-50 lead. ... The home team has won all four games in this season's series and this was the last scheduled meeting of the season. ... Turner has scored 10 or more points in 13 straight games and now has 22 consecutive games with at least one block. ... Glenn Robinson III had 12 points and 10 rebounds. SITTING RONDO Bulls guard Rajon Rondo had a miserable night. He picked up two fouls in the first seven minutes and his third late in the first half. His poor first half, which including more fouls than assists (two) or made shots (zero) combined, earned him a spot on the bench to start the second half. Michael Carter-Williams started in Rondo's place and scored nine of his 12 points in the final two quarters. ""Nothing surprises me in this league,"" Rondo said. ""I'm a veteran, I'm a professional. I will always prepare well with the expectation to play and contribute."" THE HOT SEAT? Before the game, Hoiberg was asked about a report from earlier this week suggesting his job may be in jeopardy. The second-year coach tried to shrug off speculation by noting all he really wanted to do was put together a game plan that would help the Bulls play more consistently -- and win some games.","400899934"
"WASHINGTON --  Without Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards coach Scott Brooks was just hoping someone would put up double figures. Trey Burke gave him that and more, scoring a season-high 27 points off the bench as the Wizards beat the Brooklyn Nets 118-95 on Friday night to win their third consecutive game and reach .500 for the first time this season. John Wall had 19 points and 14 assists for his eighth double-double in nine games, but this was Burke's show as the 24-year-old made his first seven shots and scored 20 in the first half. ""We needed somebody,"" Brooks said. ""Trey just had an amazing night. ... He played very controlled. He had a nice rhythm, the guys were getting him open and he made a couple of tough shots but when you make shots early I think the basket becomes bigger."" Coming off the bench to relieve rookie spot starter Sheldon McClellan, Burke settled himself down with some early free throws and caught fire from 3-point territory. Wall joked that they let Burke sit at his locker by himself at halftime when he was perfect from the floor and the line. Burke has gone into many games this season uncertain of how much he'd play. Not Friday. ""You just got to be ready,"" said Burke, who led a 50-point bench effort. ""Obviously with Brad down I knew I was going to have to come in and be a spark off the bench and be ready to play."" Washington won for the seventh time in nine games and went 10-5 in December to climb into an Eastern Conference playoff position after starting the season 2-8. ""It was a great month we had,"" Wall said. ""We got to let this translate over to the New Year. ... We ended the year the way we wanted to, getting 10 wins for the month and getting back to where we wanted to be."" Brooklyn is nowhere near where it wants to be after its seventh loss in eight games. Coach Kenny Atkinson didn't like his team's energy level or engagement. ""I felt like we should have come in here and played better,"" Atkinson said. ""I don't think we were ready to play. I'll take that on me."" DUNK YOU VERY MUCH Wizards center Marcin Gortat, who was 9 of 17 on dunk attempts coming in, dunked five times in the second half, including a one-handed put-back jam. Gortat finished with 19 points but still isn't getting any support for the slam dunk contest. ""He barely can jump over a phonebook,"" Wall said. ""You see how high he was getting? But it was good to see him dunk today."" BEAL PROGRESSING Even though Beal didn't play against Brooklyn, coach Scott Brooks said it was a ""mild"" ankle sprain for the 23-year-old guard. Brooks said Beal, who's considered day to day, felt better Thursday morning after spraining his right ankle Wednesday night in a victory over Indiana and was making progress. ""Everything is going the right direction with him,"" Brooks said, adding that a Beal returning Monday in Houston hadn't been ruled out. LEVERT FOR THE LONG HAUL Atkinson sees a bigger role for rookie guard Caris LeVert as the season goes on. The 20th overall pick who made his NBA debut this month scored in double figures for the first time Friday, but it's LeVert's wing defense that excites his coach. ""I see an athletic, agile, versatile, and that gives me a lot of hope for him,"" Atkinson said. ""I just love him on the defensive end, the energy he gives. I'm not afraid to throw him on anybody.""

"BOSTON --  Isaiah Thomas had a fourth quarter better than any other player for a team rich in history. Thomas set a club record with 29 points in the fourth quarter, finishing with a career-high 52 points and leading the Boston Celtics to a 117-114 victory over the Miami Heat on Friday night. ""It doesn't seem real. It's crazy,"" Thomas said. ""The fourth quarter, I've never done that before."" Nobody had -- even for the Celtics. Thomas hit six 3-pointers and converted a three-point play in the fourth quarter and broke the franchise record of 24 points in a quarter set by Larry Bird in 1983 and matched by Todd Day in 1995. ""It just felt like I was out there by myself, working on my game in the gym. Throwing up everything and it was going in. It was a special feeling,"" said Thomas, who just set his previous career best 10 days before with 44 points at Memphis. Thomas finished with the fourth-highest total in Celtics history. Bird still holds that mark with 60 points against Atlanta on March 12, 1985. ""It's remarkable,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""That was an ubelievably willful performance -- and we needed it."" Thomas entered the fourth period with 23 points and scored the first 11 of the quarter for Boston. Al Horford and Jaylen Brown were the only Boston players other than Thomas to score in the final period until Marcus Smart hit two free throws to seal it with 6 seconds left. Thomas left between the foul shots and received a standing ovation from Boston fans, who chanted ""M-V-P!"" throughout his run in the fourth quarter. He was 9 for 13 from the field in the fourth period and made all 13 of his free throws in the game. Horford had 21 points for the Celtics. James Johnson scored 22 points for Miami, which has lost four straight and seven of eight. Tyler Johnson and Josh Richardson added 19 points each for the Heat. Miami opened the fourth on an 11-2 run and led 89-84, but the Heat could not stop Thomas down the stretch. When he wasn't hitting from the outside, Thomas drove the lane for layups. ""I'm not sure there was much we could do more,"" Miami coach Eric Spoelstra said. ""He's one of the very best fourth quarter players in this league for that reason. He doesn't shy from the shot in the moment now. Inside half court he feels like is within his rhythm."" Both teams were coming off losses the night before, but didn't show any fatigue in a tight game Friday. The Heat opened the fourth quarter with five straight points to start an 11-2 run, including a three-point play by James Johnson and a dunk on a putback by Gerald Green. Richardson stole a pass and took it in for another dunk that gave the Heat an 89-84 lead with 9:27 to play. Thomas erased the deficit with consecutive 3-pointers, then added another from beyond the arc with 7:14 left to put Boston up 93-89. Thomas wasn't done. He added another 3-pointer to put the Celtics up 101-93 and converted a three-point play with 4:05 left for a 104-98 lead. The Heat rallied with six straight points to tie it again, but Thomas put Boston right back up with a 1:57 left to make it 106-104 and the Celtics held on. TIP-INS Heat: Leading scorer Goran Dragic sat out for the second time in three games with back spasms. ... The Heat outrebounded the Celtics 27-18 in the first half. ... Hassan Whiteside had 17 rebounds in each of the first two meetings against Boston this season. He pulled down eight on Friday and scored 11 points. Celtics: G Avery Bradley was at home with an illness. ""He came down with the latest sickness. He came in and got checked out and we sent him home,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ... Thomas has scored at least 20 points in 18 straight games, the league's longest current streak. CLUB 50 Thomas the first Boston player to reach 50 points since Paul Pierce scored 50 in a double-overtime loss at Cleveland on Feb. 2, 2016. Bird was the last to score 50 in regulation for Boston on Nov. 10, 1989, against Atlanta. ""My teammates just wanted me to make plays. They kept setting screens and calling plays for me,"" Thomas said. ""They were saying, `Go 60!"" Thomas also came close to the NBA record for scoring in the fourth quarter -- 31 scored by Wilt Chamberlain in his 100-point game against the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962. ICING DOWN The rest of the Celtics celebrated Thomas' accomplishment in the locker room by dousing him with a bucket of ice water, which he said was another first and he hoped would be the last. ""They got me and they got my youngest son. He's over there freezing. I never experienced that,"" he said. ""That wasn't cool.""","400899936"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis is scoring less lately and couldn't be happier about it. Davis had 23 points and 18 rebounds, and the New Orleans Pelicans won their fourth straight game, 104-92 over the New York Knicks on Friday night. ""I could score two points and if we win, that's fine,"" Davis said. ""Everybody knows their role by now. Everybody's playing very well. We're just playing for each other and playing together."" There have been 10 games this season in which Davis scored between 31 and 50 points in a loss. His high is 28 points during New Orleans' current winning streak. ""It's been fun for us. Guys are making shots and guys are making the right passes,"" Davis said. ""We have guys who are able to get their shots and defenses are confused now because everybody's making shots.

New Orleans had six players score 10 or more, including rookie Buddy Hield and reserve guard E'Twaun Moore with 12 apiece. Carmelo Anthony had 26 points and 13 rebounds, but couldn't prevent the Knicks from dropping their third straight. ""We've got to kind of re-evaluate kind of where we're at as a team right now,"" Anthony said. ""The different kind of schemes that we're seeing against us, we've got to be able to adjust to that and react to that. We've just got to play better. And just defensively I think we've got to get in synch a little bit more."" Kristaps Porzingis had 21 points and 12 rebounds, but the Knicks shot just 37.6 percent (35 of 93). Derrick Rose added 20 points -- one of only three Knicks to score more than eight points. But Rose didn't sound as concerned with the Knicks' offense as how they played on the other end. ""I don't even want to talk about offense,"" Rose said. ""If we came out and played defense I think it would be a totally different game. I mean, we're giving them everything -- 3-point line, pull-ups -- I mean, whatever they want."" SMALL BALL With Davis at center in relatively small lineup that has worked well for the Pelicans lately, New Orleans pushed the pace from the outset, scoring 30 fast-break points and shooting 44.7 percent (38 of 85), including 12 of 29 from 3-point range. Playing that way also allowed the Pelicans to switch who was defending whom quickly and often, which seemed to disrupt the Knicks' rhythm. ""We were doing a really good job defensively and we were switching everything,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. The Pelicans led by 68-53 after a 13-0 run early in the second half during which the Knicks missed 11 straight shots, including four misses by Anthony. Derrick Rose made a difficult driving layup as he was fouled by Davis. That briefly stunted New Orleans' momentum, and the Knicks pulled as close a seven points late in the third quarter when Justin Holiday's 3 made it 76-69. Solomon Hill responded with his second 3 of the game to make it 79-69 heading to the fourth quarter. Statistically, the Knicks were virtually doomed at that point, falling to 1-14 when trailing after three quarters. ROSE-COLORED LENSES Although Rose sounded disgusted with the way the Knicks have played during their skid, he offered an even-handed perspective when asked about the Kicks being .500 through 32 games. ""Don't get me wrong. We're blessed to be in this position, but we've got to catch ourselves,"" Rose said. ""We're slipping."" TIP-INS Knicks: Shooting guard Courtney Lee, who is averaging 10 points per game this season, missed his second straight game with a sore right wrist. ... Joakim Noah was limited by early foul trouble and also had trouble guarding Davis. Noah did not score in 16 minutes of action. ... The Knicks fell to 0-2 on their three-game trip and 5-11 away from Madison Square Garden. Pelicans: New Orleans went 4-1 on a five-game home stand that began last week. The Pelicans play six of their next seven on the road, where they have gone 4-11 this season. ... The Knicks were the first of 11 straight Eastern Conference opponents for the Pelicans.","400899937"
"HOUSTON --  The Los Angeles Clippers entered their game against the Houston Rockets without star point guard Chris Paul and by halftime they were down another point guard and coach Doc Rivers. James Harden had a triple-double with 30 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists and the Rockets rolled to a 140-116 victory Friday night. Clippers guard Austin Rivers and father/coach Doc Rivers were both ejected in the second quarter as Los Angeles dropped its fifth straight. ""(The Rockets) played great and it's a shame that how beautiful they played will be marred by this crap,"" Doc Rivers said. ""Because they played great and we didn't play well."" It's the seventh triple-double this season for Harden and his third straight 30-point game. Montrezl Harrell added a career-high 29 points to help Houston win its third in a row. Raymond Felton had a season-high 26 points to lead the Clippers. The Rockets had allowed what was once a 25-point lead to dwindle to six points early in the fourth quarter before scoring the next 13 points to make it 126-104 with just under seven minutes remaining. Harrell made six points to power that run and the Clippers went more than four minutes without scoring. ""They made some big shots and tough shots and got it to six,"" Harden said. ""We handled our business, made some shots and got some stops when we needed to and finished the game off."" The Rockets had an 18-point lead later in the quarter when Harden hit Harrell with a bounce pass and he made the layup before crashing to the court to give Harden his 10th assist. The younger Rivers was tossed after missing a layup and slightly pushing referee J.T. Orr with 6:38 left in the second quarter. He yelled at Orr and waved his arms at him after the ejection and was led off the court by a Clippers employee. When he got to the edge of the court, he tried going back toward the referee and had to be held back by the employee and pulled off the court. Austin Rivers said the contact with the official was an accident. ""I would never put my hands on a ref. I have never done anything like that in my career and it was frustrating to me because he happened to be right behind me,"" Austin Rivers said. ""He knows I didn't touch him like that ... he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and unfortunately it cost me the game ... and it was a big deal for our team me going down."" During a timeout a few seconds later, Doc Rivers walked toward where all three referees were standing and began yelling at them. He was then ejected by crew chief Jason Phillips. The Rockets led 59-35 when the elder Rivers was ejected. Phillips said that Rivers was ejected for using ""extreme profanity"" while complaining about his son being ejected. But Doc Rivers said that wasn't the case and that he called the timeout because they saw an official call a foul on a layup Marreese Speights made on the play before the timeout, but didn't give them the free throw. ""I said: `No you forgot to give us the free throw,"" Doc Rivers said. ""I said: `Come on you guys don't know what you're doing.' That was it."" It was the second time the pair has been tossed in the same game after they were both ejected late in a loss to the Washington Wizards on Dec. 18. The coach has been ejected three times this season and it's the fourth career ejection for his son. TIP-INS Clippers: J.J Redick returned after missing two games with a sore left hamstring. He had eight points. ... DeAndre Jordan had 20 points and 13 rebounds. Rockets: Beverley returned after missing one game with a bruised thigh. ... Houston attempted a season-high 43 free throws. ... Harrell has scored at least 10 points in four of the last five games. ... The Rockets have scored at least 120 points in three straight games and 13 times this season. CASSELL HONORED Los Angeles assistant coach Sam Cassell was honored as part of a season-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Rockets between the first and second quarters. Cassell was drafted by Houston in 1993 and helped the Rockets to consecutive NBA titles in his first two seasons. A highlight video was played on the Jumbotron along with Cassell's memories of his time with the Rockets. Cassell received a standing ovation when he was shown on live on the screen and welcomed back to Houston. Clippers coach Doc Rivers shook hands with Cassell after that before Beverley ran over and fist-bumped him before play resumed. PAUL'S HEALTH Austin Rivers started Friday with Paul out with a sore left hamstring. Paul missed three games with the problem before returning Wednesday night against New Orleans. He played 31 minutes in the loss and Doc Rivers said Paul experienced some fatigue after that game. It's unclear how long Paul will sit out.","400899938"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Timberwolves and Milwaukee Bucks have two of the most promising groups of young stars in the NBA. Minnesota's core shined just a little brighter Friday night Andrew Wiggins scored 31 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 18 points and 16 rebounds to help the Timberwolves beat the Bucks 116-99. Zach LaVine added 24 points and Shabazz Muhammad had 22 points in 18 minutes off the bench for the Wolves, who shot 55.8 percent from the field and hit 13 of 25 3-pointers. LaVine hit 6 of 9 from deep and Muhammad made 4 of 5 3s to help the Wolves outlast Milwaukee. ""We want to show that we're the better team with the better young players,"" LaVine said. ""But you've got to respect your opponent at all times. They have great players like we do, but at the end of the day I'm glad we came out with the win."" Giannis Antetokounmpo had 25 points, seven rebounds and five assists for the Bucks, who played the first of at least two games without starting point guard Matthew Dellavedova because of a strained hamstring. Jabari Parker scored 20 points for Milwaukee. Parker and Antetokounmpo combined to make 19 of 28 shots, and the Greek Freak had a breathtaking swat against LaVine with the two youngsters one-on-one in the open court. The Wolves were just as dynamic, never more than when Towns swatted a shot from Greg Monroe, sprinted the length of the floor and dunked a lob from Wiggins for an 82-66 lead in the third quarter. And Wiggins put the game away with a soaring dunk over Miles Plumlee in the fourth quarter. ""I'd rather lose to the Bulls than lose to this team,"" Parker said about the 11-22 Wolves. ""It's not against them, but we've got to win these games. We got to. If we want to be good we've got to win these games."" TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee entered the night leading the league in points in the paint at 50.5 per game. The Bucks outscored Minnesota 54-48 in that category on Friday night. ... Michael Beasley scored 12 points off the bench against his former team. Timberwolves: Towns had his 23rd double-double of the season, fourth-most in the NBA. ... LaVine had his eighth game with at least five 3s. Only Stephen Curry (10) has more. ... The Timberwolves honored usher Arlene Pitts on her last night before retirement. She has worked Timberwolves games for 23 seasons. SHABAZZ SHINES When speaking of the Wolves' youngsters, Muhammad is rarely mentioned these days. He's struggled mightily on the defensive end, which has made it difficult for him to earn the confidence of coach Tom Thibodeau. But he finally broke out on Friday night, scored 10 of his 22 points in the first quarter and hit his first four 3-pointers to give the Wolves a huge lift one game after their bench managed just eight points in a loss at Denver. ""It's relieving to have one of those performances,"" Muhammad said. ""I can definitely build on this one."" BIG SHOT The Bucks were charging in the fourth quarter, having whittled a 19-point deficit down to 12 when the Wolves inbounded the ball with just 0.3 seconds on the shot clock. LaVine got room, caught the pass and quickly fired a shot that went through, but officials initially ruled a shot clock violation. After a review, it was determined that LaVine did get the shot off in time, giving the Wolves a 101-87 lead. BROGDON STARTS Bucks rookie Malcolm Brogdon started for Dellavedova, and coach Jason Kidd said the team would need to make no adjustments with the rookie playing instead of the veteran. Kidd said Brogdon was having one of the two best rookie seasons in the league this year alongside Philadelphia's Joel Embiid. The 24-year-old Brogdon was the sixth pick in the second round out of Virginia. ""He's a special rookie,"" Kidd said. Brogdon had 11 points, four rebounds and four assists.","400899939"
"ATLANTA --  Paul Millsap wasn't in uniform the last time the Atlanta Hawks played the Detroit Pistons. He filled it up Friday night, scoring 26 points to lead Atlanta to a 105-98 victory. That helped the Hawks forget the first time these teams met here four weeks ago, when Detroit walloped Atlanta 121-85 on Dec. 2 in Philips Arena. Millsap missed that game with a thigh contusion. ""We moved the basketball well,"" Millsap said. ""That's who we are; we're an active team, especially at the defensive end."" Kyle Korver scored a season-high 22 points for Atlanta to complement Millsap, who was 9 of 20 from the field to break out of an 11-of-48 shooting slump. The Hawks had 29 assists, and through three quarters limited the Pistons to 37.5 percent shooting as the Hawks built a 74-62 lead. Hawks center Dwight Howard added 10 points and 15 rebounds to help Atlanta forge a 44-43 edge on the boards. Four weeks earlier, he had two points and five rebounds as the Pistons won 54-32 on the boards. Millsap had his hands full with Detroit forward Jon Leuer, who paced the Pistons with a career-high 22 points. Detroit has lost seven of eight, the only win in that span coming Monday over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Korver's three consecutive free throws broke a 21-all tie early in the second quarter, and the Hawks never again trailed nor were tied. Atlanta built a 51-41 halftime lead, and grew the lead to 17 points in the third quarter only to see the Pistons close within 92-88 on Reggie Jackson's layup with 4:17 left in the game. Jackson tied his season high with 20 points. Howard scored seconds later on a one-handed dunk on an alley-oop pass Dennis Schroder. Fouled on the play by Leuer, Howard added the free throw for a seven-point lead. Detroit came no closer than five points from there. ""I think there were two main differences and then a lot of little things,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""Eighteen turnovers ...  and Kyle Korver. We lost him too many times."" TIP-INS Pistons: Starting F Marcus Morris, Detroit's fourth-leading scorer (13.1), did not play because of a sore left knee. Tobias Harris started instead. ... Leuer, who entered the game averaging a career-high 11.1 points, has averaged 18.7 over the past three games. ... Center Andre Drummond had 15 points and 15 rebounds. Hawks: Millsap had six rebounds and five assists. ... Schroder had 17 points and seven assists. ... Reserve PG Malcolm Delaney had seven assists. DROPPING OFF The Hawks frequently sagged into the paint defensively rather than leave Howard alone to block shots (he had just one). It worked. The Pistons were outscored 46-32 inside and made just 16 of 35 shots. Meanwhile, Detroit missed its first 11 3-point attempts Friday before finishing 9 of 31. ""We played a more aggressive coverage tonight, actually a coverage that can give up more 3s, but it helped us,"" Korver said. UPHILL CLIMB Detroit was outscored 11-4 to start the second half and fell behind 62-45. Not even a 36-point fourth quarter was enough to climb out of the hole. ""The start of the half, we can't get down like that,"" said guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, a former University of Georgia star. ""We've got to come out strong. We've got to hit them first.""","400899940"
"SAN ANTONIO --  In the midst of another dispirited effort, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich decided not to yell at the Spurs -- and they responded as he hoped. Danny Green and Tony Parker each had 18 points and San Antonio overcame another listless first half to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 110-94 on Friday night. ""Sometimes I go crazy, sometimes I decide to just sit and let them figure it out,"" Popovich said. ""It just depends on how I'm feeling, how I think the game might go, or who's on the court at the time. Tonight, I wanted them to see what was going on for themselves. They did a good job of it."" The Spurs won their ninth game after trailing by 10-plus points, falling behind by 13 in the first half against the Trail Blazers. San Antonio forward Kawhi Leonard sat out his second straight game with a stomach virus and Portland point guard Damian Lillard missed his third consecutive game with an injured left ankle. Even when Leonard has played, the Spurs' first-half struggles have made things difficult. San Antonio is at a loss to understand why that is. ""I don't know,"" Parker said. ""If I knew, I would not do it. No idea."" Despite the struggles, the Spurs have won four straight and 13 of 15. San Antonio had another sluggish first half, trailing by double digits for 12 minutes and falling behind by 13 points midway through the second quarter. Portland forced 14 turnovers and shot 51 percent from the field through two quarters. ""We've got to do a better job of coming out with more of an edge to the game,"" said Spurs center Pau Gasol, who finished with 10 points and seven rebounds. ""Teams know we've been having the slow starts and they play with confidence. Then we turn it up and win games, but it's something we need to keep in mind going forward so that it's not something that is repetitive or too repetitive."" C.J. McCollum finished with 29 points for Portland. Maurice Harkless and Allen Crabbe were the only others in double figures, with Harkless finishing with 12, and Crabbe 11. The Trail Blazers shot 43 percent in the third quarter after shooting 51 percent in the first half. Spurs reserve Manu Ginobili's second 3-pointer with 3:49 remaining in the third quarter gave San Antonio a 69-67 lead, its first since holding an 11-8 edge 3 minutes into the game. San Antonio had seven 3-pointers in the second half to win their seventh straight at home. LaMarcus Aldridge was held to eight points on 2-for-3 shooting, but Jonathon Simmons added 19 points for the Spurs. Green had six 3-pointers in scoring a season high. ""Today their strategy obviously was they were not going to let LaMarcus go off,"" Parker said. ""In the last two games LaMarcus has been scoring a lot and been playing unbelievable. That's their strategy and other guys stepped up."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard missed his third straight game after playing in the team's first 32. He leads the team in scoring with 27.0 points and in assists at 6.2 per game. ... Portland entered Friday allowing 111.5 points per game and 38 percent on 3-pointers, which are both 28th in the league. ... F/C Mason Plumlee had his streak of two straight double-doubles stopped. Plumlee had eight points and five rebounds. Spurs: Green has 33 games with at least five 3-pointers, the most in franchise history. ... San Antonio finished 2016 at 66-15, its most successful calendar year in franchise history. ... The Spurs are 13-0 when Parker scores in double figures. STILL HELPING OUT After shooting 25 for 32 and scoring 60 points in his previous two games, Aldridge was limited to three attempts against Portland. ""They double-teamed him all the time,"" Popovich said. ""So, you can pretty much take a player out of the game if you do that. So, they decided to do that, and he did a good job getting rid of the ball when he figured it out."" Aldridge only had one assist, but his passes helped set up San Antonio's 11 3-pointers. LEARNING FROM THE MASTER McCollum said he spent the offseason studying film of Parker's mid-range jumper after taking a step to his left away from a defender. The shot helped McCollum shoot 10 for 19 against the Spurs.","400899941"
"DENVER --  The Philadelphia 76ers came up big in the fourth quarter a night after collapsing in the final 12 minutes. Ersan Ilyasova had a career-high 23 points and 13 rebounds and the 76ers survived a flurry in the final seconds to beat the Denver Nuggets 124-122 on Friday night. ""I feel like the trip has been rewarded with a win and us having the ability to finally close out a game and finish off the fourth period,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Joel Embiid returned after sitting out Thursday's loss in Utah to score 23 points and hit key free throws down the stretch. The Sixers ended their four-game trip with just their third win away from home despite having just nine available players. They had a chance to win the other three games on this trip but consistently faltered in the fourth quarter. The Jazz outscored them 30-9 to end Thursday's game, and the Sixers went over the tape of the period Friday morning. The attention to detail paid off. ""Tonight, that was the emphasis at the end of the third quarter, that's what everybody was talking about,"" Embiid said. ""We focused, we locked in and got the win."" Nikola Jokic had a game-high 25 points for the Nuggets, and Emmanuel Mudiay scored 22. Denver had won four of its last five home games but a bad start led to another defeat. ""I thought our focus at shootaround (Friday) was not great,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""And I think that when you win a few games you start to feel pretty good about yourself and you forget why you have been winning games."" The Nuggets had a chance to tie it during a frantic ending. After Embiid hit two free throws to put the Sixers up four, Jokic was fouled on a 3-point attempt. Jokic made the first two free throws and intentionally missed the third. Denver's Gary Harris grabbed the rebound but missed a short bank shot, and Kenneth Faried's tip-in try was off as time expired. ""Jokic did a great job missing, I got a shot up and we had a chance for a tip-in, but it just didn't go our way,"" Harris said. The Nuggets pulled within 114-113 with 1:43 left, but Philadelphia's T.J. McConnell hit his third 3-pointer of the night -- matching his total makes for the season. He finished with 17 points and eight assists. Four straight foul shots by Denver tied it, but Embiid split a pair of free throws to put Philadelphia ahead by one. He then stripped Jokic on the other end as the center went up for a go-ahead layup and drained two more free throws to put the Sixers ahead 120-117 with 15.9 seconds left. TIP-INS Sixers: Sergio Rodriguez sprained his left ankle in the loss at Utah on Thursday and did not play Friday. ... Richaun Holmes was not with the team and is in concussion protocol. ... G Gerald Henderson missed his second straight game with left hip soreness. Nuggets: Wilson Chandler (right neck sprain/strain) and Jamal Murray (groin soreness) both played. ... Jokic has scored in double figures in 12 of his last 14 games. CENTER OF ATTENTION Nuggets big man Jusuf Nurkic played 18:33 after not playing in four straight games and averaging just 6:16 in three other games. Nurkic expressed his disappointment after practice Thursday, telling The Denver Post, ""I'm not here to sit on the bench; I'm here to play basketball."" Malone said before Friday's game he had no problem with Nurkic's sentiments. ""Nurk's been great,"" Malone said. ""I understand guys want to be out there. They're competitive. You want them to be competitive. Just make sure you're being a good teammate.""","400899942"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- The way Kevin Durant does it all on both ends for Golden State, triple-doubles will certainly come. They might not be flashy, and coach Steve Kerr might not even notice as the numbers accumulate. Durant, either. He notched his first triple-double since joining the Warriors with 19 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists and his first in more than a year, leading a 108-99 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. ""I thought he already had one,"" teammate Draymond Green said. KD's eighth career triple-double was his first since Dec. 10, 2015, against Atlanta. Klay Thompson scored 17 of his 29 points in the third quarter and finished with five 3-pointers, and Stephen Curry added 14 points for the Warriors. ""He's so effortless,"" Thompson said. ""He does everything great. He's going to be huge for us. We expect him to play at that level the whole year. He's been tremendous."" Harrison Barnes, who spent the past four seasons in a key role with Golden State, scored 25 points for Dallas against his old team. In the first quarter, Curry (11,903) passed Purvis Short (11,894) for seventh place on the Warriors' all-time scoring list. Green had 13 points, eight rebounds and seven assists in Golden State's ninth straight home win against the Mavericks, the Warriors' longest streak ever. There was some Curry versus Curry in this one, with Stephen guarding brother Seth Curry and vice versa for short stints. Thompson has 78 3-pointers against the Mavs, his most against any opponent. The Warriors began 3-for-10 from long range but wound up 11-for-33. Durant didn't even have his most efficient shooting night -- 7-for-14 while missing 5 of 7 3s. His stats sneaked up on Kerr. ""It's just who he is. It's just how he plays. He's a great passer. Obviously he can score any time,"" Kerr said. ""He's one of our best rebounders. A triple-double is just a byproduct of who he is."" Durant didn't realize it, either, until he glanced up as he exited the court for good. ""It really means nothing, to be honest,"" Durant said. ""Stats don't really mean anything. At the end of the game, you want to play a great basketball game. ... I felt like I didn't force it. I wasn't looking for it."" Dirk Nowitzki, who had been questionable coming in with an illness, scored 11 points on 3-for-12 shooting in 23-plus minutes for Dallas. ""Once we started kind of getting out and running, it's hard to outscore them,"" Barnes said. Reigning NBA Coach of the Year Kerr, for one, is ready for 2017 given his health issues following complications from two back surgeries last year that still affect him. But he doesn't need to change his routine. Nor his star-studded roster. ""I'm not a resolution guy,"" he said. ""I go to the gym every day -- I don't just go to the gym the first 10 days of January.""

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Marc Gasol tweaked his ankle in the third quarter, and that was it for the night. No big deal for the Memphis Grizzlies, who are used to losing key players to injuries. Mike Conley had 22 points and eight rebounds, leading the Grizzlies to a 112-98 victory over the Kings on Saturday. Conley and Gasol each missed significant chunks of last season, part of a long list of injuries for Memphis, but the Grizzlies still made the playoffs. They showed off their resiliency again while avenging an earlier home loss to the Kings. An ineffective Gasol, who had two points and two rebounds, got tangled up with DeMarcus Cousins. The injury is not considered serious. ""We have a mental mindset, an old-school mentality,"" Conley said. ""We have a toughness that feeds off one another. It's not about one person (on this team). It's about the group."" JaMychal Green made four of Memphis' 17 3-pointers and finished with 18 points. Zach Randolph and Vince Carter each scored 14, and Tony Allen and Troy Daniels had 11 points apiece. The Grizzlies went 17 for 35 from long range in their second straight win. ""Offense was not our problem. We can't give up that many points to a team that averages 95 points per game,"" Sacramento's Garrett Temple said. ""We just can't give up that many 3s and allow them to shoot that well from behind the 3-point line on top of giving up offensive rebounds."" Cousins had 26 points, eight assists and five steals for Sacramento, which has dropped two in a row after winning a season-high four straight. But Cousins was 7 for 18 from the field and had just four rebounds. He also got called for his eighth technical this season in the third quarter. ""You know that makes me happy when I see us getting after it like that (on defense),"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""We were really connected, working with our voices. Guys were backing each other up when there was a breakdown. I thought our leadership was great tonight."" Matt Barnes made five 3-pointers and scored 20 points for the Kings, and Anthony Tolliver and Darren Collison each had 16 points. Conley sparked the Grizzlies in the third, scoring 11 points. Memphis used 11 unanswered points to outscore the Kings 32-22 in the quarter and carried an 82-67 lead into the final period. ""They were a very focused group tonight, and came out and just dominated the game from start to finish,"" said Kings coach Dave Joerger, who was the head coach at Memphis the previous three seasons. ""There was a five-minute stretch where we made a little run in the second quarter, but by-and-large they just lined up and beat us position by position."" IFFY GASOL Even before the injury, it was a difficult game for Gasol. He went 0 for 6 from the field and connected on two free throws late in the second quarter for his only points of the game. Gasol rolled his ankle going for a loose ball in the third and quickly departed for the locker room. It was diagnosed as a sprained ankle and X-rays were negative. ""It hurts, but it's not broken,"" Gasol said. ""It's tender right now so we will take it day to day just like always.""

"CHICAGO --  While it might be a bit premature to compare Giannis Antetokounmpo to LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, Malcolm Brogdon didn't let that stop him. It's easy to see why on a night like this. Antetokounmpo scored 35 points, Jabari Parker added 27 and the Milwaukee Bucks used a huge fourth quarter to beat the Chicago Bulls 116-96 on Saturday. ""He's one of those Kobe Bryant, LeBron James-type players,"" Brogdon said. ""Playing with a guy like that makes it a little bit easier."" The Bucks outscored the Bulls 36-20 in the fourth to break open a tight game and come away with a lopsided win after dropping four of six. Antetokounmpo dazzled with an array of layups and dunks to go with a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first half. He also had nine rebounds, seven assists and a career-high seven blocks in another strong all-around performance. As for the comparison to Bryant and James? ""Let me tell you something. That jumper I hit in the second quarter, I felt like Kobe on that one,"" Antetokounmpo said, smiling. ""But it's great to (have) your teammates compare you to the greats. I think I'm not there yet, but I'm going to work as hard as I can."" Parker scored 18 points in the second half. Brogdon had a triple-double with 15 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds in his second career start with Matthew Dellavedova sidelined by a strained right hamstring. Greg Monroe scored 15 points, and the Bucks beat the Bulls again after pounding them on back-to-back nights two weeks ago. Chicago held out struggling point guard Rajon Rondo, hoping Michael Carter-Williams could provide a spark. But the Bulls lost for the eighth time in 11 games. Jimmy Butler scored 26 points for Chicago, and Robin Lopez added 12 points and 10 rebounds. Dwyane Wade had eight points on 3-of-13 shooting. ""This team (the Bucks), they're as long and athletic as any in the league,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""Obviously, we've had struggles against them in the three times that we've played them. It's an understatement. It's the attention to detail when you have something like that."" PULLING AWAY The Bucks let an 11-point lead in the third quarter shrink to one early in the fourth, but put it away from there. Chicago closed to 80-79 on a 3 by Nikola Mirotic in the opening seconds of the quarter. But Milwaukee responded with a 10-0 run. Antetokounmpo started the decisive stretch by driving for a 3-point play and finished it with a free throw that bumped the lead to 90-79 with 8:33 remaining. RONDO BENCHED One night after being benched for poor play in a loss at Indiana, Rondo didn't even get into the game. The veteran point guard indicated he might ask for a trade if this continues after watching from the sideline on Saturday. ""I'm not surprised,"" Rondo said. ""It has been a tough season for us right now. There have been ups and downs. Certain buttons are being pushed. The Bulls are trying to figure things out."" Carter-Williams had four points and four assists in 25 minutes. Jerian Grant backed him up and finished with five points and an assist in 18 minutes. TIP-INS Bucks: Dellavedova missed his second straight game, and his status for Monday's matchup against Oklahoma City was unclear. With Dellavedova out, Brogdon started his second game in a row. ... C Miles Plumlee sat out with a sprained right index finger. ... Milwaukee outscored Chicago 58-28 in the paint and made 9 of 15 3-pointers. Bulls: Butler has led the Bulls in scoring 25 times. ... Lopez has five double-doubles. ... The Bulls were 10 of 27 on 3s and 20 for 28 at the foul line.","400899945"
"HOUSTON -- Minutes after collecting 53 points, 17 assists and 16 rebounds in his second straight triple-double, Houston's James Harden was asked what it has been like to play in new coach Mike D'Antoni's system. ""It's been a dream so far,"" Harden said. It looked more like a nightmare to the short-handed New York Knicks after Harden powered the Rockets to a 129-122 win on Saturday night. ""It was like NBA 2K numbers,"" New York's Brandon Jennings said, comparing Harden's performance to the video game. ""I just told him afterward to just go and get the MVP and keep balling and doing what he's doing."" Harden became the first player in NBA history to have at least 50 points, 15 assists and 15 rebounds in a single game, according to information provided by the Rockets from the Elias Sport Bureau. He also tied Wilt Chamberlain for most points in a triple-double, set career highs for points and 3-pointers with nine and matched his career best for assists. He passed his previous career best of 51 points on a 3 with 1:16 left, leading to a standing ovation. ""It looked very effortless,"" teammate Ryan Anderson said. ""But it just goes to show how great of a player he is."" Harden has thrived as the point guard in D'Antoni's fast-paced system. He is averaging 28.5 points and an NBA-best 12 assists per game. ""He's an unbelievable player,"" D'Antoni said. The Knicks got within three several times in the fourth quarter, with the last time coming on a layup by Joakim Noah with about four minutes left. Harden responded to Noah's basket with three free throws before dishing to Anderson for a 3-pointer that made it 119-111. Another 3 by Anderson with less than two minutes left extended the lead to 124-113. Harden, who had 30 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in Friday night's 140-116 victory against the Clippers, completed his eighth triple-double this season when he grabbed his 10th rebound with about 10 minutes left in the third quarter. It was his 17th career triple-double and his fourth career 50-point game. The Knicks played without starters Kristaps Porzingis (sore Achilles tendon) and Courtney Lee (sore right wrist) due to injuries. They lost another one at halftime when Carmelo Anthony was sidelined by a sore left knee. He had seven points in the first half. ""I just decided at the last minute to just go out there and play and try to get going and the more I played the (more sore) it got ... I don't think it's that serious,"" Anthony said. Anderson added 25 points for the Rockets, who have won four in a row. Jennings had a season-high 32 points for New York, which has dropped four straight. A 3-pointer by Harden extended Houston's lead to 18 points with about seven minutes left in the third. Jennings then had nine points in a 15-5 run that trimmed Houston's lead to 88-80 with less than four minutes remaining in the quarter. Harden made two foul shots in the final seconds to lift Houston to a 99-92 lead after three. HAPPY BIRTHDAY D'Antoni took a minute out of his pregame talk with reporters to wish his father Lewis D'Antoni a happy birthday. The elder D'Antoni was celebrating his 103rd birthday on Saturday. The coach was asked about the best lesson he had learned from his father. ""Probably how to stay alive,"" he said with a chuckle. Then he got serious. ""There's just so many (lessons) ... just the way he approached life was remarkable,"" he said. THEY SAID IT D'Antoni on the Rockets going 15-2 in December: ""We're good but we need to get a lot better because we've got more aspirations. We've got a lot of things we've got to do."" TIP-INS Knicks: F Kyle O'Quinn sat out because of an illness. ... Willy Hernangomez received a flagrant 1 foul in the fourth quarter after elbowing Anderson in the stomach. ... Derrick Rose finished with 21 points. Rockets: G Patrick Beverley missed the game with pain in his right wrist. ... Friday and Saturday marked the first time Houston had played home games on consecutive days since February 2012. ... The Rockets have scored at least 66 points in the first half of the last four games. ... Eric Gordon added 15 points.","400899946"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  LeBron James and Kevin Love picked up much of the slack with Kyrie Irving sidelined by a hamstring injury. They got some help, too. James scored 17 of his 32 points in the first quarter, and the Cavaliers beat the Charlotte Hornets 121-109 on Saturday night. Love added 28 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland, which played without Irving after the point guard got hurt during Thursday's 124-118 victory over Boston. Jordan McRae, who got the start with Irving out of the lineup, had 20 points, and Kay Felder finished with 13. James was 6 for 7 from the field in the first quarter, including a perfect 3 for 3 from beyond the arc. ""I was just locked in from the beginning,"" James said. ""I had to get off to a good start. Then finding out Kyrie was scratched late ... I just took it upon myself and the team, and we just got off to a great first quarter and it helped us a lot."" James was 12 for 25 from the field in 35 minutes. He also had nine assists and six rebounds. Love scored 15 points in the second, helping Cleveland to a 71-59 lead at the break. The Cavs went 12 for 18 from 3-point range in the first half. ""It was great shooting, good ball movement, taking open shots,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Guys were open, and we found open guys. Kevin did a great job of setting the tone with that 3-point shooting early, and we just continued from there."" Kemba Walker scored 37 points for the Hornets, who had won five of six. Frank Kaminsky added 15 points and Nicolas Batum finished with 13 points and eight assists. Walker had 20 points on 8-for-12 shooting in the second half, but the Hornets couldn't catch the Cavaliers. ""They really just brought the intensity early and we didn't match,"" Walker said. ""We just have to be better. By the time we picked it up, it was kind of too late."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: McRae was 8 for 12 from the field. ""It was big for our team, and it was big for him to let him know what he's capable of doing in this league,"" James said. ""We needed that from him."" ... The Cavs' 71 first-half points were their third-most of the season. . Since James returned to Cleveland prior to the 2014-15 season, the Cavs are 9-1 against Charlotte. Hornets: Walker's 37-point effort marked his 31st game of 30 points or more. The only Hornets player with more such games in team history is Glen Rice with 54. ... Charlotte went 20 for 23 at the free-throw line. . Marco Belinelli missed his fourth straight game with a sprained left ankle. DEFENSIVE STRUGGLES Hornets coach Steve Clifford said he was disappointed with his team's effort on the defensive end of the floor. ""We don't have the firepower to come in here and win 120-115,"" Clifford said. ""We don't. If our defense is going to be like tonight, it's going to be hard to play well consistently. Hopefully, we can learn from it and play better in Chicago.""","400899947"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Closing out games hasn't been a simple task at times for Utah this season. Losing starting point guard George Hill to a first-quarter injury only complicated matters against Phoenix on Saturday night. The Jazz turned to their defense, holding the Suns to just two baskets over the final 6:45 of the fourth quarter en route to a 91-86 victory. Phoenix missed 11 shots during that decisive stretch. The Suns also committed a pair of critical turnovers. It opened the door for Utah to pull away for its third straight win. ""We just got stops,"" Jazz forward Gordon Hayward said. ""We started to lock up on the defensive end. We struggled offensively, but because we were able to guard in the fourth there, we had more opportunities and were able to convert some of them."" Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Hayward added 18 points and nine rebounds to lead Utah. Rodney Hood added 13 points to help the Jazz to improve to 21-13. Devin Booker scored 18 of his 20 points in the first quarter for Phoenix, and Eric Bledsoe added 19 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. The Suns dropped to 10-24. The game featured 20 lead changes and eight ties, until Hayward tipped in a missed basket to put Utah ahead for good. Gobert followed with a pair of dunks to give the Jazz an 89-84 lead with 1:46 left. Phoenix had a chance to force overtime in the final seconds, but Booker missed a 3-pointer with 5.9 seconds remaining. Hayward grabbed the rebound and hit two free throws to seal it. ""It was a battle tonight,"" Booker said. ""I have never been to the playoffs, but if there was anything like a playoff atmosphere, I feel like it was tonight. Low scoring game. Not too many people getting crazy numbers. Just hard, grind-out basketball."" Playing without Hill after a late first-quarter injury, the Jazz turned to their defense in the fourth quarter. Phoenix shot 7 of 22 from the field in the quarter and had 15 points. Utah charged out to a 63-54 lead early in the third quarter behind back-to-back baskets from Gobert and Shelvin Mack. Phoenix cut the deficit to one after Booker capped an 8-0 run with his first basket since the first quarter. But Hood quickly buried a pair of 3-pointers to stop the spurt. The Jazz built up a 76-68 lead with 1:41 left in the quarter when Raul Neto drove for a layup and then stole the ball from Tyler Ulis to set up a second layup less than a minute later. TIP-INS Suns: Booker scored 18 points on 8-of-10 shooting in the first quarter alone. The Jazz held him to two points on 1-of-9 shooting over the final three quarters. ... Phoenix has lost six straight in the series after getting swept 4-0 by Utah a year ago. Jazz: Gobert had his 23rd double-double of the season. He is the first Jazz player to average a double-double through the first 34 games of a season since Al Jefferson did in 2012-13. Gobert has had 19 straight games with 10-plus rebounds this season. ... The Jazz shot 8 of 20 (40 percent) from 3-point range. Joe Ingles led the way with a 3-of-3 effort from distance. HILL OUT AGAIN Hill went to the locker room with 0.6 seconds left in the first quarter after being elbowed in the face by Suns center Alex Len. Hill received stitches for a lower lip laceration and underwent concussion testing. He did not return in the second half. There is no timetable for Hill's return. He exhibited concussion-like symptoms and now will go through the league mandated concussion protocols before he's cleared to play. Hill has appeared in just 13 of 34 possible games because of injuries this season. He missed eight games with a sprained thumb and 13 games with a sprained toe. The veteran guard is averaging a career-best 19.1 points along with 4.2 assists and 3.7 rebounds. Utah coach Quin Snyder praised his team for responding well in Hill's absence. ""I thought we held the line and just continued to battle defensively,' Snyder said. ""It was just a tough contested game really -- every pass, every play.""","400899948"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook and Oklahoma City bounced back nicely from an ugly loss at Memphis. Westbrook had 17 points, 14 assists and 12 rebounds for his NBA-best 16th triple-double of the season, leading the Thunder to a 114-88 victory over the depleted Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night. Westbrook played just 28 minutes as Oklahoma City put away Los Angeles with a big first half. Enes Kanter had 23 points and eight rebounds, and Victor Oladipo added 15 points. The Thunder lost 114-80 to the Grizzlies on Thursday night, with Westbrook going 6 for 19 from the field and committing six turnovers before he was ejected when he was whistled for two technical fouls with 6:41 left in the third. But they managed to turn it around in a hurry against Los Angeles. ""Obviously tonight they were undermanned and without a few key guys,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I thought coming out of the Memphis game there were some things we talked about wanting to do better and I thought we did that tonight."" Oladipo was 4 for 9 from the field and 5 for 5 at the free-throw line in his return from a right wrist injury. ""It was good. The pace was high,"" Westbrook said. ""Vic was wonderful. The opportunity of having another ball handler in the game, being able to carry out different plays for our team, it was good."" The Clippers played without Chris Paul, who was sidelined by a hamstring injury, and Blake Griffin, who is recovering from right knee surgery. Brandon Bass and Marreese Speights each had 18 points, and Austin Rivers finished with 14 on 3-for-11 shooting. Oladipo and Kanter each had nine points in the first quarter as Oklahoma City jumped out to a 33-12 lead. Alex Abrines drilled a half-court shot at the halftime buzzer, giving the Thunder a 69-40 lead at the break. TIP-INS Clippers: C DeAndre Jordan finished with nine points and 11 rebounds. ...

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Nicolas Batum says there is an art to drawing a foul on a 3-point shot. ""It's not easy,"" Batum said with a wide smile. Batum twice drew whistles on 3-pointers en route to a season-high 28 points in the Charlotte Hornets' 123-112 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. Batum was a regular at the foul line Wednesday night, converting 13 of 15 free throws. As a team, the Hornets made 40 of 49 foul shots to snap a two-game losing streak. Batum said he watched others like Kevin Durant and Reggie Miller work to perfect that art of drawing the foul, which includes reading the defender's movements. ""Sometimes it works and sometimes you throw up a really bad shot,"" Batum said. Thunder coach Billy Donovan said Batum just has a good feel and understanding on how to play the game. ""He subtly, very calmly impacts the game,"" Donovan said. ""He lets it come to him. He has a great pace and tempo to his game. Obviously, he's very, very crafty in terms of understanding how to draw fouls. He's a really good passer."" Russell Westbrook had 33 points and 15 rebounds, but fell two assists shy of his 17th triple-double of the season for Oklahoma City. The MVP candidate was assessed a technical foul in the first half after he hit a referee in the head with a ball. After the Thunder called a timeout Westbook was retreating toward the bench and tossed an overhead pass toward the referee, who wasn't looking as the ball hit him in the side of the cranium. Another official came running into the Thunder huddle and called a technical. Westbrook reacted in utter disbelief, putting his hands over his face. Donovan said it was ""unintentional."" Enes Kanter added 22 points, and Victor Oladipo and Steven Adams each had 18 for the Thunder. The Thunder led by one after Kanter hit a 3-pointer from the top of the key to beat the buzzer at the end of the third quarter. But they couldn't sustain the momentum after erasing a double-digit deficit. The Hornets took control with about six minutes left, outscoring the Thunder 22-11 the rest of the way. Kemba Walker, who scored 34 and 37 points in his last two games while making an All-Star push, had nine points in the decisive final quarter. Frank Kaminsky carried the Hornets early, scoring all of 17 points in the first half as Charlotte took a 60-55 halftime lead. TIP INS Thunder: Had beaten the Hornets 11 straight times before Wednesday night. ... Westbrook has 28 double-doubles on the season. Hornets: Marco Belinelli returned to action after missing the last five games with a sprained left ankle. ... Roy Hibbert was called for a technical foul in the third quarter after exchanging words with Oklahoma City's Steven Adams. A BETTER FINISH Before the fourth quarter, the Hornets gathered together in a huddle making sure they were all on the same page heading down the stretch. ""The fourth quarter has been an issue for us defensively and we really wanted to play as well as we can,"" Walker said. ""We did a good job. We wanted to clamp down as best as we can. And we have to continue to be that way."" DEFENDING WESTBROOK Hornets coach Steve Clifford said he felt Michael Kidd-Gilchrist did a solid job defending Westbrook. Even though he had 33 points, Westbrook shot just 10 of 31 from the field. ""There weren't a lot of easy (shots),"" Clifford said. ""I thought Mike played with great discipline and I thought our guys off the ball were great."" Clifford called Westbrook ""the MVP of our league right now.""","400899950"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- The Atlanta Hawks hadn't been able to shake an embarrassing home defeat to Orlando on Dec. 13, when Serge Ibaka and the Magic burned them again and again from 3-point range. This time, Atlanta tightened up on Ibaka and the rest of Orlando's deep shooters, riding a big fourth-quarter run to a 111-92 victory over Orlando on Wednesday night. Ibaka had 29 points in the first meeting but scored just nine points and was 0 for 4 from 3-point range Wednesday night. ""It was important, because they put it on us pretty bad,"" said Atlanta forward Paul Millsap, who had a strong second half and finished with 16 points. ""The point of emphasis was not to let them score 130 points, so defense was definitely a point of emphasis. I think we came out and accepted the challenge."" In the first meeting, Orlando won 131-120 by making 15 3-pointers. On Wednesday, the Magic converted just nine 3-pointers, with a few coming late as they attempted to play catch up. ""We're all aware of what they did in the last game,"" said Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer, whose team has won four straight and nine of 13. ""You go out and make them take more tough shots, more contested shots."" Atlanta led by 15 after three quarters, but then Orlando used a 14-2 run to pull within 88-84 with 7:56 left. The Hawks responded with a 21-5 spurt, including back-to-back 3s by Kent Bazemore and Millsap, that put the game out of reach. The Hawks were balanced on offense with six players in double figures. Point guard Dennis Schroder led the way with 18 points while Dwight Howard had 13 points and 12 rebounds. Bazemore had 17 points. Atlanta shot 54 percent from the field and 53 percent from beyond the arc. ""From the jump, we seemed like we didn't execute completely on the defensive end,"" said Magic forward Aaron Gordon, who tied for a team-high 15 points. ""It kind of bled into our offense and throughout the whole game."" PAYTON'S PLACE Orlando point guard Elfrid Payton got his starting position back Wednesday night after losing it 20 games ago to D.J. Augustin. It seems Magic coach Frank Vogel was looking to send a message to his point guard, and he believes he got through. ""I've been challenging him to raise his game to get himself back in the starting lineup and I thought in the New York game he had one of his best games of the year defensively where needed him most,"" Vogel said. TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta took a 6-0 lead on three consecutive drives to the basket in the first, prompting Orlando coach Frank Vogel to call a timeout 2:13 into the game. ... Howard began his career with the Magic from 2004-2012 and heard it from the fans in the Amway Center each time he touched the ball. This was his first return to Orlando as a member of the Hawks. Magic: Fournier, the Magic's leading scorer, returned after missing the previous five games with a bruised right heel. Fournier, however, did not start. Jodie Meeks, who had a season-high 23 points Monday in a win over the Knicks, remained in the starting lineup at shooting guard.","400899951"
"NEW YORK --  Giannis Antetokounmpo is one of the NBA's most explosive players, as he showed when he leaped from about a step inside the free-throw line to throw down a fast-break dunk. And when he takes his time, he can do special things, too. Antetokounmpo made a turnaround jumper at the buzzer to give the Milwaukee Bucks a 105-104 victory over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. The Greek Freak dribbled for about seven seconds, calmly backing down Lance Thomas before turning and releasing his jumper from the foul line, the ball going in as time expired. ""I was patient,"" he said. ""I knew I could shoot the ball over the top of anybody, anytime. I know he is not going to block my shot, so I just wanted to make sure I take the last shot."" Antetokounmpo finished with 27 points and 13 rebounds, and he gave the Bucks a final possession when he knocked the ball off Derrick Rose and out of bounds with 8.6 seconds left. Officials originally ruled the ball was off the Bucks but reversed the call after video review. Antetokounmpo then handled things himself, hitting his first game-winner of the season. ""He's had some early this season that hadn't gone down, but tonight I thought he got to his strength and he took his time,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""It wasn't a rushed shot and he did the rest."" Carmelo Anthony had 30 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists for the Knicks, who lost their sixth straight. ""We had a big lead in the beginning of the fourth and we just gave it away,"" Thomas said. ""It should've never got to that point."" Greg Monroe had 18 points and nine rebounds for the Bucks, who never led in the second half until Antetokounmpo's basket gave them a third straight victory. ""This game was a must-win game. We needed this win,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""So thank God this one went in."" Milwaukee rallied from a 16-point deficit after a dismal third quarter to take the opener of the home-and-home series. Rose and Mindaugas Kuzminskas each scored 15 points for the Knicks, who seemed to have the game in control after their 35-point third quarter gave them an 87-73 lead. But Antetokounmpo had 12 points in the final 12 minutes, including a steal and dunk that maybe no other NBA player could pull off, when he took off from about a step inside the free-throw line. New York played its third straight game without Kristaps Porzingis because of a sore left Achilles tendon. ""I think we gave this one away,"" Anthony said. ""It's a tough one to swallow."" TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo has at least 20 points in 13 straight games, the longest streak by a Bucks player since Michael Redd had 14 in a row in 2006. ... Rookie Malcolm Brogdon continued his strong stretch with 12 points, eight assists and six rebounds. Knicks: Porzingis hoped to play Wednesday but wasn't able to practice Tuesday and complained that his foot still felt stiff. They hope he can practice Thursday and return in the next game. ... Joakim Noah finished with 16 rebounds despite appearing to injure his shoulder late in the game. TOO CLOSE TO CALL Neither team led by more than four points in the first half, when there were 11 ties and 11 lead changes before they went into the half deadlocked at 52. RIGHT AT HOME IN HOME-AND-HOMES This was the start of the Bucks' fifth home-and-home set since Dec. 1. They also played consecutive games against Brooklyn, Chicago, Cleveland and Washington.","400899952"
"CLEVELAND -- LeBron James was reminded what it's like to be Cleveland's only star. Lonesome and no fun. Jimmy Butler took over in the fourth quarter, scoring 10 straight points during a critical stretch and leading the Chicago Bulls to a 106-94 win Wednesday night over the Cavaliers, who had a less-than-100 percent James and were without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Butler, who was coming off a 52-point game against Charlotte, scored 14 of his 20 points in the fourth as the Bulls held off Cleveland's rally and ended the Cavs' 13-game winning streak with James in the lineup. Butler said Dwyane Wade, who returned to his hometown this summer, encouraged his new teammate to take control. ""The guy who wears No. 3 on this team came to me and was like, `Win the game,"" Butler said. ""So I guess a switch cut on. I knew I was going to have to do that in the fourth anyway, but with him telling me that, you can't let D-Wade down. ""He's been doing it for years. It was my time to step up."" James, who has been battling a head cold for several days, was questionable until about 20 minutes before the game, when the Cavs announced he would be the one -- and only -- member of Cleveland's ""Big 3"" in uniform. He finished with 31 points, eight rebounds and seven assists in 37 minutes. James was forced to go it alone as Irving missed his third straight game with a hamstring issue that appears to be more serious than first diagnosed and Love is still recovering from a nasty case of food poisoning. James said there was never any question he would play. ""If I can walk, I can go,"" he said, ""unless coach tells me to sit down. My plan was to play."" But without Irving and Love, the Cavs didn't have enough firepower to slow the Bulls, who got 17 points from Doug McDermott and made a season-high 13 3-pointers. The Bulls made just 1 of 8 3s in the first quarter before finding their range. They dropped 11 of their next 14 and built a 15-point lead when James went to the bench with 3:30 left in the third quarter. But Cleveland's reserves cut Chicago's lead to four when James returned with 8:49 remaining. He made two straight layups to pull the Cavs within 89-88 and was driving for the go-ahead bucket when Butler stepped in front of him in the lane and drew a charge. ""He's coming at you full speed, that's the right play to make,"" Butler said. ""It could go either way, obviously. You've got to brace yourself. I got all my pads here somewhere. We've got all of that for a reason."" James didn't argue about the foul. ""It was a good call,"" James said. Butler then hit a 3-pointer on the next possession, and Cleveland never got closer than eight and had its home winning streak ended at nine. ROAD AHEAD The Cavs are set to embark on a season-long, six-game road trip. James was asked if it's coming at a good time with the injury and illnesses. ""I don't know until we know who's active,"" he said. ""I don't know if it's going to be a good time or not until we know who's active and who's playing. See what happens."" WADE'S KNEE Wade scored 10 points in 27 minutes after missing Monday's game with a swollen left knee. He said it feels better but the team will monitor him closely. ""This is a grueling month,"" Wade said. ""We have four back-to-backs. We want to play it smart, find gaps, find days to get through it."" TIP-INS Bulls: Starting PG Rajon Rondo didn't play for the third straight game amid talk that he could be traded. ... Chicago came in leading the league with 13.7 offensive rebounds and grabbed 12.

"LOS ANGELES --  Usually coach Doc Rivers replaces his son at a certain point in the game. Austin Rivers wouldn't let him. The younger Rivers scored a season-high 28 points while playing a game-high 44 minutes and helped rally the Los Angeles Clippers from a 12-point deficit in the third quarter to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 115-106 on Wednesday night for their second win in a row. ""We couldn't take him out. He was rolling and we needed points,"" the elder Rivers said. ""As Raymond (Felton) said, `He's the 24-year-old out here.""

Jordan missed a pair of free throws but got bailed out by Crawford's 3-pointer that kept the Clippers ahead, 100-96. The Grizzlies were limited to two field goals in the final 4:19. They have lost four of six. The Clippers snapped a six-game skid Monday against Phoenix but they were in a close game early against the Grizzlies and fell into a 13-point hole in the second quarter. Memphis led by 12 early in the third before the Clippers engineered a dramatic turnaround. They ran off 11 consecutive points, including seven by J.J. Redick, to close to 73-70. Redick finished with 19 points. From there, Austin Rivers took over. He scored seven in a row before Jordan's three-point play on a dunk and free throw. Crawford had seven of the Clippers' final nine points to give them an 89-85 lead heading into the fourth. Redick scored 10 points during the spurt, which brought the crowd back into the game. ""We needed to have a little bit more fight, more aggression,"" Jordan said. ""We were attacking and when we do that, we're pretty good."" Memphis built a 13-point lead in the second when the Grizzlies closed on a 26-13 run for a 63-53 halftime lead. Four players hit 3-pointers in that span. TIP-INS Grizzlies: C Deyonta Davis (left foot), F JaMychal Green (maxilla fracture), G Chandler Parsons (rest) and F-C Brandan Wright (left ankle) sat out, leaving the Memphis bench thin. Green sustained his facial injury against the Lakers a night earlier. Clippers: Paul had a full workout and went up and down the court during practice. Doc Rivers said if Paul doesn't have any soreness on Thursday he could return Friday at Sacramento. ... Jordan had 20 rebounds for the second straight game. ... Rookie F Brice Johnson (acute herniated disk in lower back) also played at practice and was moving well. BIG BOARDS Jordan grabbed at least 20 rebounds for the fifth time this season, most in the NBA. He has 35 such games in his career, good for second among active players behind Dwight Howard (72). Jordan is tied with Shaquille O'Neal for 10th overall since 1983-84. CROWD NOISE Clipper Darrell, the team's longtime super fan, got the attention of Vince Carter when he did his ""you're ugly"" chant as James Ennis III was at the free throw line in the second quarter. Carter turned and stared at Darrell, pointed and shook his head. Later, Darrell shouted, ""Hey Vince, I love you,"" before Carter missed two free throws. ""We're friends,"" Carter said. ""I was just giving him some play.""","400899954"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry marvels at Kevin Durant's efficiency: 30 points on 16 shots in his latest outing. KD finds plenty of things in the MVP's game to praise, too. And when these two get clicking together, the Golden State Warriors are oh so good. It just took a while Wednesday night. Curry had 35 points with five 3-pointers, Durant added three more blocked shots and the Warriors held off the Portland Trail Blazers 125-117. ""It's pretty special, I didn't realize it at first,"" Curry said of KD's ability to light up a stat line on minimal shot attempts. ""He's a super-efficient player and he takes pride in that."" Zaza Pachulia scored 13 points to hit double figures in consecutive games for the first time this season, just his fourth time reaching double digits for Golden State. He also matched his career high with three blocks in the Warriors' ninth straight home win. CJ McCollum scored 35 points to lead a Portland team still without Damian Lillard, and the Trail Blazers certainly had to feel better about hanging tough in this one after their forgettable 45-point defeat here 2 1/2 weeks earlier. Curry shot 12 for 25 on a night Splash Brother Klay Thompson struggled to find his stroke from long range, going 1 of 7 and scoring 14 points. Coming off a triple-double, Draymond Green had 11 assists, nine points, seven rebounds, three steals and a late block with five fouls. Durant was dominant on both ends, especially during one spectacular sequence late in the first. He made a pretty driving lay-in and converted a three-point play at the 2:50 mark, blocked two shots in succession moments later -- one against McCollum then on Noah Vonleh's putback try. KD drained a 3-pointer the next time down, and he also had a four-point play in the final minute of the first half. ""He's been amazing, and it's not just rim protection,"" said Green, who challenged Durant ""to fly around"" on defense. McCollum made three of his first six 3s then missed four of five in the second half, when he shot 3 for 12. ""I just missed some shots. It happens,"" he said. ""I had a lot of good looks from 3 that I didn't make and I missed a couple layups. Credit to them, they did a good job defensively."" Four Golden State starters hit 3-pointers among the Warriors' first four baskets before the game was even three minutes old. The Warriors' five straight wins against the Trail Blazers mark their first five-game winning streak versus Portland since winning seven in a row from Feb. 20, 2005 to Nov. 3, 2006. Golden State also has won six straight in the series at home. That includes the blowout victory Dec. 17 -- 135-90 -- for the biggest margin by Golden State in the series and matching the largest point disparity in any game played between the rivals with Portland's 136-91 win on Dec. 22, 1987. KERR'S MESSAGE Already fined $25,000 in November for his remarks on traveling, Warriors coach Steve Kerr shared how he texted Lakers coach Luke Walton on Tuesday night regarding a play by Grizzlies guard Mike Conley. Once he'd said it, he begged NBA president of basketball operations Kiki VanDeWeghe not to penalize him again. ""Mike Conley took like five steps on the play and got an and-1. It was like, `Not only are we going to let you to travel, we're going to give you the benefit of that touch at the end, too.' It's like, `All right, we have to adapt to that,"" Kerr said. ""... So, again, Kiki if you're listening, it's just an observation, it's not a complaint. Don't fine me."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Coach Terry Stotts was hopeful of having his leading scorer return for the second game in a back-to-back Thursday at home against the Lakers. ""He's moving around better,"" Stotts said. ... Already through three of four regular-season meetings with Golden State, Portland hosts the last one Jan. 29. Warriors: Curry and Durant scored at least 25 points in the same game for the 10th time. ... Golden State had its NBA-leading eighth 40-point quarter in the first. ... Durant had the Warriors' second four-point play after Curry's on Nov. 10 at Denver.","400899955"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Tyler Johnson had a modest cheering section on the road Wednesday night and gave relatives and Fresno State fans plenty to cheer about as he helped rally the Miami Heat. Johnson scored 10 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter, including his team's final five, to help the struggling Heat beat the Sacramento Kings 107-102 to snap a six-game losing streak. The Heat squandered a 19-point third-quarter lead and trailed on several occasions in the fourth before Johnson put them ahead 105-102 on a three-point play with 27.8 seconds left. ""It's not a coincidence that his most memorable plays come down the stretch,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said of the third-year guard. ""He's a fearless player, a real competitor."" Johnson, a former Fresno State player, blocked Matt Barnes' shot from close range with just under a minute left. He then came down court and made a floating jumper and was fouled. He hit the free throw to complete the three-point play. ""I was trying to make the shot (by Barnes) difficult, I wasn't really trying to block it,"" Johnson said. The victory was Miami's sixth straight over Sacramento and 16th in 17 meetings. Goran Dragic had 19 points and seven assists for the Heat. James Johnson had 14 points and Wayne Ellington had 13. Miami had dropped nine of its previous 10 games. Reserves Arron Afflalo, Garrett Temple and Ty Lawson each had 15 points for the Kings. Anthony Tolliver had 14 points, DeMarcus Cousins had 13 and Matt Barnes added 10. ""Miami has always been a team and franchise that takes pride in playing great from top to bottom no matter if they have superstar talent or low-level players,"" Afflalo said. ""We expected that coming in, and they did what they had to do."" Trailing by 19 points in the third quarter and looking lethargic, the Kings closed the period with 13 straight points to pull within 87-81 entering the fourth. STRENGTH IN NUMBERS Plagued by injuries for much of the season, it's been a challenge for Spoelstra to find a regular rotation. The challenge Tuesday against Phoenix was overcoming a lack of bench players. The Heat dressed only eight players and lost to the Suns for the first time since Nov. 3, 2009. Hassan Whiteside (bruised right eye) was one of four injured players who were back in Miami. But the Heat did have 11 players, and 10 of them played. ""I got confused, I wasn't used to having that many players on the bench,"" Spoelstra joked. ""I had to actually coach tonight."" LIMITING COUSINS Cousins, who entered averaging 29 points and 10.1 rebounds, was ineffective all game. He missed 11 of 15 shots and had 13 points and six rebounds. ""Basically half our team was on him,"" Spoelstra said. ""We limited his catches in his sweet spots."" TIP INS Heat: Prior to the game, the Heat announced that Justise Winslow will have surgery to repair of torn labrum in his right shoulder. The team expects he will miss the remainder of the season. ... The Heat shot 63 percent and led 64-59 at the half. They finished at 48.6 percent. Kings: Rudy Gay, the team's second leading scorer, sat out for the 10th time in 11 games with a strained right hip flexor. ... Afflalo made all five shots, including three 3-pointers, and had 15 points in 13 first-half minutes. ... The Kings had nine rebounds at the half and didn't get another one until the 8:46 mark of the third quarter.","400899956"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  In one week, the Indiana Pacers have developed something they've been searching for all season -- consistency. Jeff Teague had 21 points, 15 assists and seven rebounds, and Myles Turner finished with 25 points and 15 boards as the Pacers beat the Brooklyn Nets 121-109 on Thursday night for their fourth straight victory. The winning streak began last Friday, when Indiana knocked off Central Division-rival Chicago. In each of the three games since, the Pacers have won by double digits. Through the first 33 games of the season, Indiana won consecutive games only four times. ""I think we're figuring it out right now,"" Teague said. ""I think we know what we want to do. I think we're playing together. It just becomes contagious."" With the halfway point of the long season just four games away, the Pacers realize the magnitude of finding their identity and, most of all, solidifying their team chemistry in hopes of setting up a strong second half. ""It's huge. We lost four in a row, so to win four in a row is huge for us,"" Turner said. ""We've just got to keep the ball rolling and keep the positive momentum going."" Paul George scored 26 points and Thaddeus Young added 10 points and six rebounds for Indiana. The Pacers put their foot down in the third quarter and broke the game open. Indiana (19-18) held a 66-59 lead when it went on an 18-4 spurt that opened a 21-point lead. The Nets clawed their way back, pulling within eight with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but Indiana then stretched its advantage back to double digits. Trevor Booker and Justin Hamilton had 16 points apiece for the Nets (8-26), who fell to 1-17 on the road. Sean Kilpatrick and Sean Dinwiddie each scored 13. Brooklyn has lost four straight and nine of 11 overall. Indiana's largest lead was 22 points. And despite seven-point deficits at the end of the first and second quarters, the Pacers controlled the game most of the way. They led by as many as 13 in the first half, when Teague scored 15 points. The Pacers outscored Brooklyn 52-30 in the paint even though they were outrebounded 45-44. Indiana had 17 points off 13 Nets turnovers and outscored them 15-4 on fast-break points. ""Our first unit didn't have great energy and didn't come out and compete. Obviously, (the Pacers are) on a roll and they're playing great team basketball,"" Brooklyn big man Brook Lopez said. ""They are playing well right now and starting to peak at the right time."" TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn is 3-14 since Dec. 1, allowing its opponent to score more than 100 points in each loss. ... The Nets have dropped four straight at Indiana. ... Brooklyn has lost 14 road games in a row. Pacers: Indiana's 38 points in the third were a season high for one quarter. ... Turner finished one rebound shy of his career high. ... Turner had his sixth double-double of the season, while Teague posted his seventh. START ME UP Indiana's five starters combined for 90 points and were plus-159 while they were on the floor. The bench had one of its worst outings all season, combining for just 31 points and finishing at minus-99. TURNING IT AROUND After losing four straight games at the end of December, Indiana has strung together a four-game winning streak -- and it couldn't have come at a better time. After the Pacers play the Knicks on Saturday night, they'll travel to London to play the Nuggets, then return home to face the Pelicans before heading out on a four-game Western Conference road trip.","400899957"
"TORONTO --  For the second time in two weeks, Kyle Lowry took down the Utah Jazz. The Toronto point guard scored 16 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Raptors to a come-from-behind 101-93 win over the Jazz on Thursday night. Back on Dec. 23, Lowry had 19 of a season-high 36 points in the final period of a comeback victory at Utah. ""Kyle's been doing a great job,"" said Raptors forward DeMarre Carroll, who had eight points and four rebounds. ""He starts the game trying to get other guys involved and then he knows at the end either him or (DeMar DeRozan) have got to close it. ""Kyle stepped in and really took it on his shoulders and kind of willed us to that win."" Lowry, who went 5 for 6 from the field in fourth quarter, including 2 for 2 from 3-point range, also made four of five free throws in the period and added six rebounds and five assists on the night for the Raptors (24-11). DeRozan had 23 points and seven rebounds, while Jonas Valanciunas added 18 points and 13 rebounds as Toronto rallied from a deficit of 11 points in the second quarter. The Jazz (22-15), who led for the first 44-plus minutes, were paced by Rudy Gobert's 15 points and 16 rebounds. Shelvin Mack added 17 points and Gordon Hayward scored 16. It was the second straight loss for Utah, which committed 19 turnovers that led to 27 Toronto points. ""That was a huge part of the game -- that and the offensive glass,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""It's tough to win when you turn the ball over and that's what happened. ""We weren't tough enough with the ball."" DeRozan's 18-foot jumper with 3:44 left gave the Raptors their first lead, 89-88. It was an advantage they never relinquished. DeRozan then took Lowry's feed down the lane for a dunk to extend the lead to three. After a Jazz turnover, Lowry drilled a 3-pointer to put the Raptors ahead by six with 2:43 to go. ""I don't want to get into analyzing how we could guard Kyle Lowry differently. We have to do a better job on him,"" Snyder said. ""Same thing happened to us at home. He's good."" Hayward's 3 and a pair of foul shots by Gobert cut the lead to one before Lowry's driving layup widened the margin. Lowry bounced back from a season-low six points in a 110-82 loss at San Antonio on Tuesday. ""I'll tell you what, if it's a loose ball down there, he's like a little pit bull,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""That's why he's who he is. He's been that way since high school and that's not going to change. ""He took over the game down the stretch."" Lowry hit a 3 with five minutes remaining to cut Utah's lead to 85-84. But on the next trip up the court, Rodney Hood answered with a 3 as the shot clock expired. Utah led 73-71 going into the fourth quarter as the defenses tightened at both ends in the third. Each team barely cracked 30 percent from the field in the quarter. Utah was 7 for 19, the Raptors 6 for 17 as Toronto tied the game for the first time since the opening period. The Jazz took a 52-48 lead into halftime as Mack set the pace with 13 points on 6-for-7 shooting. Gobert added eight points and 10 rebounds in the half. Utah led by as many as 11 early in the second quarter but the Raptors took advantage of some sloppy Jazz play to score 13 points off seven turnovers in the period to cut the margin to 47-46. DeRozan scored Toronto's final six points of the half. ""They got offensive rebounds, they did their job, everybody got in and people just hustled,"" Gobert said. ""We weren't playing good defense. They could just get loose balls and go."" TIP-INS Jazz: G George Hill missed his third straight game due to a lip laceration and concussion-like symptoms. ... Mack scored 10-plus points for the seventh time in his past 12 games. ... Gobert extended his franchise-record streak of games with at least 10 rebounds to 22. Raptors: F Lucas Nogueira had four points, six rebounds and three assists in 26 minutes. He made his second career start in place of rookie Pascal Siakam, who had started all 34 games this season. ... F Patrick Patterson missed his third straight game with a strained left knee. ... Valanciunas had his team-leading 13th double-double of the season and the 90th of his career. RUDY'S REJECTIONS Gobert blocked three more shots to give him 95 this season, tops in the NBA. SCORING SALUTE Raptors fans gave DeRozan a standing ovation during the game's first TV timeout after a scoreboard video montage paid tribute to him surpassing Chris Bosh to become the team's career scoring leader during Toronto's recent six-game road trip. PAINT PRESENCE Toronto outscored the Jazz 12-2 in the paint during the fourth quarter. HE SAID IT ""Turnovers aren't something you work on. You can't go to the gym and practice. We just have to be tougher and more secure with the ball,"" Snyder said.","400899958"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- It was a shot that would have been replayed for years -- if it had actually counted. Instead, Marco Belinelli gets points for creativity, but the Detroit Pistons held on for the win. Belinelli's bank shot from 3-point range was disallowed because it came too late, and his Charlotte Hornets lost 115-114 to the Pistons on Thursday night. With Charlotte down by one, Belinelli was inbounding from the sideline with 0.5 seconds left. He bounced the ball off a defender and back to himself, then quickly released a wild shot that went in off the glass. The basket was waved off immediately, and a video review confirmed that Belinelli hadn't beaten the buzzer. It was close, though. ""It was a good idea by Marco, but with 0.5 seconds left, you probably don't have time to do anything where more than one person touches the ball,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. Kemba Walker scored 20 of his 32 points in the final period, helping Charlotte rally from a 19-point fourth-quarter deficit. Reggie Jackson put Detroit up 115-113 when he made two free throws with 1.9 seconds remaining. Marcus Morris was called for a foul while Charlotte was trying to inbound at the other end, giving the Hornets one free throw and the ball. Belinelli made it to pull Charlotte within one. Jackson knocked the ensuing inbounds pass out of bounds, leaving 0.5 seconds on the clock. Belinelli then tried his tricky move, but there wasn't quite enough time to pull it off. Boban Marjanovic had 15 points and a career-high 19 rebounds, helping the Pistons overcome Andre Drummond's foul trouble. The 7-foot-3 Marjanovic had played only 76 minutes all season, but the Pistons had little choice but to go to him when Drummond was whistled for his second foul with 6:42 left in the first quarter. Backup center Aron Baynes was out with a sprained left ankle. By halftime, Marjanovic had 10 points and 11 rebounds, eight of which came at the offensive end. The Hornets didn't seem ready for the 28-year-old from Serbia, who was able to position himself near the basket and simply reach above other players for rebounds. ""Great, great, great effort,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""Even ran the floor a couple of times for post seals."" Drummond picked up his fourth foul with 10:42 remaining in the third, so Marjanovic came back in and grabbed seven more rebounds by the time that period was over. He finished the game with only four field goal attempts and was 9 of 11 on free throws. ""I (have) good size,"" Marjanovic said. ""They don't allow me to make easy baskets. They put me on free throw line."" Detroit scored the final nine points of the third and led 85-70 after Morris made a 33-footer at the buzzer. Charlotte then scored 44 points in the fourth, and the game came down to the wire. Tobias Harris scored 25 points for the Pistons, and Jackson had 22 points and 11 assists. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte was 5 of 22 from the field in the second quarter but still outscored Detroit 22-21 in the period. The Hornets trailed 58-48 at halftime. ... The Hornets were without 7-footer Cody Zeller, who has been going through the NBA's concussion protocol. Pistons: Detroit had lost eight of 10. ... Morris had 20 points and 10 rebounds. TURNOVERS The Pistons and Hornets came into the game averaging 12 turnovers apiece -- the best marks in the NBA. They combined for 12 in this game -- five for Charlotte and seven for Detroit.","400899959"
"NEW ORLEANS -- Kyle Korver knew he wasn't going to play for the Atlanta Hawks in New Orleans and likely would be wearing a Cleveland jersey the next time he hit one of his signature 3-pointers. Still, he put on his Hawks warmups and stayed on the bench the whole game Thursday night, counseling teammates and rooting them on as they sought a fifth straight victory against a Pelicans team that had won its last four at home. ""To see him on the bench and continue to cheer us on, knowing that he's going to another team -- to me that says a lot,"" Hawks forward Paul Millsap said. ""To continue to support us says a lot about who he is."" Dennis Schroder scored 23 points, Millsap added 17 points and 10 rebounds, and the Hawks beat the Pelicans 99-94 by closing the game on a 14-6 run over the last three minutes. The Hawks declined to confirm that Korver was involved in a trade, which was not official when the game ended, but Korver spoke as if the deal was done. ""There are definitely mixed emotions. There are a lot of heart ties to Atlanta for a lot of reasons. A lot of friendships,"" he said. ""Obviously, it's a great opportunity for me to go to Cleveland, so I'm very excited about that part. ""If there wasn't the emotional connection that I have to Atlanta and the Hawks organization, it would be a different story. From a basketball perspective, (Cleveland) is a great, great fit for me and I know that,"" Korver continued, adding that it would be particularly difficult to lose Millsap as a teammate. ""I've played with Paul for a lot of years,"" Korver said. ""There's mutual respect there, so it's going to be hard not to play with him anymore. I'm going to miss him."" Dwight Howard added 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 14 for the Hawks, who trailed by three after Anthony Davis' dunk with 3:51 left. ""Our team wants to win. We try to keep all the noises from the outside away,"" Howard said, discussing the team's steadiness after hearing Korver was likely done in Atlanta. ""It's tough to kind of keep those distractions out of your mind, but the young guys really held it together and we got a good win. ... We just played harder in the fourth quarter than they did, hit some shots, got some key stops."" Davis had 20 points and 19 rebounds for New Orleans, which has lost its last two. Jrue Holiday added 18 points and Buddy Hield scored 15 for the Pelicans, who shot only 36.6 percent (34 of 93). ""We weren't moving the ball,"" Davis said. ""We just have to move the ball and stop playing 1-on-1. When we play 1-on-1 we get a lot of bad shots."" MAINTAINING COMPOSURE Atlanta matched its biggest lead at 83-76 on Kris Humphries' layup with 7:50 to go in regulation. The Pelicans began to close the gap when Davis converted a two-handed reverse layup of Holiday's alley-oop lob. That started a 12-2 run that included 3s by Holiday and Hield, along with Davis' emphatic dunk that had the home crowd in a frenzy. Hardaway Jr. tied it with a 3, however, and after Hield's miss of a driving layup, the Hawks patiently worked the perimeter until finding Schroder for an open 3 that he buried with 1:13 to go to put Atlanta back in front. Hield missed another driving layup attempt, and Millsap hit an 18-foot jumper to make it a five-point game with 38 seconds left. ""There were a lot of miscommunications, just a lot of mental breakdowns offensively that we can't afford,"" Davis said. TIP-INS Hawks: Malcolm Delaney scored three of his seven points on free throws in the final second of the third quarter after being fouled from behind by Solomon Hill on a transition 3-point attempt that he was trying to get off before the horn in a tie game. ... Atlanta is 2-0 on its four-game road trip and 10-9 on the road overall this season. Pelicans: Terrence Jones had 12 points and 11 rebounds. ... The Pelicans play their next five on the road, where they are 4-12 this season.","400899960"
"HOUSTON -- The Houston Rockets weren't happy to have squandered an 18-point lead, leaving them tied with Oklahoma City with just seconds left on Thursday night. But they were proud of the plays they made at the end of the game to hang on for the win. James Harden scored 26 points and Nene hit two free throws with 0.7 seconds remaining to lift the Rockets to their sixth straight victory, 118-116 over the Thunder. ""There's going to be some close games in the postseason where we'll have to figure ways to close them out, and it isn't always going to be us making shots and it being perfect,"" Harden said. ""We're going to have to get stops sometimes."" Houston overcame Russell Westbrook's 49 points, though the star guard struggled down the stretch. Harden found Nene right under the basket and he was fouled by Jerami Grant as he attempted a shot, setting up the winning free throws. Nene had a season-high 18 points for his 12th double-digit game this season. ""I saw two defenders guarding me and I saw Nene wide open,"" Harden said. ""No matter if it's the fourth quarter with three seconds to go or the first quarter with 10 minutes to go, I'm going to make that pass. And my teammates know that and he was prepared and ready for it."" A pair of foul shots by Harden tied it with just under two minutes remaining. The teams combined to miss seven shots after that, with Westbrook missing three in that span, before Nene's free throws. Westbrook was a bit touchy was asked about his last missed 3-point attempt. ""Did you see what happened? There's nothing to take you through,"" he said. ""I missed the shot."" The Thunder attempted an alley-oop on the inbounds pass after that, but Enes Kanter couldn't finish the play and Houston held on. Westbrook finished two points shy of his season high as Oklahoma City dropped its third straight. Houston was clinging to a four-point lead with about 2 1/2 minutes remaining before Westbrook and Victor Oladipo made consecutive 3-pointers to put Oklahoma City up 116-114. The Rockets had a 14-point lead early the fourth quarter before their offense stalled, and the Thunder went on a 20-7 run to cut the lead to 107-104 with about 5 1/2 minutes left. Westbrook was on the bench for most of that time and Oladipo scored five points during that run before Westbrook returned and capped it with four straight points. Westbrook had 40 points entering the fourth quarter. But he wasn't getting much help from his teammates, with the rest of the Thunder managing just 43 points as Houston led 97-83 after three. ""He played an incredible game and in a lot of ways ... kept us close because we weren't getting a lot of production offensively,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. Westbrook, who finished with eight 3-pointers, made one with about nine minutes left in the third quarter to get Oklahoma City within 10. Houston scored the next eight points to extend the lead to 82-64. Another 3 by Westbrook came after that to end a scoring drought by the Thunder of almost three minutes. Houston had an 18-point lead with about six minutes left in the quarter when the Thunder scored the next eight points to cut it to 10 again. But Houston responded with an 8-2 spurt, with five points from Eric Gordon, to push the lead to 93-77. The Rockets led 67-56 at the break.

""No. It hurt (a lot). Wrist is throbbing right now,"" he said. ""But for some reason every shot I shot felt good. I was able to do the hustle plays and energy plays. I'm just happy my energy was good. I would say I was solid defensively, but (Westbrook) scored 50 points. So I'm just happy he didn't get a triple-double and we got a win."" WESTBROOK'S NIGHT Westbrook's 49 points were the most a player has scored against Houston since current Rocket Corey Brewer had 51 for Minnesota on April 11, 2014. It was the third-most points Westbrook, whose career high is 54, has ever scored.","400899961"
"DALLAS --  Eric Bledsoe spent time last summer trying to teach himself not to get down when a game wasn't going well. The Phoenix guard applied those lessons in Dallas, helping his team win consecutive games for just the second time this season. Bledsoe scored 11 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, including seven straight to break a tie in the final two minutes, and the Suns beat the Mavericks 102-95 on Thursday night. The six-year veteran had missed all four of his 3-pointers through three quarters before making two of three while the Suns were 4 of 5 from long range in the fourth. He finished 9 of 16 from the field . ""I have to show up in crunch time no matter how bad the game is going for me,"" said Bledsoe, who scored nine of Phoenix's last 11 points and had a game-high seven assists. ""The last couple of minutes is my time."" Devin Booker, Bledsoe's backcourt mate, added 22 points as the Suns (12-25) denied the Mavericks (11-25) their third two-game winning streak in a matchup of Western Conference also-rans. ""We want our guards to get after it, control the pace, create tempo and play with a lot of edge,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""It just filters throughout our team."" Deron Williams led the Mavericks with 20 points, including consecutive baskets for a 93-all tie before Bledsoe's tiebreaking 3-pointer started a 9-2 run to finish the game. Tyson Chandler had 18 rebounds for Phoenix against his former team, and Brandon Knight scored 17 points after missing a game with a sprained right wrist. Led by the 7-foot-1 center who helped carry the Mavericks to their only NBA title in 2011, the Suns outrebounded the Mavericks 53-31. ""Not good,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""And that's a big factor obviously in the game and the outcome. You shoot better but lose by seven. That's one of the reasons."" Dallas' 7-footer, Andrew Bogut, had no rebounds and also went scoreless with five fouls a day after suggesting in a radio interview in his native Australia that his days in Dallas might be short. He didn't talk to reporters after the game. Bogut, obtained in an offseason trade after Golden State had to dump salary to add Kevin Durant, is coming off the bench because starting alongside star forward Dirk Nowitzki hasn't been a good mix. Bogut is a prime candidate for a trade, with Dallas likely looking to the future. The Mavericks led 72-70 after Devin Harris picked up a loose ball that got away from P.J. Tucker near midcourt and hit a 3-pointer at the third-quarter buzzer. That led to a fourth quarter with five lead changes and two ties. TIP-INS Suns: Alex Len had 14 points and seven rebounds. ... Chandler scored three points to go with three assists and had his eighth game with at least 15 rebounds. ... Bledsoe had at least 20 points for the 19th time in 37 games, and Booker hit the mark for the 15th time in 37 games. Mavericks: Harrison Barnes, Dallas' leading scorer, had 19 points. ... The guards were strong off the bench, with Seth Curry scoring 16 points and Harris 12. ... Curry was in double figures for the ninth time in 11 games and the 18th time this season. He had 12 double-figure games with Sacramento last season. NOWITZKI'S PROGRESS The 7-foot German played for the sixth time in seven games after missing 22 of the previous 24 with a strained right Achilles tendon. He played 28 minutes and had 13 points on 5-of-14 shooting, missing a number of open looks, with a team-high seven rebounds. ""I think it's too early to judge any of that stuff,"" Carlisle said. ""This has been a long road, so the good thing is he's moving better."" A LITTLE RUN Thanks to their modest winning streak, the Suns are 3-2 in their past five games after losing six of the previous seven. For the moment, they're out of last place in the West. ""We have aspirations and goals to make it to the playoffs,"" said Booker, who made all three of his 3-pointers. ""We know it could go either way right now, but we keep fighting through it. Tonight was a big game.""","400899962"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- One down, two to go. With his struggling team in a short stretch of games it really needs to win, Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts is actually looking ahead a little bit. Portland got started Thursday night with a 118-109 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. CJ McCollum scored 27 points and Damian Lillard had 21 points and 10 assists in his return from a sprained ankle. ""It's a little bit of a departure for me to talk about the future, but these three games get us back in the mix,"" Stotts said. Following their victory Thursday night, the Blazers host the Detroit Pistons on Saturday before heading south to play the Lakers again on Tuesday. ""We've been playing much better; it hasn't always led to wins,"" Lillard said. ""Two of these next three at home, one of them on the road against a team we beat tonight that we know we're capable of beating, we've got to take advantage of that, and not take it for granted."" Evan Turner scored 15 of his season-high 20 points in the fourth quarter as Portland secured its ninth straight regular-season victory over the Lakers, a franchise record. D'Angelo Russell had 22 points, 10 in the final period, and Jordan Clarkson added 21 off the bench for Los Angeles, which led by 14 in the first half. Russell's turnaround jumper put the Lakers up 101-99 midway through the fourth. He added a pair of free throws, but Lillard hit a 3-pointer that closed the gap. McCollum's floater put Portland in front before he hit a 3 with 4:06 to go that pushed the lead to 107-103. He added another basket that extended it, and the crowd chanted ""Beat L-A! Beat L-A!"" Turner padded the advantage with a jumper with just more than two minutes left, and the Lakers couldn't catch up. ""It was one of those nights where at the end all of the key plays went their way,"" Lakers guard Nick Young said. Lillard missed five games after spraining his left ankle against San Antonio on Dec. 23. He is the team's top scorer with an average of 27 points and 6.2 assists per game. The Blazers went 2/3 without him, including Wednesday night's 125-117 loss to the Golden State Warriors. ""Obviously, he makes them a lot more dangerous,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said before the game. Luol Deng sat out because of right biceps tendinitis. Deng played more than 31 minutes Tuesday night in the Lakers' 116-102 victory at home against Memphis. Julius Randle had a triple-double (19 points, 14 rebounds, 11 assists) against the Grizzlies. He finished with 17 points and nine rebounds against the Blazers. Lillard didn't look rusty from the layoff, hitting his first four shots, including a 3-pointer that gave the Blazers an early 21-16 lead. Clarkson, Lou Williams and Brandon Ingram hit consecutive 3s to cap a 13-0 run that gave the Lakers a 37-29 lead early in the second quarter. Los Angeles pushed the advantage to 54-43 after Russell's short jumper late in the half. Portland climbed back into it with a 13-2 run to open the second half, capped by Maurice Harkless' 3-pointer that tied the game at 66. The Blazers took an 84-81 lead on Turner's fast-break layup late in the third quarter. TIP-INS Lakers: Walton said he can't really compare his head coaching experience from last season, when he stepped in for Steve Kerr with the Warriors, to his first season running the Lakers. ""This whole thing takes time, and obviously we're in the earlier stages,"" he said. Trail Blazers: Allen Crabbe has scored in double figures in five straight games, a season high. He finished with 14 points. ... McCollum has averaged 35 points over the last three games. LILLARD'S ANKLE Lillard, who had his fourth double-double in his past six games, said he was pain-free following the game. ""He looked really fresh at the beginning. He may have fatigued a little bit. A couple of the shots late looked a little tired. But I thought he managed the game pretty well,"" Stotts said. ""I tried to get him off the ball so it wasn't quite as fatiguing."" QUOTABLE ""Honestly, I didn't feel like we had our legs. Not sure why, but it felt like we came out and the first couple of plays we ran and we weren't cutting hard, we weren't pushing the ball into the spots we wanted the ball to be in. That's not OK. So we made a mess, and we tried to regroup from there,"" Walton said.","400899963"
"DENVER --  Tony Parker likes to get his big men involved right out of the gate, just to get them in an early flow. It worked all those years with Tim Duncan before he retired. Now it's working with LaMarcus Aldridge. Aldridge scored 28 points, including 11 while sparking a third-quarter spurt, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Denver Nuggets 127-99 on Thursday night. ""It's great when we establish L.A. like that. Feel like he's gaining confidence,"" Parker said. ""I don't know, it feels like the last three or four games, he's getting in a great rhythm."" Kawhi Leonard added 24 points, while Parker had 21 and a season-high nine assists for the Spurs, who improved to 17-3 on the road this season. Parker shot 10 of 11 from the field. ""Tony was vintage T.P.,"" Aldridge said. Aldridge helped San Antonio pull away in the third quarter by knocking down a flurry of mid-range jumpers and hook shots. He has reached double figures in 30 of 33 games this season. Parker's mission now is straightforward: Get Aldridge to shoot even more. He made 11 of 18 from the field. ""He's a great shooter, a great scorer,"" Parker said. ""When he plays like that, it forces double-teams and makes everybody's job easier."" Nikola Jokic had 19 points and 11 rebounds for Denver, which dropped its fourth straight. The Nuggets hit their first 10 shots from the floor, but couldn't gain any separation from the Spurs. ""They just kept scoring and got stops and we did the opposite,"" Wilson Chandler said. San Antonio entered fresh off a 110-82 win over Toronto on Tuesday. It was a game in which the Spurs made the Raptors look ""like a JV team,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said before Thursday's game. ""They have that kind of talent. They have that chemistry. ... I just hope we rise to the challenge."" But the Nuggets couldn't match San Antonio's intensity and had no answer for all of its scoring options. ""Losses in general but losses when you feel like you're defeated, it's definitely hard to swallow,"" Chandler said. ""We've got to figure out some way to get out of it and it's going to be on the defensive end."" Speaking of defense, Malone called out his team's defensive intensity the other night. His message didn't appear to register. ""Some guys may be in denial and some guys may be, `Hey, Coach is right,"" Malone said. ""There's 127 points on the board. Call me a liar if you want, I look at all the numbers and when you're ranked 30th in defensive efficiency, it is what it is. Our offense has been pretty good overall, but you want to win in the league, be a competitive playoff team, you better defend."" TIP-INS Spurs: Pau Gasol had 17 points and a team-high nine rebounds. ... Asked what turned the game in the second half, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich simply said: ""We played better. We played defense. We made shots. We didn't turn it over."" ... The Spurs had 34 assists. Nuggets: F Kenneth Faried missed the game with a sore lower back. ... F Danilo Gallinari drew a technical for arguing a call in the third quarter. ... Jokic dished out five assists. No surprise, since he's one of the top passers among centers this season. ... Denver was outrebounded by a 41-38 margin. SORRY, GUYS Malone apologized to his veteran players for calling them out for a lack of leadership following a loss to Sacramento on Tuesday. ""I let my frustrations after that loss get the best of me,"" he explained. ""If I have issues with our veterans, I'll address it with our veterans 1-on-1, to try and resolve whatever issues there may be."" SCARY THOUGHT Aldridge thinks this Spurs team hasn't reached its full potential yet. ""We still have work to do,"" he said. ""It's looking more promising now. Guys are definitely getting more comfortable.""","400899964"
"WASHINGTON -- On a night when Andrew Wiggins was nearly unstoppable, John Wall made sure the Washington Wizards did enough to get their ninth straight home victory. Wall had a season-high 18 assists and scored 18 points to help the Wizards beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-105 on Friday night. Wiggins had 41 points on 16-of-30 shooting, but it wasn't enough on a night the Wizards shot 58.2 percent (46 of 79). ""A lot of times I could have taken the drive to the basket, but I knew (Bradley Beal) was getting it going,"" Wall said. ""I was trying to find him in transition, and find Otto (Porter Jr.) and those guys and they were knocking down shots."" Beal had 22 points and Marcin Gortat hit all nine of his field-goal attempts and scored 19 points. Porter added 17 points and Markieff Morris had 15 for the Wizards. They have won 10 of 15 overall. Karl-Anthony Towns added 18 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota, which has dropped six of its last eight. Gorgui Dieng added 15 points and 11 rebounds, and Zach Lavine had eight points on 3-of-14 shooting. Wiggins bounced back after scoring eight points in a loss to Philadelphia on Tuesday night. ""It doesn't mean nothing,"" Wiggins said. ""We lost because of our defense. So, what we did offensively doesn't mean nothing at the end of the day."" After Wiggins gave Minnesota its first lead since early in the fourth quarter, 101-99 with 2:50 left, Porter tied it with a jumper, and Wall scored on two fast-break layups to make it 105-101 with 140 left. Wall totaled eight points and six assists in the fourth quarter. ""He killed us,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I mean, 18 assists, pushed the ball, made plays, so. It only takes one guy to jog back (on defense) and then that crushes you."" Wiggins' dunk pulled the Wolves within two, but Beal made a 3-pointer. Wiggins hit another jumper, and Gortat's layup gave Washington a five-point lead with 48 seconds left as Washington scored on five straight possessions. Wiggins missed on Minnesota's next possession, and nobody scored again until Wall hit two free throws with 8.3 seconds left. The Wizards opened the fourth quarter with a 9-0 run to take an 89-85 lead. Minnesota trailed 66-52 early in the third, but Wiggins (16 points in the quarter) sparked a comeback that saw the Wolves hit 15 of 23 shots and score 37 points in the period to lead 85-80 entering the fourth. ""We got the lead and then we relaxed,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""Then Wiggins got extremely hot and it was hard to turn him off."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Wiggins scored 15 points in the first quarter on 6-of-10 shooting. ... F Shabazz Mahammad (illness) was inactive. ... G Brandon Rush played for the first time in 12 games and finished with a season-high 10 points. The Wolves are 3-21 when allowing 100 or more points. Wizards: The franchise record for consecutive home wins is 22 during the 1974-75 season. ... It was the fifth game in which Wall topped 15 points and 15 assists. His career high is 19 assists. ... Gortat (10 rebounds) has 21 double-doubles. BENCHED The game matched the league's two lowest-scoring reserve units. Minnesota's bench came in ranked 30th, contributing 21.8 points per game, while Washington was 29th with 23.7 points. The Chicago Bulls, ranked 28th, are getting 29.4 points per game from their bench. INSIDE MAN ""He did a great job of setting screens for us, running to the basket, offensive rebounds he goes up, when he's dunking the ball and finishing around the paint it makes us a better team,"" Wall said about Gortat's perfect night from the field. ""We try to tell him to stay away from the free-throw line and jump shots.""","400899965"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Houston Rockets are edging toward elite status in the Western Conference, and learning that the climb comes with challenges. Facing a struggling Orlando Magic team on Friday, the Rockets found themselves in a too-close-to-call contest for the second straight night before coming away with a 100-93 win for their seventh straight victory. Houston escaped against Oklahoma City with a two-point win at home Thursday night after leading by 18 in the second half. This time, the Rockets trailed by eight at halftime before taking off in the third quarter to regain the lead in a game that was tight throughout. ""A win is a win. It's tough to win in this league, so we are going to take every win that we can,"" said Houston forward Ryan Anderson, who scored all 19 of his points in the second half. ""We don't want to play the first half like we did tonight. We played a real bad first half, for us, especially. We corrected things and came together a lot better in the second half and we played better defense overall and made shots,"" he added. After Magic forward Aaron Gordon tied the game for the ninth time with a three-point play with 3:52 to go, the Rockets (29-9) stepped up their defense and their scorers got going from the 3-point line in the final three minutes. Anderson hit two of his five 3s during that span and Eric Gordon knocked down a 3 to help Houston outscore Orlando 12-5 down the stretch. But the Rockets realize with a tough road game coming up Sunday against Toronto that they have to figure out a way to play a complete 48 minutes. ""We need to be ready to go from the start and play with a chip on our shoulders because we are getting everybody's best now because we are one of the best teams out there,"" said Eric Gordon, who had 17 points off the bench. ""We just have to play with more urgency."" The Magic, who have lost four of five, seemed to play with that urgency in the first half as they played solid defense against James Harden, Anderson and Eric Gordon. But things changed drastically in the second half. Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza, Anderson and Gordon all knocked down big 3-point shots to help the Rockets quickly reclaim the lead. Houston attempted 49 3-pointers and made 15. They attempted just 37 two-point shots. Orlando (16-22) kept it close but couldn't come up with consistent scoring to pad its slim leads. ""It's a really unique style and it works for them,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said about Houston. ""I thought we did a pretty good job handling it most of the night, but Ryan Anderson got loose too much in the third quarter and that's where the game was lost."" FLOPPING MATTER The offseason additions of power forward Serge Ibaka and center Bismack Biyombo have given Orlando an inside presence this season, But entering Friday night, the Magic ranked 24th in points in the paint (40.3) and 23rd in defending the paint (41.1). Vogel had an interesting take on what his interior players, including Nikola Vucevic, need to do to improve the numbers. ""I can't believe I'm saying this to the media but I feel like our guys don't do a good enough job flopping,"" he said. ""I don't like when guys flop but it seems like that's the avenue to get to the free throw line. We don't sell contact very well; we just go try to score the ball."" TIP-INS Rockets: Nene was not in the starting lineup but did play. Montrezl Harrell started at center. ... The Rockets are the only NBA team that is undefeated this season in the second of back-to-back games. They are 9-0 after Friday night's win. ... Harden had an off night, missing all eight of his 3-point attempts and committing six turnovers. He finished with 14 points and 10 assists. Magic: Evan Fournier returned to his starting spot after coming off the bench Wednesday. Before that, he missed five games with a heel injury. ... Orlando is 7-13 at home this season and has dropped three straight at Amway Center.","400899966"
"BOSTON --  Three-pointers have been plentiful for the Boston Celtics recently. And they continue to add up to wins. Avery Bradley had 26 points and nine rebounds and the Celtics set a franchise record with 19 3-pointers in their 110-106 comeback victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday night. Isaiah Thomas added 24 points, and Al Horford scored 14 of his 19 points -- including a pivotal late 3 -- in the final period. The Celtics have won nine out of their last 11 and four straight at home. They are 53 of 103 from beyond the arc in their last three. ""Once I came back in the game (in the fourth quarter), I got a look early and it felt really good,"" Horford said. ""I was just kind of in a zone there. Guys kept finding me and I kept knocking them down."" Joel Embiid led Philadelphia with 23 points, and Ersan Ilyasova added 20. Philadelphia led by as many as 14 in the first half before the Celtics tied it and took the lead early in the fourth quarter. After sitting out practice Thursday with the flu, Embiid was on a 28-minute limit Friday. He made the most of his time, adding eight rebounds and six assists. It was tied at 104 with less than a minute when Embiid hit a pair of free throws to put the 76ers in front. But Horford got wide open in the corner on the Boston's ensuing possession and hit a 3 with 17.2 seconds left. The Celtics nearly stole Philadelphia's inbounds pass after the timeout, then Amir Johnson rebounded a rushed jumper by Ilyasova and was fouled. Ilyasova had one more chance in the closing seconds, but came up with air on his 3-point attempt. ""I thought I didn't get the ball enough in the third. We weren't just moving the ball,"" Embiid said.  ""I thought we were moving the ball when we were scoring, so I was just being a playmaker and just moving the ball."" Boston picked things up in the second half after the 76ers dominated early. Embiid scored 17 points in the first half and Sixers fans at TD Garden chanted ""Trust the process! Trust the process!"" at times as Philadelphia surged in front. Embiid was the engine, getting free for some dunks on offense and altering shots on the defensive end. He joked during the team's shoot around Friday morning that he wanted an opportunity to guard Thomas on defense. Embiid got the chance a few times in the first half, getting Thomas on defensive switches. Thomas got a layup and drew a foul on one occasion, but failed to convert on the free throw. The comments weren't missed by Thomas, who had a light moment with Embiid after the play. ""He said he was going to guard me on the switch, I just said, `Nobody can stop me on the switch. Especially not your big (butt).' He started laughing,"" Thomas said. TIP-INS 76ers: T. J. McConnell had a career-high 15 assists. ... Held a 30-6 scoring advantage in the paint in the first half. Celtics: Thomas has scored 20 or more points in 20 straight games. ...  Improved to 17-9 when scoring 100 or more points. ... Outrebounded an opponent for only the eight time this season. They are 8-0 in those games. MAKING PROGRESS 76ers rookie F Ben Simmons made his first road trip with the team this season since suffering a fractured right foot during Philadelphia's final training camp scrimmage back in September. During Friday's morning shoot around at the team's hotel the No. 1 overall draft pick did some running and went through some light drills with trainers. BOUNCING BACK Stevens said he expected F Jae Crowder to respond well Friday after he offered some choice works on Twitter following Tuesday's win Utah. Crowder took issue with Boston fans who cheered for Jazz forward Gordon Hayward, who could be a free agent this summer. He has since deleted most of the tweets and apologized on Thursday. Crowder received a loud cheer from the TD Garden fans during pregame player introductions. ""I've never been through a situation like that,"" Crowder said. ""I didn't anticipate nothing. I didn't think about nothing. But I'm ready to put it behind us.""","400899967"
"NEW YORK -- Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were rusty and Kyle Korver is still not a Cavalier, so LeBron James needed to play a heavy role Friday. As usual, he was up to the task. James scored 36 points, carrying Cleveland while Irving and Love had slow starts in their return to the lineup in a 116-108 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. Irving added 32 points and Love had 17 points and 13 rebounds, but both shot poorly early as the Nets kept it competitive for 1 1/2 quarters. James helped the Cavs open a comfortable lead by halftime they enjoyed most of the rest of the way in the opener of a six-game trip. ""Ky was a little rusty coming off a couple of games out and obviously Kev as well,"" James said, ""so I was just trying to see if I could push the tempo, get us into a good flow, get some early buckets in the second quarter and I was able to push the lead to a double-digit lead by halftime. So it worked well for us."" The Cavs were still working to finalize a trade with Atlanta to acquire Korver, which will add a premier perimeter shooter to their second unit. ""Every shooter that comes here we tell them LeBron's statement: If a guy's not in your numbers, then you're open,"" Irving said. ""So I know he'll pretty much enjoy that."" Bojan Bogdanovic scored 23 points for the Nets, who have lost five straight. ""We just tried to compete the whole game. We dug ourselves a hole,"" rookie Caris LeVert said after scoring a season-high 19 points. Love missed a loss to Chicago on Wednesday and was limited in the previous game after suffering from food poisoning on New Year's Day. Irving had sat out the last three with right hamstring tightness. Irving started 1 for 8 and Love was 1 for 7 as the Nets, who trailed by 46 during their loss at Cleveland on Dec. 23, led with under five minutes remaining in the second quarter. But James had 10 points in the final 3:09 as Cleveland took a 50-39 lead. Love then had 10 points in the Cavs' 36-point third quarter and Irving heated up late as Cleveland broke it open again after the Nets trimmed a 24-point deficit to six in the fourth quarter. ""I thought they were rusty but we did a good job of working them back in and they were able to finish the game,"" Lue said. Irving finished 10 for 26 from the field with three 3-pointers. Love was 5 for 16. Tristan Thompson was 0 for 9 from the free throw line in the first half before finally making a pair with 4:27 left in the third quarter after the Nets fouled him intentionally. He finished 4 for 13. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Love said he has regained most of the 10 pounds he lost during his illness. ... After the acquisition of Korver is completed, James and Lue said the next priority for the Cavs is adding another point guard. With Matthew Dellavedova going to Milwaukee in the offseason, rookie Kay Felder is the only point guard on the roster other than Irving. Nets: With Jeremy Lin still sidelined, Spencer Dinwiddie made his second career start, scoring seven points. ... F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson returned after missing Thursday's loss in Indiana with right hip tendinitis and shot 1 for 6 for four points. DONE DEAL Though the trade with Atlanta wasn't done yet, the Cavaliers did complete one with Portland. The Cavs re-acquired the 2018 first-round pick they had sent the Trail Blazers along with Anderson Varejao last February, in exchange for their 2017 first-rounder. KORVER SUPPORTER Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, who was an assistant in Atlanta, said the Cavaliers are making a great move to get Korver. ""I think we all make a mistake if we just think Kyle's a shooter,"" Atkinson said. ""I think he's a better all-around player than people think. I think he's a better defender than people think. Better passer. He's just really great IQ and he's going to help them in so many ways.""","400899968"
"MILWAUKEE -- Two nights after losing to the Bucks on a last-second shot at home, the New York Knicks rallied late in the rematch and stunned Milwaukee. Carmelo Anthony had 26 points and 10 assists, including a clutch 3-pointer in the fourth quarter, and the Knicks stormed back from 18 down Friday to beat the Bucks 116-111 and stop their six-game losing streak. With less than a minute remaining, Anthony drained a 3-pointer that put New York in front by one. ""It felt good. I'm glad it went in,"" he said. ""You don't make it if you don't take it."" On the ensuing possession, Lance Thomas stripped Giannis Antetokounmpo, leading to a fast-break dunk by Courtney Lee that helped the Knicks hold on. New York rebounded from a tough loss Wednesday, when Antetokounmpo hit a step-back jumper at the horn that gave Milwaukee a 105-104 victory at Madison Square Garden. ""It is a great win for us tonight because the other night (we) thought we should have won,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. This time, they did. New York erased a 13-point deficit to begin the fourth quarter and ended its longest skid of the season. Kristaps Porzingis returned from a three-game absence due to a sore left Achilles tendon and added 24 points for the Knicks. ""We needed it. We needed it more than anything,"" he said. Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker had 25 points apiece for Milwaukee. Greg Monroe chipped in with 19. ""After halftime, we relaxed and didn't move the ball real well,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We were taking tough shots and we weren't playing our game. We had a chance to put them away, but we didn't."" The Knicks used a 12-0 run to cut the Bucks' lead to one early in the fourth. Milwaukee's Jason Terry was called for a flagrant foul during the stretch after he struck Ron Baker in the neck with his forearm. After New York pulled within a point again later in the quarter, Tony Snell connected on back-to-back 3s for Milwaukee. Porzingis answered with a pair of 3-pointers. After trailing by 12 at halftime, the Knicks opened the third quarter on a 15-4 run to cut the deficit to a single point. The Bucks immediately followed with a 9-0 spurt and led 96-83 heading to the fourth. The Bucks used torrid long-range shooting to lead 65-53 at halftime. Milwaukee made its first eight shots from 3-point range before Michael Beasley misfired with about seven minutes left in the second quarter. The Knicks jumped out to a 9-0 lead but the Bucks quickly erased the deficit and held a 33-32 advantage after one quarter. AFTER FURTHER REVIEW Hornacek brushed off a report from the NBA that stated there was a missed five-second call on Antetokounmpo's game-winning shot Wednesday. ""You're not going to see it called,"" Hornacek said. ""They aren't going to change the game, so you just move on."" ROUGH GAME New York center Joakim Noah picked up three personal fouls and was charged with a technical in the first half after he vehemently argued a call. Noah picked up two fouls in the third quarter and argued with referees as he left the court after being called for an offensive foul. He fouled out late in the game and egged on fans as they mocked him while he made his way to the bench. TIP-INS Knicks: Hornacek thought he'd be forced to limit Porzingis' playing time as he returned from injury, but the forward/center logged 30 minutes before fouling out with 2:44 remaining. Porzingis said after the game that he had no soreness in the Achilles. ""Maybe I should have worked harder,"" he said.

"LOS ANGELES --  Goran Dragic and Jordan Clarkson repeatedly collided while they fought for position with increasingly bad intentions. Clarkson finally knocked down Dragic with a shove. Although teammates and officials kept them apart before any punches flew, both the Heat's leading scorer and the Lakers' reserve guard were ejected. That exchange was yet another bit of good news on an excellent night for Los Angeles. Lou Williams scored 24 points and Luol Deng added 19 points and 14 rebounds for the Lakers in their fourth victory in 20 games, 127-100 over Miami on Friday. Dragic scored 16 points before getting tossed, and the Heat couldn't keep up afterward. While both teams had differing interpretations of the physical play that led up to the near-fight, Miami coach Erik Spoelstra was the most displeased. ""That's really shameful, disgraceful that Goran Dragic got thrown out of that game,"" Spoelstra said. ""It's an elbow to his face, somebody that wants to fight, knocks him down on the ground, and just a bail-out, shameful, disgraceful ejection. There's no way he should be thrown out of that situation for just taking an elbow to the face, getting up, not even necessarily defending himself, just getting up. But at that point, it's an eight-point game, and we pretty much just let it go from there. I don't know if it would have made a difference, but he is our best player."" Lakers coach Luke Walton thought the whole incident was overblown, particularly given the long video review before the ejections. ""A couple of players pushing each other,"" Walton said. ""I don't think it's that big of a deal. You never want a fight to happen, but whatever, keep the game moving and let's go."" With the Heat's leading scorer in the locker room, the Lakers seized control in the fourth quarter of just their second win in 10 meetings with Miami. Williams led a decisive 19-4 run while scoring 16 points in the final period. Willie Reed had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Heat, who have lost seven of eight overall and nine of 10 on the road. D'Angelo Russell scored 19 points, rookie Brandon Ingram had a career-high 17 and Julius Randle added 15 for the Lakers, who had their highest-scoring performance of the season. Reed matched his career high, and James Johnson scored 20 points for the Heat. ACT TWO Johnson and Randle exchanged harsh words moments after Dragic and Clarkson were tossed, but the big men were kept apart. Johnson scored nine points in the ensuing five minutes to keep the Heat close. ""Everything was already separated, so there was no need for anything else to go on,"" Johnson said. ""Just people woofing out there. That's all it is, woofing."" METTA'S LAST GAME? Metta World Peace knows a thing or two about NBA fights, but he kept it relatively clean in perhaps his final game with the Lakers. The 37-year-old veteran committed three fouls and missed his only shot while playing the final 2:12, getting raucous ovations from the Lakers' knowledgeable fans with every event. Los Angeles must decide this weekend whether to allow his one-year contract to become a guaranteed deal. ""I like him with us,"" Walton said. ""That's a front-office decision, but my recommendation is to keep him, obviously, with us."" If the Lakers decide not to keep World Peace in uniform, Walton says hiring him as an assistant ""would be my next recommendation. I want the guy around our players. I do. He's a professional. I think it's real beneficial when he's in practice in the trenches with them. He's someone that helps the team being around.""

"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Rarely did Stephen Curry, coach Steve Kerr and the rest of those 73-win Warriors have to stop and re-evaluate things last season. Until they lost the NBA championship to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, of course. Golden State sure is taking inventory now, having squandered Curry's 40-point performance and a 24-point lead in the second half of a 128-119 overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night. ""There's no panic at all. You go through these hiccups, these road bumps and it pokes air out of the balloon a little bit, but that's what the regular season's for,"" Curry said. ""Last year, I don't think we had many opportunities to kind of self-assess and look ourselves in the mirror and see where we were at, just riding that wave."" Draymond Green plans to do his part in the learning process after criticizing his own poor body language. He figures that affected his teammates as the game got away. The Warriors watched as Mike Conley knocked down a key jumper with 55 seconds left in OT on the way to 27 points, and the Grizzlies beat Golden State for the second time this season. Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph each made two quick baskets as the Grizzlies hit their initial five shots in the extra period and snapped Golden State's nine-game home winning streak. ""I'm actually happy we lost today because there are some things that we need to correct in order to win a championship. That's our goal,"" Green said. ""Our fourth-quarter offense has been atrocious."" Green converted a three-point play for the Warriors with 2:22 left in overtime, then made a steal on the other end. But he turned the ball over and Troy Daniels immediately hit a corner 3-pointer for Memphis. Conley tied it on a 17-footer with 7.4 seconds left in regulation, and a heavily guarded Curry missed from way back before the buzzer. Kevin Durant had 27 points and 13 rebounds but missed five free throws in the Warriors' sixth defeat of the season. The Grizzlies handed Golden State a 110-89 loss on Dec. 10. ""The fourth quarter, once they made that run, our body language was bad, and that can't happen,"" Kerr said. ""And that bothered me."" One spectacular play seemed it would sum up Curry's night until his team crumbled. Off the ground mid-shot, he knocked down a 3-pointer and converted the four-point play to chants of ""M-V-P!"" with 5:16 left in the third quarter after a foul on his backside by Vince Carter. Curry's bottom on the court and mouthpiece hanging out moments later, he raised both arms to make sure everybody knew the shot was good. The Warriors didn't make their first field goal in the fourth until Curry's jumper with 3:14 to go. They shot 2 for 13 in the period with five turnovers. ""I love that it was a great team that we beat, but I want more consistency,"" Grizzlies coach David Fizdale said. ""Right now we play like spoilers. We haven't proven that as a contender we can do it night in and night out."" Klay Thompson had been questionable with an illness but got going in a hurry. He scored 12 points on 12 shots in 13 minutes out of the gate and wound up with 17 points for Golden State. Curry, who shot 15 for 27 and 5 of 13 on 3s, has made a concerted effort to be more aggressive on the offensive end during this recent stretch and since a defeat at Cleveland on Christmas after which he said he didn't shoot enough. He had his second 40-point game following a 35-point outing Wednesday against Portland. But the Warriors lost for the first time in 26 regular-season games when Curry scored at least 30 points. Memphis won on Golden State's home floor for the first time since an 88-81 victory in overtime on Nov. 20, 2013. TIP-INS Grizzlies: F JaMychal Green started after missing Wednesday's game at the Clippers, wearing a mask to protect the facial fracture he sustained Friday. ""I guess it's not something that bothers him. He's a tough kid,"" Fizdale said. ... Tony Allen had a season-high six steals. Warriors: Golden State had gone four straight games with 30 or more assists while shooting at least 50 percent, but did neither this time (23 assists, 49.4 percent). ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Chris Paul is back and so are the Los Angeles Clippers, who have recovered quite nicely following a six-game losing streak. Austin Rivers scored 24 points and Paul was a difference-maker down the stretch as the Clippers won their third straight game by defeating the Sacramento Kings 106-98 on Friday night. Rivers made four 3-pointers and the Clippers hit 13 overall in beating the Kings for the ninth straight time in Sacramento. Los Angeles hit five 3s in the fourth quarter, when it outscored the Kings 31-25. ""We have been able to finish (the last three) games when they are close in the fourth quarter,"" J.J. Redick said. ""We've proven we can be a high-level team. We just have to do it consistently."" It helped having Paul back directing the offense, especially in the fourth quarter. The veteran point guard had 14 points and 12 assists. He made six straight free throws in the final 24 seconds and had six assists in the fourth to help secure the victory. Paul missed the previous four games and seven of the past eight with a left hamstring injury. ""Down the stretch, it's funny, you could see that he just hasn't played and you could see the rust,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""But still, his grit. His defense and all his little defensive plays that he made down the stretch I thought was the difference in the game."" Redick drained five 3s and scored 20 points, and DeAndre Jordan had 20 points and nine rebounds for the Clippers. Austin Rivers carried much of the offensive load again for the Clippers after scoring a season-high 28 points in Wednesday's win over Memphis. He hit four 3s, shot 9 of 15 overall and added six rebounds. ""He's been hot lately,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""He's a good player and I mean a couple of times he just lined us up, just hit them with a couple people on him. He has a nice rhythm to him where sometimes he keeps you off balance."" DeMarcus Cousins had 25 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists for the Kings. Darren Collison scored 20, Rudy Gay had 18 and Ty Lawson added 17 points and six assists. Sacramento has lost two straight and four of five since a season-high four-game winning streak. With his team trailing by four points, Cousins shot an airball on a 3. Paul then made four straight free throws to close it out. Cousins made a 3-pointer and Collison hit two free throws to pull the Kings to 100-98 with 56 seconds remaining. But with a chance to tie on their next possession, the Kings turned the ball over. They quickly fouled Paul, who converted two free throws for a four-point lead. After a lackluster opening quarter, the Clippers pressured the Kings defensively and were getting plenty of good looks at the other end in the second. Los Angeles outscored Sacramento 34-12 and led 53-39 at halftime. ""They're a good team. We didn't expect to blow them out,"" Gay said. ""I think our execution went down a couple of times and we forced things and that's what happens. You can't do that against good teams."" MOVIN' ON UP Paul moved into 10th place on the NBA's career assists list. He needed six to pass Rod Strickland and did it when he found Luc Mbah a Moute for a dunk midway through the third quarter. Strickland ended his career with 7,987 assists. Paul now has 7,994, and Doc Rivers thinks there are many more to come. ""That's awesome. And he has a lot more years left, so he will keep going up on that list,"" the coach said.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Jeff Teague is providing the boost behind Indiana's surging offense. ""Jeff to me is the MVP of this five-game win streak,"" veteran center Al Jefferson said. ""He's getting everyone involved and setting the tone."" Teague and Paul George each scored 19 points to lead the Pacers to a 123-109 victory over the New York Knicks on Saturday night. Teague, who was 9 of 9 from the free throw line, also had eight assists. The Pacers have scored more than 120 points in three straight games, and at least 111 points in each game of its longest winning streak of the season. Thaddeus Young had 16 points and nine rebounds, C.J. Miles added 15 points off the bench, and the Pacers (20-18) extended their streak of home regular-season wins over the Knicks to nine in a row. ""We have guys who can put the ball in the basket,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""In this winning streak, we have established that we can run the offense and focus on making the right plays."" Carmelo Anthony and Brandon Jennings each scored 17 points for the Knicks (17-20), who lost for the seventh time in eight games. Kristaps Porzingis made four 3-pointers and finished with 16 points. The Pacers used a 14-2 run at the start of the second quarter to pull away. Teague's 3 with 49 seconds to go in the first half put the Pacers ahead 60-40 before Porzingis answered with a 3-pointer of his own and Miles scored to give Indiana a 62-43 halftime lead. New York's trip to Indiana was on the second night of a back-to-back on the road. The Knicks overcame an 18-point deficit Friday in Milwaukee to end a six-game skid, but falling into a 29-point hole against the Pacers was too much to climb. ""We didn't come out with enough energy and they were playing real good basketball,"" Porzingis said. ""Once you get down big like we did, it's tough to get back into the game."" Miles made a 3-pointer at the start of the fourth quarter to give Indiana a 99-70 lead. Jefferson made two free throws to make it 103-80 before the Knicks went on a 14-2 run to get within 11 when Mindaugas Kuzminskas dunked with 4:57 remaining. George made two free throws to extend Indiana's lead and Young dunked on an alley-oop pass from Teague to put the Pacers ahead 114-100 with 3:50 to go.

It was his first game with the mask after playing without it in Thursday's game with Brooklyn. . G Rodney Stuckey was out with a sore left hamstring.

"BOSTON --  Marcus Smart made the most of his opportunity in Avery Bradley's absence. With Bradley sidelined by a strained Achilles tendon, Smart scored a season-high 22 points to help the Boston Celtics to a 117-108 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday. ""(My mentality was) just to bring it early,"" said Smart, who scored nine of his 15 first-half points in the opening quarter. ""Avery Bradley was out, it's a tough game."" Smart also contributed five rebounds, six assists and a pair of steals. ""He cannot score a point, he can miss eight shots and not make any, and he can still have a positive impact on winning,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of Smart. Isaiah Thomas did his part with a 38-point outburst, his 21st consecutive 20-point game. Gerald Green scored 15 and Kelly Olynyk had 12 off the bench as the Celtics (23-14) notched their fourth straight win. Anthony Davis had 36 points and 15 rebounds, while Langston Galloway scored 20 points for the Pelicans (14-24), who have dropped three in a row. ""We took a lot of bad shots,"" Davis said. ""We weren't moving the basketball and they came down and capitalized on each bad shot and turnover that we made."" Boston blew open the game with a 36-point third quarter and led 93-73 entering the fourth. Davis scored half of the Pelicans' points during a 14-4 run in the opening four minutes. His hook shot with 3:09 left in the quarter again pushed the lead to double digits at 25-15. Boston answered with a 13-3 run capped by six straight points from Smart, including his 3-pointer with 39.5 seconds left to tie it at 28. E'Twaun Moore's jumper and free throw on the other end gave New Orleans a 31-28 lead through one.

"CHICAGO --  Jimmy Butler wasn't sure what to make of the ""MVP! MVP!"" chants. He insisted he's not worrying about any trade rumors. He's just trying to focus on the job at hand, and is he ever locked in at the moment. Butler scored 42 points, and the Chicago Bulls overcame a 19-point deficit to beat the Toronto Raptors 123-118 in overtime Saturday night. Butler led a big run in the fourth quarter and nailed a spinning, fadeaway 3 with 17.3 seconds left in overtime for a five-point lead. He also hit the 40-point mark for the third time in six games thanks to four 3-pointers and an 18-for-20 performance at the foul line. Dwyane Wade added 20 points, and Doug McDermott had 17 to help the Bulls win their 10th in a row against Toronto. ""My job is not to worry about what the media's writing, what's going on in the outside world,"" Butler said. ""My job is to come in here and work, try to help this team win games. We're all we have in here in. Good, bad indifferent, we always lean on each other. With all the hippidy-hoopla that's going around, just keep being you and keep working."" Butler once again did everything he could to lift the Bulls to their third straight win. He has gone from scoring 52 against Charlotte to pouring in 14 in the fourth quarter at Cleveland on Wednesday to scoring 32 after halftime to help Chicago beat Toronto. DeMar DeRozan led the Raptors with 36 points. Kyle Lowry added 27 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, but the Atlantic Division leaders got outrebounded 60-41 and outscored 26-7 on second-chance points. That helps explain how they went from leading by 19 late in the third quarter to losing for the fourth time in six games. ""You make your breaks, you set the tone, you maintain your tone, the intensity, the toughness,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""You can't relax, no matter what the lead is in this league. With one-on-one players they have like Butler, different people, we did as good a job as you could, we put him on the free throw line 20 times, but that's what he does. When he does miss, we got to make sure we secure the rebound."" FINAL PUSH It was tied in overtime when McDermott hit three free throws and cut for a dunk to give the Bulls a 116-111 lead with 2:18 remaining. Two free throws by Lowry made it a three-point game. But Terrence Ross missed potential tying 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions. Butler hit two free throws for Chicago after DeMarre Carroll converted 1 of 2 to make it 118-114 with 1:06 remaining. Lowry then drove for a layup to cut it to two, but Butler then buried the dagger. With Lowry guarding him, he spun and stepped back beyond the arm and hit a fadeaway shot to make it 121-116 with 17.3 seconds left. ""Step-back 3 fading away,"" Lowry said. ""I'm comfortable guarding him. He made a tough shot. That's why he's an All-Star."" IN REGULATION Both teams had opportunities in the closing seconds of regulation. Wade missed a spinning, driving layup and Felicio missed the tip-in. Toronto had a chance to win, but DeRozan missed a floater and Lowry could not knock down a fadeaway as time expired. The Raptors led 82-63 late in the third quarter and were up 99-87 midway through the fourth when the Bulls went on a 14-0 run. Butler scored nine in that stretch and fed Wade for a layup to put Chicago on top 101-99 with three minutes left.

Westbrook made 7 of 12 3-pointers after hitting a career-high eight 3s on Thursday at Houston. He made four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to turn the game into a rout. ""Obviously, Russ started hitting pull-up 3s from 30 feet, and there's not a lot you can do with that,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. Westbrook, who entered the game as a 33 percent 3-point shooter for the season, said there's no magic in his 15-for-27 shooting behind the arc the past two games. ""Just try to stay on balance and concentrate on making the shot,"" he said. Westbrook matched his season high in rebounds in the 54th triple-double of his career. The Thunder improved to 32-3 the past two seasons when Westbrook gets a triple-double. Steven Adams scored 16 points and Victor Oladipo added 15 for Oklahoma City, which snapped a three-game losing streak. Wilson Chandler scored 24 points and Will Barton added 21 for the Nuggets.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder wanted to limit George Hill's shifts to shorter bursts in his return from a three-game absence due to a concussion. That plan went out the window in the fourth quarter as Hill led a charge against the young Minnesota Timberwolves. Hill scored 10 of his 19 points in the fourth and Rudy Gobert tipped in a rebound with 27.5 seconds to play to lift the Jazz to a 94-92 victory Saturday night. ""I think he understands who I am as a person,"" said Hill, who played all 12 minutes in the quarter. ""I think he understands if he would've pulled me out late there I would've been upset."" Derrick Favors scored seven of his 15 points in the fourth and Gobert finished with 12 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks as the Jazz rallied from 11 points down to start the final quarter. They still trailed by nine with three minutes to play, but closed on an 11-0 run. ""Given the fact that he hasn't played in a while, even sporadically at that, to know you've got a guy that likes to compete like that is important,"" Snyder said about Hill, who had played 36 minutes total in the last 18 games because of injuries. Zach LaVine had 24 points, nine rebounds and four assists and Karl-Anthony Towns had 18 points and 15 rebounds for the Timberwolves. They have lost four straight games. The Wolves went the final 4:41 without a field goal. With Utah down 93-83 with 3:05 to play, Favors scored seven straight points for the Jazz, including a corner 3-pointer to cut it to 92-90 with 1:29 to play. Andrew Wiggins missed a jumper on the other end and went 0 for 4 in the final 12 minutes and Hill made a pair at the line to tie the game with 52 seconds to play.

F Shabazz Muhammad returned after missing the game Friday night with an illness. He had five points in 18 minutes. FRUSTRATED THIBS Thibodeau has a volatile demeanor on the sideline, barking at officials and cursing at turnovers and poor shot selection. But he dismissed a question on whether the players feed off of that energy when giving away big leads. ""You can look for all of the excuses you want,"" Thibodeau said. ""We have to get the job done. You can say this, that, whatever. We have to do our job. Everyone has to do their job."" Players backed him, saying they had to be more mentally tough and not relax when they have a lead late. The Wolves are 0-10 in games decided by four points or less this season. ""We've just got to get a better attitude,"" LaVine said. ""We've got to stop playing so relaxed like we've done something. Stop letting go of the leads. Even though we're up, it doesn't really matter. It's the NBA and we've blown almost every lead we've had.""","400899977"
"DALLAS --  Tim Hardaway Jr. and Dennis Schroder made sure Atlanta had 3-point shooting covered on Saturday night. Hours after the Hawks traded Kyle Korver, their leading long-range shooter, Hardaway and Schroder combined for 42 points and 8-for-13 3-point shooting to beat the Dallas Mavericks 97-82. ""Coach just said to be ready to go tonight,"" Hardaway said. ""I felt good today at shootaround. We all know that we prepare for this moment, and you just have to take care of the opportunity at hand. I think we all did that tonight."" Hardaway finished with 22 points, going 5 of 8 on 3-pointers off the bench. Schroder scored 20 and was 3 for 5 from 3-point range. The Hawks exceeded their season average with 11 3-pointers in 22 attempts. ""I thought Tim was great,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Tim has played well often this year, and he did that again tonight."" Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki said he wasn't surprised by Hardaway. ""We talked about him. He's been hot."" Hardaway is 18 for 31 (58 percent) in the last four games and could assume a bigger role with Korver headed to Cleveland. ""We're going to miss (Korver) as a teammate and a brother,"" Hawks center Dwight Howard said. ""It's a part of the business that you never know what can happen."" Howard had 20 rebounds and 15 points for Southeast Division leader Atlanta, which has won six straight games, the last three on the road. Harrison Barnes led Dallas with 21 points. Nowitzki and Devin Harris had 11 apiece. J.J. Barea led a fourth-quarter surge that cut the Hawks' advantage to 69-67. A 15-4 run, including five points by Howard, increased the lead to 84-71 with 5:41 left. ""They hit a couple of 3s (by Kent Bazemore and Hardaway) on us,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We had an untimely turnover. It was a game we couldn't ever get over the hump."" Paul Millsap made 11 of 13 free throws for 17 points to go with nine rebounds and six assists for the Hawks. Hardaway and Bazemore hit 3-pointers in the final minute of the second quarter as the Hawks went into halftime leading 45-42. Hardaway and Schroder each were 2 for 2 on 3-pointers in the third quarter, which ended with a seven-point Atlanta lead. TIP-INS Hawks: Neither Mike Dunleavy nor Mo Williams, the players acquired for Korver, was active for Saturday's game. ... Atlanta entered the game shooting 36 percent and averaging about 10 per game from 3-point range, including 41 percent and a team-high 65 made by Korver. Mavericks: They waived G Pierre Jackson on Friday, but have an open roster spot and could re-sign him if he isn't claimed. ... Barea had missed the previous seven games because of a leg injury. TOEING THE LINE Howard, a 54 percent free throw shooter, confounded Dallas' strategy to foul him late in the game by finishing 7 for 9 (78 percent).  ""We decided to leave him in, and he made several free throws,"" Budenholzer said, ""but at some point I want to be sure we are taking care of his body."" HEADS UP Atlanta rookie G Malcolm Delaney had a highlight-reel assist on the last field goal of the first half. Delaney started driving down the lane, but found his way blocked. In midair, he spun and threw a blind pass over his head to Hardaway deep in the right corner for a 3-pointer. NOWITZKI'S PLAYING TIME GROWING The 38-year-old Nowitzki has played 58 minutes in the last two games. He has missed 25 of the team's 37 games because of injury. ""It's reasonable. There's a range of mid-to-high 20s and occasionally going into the 30s possibly,"" Carlisle said. ""We're not there yet. There's a long way to go before he really is back to being himself.""","400899978"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The San Antonio Spurs were not getting the spark they normally receive from their All-Star veterans, so they turned to a rookie coming off two knee surgeries. Davis Bertans responded with another eye-opening performance. Bertans scored a season-high 21 points to help the Spurs overcome a sluggish start and beat the Charlotte Hornets 102-85 on Saturday night. ""We saw what he's capable of,"" Spurs guard Danny Green said. ""It finally translated over to the game. He's been doing that all preseason, practice and even when he's played he's shown bits and pieces of it. He put it together for the whole time he was out there (tonight). We expect him to play like that. Hopefully this game is a confidence builder for him."" Bertans was 4 for 5 on 3-pointers in leading the Spurs in scoring for the first time this season. The 6-foot-10 forward from Latvia has averaged 9.6 minutes while playing in 24 of the team's 37 games and San Antonio is unbeaten when he scores. San Antonio has won nine straight at home and 13 of 15 overall. Kawhi Leonard added 19 points and LaMarcus Aldridge had 15 points and 11 rebounds, but Bertans ignited the Spurs. ""Kawhi and LaMarcus and Pau (Gasol), those guys are a handful on their own,"" Hornets center Cody Zeller said, ""but it's tough to win when their role players get off like that. He was the difference in the game."" Kemba Walker finished with 18 points for Charlotte, shooting 4 for 5 from 3-point range. Bertans started early, sprinting past Frank Kaminsky from the 3-point line and throwing down a running right-handed dunk on Roy Hibbert to cut Charlotte's lead to 22-19. ""He's got some athleticism you all haven't seen,"" San Antonio reserve Dewayne Dedmon said. ""It's pretty impressive."" Bertans joined the Spurs after playing the previous five seasons in Europe since being drafted 42nd overall in 2011 by Indiana. He was part of the draft-day trade that brought Leonard to the Spurs and sent George Hill to the Pacers. His delay in joining the Spurs was partly due to surgeries to repair a torn ACL in his right knee in June 2013 and again in March 2015. He has joked that the doctors put ""something special"" in his knee during the second surgery and his teammates are starting to wonder if it's true. Bertans energized the sold-out crowd with back-to-back 3-pointers late in the third quarter, extending the Spurs' lead to 68-60. His first 3 resulted in a four-point play when Kaminsky closed late defensively and nearly knocked over the 24-year-old. Bertans' fourth 3-pointer caused the Spurs' bench to leap in excitement, signaling the shot with three fingers in the air. ""They missed a lot of shots and just one point in the game they just catch fire,"" Walker said. ""That's what they do. They've been doing it for years."" San Antonio trailed 50-47 after a sluggish first half. Jeremy Lamb added 13 points and eight assists for Charlotte. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte has lost nine straight in San Antonio. The Hornets' last victory was a 92-85 overtime victory on Nov. 15, 2006. .... Walker, Lamb, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Marvin Williams and Zeller started together for the first time this season. ... Hibbert emerged a few minutes into the second half with his right knee wrapped heavily wrapped in ice, but he entered the game midway through the third quarter. Hibbert finished with 10 points and five rebounds in 15 minutes. Spurs: Leonard has scored in double figures in 69 straight games. Only LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Isaiah Thomas and DeMarcus Cousins have longer active streaks. ... F David Lee missed his first game of the season with a bruised left knee. He is averaging 6.6 points and 5.0 rebounds and has started two games. ... Gasol had two blocks, moving him past Jermaine O'Neal for 22nd on the career list with 1,822. FEELING BETTER Zeller played after clearing the concussion protocol tests. He missed the Hornets' previous three games after taking an elbow to the head in the fourth quarter of their loss to Cleveland on Dec. 31. ""He's a rhythm player and missing that time badly hurt him,"" Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. ""I think he'll be a lot better on Tuesday."" Zeller was 3-for-5 shooting and finished with nine points and nine rebounds in 33 minutes.","400899979"
"Joel Embiid drives the baseline and is able to knock down a tough layup while being fouled by Joe Harris. (0:19) NEW YORK --  Joel Embiid is no longer just trusting the process. Now he's talking about the playoffs. Embiid scored 20 points and the Philadelphia 76ers earned their 10th victory to match their total from all last season, beating the Brooklyn Nets 105-95 on Sunday. The 76ers broke it open with a 17-2 surge in the fourth quarter to win the matchup between the NBA's two worst teams and improve to 10-25 in their first season with former lottery picks Embiid and Dario Saric. They were 10-72 in 2015-16, just off their own record for worst finish in the 82-game schedule. Embiid has looked at the standings and seen the 76ers are eight games back of eighth place in the Eastern Conference, and believes that should be a goal. ""I think we have a chance. We've been hot lately,"" he said. ""We've won three out of four lately, so I look at it and I think we have a chance and we're really figuring things out. We're starting to learn how to win games."" Embiid did his damage without even reaching the 28-minute restriction he was limited to as he recovers from a series of foot injuries that delayed his NBA debut for two years. He left the court to chants of ""Trust the Process!"" in a nod to what he and others reminded fans while the Sixers lost big during Sam Hinkie's rebuilding plan. Even as the victories come, coach Brett Brown said the building process remains most important. ""We are winning basketball games more frequently than we have been, but for us it's still, how are we doing what we do?"" Brown said. ""Are we doing our job? Are we not skipping steps? Are we putting in good days? And we believe as simple as that might sound that they will add up."" Saric added 18 points, while Robert Covington and Nik Stauskas each had 15. Brook Lopez scored 26 points for the Nets (8-28), who have lost six in a row. The Nets led by 11 at halftime, but the Sixers scored the first 13 points of the third quarter to take their first lead at 59-57 on a jumper by Embiid. They opened the second half with a 30-9 spurt and went into the fourth ahead 78-73. ""I just didn't feel like that third quarter, it's like, `Why isn't our energy the same?"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Brooklyn recovered to take an 85-84 edge but it was all Sixers from there, closing their spurt with 13 straight points to make it 101-87 on Covington's 3-pointer. TIP-INS 76ers: Sergio Rodriguez returned after a three-game absence with a sprained left ankle, but T.J. McConnell remained the starter after recording a career-high 17 assists Friday at Boston. Brown stopped short of saying it would stay that way long-term or even that McConnell would play the starter's share of the minutes, but praised his play in Rodriguez's absence. McConnell missed his first seven shots but finished with six assists and eight rebounds. Nets: The Nets fell to 7-2 against the 76ers at Barclays Center, their most wins against any team. ... Starting forward Trevor Booker left after just three minutes of the second half with a bruised left hip. The Nets originally ruled him out for the remainder of the game, but he returned with 4:36 to play. NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN The 76ers spent their Saturday night in New York at the Broadway musical ""Hamilton,"" the winner of 11 Tony Awards in 2016 that uses hip-hop music to tell the story of Alexander Hamilton and America's founding fathers. ""Team stuff like that, growing a culture, building a program off the floor, that stuff matters to us,"" Brown said, ""and I think it's just one other example of just things you try to do with a team to just grow a program and grow a culture and it was a wonderful day.""","400899981"
"LOS ANGELES --  Down one of their starting guards, the Los Angeles Clippers got more than enough from J.J. Redick and Chris Paul. Redick scored 25 points and Paul had 19 points, 18 assists and one turnover and Los Angeles beat the Miami Heat 98-86 on Sunday for its fourth straight victory. DeAndre Jordan added 18 rebounds to help keep the Clippers unbeaten in the new year after they closed 2016 on a six-game skid. ""We had a rough stretch,"" Jordan said. ""We're getting back to defense and we're rebounding the ball better as a team. Getting our (rear) kicked a couple times helped."" Goran Dragic scored 24 points, and Hassan Whiteside had 15 points and 13 rebounds for Miami in his return after missing four games with a right retinal contusion. The Heat shot 37 percent and had three technical fouls. ""The issue was Chris Paul facilitating and J.J. Redick coming off picks,"" Whiteside said. ""I don't remember him missing too often. He was making a lot of tough shots. He really was hurting us."" With starter Austin Rivers out because of the flu and backup guard Jamal Crawford going 1 of 12, Redick and Paul carried the load offensively. The Clippers broke it open with a 43-21 run that spanned the second and third quarters. Redick scored 14 points and Paul added 12 as they stretched the lead from one point to 23 points. Redick hit three 3-pointers and Paul added another. From there, Miami outscored the Clippers 24-14 to end the third, but still trailed 80-66 after Redick's fast-break layup off a steal by Brandon Bass beat the buzzer heading into the fourth. ""Those are tough shots,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""That's a dying breed in this league, guys that can come off screens full speed, catch, shoot from 20-24 feet. He's really created a great niche for him, and it helps that basketball team."" Marreese Speights scored 12 of his 19 points before fouling out in the fourth when the Clippers built their lead back to 20.

Rookie F Brice Johnson, who has yet to play this season because of a herniated disk in his lower back sustained in the preseason, isn't likely to return anytime soon. SAY THANKS Clippers coach Doc Rivers made Jordan thank Redick during the game for helping out on defense. ""D.J. helps a lot and he goes crazy if he doesn't get any,"" Rivers said. Jordan succumbed to the peer pressure and expressed thanks to Redick. ""I blew him a kiss,"" he said. WHAT A DIFFERENCE Whiteside was back at the scene of his breakout two years after he had a then-career high 23 points and 16 rebounds off the bench for the Heat against the Clippers at Staples Center. The Heat won 104-90 on Jan. 11, 2015, in an afternoon game just like Sunday. At the time, Whiteside had been out of the league for two years after playing briefly with Sacramento. The Clippers were one of 29 teams that declined him a preseason tryout; the Heat was the only team to work him out. ""Very quickly after that we ended up starting him,"" Spoelstra recalled of that 2015 game. ""He went on a run there for about three weeks where he was having those kinds of impacts, and we were winning those games. When he's playing on that kind of level, and impacting the game at both ends of the court, we're a totally different team."" HE SAID IT ""We started being too clever. We started switching things defensively. Hell, I didn't even know what we were doing at times. It was confusing me."" -- Doc Rivers on the team's overly elaborate defensive changes during their recent six-game skid.","400899982"
"MILWAUKEE --  Once the Washington Wizards adjusted to playing against a Milwaukee team missing star Giannis Antetokounmpo, they were all right. The Wizards overcame a sluggish start that saw them trail by double digits and beat the Bucks 107-101 Sunday. ""In the first half, we gave them everything they wanted,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""I think human nature kicked in. They didn't have Giannis and we kind of relaxed. You can't do that."" ""The second half, I thought, was about as good as we've played all year on both ends of the floor,"" he said. Antetokounmpo is averaging 24 points per game. He was ill and sat out. Bradley Beal led Washington with 26 points and Markieff Morris added 20 points and 10 rebounds. Jabari Parker's basket brought the Bucks within 104-101 with 1:05 to play. Washington grabbed an offensive rebound off a missed jumper by John Wall, and Otto Porter then found Morris wide open under the hoop off an inbounds play for a basket with 37.9 seconds left. Milwaukee connected on 7 of 12 3-pointers in the first half and led 57-49 at the break. The Wizards began the second half on a 15-6 run to take a 64-63 lead on Kelly Oubre's dunk. Oubre had 10 of his 17 points in the third, helping Washington outscore the Bucks 33-21 in the quarter. Bucks coach Jason Kidd was clearly bothered after the game, repeatedly blaming himself. ""It was bad coaching,"" Kidd said. ""I messed the guys up, it was on me. The third quarter was something we talked about and I didn't do a good job."" ""This is a consistent thing we've been doing for the last six or seven games. The first quarter, we've been down. The third quarter, we've been down. This falls on my shoulders. I've got to do a better job of coaching there in the third."" he said. After turning the ball over 12 times in the first half, Washington committed just three miscues in the third quarter. The Wizards also took away the 3-point shot from the Bucks, as Milwaukee was 0 for 4 from distance in the third. ""We took those away in the second half and made them drive,"" Oubre said. ""They got a lot more paint points than they did in the first half, but our goal was to run them off the 3-point line and contest all jumpers and layups."" Parker led Milwaukee with 28 points. Malcolm Brogdon finished with a career-high 22 points and Michael Beasley scored 18 points in 16 minutes off the bench. TIP-INS Wizards: Beal briefly went down after colliding with Porter in the second quarter. He limped off the court but stayed in the game following a timeout. Bucks: G Matthew Dellevadova returned after missing five games with a strained right hamstring. ... Milwaukee's eight steals in the first quarter were its most in any quarter since April 9, 2006 . Beasley left the game with a left shin contusion with 1:24 left in the third quarter and did not return.

"TORONTO -- James Harden had his 10th triple-double of the season to help the Houston Rockets run their winning streak to eight games. He still sees a lot of room for improvement. ""One hundred percent,"" Harden said after finishing with 40 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in the Rockets' 129-122 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday night. ""We're almost halfway through the season and we're a fairly new team still and I'll get better and my turnovers will start dropping just when I get familiar with what different defenses are doing but until then, we're rolling, guys are happy and we're making shots."" Harden also had 10 of Houston's 15 turnovers. ""I've got the ball in my hands 90 per cent of the time so it's going to happen,"" he said, adding that as long as the team stays under coach Mike D'Antoni's limit of 15 turnovers it will be OK. According to Elias Sports Bureau, Harden is the first player with a 40-point triple-double and 10 or more turnovers since turnovers became official in the 1977-78 season. Harden shot 13 of 26 from the field, finishing with 30-plus points and 10-plus assists for a league-leading 13th time this season. Montrezl Harrell had 28 points in 26 minutes off the bench on 12-of-13 shooting, with Eric Gordon adding 19 more as Houston won consecutive games in Toronto for the first time in franchise history. Down 99-95 entering the fourth quarter, the Rockets went on a 15-0 run to take an 11-point lead. DeRozan's run of 12 consecutive points for the Raptors cut into that advantage, but Toronto could get no closer than five points. Going on that kind of run is nothing new for the Rockets, who feed off each other, according to Trevor Ariza, who had 17 points. ""Once one shot goes in for someone, another one goes in, it brings up the team's morale and everybody's getting open looks, everybody's knocking down shots, it's fun to play that way,"" he said. After compiling a 19-0 record when taking a lead into the fourth quarter this season, the Raptors have lost two straight in the last 12 minutes. They ultimately lost in overtime in Chicago on Saturday night, and followed that up with Sunday's loss, a game where they had a 13-point lead at one stage. ""It just sucks in the moment, especially two night sin a row,"" DeMar DeRozan said. ""It happened and you just have to lock in."" DeRozan had 36 points for the Raptors, setting a career high with his 18th 30-plus-point game of the season. DeMarre Carroll tied a career high with 26 points and set a career high with six 3-pointers on 10 attempts. The late run by Houston to take the game away from Toronto was particularly galling for coach Dwane Casey, who constantly stresses the importance of a consistent approach to defense throughout the entire game. ""They put their heads down, attacked our feet,"" he said. ""There was a stretch where we played good basketball for 39 minutes but it is a 48-minute game and we have to extend that.""

OFF TARGET Despite entering the game with 122 more made 3-pointers than any other NBA team and on a league-record run of 27 games with at least 10 3-pointers made, the Rockets shot only 2 of 17 from beyond the arc in the first half. However, they bounced back in the second half with nine more to extend their NBA-record streak to a 28th consecutive game with at least 10 3-pointers.

Memphis, which erased a 24-point third-quarter deficit to defeat the Warriors in overtime Friday, matched Utah's intensity and defeated the Jazz 88-79 Sunday night. ""The number one thing for us was to build off of the (128-119 overtime) win at Golden State. Not be happy with it, then get back here and just lay an egg, which we've done during the year,"" said point guard Mike Conley, who led the Grizzlies with 19 points and nine assists. Marc Gasol scored 17 points, and Zach Randolph finished with 13 points and 11 rebounds for Memphis. Gordon Hayward led the Jazz with 22 points, and George Hill added 15 points. Rudy Gobert grabbed 13 rebounds. ""They play physical, and I think we do too,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""...It makes for, sometimes, a different style of game, but a very competitive game."" Utah is first in the league allowing opponents only 95.2 points a game, while Memphis is third giving up an average of 99.1. The Grizzlies pushed the lead to 17 in the fourth, allowing Memphis to hang on for the win despite Utah connecting on five 3-pointers in the fourth ""I am just proud of the way we fought,"" Hayward said, adding that the loss was ""not the way"" the Jazz wanted to end their five-game road trip. Utah managed 35 points in the first half, but came out after intermission with more vigor and a tighter defense. The recipe helped the Jazz pull within 51-49. But Memphis closed the third quarter with consecutive 3-pointers from Troy Daniels and Vince Carter in the final 5 seconds of the frame giving the Grizzlies a 63-51 lead heading to the fourth. The lead would reach 17 in the fourth -- enough to hold on. The Jazz was within 82-77 with 1:10 left. But Gasol was fouled by Gobert attempting a 3-pointer as the shot clock ran down. Gasol converted all three free throws for an 85-77 lead with 25 seconds left. ""We were eventually able to make a couple of shots and give us some life,"" Snyder said, ""but we dug ourselves in too big of a hole previous to that to have any kind of effort in the fourth quarter.""

The Jazz, who average 13.7 turnovers a game, already had 12 in the first half, ending the game with 18. .The loss was the first time in nine games that Utah lost where both Hill and Hayward played. .Gobert has led the Jazz in rebounding 22 straight games. Grizzlies: With a layup early in the fourth quarter, Randolph moved passed Grant Hill (17,137) for 89th on the NBA career scoring ladder. .... Memphis had nine 3-pointers, snapping a string of five straight games where they recorded at least 10 baskets outside the arc. SLOW and GO Zbo Memphis coach David Fizdale was asked before the game about the play of reserve forward Zach Randolph at 35 years old with past knee troubles. ""He's always had an old man's game,"" Fizdale said with a chuckle. ""It wasn't like he slowed down. He was already playing in preparation for (this)."" FOR THE FIFTH It may be early to start seed-watching, but the Grizzlies win moved them a half-game ahead of Utah for the fifth spot in the Western Conference. ""It's not too early. I'm very aware,"" Conley said of watching the standings. ""...We understand at the end of the year, it's going to come down to one or two games between three or four teams possibly.

"PHOENIX -- The Phoenix Suns, with one of the worst records in the West, threatened to make it an embarrassing night for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Until LeBron James set things straight. James scored 12 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and the Cavs fought off Phoenix down the stretch for a 120-116 victory Sunday night. ""I am just confident in my ability,"" James said. ""I work on my craft. I work on my shooting every day so it is always an option I could go to. I just try to mix it up, playing interior, playing transition, playing on the exterior and I was able to knock a couple of them down."" Kyrie Irving added 27 points and Kevin Love 25 for the Cavaliers. They led by as many as 22 in the first half and 20 early in the third quarter. ""We play well, you play hard and get the lead and playing the right way then we just messed around,"" Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said. The Suns tied it late in the third and got within one in the fourth but never took the lead. ""We made enough plays down the stretch to win,"" James said. ""We played good ball except for the third quarter. We allowed them to get out in transition and them being young and athletic they took advantage of it."" Eric Bledsoe scored 31 points and Devin Booker had 28 for the Suns. James sank consecutive 3-pointers, his only 3s of the game, to give Cleveland a 115-109 lead with 2:46 to play and scored on a driving layup with 44 seconds left to make it 120-114. ""That what makes him one of the greatest,"" Booker said. ""We knew down the stretch he wants the ball in his hands and he wants to make the play and he did that. He hit two tough shots, 3s in transition."" The young Suns turned aggressive and got their running game going to outscore Cleveland 25-7 in one stretch of the third quarter. Tyson Chandler's inside basket cut the Cav' lead to 84-82 with 3:31 left in the period. Phoenix tied it twice before the quarter ended, the last at 90 when Booker banked in an 8-footer with 11.2 seconds left, but Irving sank a 3 at the buzzer and Cleveland led entering the fourth 93-90. The Sun got within one three times early in the final quarter, the last at 98-97 on Booker's left-handed drive with 9:37 left. After Phoenix rookie Dragan Bender missed a 3, Irving sank one, then added an acrobatic driving layup to put the Cavaliers up 104-98 with 7:38 left. The Suns still were down only 109-107 after Marquese Chriss made one of two free throws with 4:28 to play but James sank his first three to boost it to 112-107. Bledsoe's layup cut it to 112-109, and James sank his second 3 to make it a six-point game. Phoenix never got closer than four after that. ""I'm mad we lost but at the same time this is one of those games that was I guess a good loss,"" Bledsoe said. ""We competed with one of the top teams in the league.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Steve Kerr pulled a Gregg Popovich. One missed defensive assignment with no backdoor help on DeMarcus Cousins, and Kerr called a timeout 18 seconds into the game. ""Nobody can make a move like Pop, I'm a very cheap version of him, if at all,"" the Golden State coach quipped about Popovich, the longtime San Antonio coach. ""It definitely made a statement,"" Draymond Green said. Stephen Curry scored 30 points and the defense started rolling after halftime, with the Warriors taking their first lead midway through the third quarter on the way to a 117-106 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Sunday night. Once the 3-pointers began to fall, the Warriors were on their way. Kevin Durant had 28 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four blocks, and Klay Thompson added 18 points. The Warriors reached 124 regular-season games in a row without suffering back-to-back defeats. ""It's deflating for other teams when we can get stops and protect the rim, get steals, force them into tough shots and tough misses and on the other end we're just running it right back down the paint,"" Curry said. ""We have to allow that part of our game to shine."" Green had 10 assists for his 12th game with double digits assists and third in four, while Zaza Pachulia scored 10 points to reach double figures for the fourth straight game. Yet one for the highlight reel was Pachulia's no-look, backward over-the-head pass to Curry after the big man got the ball when Durant blocked a shot by Cousins. ""We scored, right? Nobody's going to say anything. If it was a turnover, first thing on the film,"" Pachulia said. Sacramento's Rudy Gay scored 15 of his 23 points in the first quarter. Cousins had 17. Golden State had 30 assists for the 26th time this season and won its 13th straight against the Kings, seventh in a row in Sacramento. The Warriors woke up after halftime, starting the third with a 19-7 burst and outscoring the Kings 39-22 in the period. Golden State didn't lead until Curry's 3-pointer with 7:34 left in the third, following Durant's tying 3 the previous possession. Curry hit five 3-pointers and has at least 30 points in three consecutive games. Gay shot 9 for 17 in his second game back after missing four straight with a right hip flexor strain and 10 of 11. Cousins went 4 for 11. ""We always have that one quarter or one little stretch where we have bad basketball,"" Cousins said. ""It comes back to bite us in the end."" The Warriors went 3 for 14 from long range in the first half, then shots fell as the defense improved. Before the game, Kings coach Dave Joerger joked, ""Ask `em nicely if they won't shoot so many."" The Warriors just needed some time to warm up after choosing not to shootaround in the morning with a 6 p.m. tipoff even with it being their first visit to the new Golden 1 Center. They didn't relinquish this one, two days after squandering a 24-point lead in the second half of a 128-119 overtime home loss to Memphis.

"LOS ANGELES --  The young Lakers players are starting to show improvement. Los Angeles used No. 2 picks the last two years on D'Angelo Russell and Brandon Ingram, and a No. 7 on Julius Randle in 2014, who promptly missed all but one game of his rookie season with a broken leg. Now the trio are starting to pay dividends, including helping Los Angeles to a 111-95 win over the Orlando Magic on Sunday night. Randle led the Lakers with 19 points and nine rebounds. Russell had 17 points, eight rebounds and seven assists and Ingram matched his career-high for the second consecutive game with 17 points. Lakers coach Luke Walton said Randle, 22, and Russell, 20, gradually have shown improved commitment to their work ethic. ""We all knew they had the talent to be really good, but I think it's the fact that they really stepped up their professionalism as far as the way they're treating their bodies and approaching practice and every opportunity. It's a direct result from that,"" Walton said. The young trio enabled the 15-26 Lakers to put together consecutive victories for the first time in 30 games. The last time the Lakers won a second consecutive game was Nov. 12. Serge Ibaka, Evan Fournier and Nikola Vucevic each scored 19 points for Orlando, which could not overcome a disastrous start to the second half. The Magic trailed by two at the break, but missed their first 10 shots in the second half. They did not connect on a field goal until Ibaka hit a driving hook shot with 4:47 left in the third quarter. Orlando finished just 2 of 10 from the field in third. ""We settled too much for the perimeter,"" said Magic coach Frank Vogel. ""Going ice cold in the third did us in."" Ingram was shooting a disappointing 34.5 percent a week ago, but in his last four games has gone 17 of 28 from the field. ""I'm starting to feel comfortable, just finding openings in the offense and trying to make plays for myself and also for my teammates,"" Ingram said. TIP-INS Magic: Vucevic started the first 16 games of the season, averaging 11.8 points, 11.5 rebounds and 27.6 minutes per game while shooting 43.7 percent. In his next 19 games off the bench, he's averaged 14.1 points and 9.5 rebounds in 28.7 minutes, shooting 46.5 percent. ... Orlando is 29th in free-throw percentage (71.4). Lakers: Forward Larry Nance Jr., out since Dec. 20 with a left knee bruise, continues to improve and has begun shooting. ""Hopefully, he's close,"" Walton said. The season-high 127 points the Lakers scored in their win Friday against the Miami Heat included a season-high 62 rebounds. GETTING DEFENSIVE Los Angeles held the Magic to just nine points in the third period, a season low for any quarter by a Lakers opponent. The Lakers forced 18 turnovers. RANDLE UPTICK The new year has seen a more aggressive and productive second-year forward for the Lakers. In his last seven games, he's averaged 18.3 points. ""Our practices are carrying over,"" Randle said. ""We are locked in as a unit and just trying to take advantage.""","400899988"
"NEW YORK --  Anthony Davis dominated the Knicks until they finally knocked him out of the game with a hard foul. New York was more concerned with Derrick Rose than Davis. Davis had 40 points and 18 rebounds before leaving with a left hip injury in the New Orleans Pelicans' 110-96 victory over the Knicks, who started the game without Rose and lost Carmelo Anthony to an ejection. Rose was absent for reasons that remained unclear. Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said it was too soon to discuss the issue until the team had heard from its point guard. ""Everything will become clear later on,"" Hornacek said. ""We want to respect whatever he's going through and we're just not going to comment about it."" Joakim Noah said he had spoken to Rose, his longtime teammate in Chicago, after the game. He wouldn't discuss the conversation other than to say Rose was OK. ""Obviously, Derrick's one of our better players and when he's not here it's tough, but just happy that everything is OK with him,"" Noah said. Anthony was back in the locker room late in the third quarter after getting thrown out for arguing with the officials. He left without speaking to reporters. Davis played only 29 minutes and blocked three shots. ""I know where we are as a team, what we are trying to do as a team and I just tried to come out aggressive,"" he said. ""That was it."" He left the game when he was flagrantly fouled by Kyle O'Quinn, ejected for swinging his arm down hard on Davis, who was dribbling up the floor on a fast break and ended up being knocked into the front row of fans behind the baseline. X-rays were negative. Davis said he had a bruised hip and expects to receive plenty of treatment before the Pelicans play again Thursday in Brooklyn. Anthony had 18 points for the Knicks, who lost for the eighth time in nine games and had problems well beyond their non-existent defense. Hornacek never mentioned that Rose wouldn't play before the game, but Brandon Jennings started at the point and the Knicks said only that Rose was not with the team. Jennings led the Knicks with 20 points. Anthony felt he was fouled while missing a pair of jumpers in the third quarter and lingered long into the ensuing timeout talking to referee Dan Crawford, who hit him with a technical before Jacyn Goble called a second and tossed Anthony. By then it didn't matter. The Pelicans were in the process of outscoring the Knicks 31-15 in the third en route to a 91-66 bulge. ""I just thought we were really solid defensively,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Tyreke Evans had 12 points for the Pelicans, who snapped a three-game losing streak. ... New Orleans beat New York for the third straight time, including a victory at home on Dec. 30. Knicks: Kristaps Porzingis was just 3 for 13 for nine points. ... Backup forward Mindaugas Kuzminskas missed the game after feeling sick Monday. DOMINANT DAVIS Davis reached double figures in scoring in the first quarter for the 18th time this season. He had the first 40-point game by a Knicks opponent at Madison Square Garden this season. Kevin Durant had the most recent one, for Oklahoma City last Jan. 26.","400899989"
"CHICAGO --  Even Russell Westbrook was impressed with the passing by Oklahoma City's big men. Westbrook flirted with another triple-double and Steven Adams led a dominant effort in the paint, helping the Thunder pull away from the Chicago Bulls for an easy 109-94 victory Monday night. Westbrook had 21 points, 14 assists and nine rebounds, falling just short of his 18th triple-double of the season. But his all-around performance is practically a sure thing these days. It was the inside play of Adams and Enes Kanter that really hurt Chicago, with the big men scoring with ease or passing out of double-teams to set up their teammates. ""They do a great job of playing off each other,"" Westbrook said. Adams had 22 points on 11-for-14 shooting, and Kanter finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds. The duo helped the Thunder to 56.6 percent shooting from the field, a 60-36 advantage on points in the paint and a 42-38 edge in rebounding. ""I thought tonight, on both ends of the floor, we played at a high level,"" coach Billy Donovan said. Dwyane Wade led Chicago with 22 points, and Michael Carter-Williams had 15. Cristiano Felicio finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds. The Bulls had won three in a row and five of seven, but they were no match for the Thunder with Jimmy Butler hampered by an illness. The reigning Eastern Conference player of the week had one point on 0-for-6 shooting and seven assists. ""I appreciate him coming out and giving it a shot. That says a lot about him, as a competitor, but he was really struggling, obviously,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. Butler was sent home after he left the game in the third quarter, and Hoiberg said Butler will not play Tuesday night against Washington. Wade, who turns 35 on Jan. 17, also will rest against the Wizards. ""Jimmy can't put up 50 every night. We have to do better. We have to support him a lot better,"" Bulls forward Taj Gibson said. Gibson's three-point play off a slick pass from Wade got Chicago within 10 with 6:51 left in the third, but Westbrook helped the Thunder put it away from there. The dynamic point guard threw an alley-oop to Adams and then found the center for a layup. Westbrook set up Andre Roberson for a 3-pointer and a cutting dunk. Kanter added a driving layup with 54 seconds left, helping Oklahoma City to an 89-67 lead after three. GRANT VS GRANT Brothers Jerami and Jerian Grant faced off. Jerian Grant had 11 points in 21 minutes for the Bulls. Jerami Grant played 16 minutes for the Thunder and finished with seven points. ""Whenever I get to play against him, it's great to see him,"" Jerami Grant said. TIP-INS Thunder: Victor Oladipo scored 13 points on 6-for-9 shooting. ... G Cameron Payne played almost 15 minutes in his second game of the season after being sidelined by a right foot injury. ... The Thunder had lost four straight road games. Bulls: G Rajon Rondo did not play on his bobblehead night. The veteran guard hasn't played since Dec. 30 against Indiana, and it's unclear when or if he will return to Hoiberg's rotation. ... Rookie G Denzel Valentine missed his third straight game with an ankle injury.","400899990"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Karl-Anthony Towns dominated at the start, Ricky Rubio took over in the end and it added up to a big win for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Towns had 34 points and 11 rebounds, Rubio added 13 points and a season-high 15 assists, and the Timberwolves snapped a four-game losing streak with a 101-92 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night. ""The team was struggling lately and everybody had to do a better job in the fourth quarter, and I think we did today,"" said Rubio, whose team has lost 12 games after leading by double digits this season, including a two-point home defeat against Utah on Saturday. ""We've been doing a pretty good job for three quarters all season, but the fourth quarter is just different. It's when you win games."" Harrison Barnes scored 30 points for the Mavericks and Dirk Nowitzki had 26, including five 3-pointers. ""We were never able to control Towns, obviously,"" Nowitzki said. ""He got too deep some; just never really had an answer for him."" The Timberwolves shot 56.3 percent from the floor, with Towns (15 for 19) leading the way. He got off to a scorching start, shooting 8 of 9 in the first quarter. Towns scored Minnesota's first seven points and 16 total in the first seven minutes. He finished with 20 in the period as the Timberwolves took a 33-14 lead after one quarter. ""I guess it was my lucky day,"" Towns said. ""I just found good ways to find ways that they couldn't double-team me in spots where it was very difficult to double-team me."" Rubio scored nine points in the fourth quarter, including consecutive baskets during an 8-0 run that gave the Timberwolves some breathing room after Dallas had whittled a 21-point lead to 81-77. His three free throws put the Wolves up by 14 with 2:08 to play, effectively sealing the game. ""I thought Ricky had great command of the game with his dribble penetration, and I thought he made great reads early with Karl,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""That got Karl going. And he settled us down in the fourth."" After Minnesota took a 44-23 lead in the second quarter, the Mavericks responded with a 15-2 run to get back in the game. Nowitzki hit 3-pointers on three straight possessions to close the first half as Dallas pulled to 54-46 at the break. But in the end, it was another stinging blow for the Mavericks, who lost to Atlanta in similar fashion on Saturday. ""Yeah, it's tough, because both these games, they played out the same way,"" Barnes said. ""You got down. You battled back. You got an opportunity to kind of get on top, and you fall back into the same routine."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas had won seven straight against the Timberwolves, including four in a row at Target Center. This was their first meeting of the season. ... Nowitzki topped his previous season high of four 3-pointers. The last time he had six in a game was April 1, 2014. ... Andrew Bogut missed the fourth quarter with an injured hamstring. Timberwolves: Towns scored 20 points in a quarter for the second time in his career. He had 22 in the first quarter against New York on Nov. 30. ... Zach Lavine left early in the fourth with a bruised left hip and did not return. Lavine grabbed Devon Harris to get called for a foul, then limped off the court and into the Minnesota locker room. Thibodeau said Lavine would be re-evaluated at practice on Tuesday. ... Shabazz Muhammad scored in double figures off the bench for the sixth time in his last eight games, finishing with 11 points in 20-plus minutes. DIRK DIGS DEEP Nowitzki played more than 30 minutes in a game for the first time this season. He's missed a total of 25 games this season due to a strained right Achilles and a handful of other injuries and illnesses. ""It's still a work in progress, but it's a lot better than I was a week ago,"" Nowitzki said. ""Just got to keep working, got to be a little better on both ends and help the fellas."" PLAYOFFS? Yes, the Timberwolves climbed out of the Western Conference cellar with the victory. But in a wide-open race for the eighth playoff spot in the West, Minnesota is just three games back in the loss column. ""It's amazing how long the season is,"" Towns said. ""We have so much time. Don't count us out at any time."" But the veteran Rubio added a word of caution. ""We've still got time but we've got to hurry up,"" he said. ""The window is closing.""","400899991"
"WASHINGTON -- John Wall fumed as Denzel Valentine celebrated a big 3-pointer Tuesday night. Then the Washington Wizards star warned the Chicago Bulls rookie: ""You woke a monster up."" The Wizards rallied, and Wall hit a game-winning jumper with 5.9 seconds left as Washington defeated Chicago 101-99 to move above .500 for the first time in more than a year. Wall finished with 26 points and 14 assists to overshadow Valentine, who posted career highs with 19 points and five 3-pointers. After Valentine's last 3, he had the nerve to dance near the halfcourt circle with Chicago up 92-85 with 7:38 to play. ""I just walked over there and as I was coming out of the huddle I said, `That's how you feel?"" Wall recalled. ""And I said, `You woke a monster up."" Marcin Gortat had 10 points and 12 rebounds for Washington. He also set the screen that freed up Wall for his tiebreaking jumper to seal a 10th straight home win. Markieff Morris and Bradley Beal each added 19 points for the Wizards, who completed their biggest comeback victory of the season after trailing by 18 in the second quarter. ""Exhausting,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of the first half. ""Tonight we relaxed and gave guys open 3s and they made them."" Chicago was missing leading scorers Jimmy Butler (ill) and Dwyane Wade (resting). Bulls forward Nikola Mirotic also sat out with an illness. Taj Gibson finished with 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Bulls. Rajon Rondo added 12 points in his first game since Dec. 30, when coach Fred Hoiberg began keeping the healthy four-time All-Star on the bench. ""I thought he went out there and played his role exactly as we needed him to,"" Hoiberg said of Rondo. ""He was impressive going to the basket, getting shots at the rim. ... I thought he did a good job organizing us, getting us into offense."" After Wall had a basket and an assist during a 10-0 response to Valentine's 3, the Bulls regained the lead before Wall's pull-up from near the foul line tied it at 99 with 47.4 seconds left. Chicago's Michael Carter-Williams missed a contested shot on the other end with about 30 seconds left. Wall got the ball after Otto Porter's rebound, took Carter-Williams into Gortat's screen on the right wing and hit a 16-footer over Robin Lopez's late-arriving outstretched arm. After a timeout, Doug McDermott missed a long 3-pointer for the Bulls, and Wall grabbed the rebound with a second to go. ""I've been in that situation plenty of times where I've missed that shot, and didn't have the confidence to even take it,"" Wall said. ""But I felt confident with that one, and I'm glad we got a stop when we did."" RONDO RETURNS Before the game, Rondo said he was told by a member of the Chicago coaching staff that Hoiberg was ""saving me from myself"" by benching the four-time All-Star for the past five games. Rondo was surprised by the comment and said he did not understand it. ""Save me from myself?"" he said. ""I've never heard that before in my life. I guess he was trying to do the best thing for me."" Rondo hadn't played since posting a plus-minus rating of minus-20 during 11 first-half minutes in Chicago's 111-101 loss at Indiana on Dec. 30. He averaged 7.2 points, 7.1 assists and 6.5 rebounds over 29 games before falling out of favor. Hoiberg declined to elaborate but said he expected Rondo to play again Thursday.

"TORONTO --  Faced with the possibility of their longest losing streak in over a year, DeMar DeRozan and the Toronto Raptors finally hit their stride. DeRozan had a season-high 41 points and Toronto overcame a late 16-point deficit to beat the Boston Celtics 114-106 on Tuesday night. The win snapped Boston's four-game winning streak and helped Toronto avoid a three-game skid. ""You're going to lose games in this league,"" DeRozan said after pulling down a career-high 13 rebounds. ""But you don't want to make it more than one."" The Raptors bounced back after losing to Chicago and Houston over the weekend and haven't lost three straight since a West Coast trip in November 2015 when they come up short in Sacramento, Utah and Golden State. Toronto also kept itself above Boston in the Eastern Conference standings. A win would have pulled the Celtics even with the Raptors for second place behind Cleveland. Raptors coach Dwane Casey called the game a ""bloodbath."" Toronto prevailed on the boards, 50-33, thanks largely to Jonas Valanciunas. The Lithuanian center had a career-high 23 rebounds to go with 18 points. The rebounding helped fuel Toronto's 19-4 run over the final 5:05 to overturn what had been a 102-95 deficit. ""He had some sticky stuff on his hands today so he caught everything that came off the rim,"" DeRozan said of his teammate. ""He gave us the opportunity to have those possessions and get back in the game."" Boston led from the second quarter until Kyle Lowry's 3-pointer with 2:41 to play gave the lead back to Toronto. The Raptors had pulled within four at the end of the third quarter, mainly on the strength of DeRozan's 19 points in those 12 minutes, but Celtics coach Brad Stevens said the end of both the third and the fourth quarters proved costly. ""The last six minutes of the third crushed us, and the last six minutes of the fourth,"" he said. ""I think it was like 42-15 or something in those timeframes."" Isaiah Thomas had 27 points for Boston. ""We gave them fouls and offensive rebounds. They took advantage of that,"" Thomas said. ""That's probably the big thing.

Toronto is now 3-0 wearing the uniforms. THREE AND OUT After making at least 17 3-pointers in its last four games, the Celtics had a chance to tie the NBA record of five, set by Houston earlier this season. They came up short, converting just 9 of 27 shots from beyond the arc. BENCH BATTLE Because the Cleveland Cavaliers coaching staff is prohibited from working the All-Star Game in consecutive seasons, staffs from Toronto and Boston are vying to represent the Eastern Conference for the game next month in New Orleans. The reward goes to whichever team has the best record after Feb. 5. ""That's a real honor to be part of a team that's in a position to do that,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said.

"NEW YORK -- On paper, this one appeared to be a mismatch. On the court, that's exactly how it played out. Dennis Schroder had 19 points and 10 assists, Dwight Howard added 14 points and 16 rebounds, and the Atlanta Hawks won their season-high seventh straight game with a 117-97 victory Tuesday night over the skidding Brooklyn Nets. Paul Millsap added 14 points for Atlanta, which led the entire way and has won eight of its last nine road games. Kris Humphries had 13, Malcolm Delaney scored 12 and Thabo Sefolosha finished with 10. ""Everybody was on the same page,"" Schroder said. ""It was great to win."" Brook Lopez scored 20 points for the Nets, who have lost seven in a row and 12 of 13. Bojan Bogdanovic added 16 and Sean Kilpatrick 14. ""Well, you feel a bit for (Nets coach) Kenny Atkinson tonight. Brooklyn is trying to build something here,"" said Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer, who had Atkinson on his staff in Atlanta for three years. ""I care so much about him and I want good for him, so it is a little bit hard."" Lopez's 3-pointer brought the Nets to 89-78 with 9:44 left.

Harden has five triple-doubles in the past seven games and is averaging 32.4 points, 11.4 assists and 9.9 rebounds during this winning streak. Harden got his 11th triple-double this season and 20th in his career. Tuesday's performance comes after he had 40 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in a win over Toronto on Sunday to make him the fourth player in NBA history with at least 40 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in consecutive games. Pete Maravich, Michael Jordan and Russell Westbrook are the three others to do it. ""As long as I play the right way and be unselfish and we win games, all that is going to come,"" Harden said. ""I don't think about it too much. If it happens, it happens and the most important thing is winning and it's been a total turnaround from last year to this year ... so (win) and great things will come."" The Rockets missed 10 straight shots and let an 18-point lead evaporate before coach Mike D'Antoni called a timeout with 2:26 left. Ryan Anderson made Houston's first shot in more than four minutes with a 3-pointer out of the timeout, and after a block on the other end, Harden's layup put Houston up 115-111 with just over a minute to play. Kemba Walker cut the deficit to one with a 3-pointer, but another layup by Harden made it 117-114 with 28.6 seconds left. Charlotte missed three 3-point tries in the final seconds. Walker had 25 points for the Hornets, who dropped their third straight. ""It's going to come down to the basic principles and those are things that until this year that we were really good at,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""And if we want to win, we'll get back to that."" Houston led by 18 after a 3-pointer by Corey Brewer with about eight minutes remaining. A 21-2 run by the Hornets followed and put them ahead 111-110 with about 2½ minutes left. Frank Kaminsky got that run going by scoring the first five points and made two 3-pointers later in that stretch, including the one that put Charlotte on top. TIP-INS Hornets: F-C Cody Zeller sat out with an illness. ... G Nicolas Batum missed his second straight game with a hyperextended right knee. ... Williams had 16 points and Kaminsky had 22. Rockets: G Eric Gordon missed the game with a sprained left big toe. ... Trevor Ariza had 16 points. ... Houston led by as many as 23 points. ... The Rockets had 25 fast-break points to just two by Charlotte. CAPELA GETTING CLOSER Rockets C Clint Capela is making progress in his recovery from a fractured left fibula. Capela, who was injured on Dec. 17, said Tuesday that he is still on schedule to return in four to six week from when he was injured. ""(I feel) way better, because when it happened I wasn't even able to walk and now I can run,"" he said. ""So in my mind I'm really ready to go. Of course I still have like a couple of weeks in front of me before I come back. But I'm so focused on what I'm doing and I'm really excited.""","400899995"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Milwaukee Bucks had little to show for their attempts to improve in late-game situations this season. Until they took on San Antonio. Michael Beasley scored a season-high 28 points in place of an ill Giannis Antetokounmpo, and the Bucks rallied to beat the Spurs 109-107 on Tuesday night. Milwaukee erased a six-point deficit in the final five minutes to snap San Antonio's nine-game winning streak at home. ""We were owed this game,"" said Jabari Parker, who had 22 points and seven rebounds. ""We've had so many opportunities when we let (them slip) out of our hands, but this game really got us over that hurdle that we've been asking for the past two months."" Coming off a third-quarter swoon in a 107-101 loss Sunday to Washington, Milwaukee battled through another tough fourth quarter. ""I think this game showed a lot of character and resilience,"" Beasley said. ""It showed that we are working. We are trying to get better at late-game situations."" Despite getting little from Antetokounmpo, the Bucks overcame Kawhi Leonard's 30 points and a 13-point deficit in the first half. Parker's layup with 2:56 remaining gave Milwaukee a 103-101 lead, its first since the 3:24 mark of the first quarter. After a pair of free throws by Beasley, the Spurs reclaimed a 107-105 lead on consecutive 3-pointers by Davis Bertans and Danny Green. Bucks rookie Malcolm Brogdon hit a 3 to give Milwaukee a 108-107 edge. ""Just shoot your open shot, shoot them with confidence,"" Brogdon said. ""If it goes in, great. If it doesn't, you shot it with confidence and that's what your team wants you to do."" Brogdon sank one of two free throws with 6.7 seconds to go, making it 109-107. Leonard kicked the ball out to Manu Ginobili, but the veteran's 3-pointer hit the side of the backboard at the buzzer. ""Kawhi made a good play,"" Ginobili said. ""Nothing to add. A terrible shot. Miss."" The Bucks celebrated their first win in San Antonio since Dec. 30, 2008, snapping a six-game losing streak. And they did so without their leading scorer and rebounder for most of the night. Antetokounmpo, who missed Milwaukee's previous game, started despite having a fever at morning shootaround. He was scoreless for the first time this season, missing his only three attempts, and had two rebounds and two assists in nine minutes. Beasley responded with 22 points in the second half, shooting 9 for 13 from the field in the final two quarters. He also had three of his season-high four assists in the second half, including one on Brogdon's decisive 3. ""He was terrific,"" Brogdon said. ""He was the heart and soul for us tonight. We leaned on him like we lean on Giannis and he came through. He stepped up."" The Spurs were without LaMarcus Aldridge, sidelined with a stomach virus similar to the one that kept Leonard out for two games in the final week of December. Green, Tony Parker and Jonathon Simmons had 14 points each for San Antonio, but defensively the Spurs allowed the Bucks to shoot 52 percent from the field and on 3-pointers. ""Beasley was great,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""We never stopped him, but in general our defense was not up to par."" TIP-INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo's scoreless outing ended a 14-game streak of at least 22 points for the 6-foot-11 forward. ... Beasley, who was listed as probable with a bruised left shin, finished 11-for-18 shooting. His previous season high was 19 points against Memphis on Nov. 12. ... Brogdon started his seventh straight game after coming off the bench in the team's first 30 games. ... Jason Terry got his usual jeers from Spurs fans, who still have not forgiven the guard for his many ""jet takeoffs"" against San Antonio during successful playoff runs with Dallas. Spurs: Leonard has scored in double figures in 70 consecutive games, the Spurs' longest streak since Tim Duncan had 75 straight in 2004-05. ... F David Lee had 10 points and seven rebounds in 26 minutes while starting in place of Aldridge. ... San Antonio is on a similar pace to last season, when it set a franchise mark with a 67-15 record. At 30-8, the Spurs are two games off last season's pace. ... San Antonio has led by at least 15 points in 21 games this season compared to 25 such leads through 38 games in 2016. BIG NIGHT Jabari Parker called the victory his best game since college. When pressed to explain, he amended his statement to say it was his best since Milwaukee beat Golden State 108-95 on Dec. 12, 2015. Parker had 19 points in that game. While the third-year forward from Duke has had more prolific scoring performances, the Bucks have not had many big wins. ""You've got to remember, we lost a lot last year,"" Parker said. ""It wasn't a good year for us, but hopefully this can get us in the right direction.""","400899996"
"SALT LAKE CITY -- Even if Gordon Hayward isn't concerned with his All-Star candidacy, he put a signature performance on his resume in a huge win for the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night. Hayward went blow for blow with LeBron James in the second half to help Utah beat the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers 100-92. Hayward scored 28 points and went back and forth with the four-time MVP during a decisive third quarter. James brought the Cavs back from a 15-point halftime deficit before Hayward drove the lead back to 14. ""His level being so high consistently is what's separating him right now,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""He had big games last year at various times last year. But he's up at that level more for longer periods during the game. ""That's the next level that he found tonight, understanding how to attack a defense. Not just how to attack one guy."" Hayward had 11 points while the Jazz used a 16-0 run midway through the quarter to lead 74-60. The Cavs had a 17-0 roll after halftime thanks to an aggressive James and his 13 third-quarter points. Trey Lyles had eight straight points, including a pair of 3-pointers, in the fourth quarter to help the Jazz hold on. ""Studying the film, doing some extra work before the games has helped me out, and after the games,"" Hayward said. ""Stuff that I didn't used to do. The little things like that have definitely transferred over. ""Going over matchups, going over how guys defend, how teams defend, what I can do better from the last time we played them. Different things like that."" James finished with 29 points and Kyrie Irving added 20 for the defending champs. The Jazz led 56-41 at halftime after closing the second quarter on a 10-0 run highlighted by Hayward's alley-oop and 3-pointers from George Hill and Rodney Hood. Utah dominated the second quarter 27-12 while shooting 50 percent in the first half. Cleveland's 12 points were a team season-low for a quarter ""When we got down so much, we had to play so hard to come back,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said, adding ""we used so much energy in the third quarter. We should have started the game that way."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland is 8-3 against Western Conference opponents. ... The Cavs shot just 36.5 percent and 29.0 percent from behind the arc. ... James is 5-9 on the road against the Jazz. ""I feel great in this arena all the time,"" James said. ""You talk about the altitude. I don't really get that tired for some odd reason. I've had some pretty big quarters, but it's never on the winning side."" Jazz: Rudy Gobert posted his franchise-best 25th consecutive game with 10-plus rebounds (14). He added 11 points for his 27th double-double this season. ... Hood scored 18. DEBUT Kyle Korver made his first appearance with the Cavs after being traded in a deal that sent Mike Dunleavy, Mo Williams, a protected first-round pick and cash to the Hawks. He scored two points and grabbed three rebounds in 17 minutes. ""I've always felt the better the players are around me, the better I can be,"" Korver said. ""And this is the most talented team I've ever been on."" HEALTHY The suddenly healthy Jazz started Hill, Hood, Hayward, Derrick Favors and Gobert for just the sixth time this season. The Jazz are now 5-1 when that unit starts. ""It's different, that's for sure,"" Snyder said about having the full roster available. ""I hesitate to say it's more challenging. It's different for the players, too. We'll have to find out more about ourselves and guys individually and how they play together."" QUOTABLE ""First thing I told him when he walked in the locker room the other day was, `If you want to fit in, shoot the ball every time you get it,"" James said of Korver. ""Soon as it touches your hand, shoot it. We don't care.' ""We've got about four guys who have the ultra-green light. J.R. (Smith), Kev (Love), now Kyle, Channing (Frye) and Champ (James Jones). And then you've got green lights for Kyrie. Then you have like a flashing light for myself. I've got to make sure I get everybody involved so I can decide if I want to stop at the light or I can just cruise through there. So, the fluorescent light guys, they can do whatever they want. They have no other responsibilities besides let it go.""","400899997"
"LOS ANGELES -- If there's a mystery to it, the Los Angeles Lakers can't solve it. They can only seem to repeat the same story over and over. Play the Portland Trail Blazers, lose to the Portland Trail Blazers. It happened yet again, with the Blazers using a dominant third quarter to defeat the Lakers for the 10th consecutive time, 108-87 on Tuesday night. The Blazers trailed by two to start the second half, but held the Lakers to 21.7 percent shooting (5 of 23) and blocked four shots in the third quarter, outscoring Los Angeles 23-12. ""I'm still trying to figure out exactly what happened in the second half,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""I was shocked."" C.J. McCollum led the Blazers with 25 points, but Damian Lillard sparked the third-quarter rally. After starting the game 0 for 8 from the field, Lillard scored 11 points in the third, perhaps inspired by a double technical on him and Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell when they exchanged brief but heated words. ""Don't poke the bear,"" said Portland forward Maurice Harkless, who had 14 points. ""Let him sleep."" After scoring 31 points in the second quarter, the Lakers managed only 30 more in the second half. ""I really didn't recognize that team,"" Walton said. Luol Deng led the Lakers with 14 points, but did not make a field goal after the first half. Russell was 4 of 14 on the night, finishing with nine points, eight rebounds and six assists. ""A little incident happened and then they turned up the pressure,"" he said. ""They started making shots, started getting stops and we didn't."" The Blazers shot 50.6 percent. Harkless hit all but one of his six field goal attempts and blocked three shots. Al-Farouq Aminu had 15 rebounds, and Evan Turner added seven assists off the bench. ""I was really pleased with our defensive effort in the second half,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""Particularly in the third quarter, we did a really nice job in a lot of different areas."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: When guard Allen Crabbe scored 30 points Sunday against Cleveland, he became the first Portland player to score 30 off the bench since Jamal Crawford went for 34 on April 11, 2012. ... Mason Plumlee's 10 rebounds and 12 assists vs. the Cavs made him the first Blazers forward or center to have a double-double in those categories since Mychal Thompson on Jan. 6, 1984. Lakers: G Lou Williams leads the team in scoring (17.9 points per game) off the bench. He could become only the second Lakers reserve to lead the club in scoring. The other was Nick Young, three seasons ago. ... Los Angeles' bench remains the NBA's best offensive unit (49.1 points per game). LAMAR ODOM Walton seemed hesitant to discuss any possible role with the team for the former Lakers star in the future. But the coach said he had been in contact with the 37-year-old Odom and would not rule out him joining the Lakers later in some coaching capacity. ""I think when he's ready, he would be great,"" Walton said. Odom reportedly completed a monthlong substance-abuse program at a San Diego rehab facility Thursday.","400899998"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Without Klay Thompson and all he does to keep a defense honest, the Golden State Warriors struggled to produce the zippy passing that regularly leads to open perimeter looks and easy baskets in the paint. It all came together in the closing minutes -- just in time. Stephen Curry had 24 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, Kevin Durant added 28 points and Golden State finished in its typical, impressive fashion to beat the Miami Heat 107-95 on Tuesday night in another victory when the Warriors were hardly at their best. Durant also had eight rebounds and Draymond Green contributed 13 points, nine rebounds and five assists with no fouls in the Warriors' fifth straight win against the Heat and eighth in 10, including three in a row at home. ""I was rushing early on, I rushed five shots,"" said Durant, who missed his first five attempts. ""My first five shots were terrible looks. It was just bad to watch, for sure. I settled in and told myself I don't have to make up for Klay being out."" Thompson had the night off for rest after he played through illness the past two games. Coach Steve Kerr said he was worn down -- and Golden State sure missed him. ""I thought it took us a while,"" Kerr said. ""We're so used to Klay running off screens, and he's such a threat, he puts so much pressure on the defense with his shooting, so without him, it was a different feel, different look."" Hassan Whiteside had 28 points and 20 rebounds for the Heat, who were outscored 26-14 in the third quarter after leading 54-53 at halftime. Rookie Patrick McCaw made his first career start in Thompson's place and contributed a key 3-pointer in the third that put the Warriors ahead 67-60. While they finished with 28 assists, that lively passing game the Warriors have with Thompson on the court wasn't quite as crisp -- though one pretty sequence of several quick touches led to Ian Clark's key 3 on a pass from Andre Iguodala with 5:44 to go. Iguodala later dished to Clark again for a layup. ""They just run and bodies are just moving,"" Miami's Dion Waiters said. ""You look up and you think you have a stop here, a guy comes from here, he's swinging it."" Curry was 8-for-21 shooting and hit just 4 of 11 3-pointers as the Warriors shot 11 for 27 from beyond the arc and 45.3 percent overall. The two-time reigning NBA MVP fell short of a fourth straight game with 30 or more points. Golden State, which played its lone road game in 10 on Sunday with a bus trip to nearby Sacramento, again struggled to find an offensive flow while missing everything from layups to open 3s during stretches. Miami lost its third straight game and dropped to 1-4 on this six-game trip as coach Erik Spoelstra works to help his team find ""our identity on both ends of the court and doing it more consistently."" Whiteside's alley-oop dunk with 7:15 remaining pulled the Heat within 85-80 and forced a Warriors timeout. Tyler Johnson scored to make it a three-point game before the Warriors closed it out. QUOTABLE Kerr was asked about visiting the White House with Donald Trump as President if the Warriors were to win a championship. ""I certainly hope that we have to have that decision to make next year,"" he said. ""I'll move on to the next question."" TIP-INS Heat: Whiteside has eight or more rebounds in a career-high and franchise-best 50 straight games. ... The Heat have held opponents below 50 percent from the field in 33 of 40 games. ...

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  It took four tries for the Sacramento Kings to win for the first time on their much-anticipated, seven-game homestand. DeMarcus Cousins had 24 points, 13 rebounds and six assists to help the Kings stage a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback in defeating the Detroit Pistons 100-94 on Tuesday night. The Pistons led by as many as 18 points and were up nine entering the fourth, when they were outscored 32-17. The victory snapped a three-game losing streak for the Kings, who had lost five of six since winning a season-high four straight. ""Everyone did a great job in the second half. What got us going was defense,"" said reserve center Kosta Koufos, who scored eight of his 12 points in the fourth quarter. ""We understood that we had a slow start and it was obvious -- everybody could see what we needed to do. We knew we had to establish ourselves defensively."" Shooting well through three quarters, the Pistons went 7 of 20 in the fourth and mustered only two points in the final three minutes. Detroit had 38 second-half points after leading 56-43 following an effective first half. The Kings closed the game with an 11-2 run. ""They outrebounded us by 11, we gave them 13 3s and our ball movement was just ridiculous in the second half,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We're playing everything 1-on-1 and wouldn't pass the ball. That's why we ended up where we are."" Anthony Tolliver added 17 points, while Rudy Gay and Garrett Temple both finished with 11 for Sacramento. The Kings made four 3-pointers in the fourth and were 13 of 24 overall from beyond the arc, including 4 of 5 for Cousins. ""There were times when they certainly could have really run us out of the gym,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""We didn't put our heads down and we didn't quit. We found a rhythm with that (fourth-quarter) group. I thought Kosta was fantastic."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made six 3s and had 21 points for the Pistons, who had won two straight and three of four. Reggie Jackson had 19 points, Tobias Harris 18 and Andre Drummond added nine points, 12 rebounds and seven blocks. Temple's 3 with just under two minutes left gave the Kings their first lead since the opening quarter. Cousins hit another 3-pointer to put Sacramento ahead 98-94. Averaging 28.1 points per game, Cousins had only 55 over the previous three games while shooting 17 of 45. He scored 16 first-half points this time, then picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter but never got a fifth one. ""Cuz is the best big man in the NBA. He shows it night in and night out,"" Koufos said. MONEY TALKS There has been recent chatter that the Kings will make Cousins their franchise player this summer, an extension on his current contract that could be worth more than $200 million. ""Ya'll want me to be here?"" Cousins said, posing the question to the media. ""Well, guess what people? I'm here. We'll talk when it's time to talk."" TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit made its first three 3s and was 5 of 7 in the first quarter. The Pistons finished 12 of 27. ...

"PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid wrapped his hands around T.J. McConnell's neck, and let out a yell for a victory sweeter than the taste of endless rounds of Shirley Temples. With his team down 10 with 2:29 left, Embiid sparked a 76ers' rally like the franchise player Philly expects him to become. McConnell's baseline jumper for the win, well, that was just the cherry on top. McConnell shot at the buzzer gave the suddenly streaking Philadelphia 76ers a 98-97 victory over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. Embiid had 21 points and 14 rebounds to help the Sixers rally from a 17-point deficit and win for the fourth time in five games. ""Playoff time, baby,"" Embiid said. The postseason still seems a bit optimistic for the Sixers. But playoff hopes are crashing for the Knicks with their ninth loss in 10 games. Derrick Rose returned from a one-game hiatus and scored 25 points for the Knicks. Carmelo Anthony had 28. Rose showed why New York needs him on the court, two days after an unexcused absence. He missed Monday night's loss to New Orleans when he traveled home to Chicago without informing the team first. Rose stepped back for a mid-range jumper with 1:24 left that pushed New York's lead to 95-89, and he cut through the lane for an up-and-under bucket on Embiid that kept the lead at three. Embiid banked in a 3-pointer and had fans chanting ""Trust the Process!"" He followed with a layup to make it a one-point game and McConnell, who scored eight points, shot one over Anthony at the horn to send the crowd into a frenzy. ""We should tell ourselves this was unacceptable,"" Anthony said. Rose was absent Monday for what he described as family reasons. He said his trip to Chicago had nothing to do with basketball and he apologized to his teammates and Knicks management, telling them it won't happen again. ""I only missed one game,"" Rose said. ""If I felt like I needed more time, I would have talked to the front office. But I feel like everything is all right."" Rose insisted he simply left for the family matter and not because of any rift with the Knicks. ""The relationship I'm building with Phil (Jackson) and Steve (Mills), I wouldn't mind asking (for more time off) if I needed it,"" Rose said. ""I feel fine. What happened a couple of days ago, that's in the past."" Embiid is a huge part of Philly's future. He missed the final minutes of the first half with a sprained left ankle. Embiid, who missed two seasons recovering from injuries, returned in front of fans who were sipping his favorite Shirley Temple drink. Embiid has long been a fan of the sweet concoction of lemon-lime soda, grenadine and a maraschino cherry, and the Sixers sold the drink as part of a promotional push to get him an All-Star spot. Embiid got hooked on the drink during his lone season at Kansas. ""One night, I went out with my teammates. I don't drink alcohol so I wasn't drinking,"" he said. ""This girl walked up to me, she was talking to me, she was like, `Why aren't you drinking?' I was like, `I just don't drink, alcohol is nasty.' She was like, `I might have something for you.' She went and got a Shirley Temple. Then I was like, `Oh, OK.' Then I fell in love with it and since then, I've been drinking it."" TIP-INS Knicks: Whoops. The Knicks deleted a tweet that showed Rose talking to Anthony with the caption, ""Communication is key."" They reposted the photo with a caption that read, ""(at)carmeloanthony &amp; (at)drose chat in the huddle."" 76ers: Ben Simmons, the No. 1 overall draft pick, is making strides in his comeback from a broken right foot and he could make his season debut within the month. The Sixers, though, have not put a timetable on his return. He competed in 5-on-0 drills this week for the first time and has recently started traveling with the Sixers. Coach Brett Brown said Simmons could make the same impact as Embiid. ""We believe Ben is going to be in that same species, that same genre,"" he said. ""But we haven't seen him. You feel like that's going the way that we hoped that it would."" HE SAID IT ""In all my years of basketball, that was my first one,"" McConnell said of his buzzer-beater. ""If there was one in grade school, I can't remember it. I know there wasn't one in high school or in college either."" DERRICK AND THE BULLS Rose carried Chicago to the top of the Eastern Conference in the 2010-11 regular season, earning NBA MVP honors and leading the franchise to success it hadn't enjoyed since Michael Jordan took the Bulls to their last of six titles in 1998. Rose has struggled with injuries over the last four years, and Chicago dealt him to the Knicks on the eve of the NBA draft with a year left on his contract. He refused to dwell on his time with the Bulls, who visit New York on Thursday night. ""That's the past. Can't think about it,"" he said.","400900001"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook made fewer than a third of his shots and still dominated the Memphis Grizzlies. Oklahoma City's point guard posted his 18th triple-double of the season, and the Thunder defeated the Grizzlies 103-95 on Wednesday night. Westbrook shot just 6 of 19 and missed all seven of his 3-pointers, but finished with 24 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists for the 55th triple-double of his career. He already has matched his total from last season less than halfway through this one, and his 2015-16 total was the most for an NBA player since Magic Johnson had 18 during the 1981-82 season. Westbrook isn't just rolling up stats. The Thunder are 15-3 this season and 33-3 the past two seasons when he gets a triple-double. ""People can get wrapped up in numbers and talk about numbers, and the numbers don't reflect winning,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""When Russell has gotten the triple-doubles, we've won, and that's what he, I think, is most focused about."" Enes Kanter scored 19 points and Victor Oladipo added 16 for the Thunder, who won their third straight and avenged their worst loss of the season. Oklahoma City lost 114-80 in Memphis on Dec. 29, a game Westbrook was ejected from. Mike Conley scored 22 points, and Zach Randolph and Chandler Parsons each scored 14 for the Grizzlies. ""It was just one of them games, man,"" Randolph said. ""We couldn't hit shots, but we were still in the game. We didn't play good at all. It was one of them games. Give them credit. They hit shots and we didn't. We didn't execute down at the end and they won."" The Thunder led 55-44 at halftime, but Memphis pulled to 59-58 midway through the third quarter. Westbrook got his 10th assist on a pass to Oladipo for a 3-pointer as the Thunder tried to regain their footing. Oklahoma City closed the quarter strong and led 75-67 heading into the fourth. Westbrook clinched his triple-double when he snagged his 10th rebound on a missed free throw in the fourth. Thunder center Steven Adams got back to thwart a fast break, then blocked a 3-pointer by Conley. Oladipo made a 3 on the other end to put Oklahoma City up 93-86 with just more than a minute to play. Westbrook's teammates shot just under 50 percent from the field to make up for his rough shooting. ""Even with his numbers, it's really a complete and total team effort,"" Donovan said. ""Guys have got to put the basketball in the basket to get him assists. Steven and Enes screen to get him loose, to get him downhill to make plays. Everybody's kind of contributed."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Committed just three turnovers in the first half and 10 in the game. ... C Marc Gasol, the team's leading scorer at nearly 20 points per game, finished with nine on 4-for-12 shooting. Thunder: G Semaj Christon, a reserve who played regular minutes while Cameron Payne was out with a broken foot, was inactive and hasn't played in three games since Payne returned as Westbrook's backup.

"MINNEAPOLIS -- Andrew Wiggins scored 28 points, Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 18 rebounds, and Shabazz Muhammad scored 20 Wednesday night to help the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Houston Rockets 119-105. James Harden scored 33 points and had 12 assists for Houston, which saw its nine-game winning streak end. Ricky Rubio tied his own franchise record with 17 assists to go with 10 points. Wiggins carried Minnesota early, scoring 15 first-quarter points as the Wolves opened up an 11-point lead. Muhammad provided six quick points early in the second quarter and energized the crowd with a transition dunk. Ryan Anderson's 3-pointer gave Houston a 69-68 lead midway through the third quarter, but Minnesota followed with a 17-4 run capped by a thunderous dunk by Towns. The Wolves ended the third quarter leading 89-77. They started the final quarter scoring the first eight points to put the game out of reach.

"BOSTON --  Isaiah Thomas was good for three quarters and nearly unstoppable in the fourth. Thomas scored 20 of his 38 points in the final period and the Boston Celtics pulled away late for a 117-108 win over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. The Celtics won for the fifth time in six games and ended Washington's three-game winning streak. The game was physical throughout and got heated after the final buzzer as the talk continued and nearly escalated into something more. Boston's Jae Crowder pointed a finger toward Washington's John Wall as the two squared off near the Wizards bench. ""Just two teams playing hard,"" said Crowder, who had 20 points. Wall swiped at Crowder but appeared to miss, then the players were steered toward the locker rooms. Some needed more guidance than others, including Boston's Marcus Smart, who irritated and frustrated the Wizards throughout the game. Smart continued chattering away at the Wizards as he was escorted to the Celtics' tunnel, where police lined the hallways discouraging anything more. ""It's a physical team. We're physical. Neither one of us has to be pumped,"" said Bradley Beal, who led Washington with 35 points. ""It was just a physical game. That's all it was."" Smart and Beal got tangled up under the Washington basket and both fell to the floor in the third quarter. Officials and teammates separated the two as they got up and exchanged words. Smart was called for a foul and Beal received a technical. There were five technicals in all, two of them on Boston for three-second violations and the others for getting a little too physical. Al Horford added 16 points and nine rebounds for the Celtics. Crowder scored 20 and Terry Rozier had 11. Otto Porter Jr. scored 20 points for Washington, and Markieff Morris finished with 14. Boston held John to a season-low nine points. The star guard was playing with a jammed finger and sore wrist, but did have 10 assists for the Wizards, who fell to 19-19 a day after moving above .500 for the first time since November 2015. ""They made big plays at the end. We missed a lot of good-looking shots,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""They got physical. They got their hands on us. We couldn't get anything done and turned the ball over a few times."" The Wizards pulled ahead in the third quarter with an 11-3 run and led 79-69. Boston pulled to 85-83 at the end of the third and regained the lead early in the fourth on a three-point play by Thomas. Thomas scored eight straight points, including back-to-back 3s, to put Boston up 98-91, but the Wizards answered with their own 8-0 run to regain the lead. Porter gave the Wizards a 99-98 edge with 5:36 left, but Horford got it right back for Boston with 5:12 left to start a 13-0 run for the Celtics. Thomas followed with a layup and Rozier hit a 3 to put Boston up 105-99. After a miss by Beal, the Celtics took it the other way for another 3-pointer by Thomas for a 108-99 lead with 3:24 to go. Thomas was cheered on during his surge by buddy Floyd Mayweather Jr., the retired champion boxer sitting in the front row. Thomas added another 3 and Horford hit from beyond the arc for a 111-99 lead. I.T. AGAIN Thomas has scored at least 20 points in the past 23 games. ""It was impressive,"" Horford said. ""He's been playing as impressive as I've seen someone play."" SCORECARD Brooks said the postgame tensions were just the result of physical basketball. No punches were landed and everyone made it back to the locker rooms peacefully, although it will be interesting to see Smart and Beal face off again Jan. 24 in Washington. ""Both competitive players competing, and that's what you want your players to do,"" Brooks said. THE WIZ Brooks noted Wall's jammed finger and sore wrist didn't help his shooting. He was 4 for 21 and missed all five of his 3-point attempts. ""It's going to affect him a little bit in the next couple of weeks, but he's tough. He's not going to complain,"" Brooks said. ""That's what I love about him. I love that competitive spirit."" TIP-INS Wizards: Marcin Gortat had 10 points and nine rebounds. ... Beal scored 16 in the first period. ... Wall scored his first points with 5:54 left in the second quarter on a 16-foot jumper. Celtics: Boston shot 72 percent (13 of 18) from the floor in the first quarter, including 8 of 11 on 3-pointers, and led 36-35 after one. ... G Avery Bradley (right Achilles strain) was one of five players out for the Celtics. Also sidelined were James Young (right ankle sprain), Tyler Zeller (sinus infection), Amir Johnson (sprained right ankle) and Jaylen Brown (sprained ankle). Smart started at shooting guard for Bradley, and Jordan Mickey replaced Johnson for his first career start.","400900004"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Clippers are still without Blake Griffin. The way they've started 2017, it's hard to tell. J.J. Redick had 22 points and hit five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to help the Clippers hold off the Orlando Magic 105-96 on Wednesday night, improving to 5-0 since the year began. ""We feel like we can keep piling up wins,"" said Chris Paul, who added 18 points. Marreese Speights scored 10 of his 13 in the fourth, including three 3-pointers, on a night when the Clippers committed 21 turnovers. DeAndre Jordan grabbed 20 rebounds (to go with 10 points) for his NBA-leading sixth game with 20 or more. ""Mo plays with a lot of energy and excitement, and we feed off that and it gets everybody going,"" said Paul, who had five turnovers. ""I can't stand them,"" he said. ""That's five opportunities we didn't get to score. It could have hurt us down the stretch."" Aaron Gordon had 28 points, 18 in the first half, to lead Orlando, which has lost four in a row and six of seven. Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 12 rebounds for his team-high 18th double-double. Gordon scored 33 points in 40 minutes, both career highs, in a win over the Clippers on Dec. 14. ""This is a game that I thought we should have won by the way that we played,"" he said. ""We had a couple of breakdowns here and there, a couple of lapses in defensive execution, a few too many turnovers and it leads to a loss."" The teams kept it close in the fourth, when the Clippers never led by more than nine. Their bench carried them, with Redick and Paul the only starters who scored in the period. ""It felt like we just couldn't get away from them,"" Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. ""We just kind of hung in there."" With his team down 75-73, Jamal Crawford got fouled on a 3-pointer and made all three shots. ""That was huge,"" Paul said, ""and then we started getting some stops."" The Magic got to 92-90 on Gordon's 3-pointer before Speights and Redick answered with consecutive 3s. That steadied the Clippers, who got seven points from Paul down the stretch. ""We're playing with the right spirit and a lot of energy,"" said Paul, who recently returned from a strained hamstring. Orlando controlled the first 1 1/2 quarters behind Gordon's scoring and the Clippers' early turnovers. Los Angeles took over with a 20-8 run to close the half leading 56-51. Paul got the offense going with back-to-back baskets, Redick hit consecutive 3s and Jordan had two one-handed dunks in a row. His first came on Paul's alley-oop pass, and on the second he took Austin Rivers' pass and went flying through the lane. ""We have to have a defensive identity,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""We have to rely on our defense and that can carry you when shots are not going. We are continuing to try to establish that, but it hasn't taken shape yet."" TIP-INS Magic: F/C Serge Ibaka sat out with a sprained right shoulder. ... G Elfrid Payton started despite a bruised right quadriceps. Clippers: Paul surpassed 13,000 minutes played in a Clippers uniform in the first quarter, the 10th player in team history to do so. ... Austin Rivers was back in the starting lineup after missing Sunday's game with flu-like symptoms. The elder Rivers also returned after missing Tuesday's practice for what he said was the first time in his career with similar symptoms. GRIFFIN'S PROGRESS Griffin is on track to return to the Clippers this month after having knee surgery. The elder Rivers said Griffin ""feels great"" and his return is still based on the team's original estimate of four to six weeks. Griffin was averaging 21.2 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists before having arthroscopic surgery to remove loose bodies from his right knee on Dec. 20.","400900005"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- That 24-hour travel odyssey hardly took a toll on the Portland Trail Blazers. C.J. McCollum scored 27 points and the Trail Blazers shook off any fatigue caused by weather-related delays to beat the defending NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers 102-86 on Wednesday night. Allen Crabbe added 24 points off the bench for the Blazers, who have won four straight home games against the Cavs. Portland, playing the second of back-to-back games, led by as many as 24. A major snowstorm in the city Tuesday night sent the team from Los Angeles to Seattle and then finally to Portland. ""When we got up this morning and we were leaving Seattle, and we got on the plane and then the bus, there was just good energy around the team,"" star guard Damian Lillard said. ""We were laughing and we were joking and I think we were just tired so we were goofy and whatever. But before the game we huddled up and I said, `We're not tired. It's just mental, and this is a game that we've got to go out and get."" LeBron James had 20 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland (28-10). McCollum, who scored 21 in the second half, hit a 3-pointer that put Portland up 85-69 with just under nine minutes left, then gestured for the crowd to stand as the Cavaliers called a timeout. McCollum has had seven straight games with 25 points or more. A snowstorm that dumped as much as 14 inches on parts of Portland caused travel problems for both teams late Tuesday. The Cavaliers, who lost to the Utah Jazz 100-92 on Tuesday night, were delayed getting to Portland but finally arrived about 3 a.m. Wednesday. The Trail Blazers beat the Lakers in Los Angeles 108-87 on Tuesday night. The team's flight was sent to Seattle, and players spent the night there. They flew into Portland by midday Wednesday and stayed in a hotel to rest until game time. The Cavaliers got a scare with 1:21 left in the first quarter when Kevin Love collided slightly with Al-Farouq Aminu and fell to the ground, clutching his left knee. Love walked off the court under his own power and returned a short time later. The Cavs finished with just 14 assists -- compared to 16 turnovers. They shot 34 percent. ""You're not going to have assists if you're not making shots. If you shoot 34 percent, how many assists can you really get?"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""We need to do a better job of making shots but also a better job around the basket and in the paint. When we get in the paint, instead of taking tough shots we need to kick it out for open shots. We have to read and play the game the right way."" Portland led 49-41 at halftime, with Crabbe's 18 points leading all scorers. The storm, which started Tuesday evening, had dumped the most snow recorded in the city since 2008 by midnight, according to the National Weather Service. When Wednesday's total is included, it might be the city's biggest snowfall of the 21st century. Gov. Kate Brown and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler both issued a state of emergency. The Blazers encouraged fans to use their best judgment when deciding whether to attend the game, and the crowd to see the defending NBA champions was surprisingly large. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Lue was asked before the game how he felt James has been getting calls this season. ""Next Question,"" Lue said. ... With his second assist of the game, James passed Tim Hardaway for 15th on NBA's career list with 7,095. Trail Blazers: When the Blazers played the Cavaliers on Nov. 23, Love finished with 40 points after scoring 34 in the first quarter. Before this matchup, Portland coach Terry Stotts half-joked: ""If we hold Kevin under 20 in the first quarter, that'll be a good start."" Love had eight points in the first. MILESTONE It was Stotts' 200th victory with Portland. He became the fourth coach in team history to reach the mark. ""I'm very proud of it,"" Stotts said. ""A lot of players and coaches went into it. If you had told me in 2012 that I'd have 200 wins, I don't know if I'd have believed you."" KORVER'S ACCLIMATION Kyle Korver made his Cavs debut against Utah, playing 17 minutes and scoring two points. Against the Blazers, he had two points in 25 minutes and was 1 for 5 from the field. ""We're going to try to do some things that he's good at, ways to cut and get him open,"" Lue said. ""But we have to find the right combination of guys on the floor with him. It's going to be some work for me to try to figure out, but right now, just play the game.""","400900006"
"NEW YORK --  Even minus Anthony Davis, the New Orleans Pelicans made it a New York City sweep. Playing without their All-Star center, the Pelicans got a season-high 29 points from Tyreke Evans and 24 points and 12 rebounds from Terrence Jones as they defeated the reeling Brooklyn Nets 104-95 on Thursday night. Davis sat out with a bruised left hip sustained during Monday night's 110-96 win over the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. He was on the floor for pregame warmups in Brooklyn, but didn't shoot. Davis is second in the NBA in scoring, averaging 29.1 points. He ranks sixth with more than 12 rebounds per game. ""With AD out, I knew I was going to have to bring a presence on the defensive end and defensive rebounding,"" Jones said. ""I just tried to help us get stops so we could get out and run in transition and get easy, early offense."" Jrue Holiday added 21 points and Solomon Hill had 14 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans (16-24), which closed the game on a 13-1 run. The Pelicans improved to 6-13 on the road by winning both games during their stay in the Big Apple. Brook Lopez led the Nets with 20 points and Sean Kilpatrick added 18, but they've dropped eight straight and 13 of 14. Brooklyn (8-30) owns the worst record in the NBA. Brooklyn led 94-91 after Lopez's basket with 3:35 left, but didn't score again until Joe Harris hit one of two free throws with 23 seconds to go for its final point. ""I thought Tyreke Evans did a really good job attacking the basket. That's kind of what he is,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""Defensively, we just locked in and did exactly what we needed to do down the stretch."" Jones contributed six points in the 13-1 run to end the game, including the go-ahead basket with 2:44 remaining. ""I think it was a mix of us not executing and they had some guys who made some big-time plays,"" Harris said. ""Tyreke did really well late in the game. He took over."" Trevor Booker gave the Nets their largest lead, 56-48, with 1:51 left in the second quarter. Brooklyn used a 10-2 spurt in the third to open a 77-70 advantage and was ahead 79-73 heading into the fourth. Evans tied it at 84 on a three-point play with 8:29 to go, and the score remained close until the Pelicans' late surge. ""It's tough because we gave ourselves a chance for so long in this game,"" Lopez said. Harris finished with 15 points, while Caris LeVert and Bojan Bogdanovic each scored 10 for the Nets. TIP-INS Pelicans: Buddy Hield is the only New Orleans player to see action in all 40 games this season. He has started exactly half of them. ... Nets GM Sean Marks played for New Orleans from 2008-10, appearing in 74 games and averaging 2.7 points and 2.8 rebounds. Nets: Booker returned to Brooklyn's starting lineup after missing Tuesday's loss to the Hawks with a bruised left hip. ... Kilpatrick is the second-leading scorer (14.8 points per game) of any current undrafted NBA player. Only Wes Matthews of the Mavericks (15 ppg entering Thursday) has a higher average. NEW YORK, NEW YORK The Pelicans spent nearly all week in New York City. ""If we're here any longer, we're going to have to take out a small business meal loan to continue to eat,"" Gentry said. ""Obviously, this is a great city. You can do a million things here and have a million left to do."" OH FOR 2017 The Nets have yet to win since the calendar turned to the new year. Brooklyn has won only once (on Dec. 26, 120-118 over Charlotte) in almost a month. The team's previous win was a 107-97 victory over the Lakers on Dec. 14 EIGHT IS ENOUGH The Nets' eight-game losing streak ties the Pelicans, 76ers and Lakers for the longest in the NBA this season. However, Philadelphia has won four of five, the Pelicans have won two straight and the Lakers had won two of three before Thursday night's loss in San Antonio.","400900007"
"NEW YORK -- To Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah, it didn't matter much that they were playing their former team. At this point, the New York Knicks just needed to beat somebody. Carmelo Anthony had 23 points, nine rebounds and six assists, Rose and Noah had big games against Chicago, and the Knicks beat the short-handed Bulls 104-89 on Thursday night. ""Tonight's game was because it was the next game,"" Rose said. ""We were desperate to win and I'm just happy that we got the win."" Rose scored 17 points in his return to Madison Square Garden after skipping the last game here, and Noah finished with 12 points and 15 rebounds as the Knicks snapped a three-game losing streak. Rookie forward Mindaugas Kuzminskas had a season-high 19 points. The Knicks bounced back from a loss at the buzzer in Philadelphia on Wednesday to win for the first time this season on the second night of back-to-back games. Dwyane Wade scored 22 for the Bulls, who were missing star swingman Jimmy Butler, Nikola Mirotic and Denzel Valentine, all because of illness. They dropped their third straight. Playing without starting forward Kristaps Porzingis, New York won for just the second time in 11 games, a much-needed victory after the mystery surrounding Rose -- and then its second buzzer-beating loss of the month. ""I haven't been in situations like this too many times in my career, but I've definitely been in situations where there's been adversity and I think that today a lot of guys showed what they were made of,"" Noah said. Rose went home to Chicago on Monday without telling the team, returned to practice the next day and said his absence was for family reasons. The Knicks fined him but put him back in the starting lineup and he has played well in both games since. Rose was cheered during pregame introductions and then helped the Knicks race to an 8-0 lead. They pulled away by limiting Chicago to 14 points in the third quarter. Butler and Mirotic both missed their second straight game. Valentine felt sick at the arena and was sent back to the hotel. ""We've got three guys out. We don't have the luxury of missing key guys,"" Wade said. ""So hopefully Saturday, hopefully we don't have any more down. Hopefully Saturday we get at least one or two back."" The Bulls ended up giving little-used, little-known rookie Paul Zipser his first career start at forward. He had a season-high seven points in just his 11th appearance of the season. TIP-INS Bulls: Jerian Grant, traded to Chicago in the deal that brought Rose to New York, scored 14 points off the bench. ... Chicago was 3 for 18 (16.7 percent) on 3-pointers. Knicks: The Knicks are 1-7 on the second night of back-to-backs. ... Porzingis missed three games recently with the Achilles problem, and coach Jeff Hornacek said the injury could have contributed to Porzingis being short on his jumpers Wednesday, including the airball that led to the 76ers' winning shot. Hornacek said Porzingis had soreness and stiffness Thursday but there was no tear or sign of serious injury. ROSE'S RESPONSE Rose said he didn't think much about how the crowd would greet him, saying he's been booed in Chicago, too. ""I'm used to it and if they did boo me tonight it's no hard feelings,"" Rose said. ""I know this is sports and I know they're very passionate about their sports and like I said, I said sorry to my team, I apologized and that was something that will never happen again."" ZIPSER'S CHANCE Zipser had played in just one of the Bulls' five games this month, 10 all season and his high game was three points. But coach Fred Hoiberg said when he told the forward from Germany's Bayern Munich that he would be starting, ""He looked me right in the eye and said, `I'll be ready, Coach.""","400900008"
"SAN ANTONIO -- The Spurs responded as they traditionally do after a home loss, by blowing out their next opponent. The Lakers learned that the hard way, taking their worst defeat ever against San Antonio. Kawhi Leonard had 31 points despite sitting out the fourth quarter, and the Spurs set several season highs in rolling past Los Angeles 134-94 on Thursday night. ""You never want to lose two games in a row,"" Leonard said. ""You always want to come out and show a better effort and a better mentality than you had the last game."" San Antonio rebounded from a last-minute loss to Milwaukee on Tuesday with its highest point total and largest margin of victory this season. The Spurs also set a season high by shooting 61 percent from the field. ""Granted we didn't put up a ton of a fight, but it's beautiful to see championship teams,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""The way they came out after one loss. How that made them play. How sharp they were tonight. There's a lot to learn from being in that game and watching that game and being a part of that game."" Pau Gasol had 22 points, nine rebounds and six assists in 26 minutes for the Spurs. Gasol finished 9 for 9 from the field and was 4 for 5 on free throws. ""When he's making shots in the paint, he causes double teams,"" Leonard said. ""Then the ball starts moving around the perimeter and we get shots."" It was the second-worst loss this season for the Lakers, beaten by 43 points against Golden State on Nov. 23. Julius Randle had 22 points on 6-for-7 shooting, but he was the only Lakers starter in double figures. The Spurs' starters did not play in the final quarter after closing the third with a 31-point lead. San Antonio increased the advantage to 40 in the fourth, matching a season high. Tony Parker and LaMarcus Aldridge added 13 points apiece. San Antonio had 32 assists on 49 baskets, finishing six assists shy of matching its season high. ""I thought ball movement was great (for) both teams, first (and) second team,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Everybody really knew where the shooters were."" The Spurs also set a season high for points in any half with 72 in the opening two quarters. D'Angelo Russell fouled Leonard on an attempted heave from near midcourt with 0.3 seconds remaining in the first half, allowing the Spurs' forward to make three free throws and extend the lead to 72-54. ""We gave up too quickly,"" Walton said. ""We gave up as if, `Aw, this is going to be too hard for us tonight' type of attitude, which is not OK."" TIP-INS Lakers: F Larry Nance Jr. missed his 12th straight game with a bruised left knee. Nance has not played since scoring 10 points against Charlotte on Dec. 20. ... Randle (sprained left ring finger), Russell (sore left knee) and Tarik Black (sore right ankle) all played after being listed as probable. ... The Lakers' last win against the Spurs was Dec. 12, 2014. ... Jordan Clarkson, who attended high school in San Antonio, received warm applause when he first entered. Clarkson and Oklahoma State's Andre Roberson were teammates on the Wagner High School team that reached the state semifinals in Texas' highest classification in 2009 and 2010. Spurs: Danny Green was 1 for 3 on 3-pointers, giving him 796 for his career to move past former teammate Robert Horry for 142nd in NBA history. ... San Antonio has scored 100-plus points in 16 consecutive games, its longest streak since hitting the century mark in 22 straight in 1995. ... At 24.1 points per game, Leonard is the first Spurs player to average 24-plus since Tim Duncan in 2002. If he can maintain that average, Leonard will join Duncan, George Gervin and David Robinson as the only players in franchise history to do so. ... Parker has played in 1,110 games, moving past Rasheed Wallace for 59th on the career list. SOMETHING IN THE AIR San Antonio will play the Phoenix Suns in Mexico City on Saturday night as part of the NBA's efforts to globalize the game. Mexico City is 7,200 feet above sea level, but the Spurs are not overly concerned about adjusting to the higher altitude. ""The other team is not used to that altitude either, so it's pretty even,"" Popovich said. ""If we were playing the Mexican National Team, they'd have an advantage maybe with the altitude. The Phoenix Suns I think play at the same kind of altitude we do, so it's all the same."" NOT THERE YET San Antonio point guard Dejounte Murray finished with a season-high 10 points, shooting 2 for 2 on 3-pointers. The work that the rookie from Washington is putting in with Spurs shooting guru Chip Engelland seems to be paying off, but Popovich wants to keep everything in perspective. ""Chip works with me on my shot,"" Popovich said. ""He works with everybody. So, it's not surprising that he works with Dejounte. It's still early in the process. Just 'cause he made two 3s tonight, it doesn't mean that he's Chris Mullin."" PRIVATE AFFAIR Manu Ginobili paid tribute to former teammate Matt Bonner while also having some fun with the Spurs' recently retired forward. Ginobili posted a picture of a green flannel shirt hung in an empty locker with Bonner written in pen on three strips of masking tape and No. 15 in Spurs' numbers. ""In a very cozy and private ceremony, today we retired (at)MattBonner-SAS's flannel shirt. (hash)ThankYou15"" The Spurs retired Tim Duncan's jersey in an emotional ceremony last month, and this ""ceremony"" brought forth a different kind of emotion: laughter. ""Yeah, we had a couple of speeches. You guys missed them,"" Green said, attempting to stifle a smile. ""It was great, the guys that stepped up and spoke about him. Had some great things to say about him.""","400900009"
"LONDON -- Italian star Danilo Gallinari and the Denver Nuggets made themselves right at home at O2 Arena. Gallinari scored 18 points and had what coach Mike Malone said was easily his best game of the season to help Denver beat the Indiana Pacers 140-112 on Thursday night in the NBA's Global Games series. ""Just to come back to Europe and play in front of these fans, it was great,"" said Gallinari, who wore knee-high socks adorned with the Union Jack and London skyline. ""Hopefully, the fans had a good show."" The Nuggets snapped a five-game losing streak and ended the Pacers' five-game winning streak. ""I joked with our guys after the game, `I think we're going to stay here in London and play our home games here,"" Malone said. ""Our guys were very comfortable out there and we had one of our best performances."" Nikola Jokic had 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Wilson Chandler added 21 points for the Nuggets. They outscored the Pacers 39-20 in the third quarter, shooting 73.7 percent in the period to put it away. Denver trailed only once, when Kevin Seraphin gave the Pacers a 31-30 lead early in the second quarter, and finished with a season high in scoring. C.J. Miles had 20 points, and Jeff Teague added 14 points and nine assists for Indiana. The Pacers had won five in a row, scoring at least 120 points in each victory. ""We didn't show up tonight. I don't have a reason for that,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Denver, they came, showed up and played well, and I didn't think that we showed up tonight."" The Nuggets had conceded at least 120 points in each of their five losses, and when Malone asked players before the game what the key to victory would be, Gallinari who spoke up and said defense. Gallinari, matched one-on-one with Indiana scoring leader Paul George for much of the game, held his counterpart to just 12 points on 2-for-12 shooting. Gallinari made three 3-pointers in the first 3:08 to set the tone. Denver made six of its first 10 3-point attempts and finished 15 for 32 from the perimeter. Kenneth Faried added 15 points for Denver. He punctuated the Nuggets' dominance with an alley-oop from Jameer Nelson that brought the sellout crowd of 18,689 fans to their feet with 8:55 remaining. After conceding their only lead, Indiana held Denver within four points for much of the second quarter, but three careless fouls -- two by center Al Jefferson -- and a succession of converted free throws pushed the Nuggets back out on top. Jokic, who missed Denver's last game because of an illness, scored 11 points and had five rebounds in the third quarter alone. A minute after knocking down a pair of free throws, he hit a 3-pointer from the right, then made another jumper as part of a 14-4 run by the Nuggets. A RECORD MARGIN The game marked the fifth consecutive year the NBA has held a regular-season game in London and the seventh overall. In winning by 28 points, the Nuggets set a record for the largest margin of victory overseas, topping the 23-point victory by the Phoenix Suns over the Utah Jazz in Tokyo on Nov. 2, 1990. SEEING THE SIGHTS The teams arrived Monday and had the better part of the next three days to practice and see the sights. The Pacers visited Westminster Abbey, Kensington Palace and the Churchill War Rooms at the Imperial War Museum, while the Nuggets visited Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. AN EXPANDING REACH NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said before the game that the league is committed to increasing the number of regular-season games it plays internationally, but that the team doesn't have any firm plans at the moment to take games to new locations. One possibility Silver said the league is closely examining is holding a preseason game in Australia. TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana has beaten the Nuggets away from home since Nov. 27, 2007, now a span of eight games. ... Thaddeus Young, who entered averaging 1.42 steals this season, needed two to reach 1,000 in his career. He was not credited with a steal against Denver. Nuggets: Darrell Arthur sat out the game with soreness in his lower left leg. ... Juan Hernangomez, from Spain, received a round of applause upon entering the game for the first time with 3:18 left. He finished with four points.","400900010"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Klay Thompson didn't much care for sitting out a game even if he knows it will probably help him in the long run. He hung out in the locker room area Tuesday night watching with the video interns and drinking water and sports drinks to stay hydrated after dealing with an illness. ""It was a good time,"" he said sarcastically. Thompson certainly looked refreshed a couple of nights later. He returned from that one-game absence for rest and scored 23 points with four 3-pointers in another balanced Golden State performance as the Warriors beat the Detroit Pistons 127-107 on Thursday. ""It felt great to be out there. It was an unfamiliar feeling a couple nights ago,"" Thompson said. Stephen Curry scored 24 points, Kevin Durant had 25 points, nine assists and six rebounds, and Draymond Green dished out 13 assists for his fifth game in the last eight in double digits. Marcus Morris scored 21 points and Tobias Harris had 18 to lead the Pistons, who lost their second straight game. Curry, Durant and Thompson scored at least 20 points in the same game for the 13th time this season. The Warriors had 39 assists for their NBA-leading 27th game with 30 or more. Thompson shot 9 for 15 after sitting out Tuesday night against Miami because he was worn down after playing two games despite not feeling well. ""He's been playing a lot of basketball the last three years,"" Curry said. ""He definitely had a nice little spring in his step."" Ian Clark hit 3-pointers 7.9 seconds apart in the final minute of the opening period and finished with 14 points for his second consecutive game in double figures and ninth in all. The Warriors won their seventh straight at home against the Pistons dating to Feb. 27, 2010. It is Golden State's longest home winning streak against Detroit, topping a six-game run from 1974-76. The 21 lead changes in the first half were the most in any half this season, the Warriors said, citing research by the Elias Sports Bureau. ""There's going to be a stretch where they lock in,"" Detroit guard Reggie Jackson said. ""For some reason they have a four-to-eight-minute window where they really lock in defensively and as they continue to score, they find a way to get stops."" BAY AREA FIRE RELIEF The Warriors, Oakland Athletics and Oakland Raiders presented a $750,000 check to aid victims from last month's deadly warehouse fire in an on-court moment after the first quarter. On Dec. 2, 36 people died in the ""Ghost Ship"" warehouse fire. Warriors players and coaches pledged $75,000, while the three pro teams in the East Bay said they would match donations up to $50,000 -- and more than 3,600 individuals had contributed to the fund as of Thursday, according to the Warriors. The funds are being collected by the City of Oakland and the Red Cross. DAVIDSON COLLEGE REPRESENTS The Davidson College Chorale, a group of singers from Curry's college, sang the national anthem during its West Coast swing -- and the two-time reigning NBA MVP gave the men and women a wave and nod as they cheered when he took the court for pregame warmups. TIP-INS Pistons: Were outscored 41-19 in the third, the Warriors' ninth 40-point quarter. ... Detroit was outscored 29-2 on fast-break points and shot 6 for 28 from 3-point range. Warriors: On Friday night in Southern California, Thompson will have his jersey retired at Santa Margarita Catholic High -- the school's first jersey retirement for basketball. ""It's a huge honor for me,"" he said. ... Golden State is 12-1 vs. the Eastern Conference this season and also won at Detroit on Dec. 23. ... Andre Iguodala has gone a career-best five games without a turnover -- topping his previous best from Dec. 30, 2014, to Jan. 7, 2015. He leads the league in assist-to-turnover ratio. ...

"MEXICO CITY --  Deron Williams' savvy floor game helped the Dallas Mavericks offset Devin Booker's sensational shooting in Mexico City. Williams had 23 points and 15 assists, and the Mavericks defeated the Phoenix Suns 113-108 on Thursday night in the fourth regular-season NBA game played in Mexico. Williams shot 9 for 15 from the field in a matchup of struggling teams south of the border. Harrison Barnes added 22 points and Dirk Nowitzki scored 18 for the Mavericks, who broke a three-game losing streak. Williams has scored at least 20 points six times in his last 10 games. ""Deron had a great night, both as playmaker and as a scorer, and he was involved in key stops down the stretch,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""When a veteran guy like that has a night like that, it's a real advantage for your team. He was solid and did it in a spectacular fashion -- a sign of a great pro."" Booker scored 29 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter for the Suns. Tyson Chandler had 14 points and 19 rebounds against his former team. Phoenix took a 59-57 lead at halftime, but Williams hit a couple of 3-pointers and a jumper in a 17-4 run that gave the Mavericks a 76-63 lead with seven minutes left in the third quarter. The Suns pulled within four after a 3 by Booker with 13 seconds to play in the game, but Dorian Finney-Smith made two free throws to seal it for Dallas. ""We wanted to get a win. We were sitting on a three-game losing streak and Phoenix just beats us at home a couple of nights ago, so it was a good win for us"", Nowitzki said. ""We made a nice little run in the third quarter and we were able to get some separation, but you've got to give them credit. Devin Booker was fantastic in the second half. He made shot after shot and he kept them in the game. At the end it was a lot closer than we wanted to, but we made big shots ourselves."" Dallas and Phoenix are tied for the worst record in the Western Conference at 12-27. ""We are at the point of the season where it's make or break. Every game counts at this point of the season and we need to get wins,"" the 20-year-old Booker said. ""We have a really young team and they put us under fire, but we have a coach that trusts and believes in us."" The game was the first of two that the Suns will play south of the border. Mexico is hosting two games in one season for the first time in NBA history. The previous regular-season game in Mexico took place in 2015, when Boston faced Sacramento. Seth Curry scored nine points in the first quarter for the Mavericks, who took a 27-19 lead. Phoenix rallied and trailed just 32-29 after 12 minutes. In the second period, Leandro Barbosa had back-to-back baskets and the Suns took the lead, but Dallas tied it with a shot from Barnes. Marquese Chriss got a layup with 19 seconds to play, sending Phoenix into halftime with the lead. TIP-INS Suns: It was the fourth straight game with more than 15 rebounds for Chandler, matching the longest streak by a Phoenix player. Shawn Marion did it in 2006. ... Booker had his 12th career game with 30 or more points. Mavericks: Curry made his seventh start of the season. A TEAM IN MEXICO? Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said would support the idea of an NBA team in Mexico. Cuban praised the Arena Ciudad de Mexico, and added that the distance from the United States is not a factor. ""I would love a team down here. I think it would really help the sport,"" Cuban said. ""I would like to come back with the Mavericks, and every time that the NBA asks, we would love to be here."" Mexico City's governor, Miguel Angel Mancera, said earlier in the week that he supports the idea of an NBA team in Mexico. SUNS DON'T SHINE IN MEXICO Phoenix fell to 0-3 in Mexico -- sort of. The Suns dropped preseason games in 1996 and 2009 to the Utah Jazz and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively.","400900012"
"TORONTO --  Having toyed with the league-worst Brooklyn Nets for the first 36 minutes, the Toronto Raptors finally clicked into gear entering the fourth quarter. Leading 90-89, they went on a 21-2 run and matched a franchise high with 42 points in the fourth to emerge with a 132-113 victory Friday night. The Raptors had their biggest offensive output of the season and the most points scored in a non-overtime game in team history. ""We just got aggressive defensively and we just got on a run,"" said DeMar DeRozan, who sat out the entire fourth quarter after scoring 19 points in the third for the bulk of his 28 points. DeRozan's streak of three straight games with 35 or more points ended, though he emphasized he was ready to come back if needed. However, with Toronto shooting 60.7 percent from the field and fellow All-Star candidate and backcourt mate Kyle Lowry chipping in with 10 of his 20 points over the final 12 minutes, he wasn't needed. ""I play the whole third and I sit out and Kyle takes over the fourth until they put the Batman sign up and I've got to come into the game or something,"" he said. The victory was Toronto's sixth straight over Brooklyn, which matched Toronto's longest winning streak over the Nets, established between Jan. 28, 2009, and Dec. 17, 2010. After shooting just 26.7 percent from 3-point range through three quarters, Toronto knocked down 7 of 13 over the final 12 minutes. ""I think we had a unit in there just flying all around the court,"" Lowry said. ""We got out on transition and got some 3s to fall and it ended up a good fourth quarter for us."" It was much the opposite for Brooklyn, which lost its ninth straight overall and 16th in a row on the road, falling to 1-18 away from Barclays Center this season. Its lone win came at Phoenix on Nov. 12. Bojan Bogdanovic led the Nets with 23 points, his ninth game with 20 or more points this season, while Brook Lopez added another 20. With 16 lead changes over the first three quarters, Brooklyn was in this contest, but just couldn't maintain it for the full 48 minutes. ""I loved our first three quarters,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""The third-quarter rebounding was an issue, but I thought we played really good basketball so it's disappointing that we couldn't finish it in the fourth."" The Nets were outrebounded 49-35 and Toronto had a 56-34 edge in points in the paint. But containing the likes of All-Star candidates such as Lowry and DeRozan, and even Cory Joseph, who shot a perfect 7 of 7 from the field, is easier said than done. ""They all shoot the ball so well in the midrange, they all keep you honest and then they pass the ball out of that situation when you come to help,"" Lopez said. TIP-INS Nets: G Isaiah Whitehead (left knee) and G Jeremy Lin (left hamstring) both missed Friday's game. . The Nets remained both winless against their division (0-7) and all Eastern Conference teams (0-13) on the road. Raptors: F Patrick Patterson (left knee) sat out, with C Lucas Nogueira starting in his place. . The Raptors, division champions the last three seasons, are now 7-0 against Atlantic Division opponents this season. . Friday's game began a four-game stretch against teams under .500. POINT GUARD BY COMMITTEE With both Lin and Whitehead out, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said the team would have to share the ""point guard position by committee."" In their place, he said that Spencer Dinwiddie, Randy Foye and Sean Kilpatrick would all see some time at the position. TAKING IT SLOW While both F Jared Sullinger and G Delon Wright, out all year following surgeries, have been cleared to practice, Raptors coach Dwane Casey says it will be tough for them to return to game fitness, with limited practice time between games. ""It's going to be tough to get both of them back in,"" Casey said. ""Hopefully Delon will go down to the D-League and get some (game action) down there; Sully would have to agree to it to go down there, he can't be forced to go down there.""","400900013"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid scored 24 points, blocked three shots and led the Philadelphia 76ers to their third straight victory, 102-93 over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night. The Sixers are on their first three-game winning streak since they won four straight from Dec. 29, 2013 -- Jan. 4, 2014. Led by Embiid, the Sixers have won five of six games overall and are no longer the league laughingstock. Embiid made six of 12 shots, grabbed eight rebounds and has made basketball fun again in Philadelphia. Embiid waved his arms while fans chanted ""Trust the Process!"" at him at the free-throw line. Embiid, the rookie center, even heard ""MVP!"" chants in the final minutes for his role in transforming the Sixers over the last month from cellar dwellers to a competitive team. Embiid's only weakness was his 0-for-5 3-point shooting. Nicolas Batum scored 19 points and Kemba Walker had 17 for the Hornets. Embiid has brightened the Sixers' outlook the same way he lights up social media. Embiid and WWE star Triple H (Hunter Hearst Helmsley) became social media friends this week and exchanged friendly tweets. Embiid said he was a fan of the wrestler and used his pregame intro to mimic Triple H. Embiid walked out to the wrestler's theme music, ""The Game,"" by Motorhead, cocked his head back and spewed water into the air like Triple H would before a main event WrestleMania bout. Triple H noticed and tweeted at Embiid, ""Still have to perfect the water-to-spit ratio...Not bad for a first attempt. (hash)MopTheFloor (hash)NBAVote Joel Embiid."" Embiid has used social media to enhance his profile, build his fan base and keep himself in contention for an All-Star spot. Embiid got the block-and-wrestling connection rolling this week when he tweeted a photo of himself with his hands around teammate T.J. McConnell's neck and wrote, ""I learned this by watching you, (at)TripleH."" Triple H tweeted back, ""To play the game you gotta go through The Process ... (hash)NBAVote."" ""That was amazing,"" Embiid said before the game. Embiid said he wanted to use Twitter to have fun. ""Everything I do on social media is really funny to me,"" Embiid said. ""I think I have the best laugh out of everybody."" Embiid had fun earlier in the day with a quote from Miami Heat star Hassan Whiteside, who said All-Star voting was a ""gimmick"" and players just ""make jokes on Twitter"" to get votes. Embiid retweeted the quote and wrote ""Hassan Whiteside (hash)NBAVote."" ""One thing is, I want to be myself,"" Embiid said. ""I'm not going to change for anybody. I never hit the delete button. If I have something in my mind and I want to say it, I'm going to say it."" Embiid has had no regrets about any of his 2,270 tweets; even when he's tried to score dates with A-list starlets or the time he doctored a tweet to make it look like President-elect Donald Trump cast an All-Star vote for him. ""In the back of my head, I think this is going to backfire at some point,"" Embiid said. ""When that day comes, I'm going to stop."" The Sixers don't mind as long as Embiid saves his best output for games. He might have scarred Cody Zeller with two monster blocks on the Charlotte center. Embiid swatted Zeller's two-handed jam attempt in the second quarter. Embiid swooped in from the left side and rejected Zeller's throw-down attempt down the lane in the third. Walker's first half was a dud. Walker, making his own social media All-Star push with a campaign that parodies Chuck Norris' ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" TV show, missed 11 of 13 shots in the first half and all four 3s. He hit a 3 in the third quarter that fueled a Charlotte run and got it to 52-50 after not leading at all in the first half. Robert Covington and Ersan Ilyasova buried 3s and the Sixers pushed the lead back to double digits. TIP-INS Hornets: Batum made 7 of 14 shots after missing two games with a hyperextended right knee. ... Zeller, who sat out the last game against Houston with an illness, couldn't have felt good after getting blocked twice by Embiid. He had 16 points and 10 rebounds. Sixers: C Jahlil Okafor, last season's leading scorer, received yet another DNP-CD.","400900014"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks made quick work of the slumping Miami Heat. Jabari Parker had 24 points, Giannis Antetokounmpo added 19 and the Bucks scored 42 first-quarter points in their 116-108 victory Friday night. ""The first quarter was a great carryover from our last game,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said, pointing to Bucks' victory Tuesday night in San Antonio. ""Guys were very willing passers and we got a lot of wide-open shots."" Greg Monroe led the Bucks with 12 points off the bench in the opening quarter, their highest-scoring period of the season. ""I was just trying to come in and bring some energy and continue what the first team did,"" Monroe said. Antetokounmpo also had eight rebounds and six assists after being limited by illness throughout the week. Monroe finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds. ""You go and beat a great team like San Antonio and then come back here and you have to protect your home court,"" Monroe said. Goran Dragic and Hassan Whiteside each had 19 points for the Heat, and Luke Babbitt added a season-high 16. They have lost 10 of 11 games, including the last four on their trip. ""The first half was what got us in trouble,"" Babbitt said. ""There is no excuse for us not to come out harder."" After leading by as many as 21 points in the first half, the Bucks maintained a large lead throughout the third quarter, pushing it to 22 at one point. ""Our margin for error is very thin. We have to compete at a high level for 48 minutes,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. The Bucks allowed the Heat to get within eight points midway through the fourth. Antetokounmpo , who declined to speak with reporters after the game, then scored six straight points and the Bucks quickly built the lead back to 14 with about five minutes remaining. Miami cut the lead to seven with 16 seconds remaining, but would get no closer. ""I think everybody is looking forward to getting home. Not that anybody was thinking about it today, but it is cold here,"" Spoelstra said. ""So it will be nice to get home and see some sunshine."" CHANGING COURSE The last time the teams met, in November, Miami held Milwaukee to a season-low 73 points in notching the victory. The Bucks surpassed that mark with 8:57 remaining in the third quarter. FREAKY FRIDAY Antetokounmpo had another highlight reel dunk in the first quarter. He took off from just inside the foul line for a double-pump slam. ""I never saw anything like it in my life,"" Monroe said. ""They call him the Greek Freak for a reason. That was the freak part."" The dunk also left Kidd shaking his head. ""I don't know what he did. I know he jumped and then he did some things in the air,"" Kidd said. ""It was a heck of a play."" STARTER FOR NOW Rookie Malcolm Brogdan made his eighth consecutive start for the Bucks, but he could soon relinquish that role. (Brogdan) has done quite well,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""He's starting now until (Matthew Dellavedova) gets back into the swing of things. We'll address that here in a week or so. They are two guys who put the team first. As for Malcolm, he just wants to play. He deserves to play."" TIP-INS Heat: Center Willie Reed sat out with a bruised sternum, leaving Miami with just 10 available players, all of whom played. Bucks: Antetokounmpo logged 37 minutes after being limited to nine minutes at San Antonio on Tuesday night while struggling with an unspecified illness that also caused him to miss Sunday's home game against Washington.","400900015"
"HOUSTON -- The Memphis Grizzlies have developed a knack for beating the best in the West. They did it again on Friday night, rallying from a 15-point, third-quarter deficit for a 110-105 victory over the Houston Rockets. Tony Allen scored a season-high 22 points and Mike Conley added 17 as the Grizzlies, who are sixth in the West, improved to 4-0 combined against the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors this season. ""We've just got to start treating everybody like they're those teams,"" Conley said. ""I think we get up for the good teams somehow and seem to lay eggs when we feel like we should win games. We've just got to come with a better mindset for games that we feel like we should win. We know we can play with anybody, we've proven that. But for us to get to that next level we've got to be consistent no matter who we're playing."" Memphis led by two late in the fourth quarter before scoring the next five points, capped by a 3-pointer by Troy Daniels, to make it 110-103 with 26 seconds left. A dunk by James Harden came next, but Houston missed two shots after that to allow the Grizzlies to hold on for their third win in four games. Harden had 27 points and nine assists for the Rockets, who have lost consecutive games for the first time this season. ""We just missed shots. That's all,"" Harden said. ""We make those shots we go up nine or it's a different ballgame. But obviously that's a scrappy team."" Memphis was up by one in the fourth when Conley tossed a ball from about halfcourt as he fell into the front row of seats to Allen for a dunk. ""I didn't know who it was going to go to,"" Conley said. ""I kind of just threw it up. I knew there were two people back there and luckily it landed in (Allen's) hands."" Conley hit a 3-pointer a few seconds later to push the lead to 101-95 with about 5 minutes left. The Grizzlies scored the first nine points of the fourth quarter, with five from Zach Randolph, to go on top for the first time in the second half, 92-85. Houston got going after that, scoring the next seven points to tie it with about 8 minutes left. The Rockets led by 15 after an alley-oop dunk by Montrezl Harrell with about 9 minutes left third quarter. The Grizzlies then used a 9-1 run to cut the lead to 71-64 with about three minutes later. Houston hadn't scored a basket in almost four minutes when Harrell made a jumper with about 5 minutes left. Consecutive 3-pointers by Eric Gordon helped leave Houston ahead 79-68. It didn't take long for Memphis to start another run as Gasol hit a 3-pointer after that to start a 15-5 spurt that got the Grizzlies within 84-83 with about a minute left in the third. Daniels had two 3s in that stretch and Randolph added one. Houston made just 2 of 14 3-pointers in the third quarter and shot just 25 percent overall in the period, while the Grizzlies made 5 of 10 3s and shot 65 percent to close the gap. Houston led 64-51 at halftime. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Allen fouled out with 3:35 remaining. ... Randolph finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds. ... Daniels scored 13 points.

Parsons was drafted by the Rockets in 2011 and played three seasons in Houston before leaving for Dallas. He spent two seasons there before joining the Grizzlies this season. He finished with five points, two rebounds and two steals. THEY SAID IT Allen on coach David Fizdale's halftime speech: ""He told guys we need to stop lying to ourselves. We were not playing hard ... and guys took it to heart the second half and you could tell by the way we played down the stretch.""","400900016"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- Russell Westbrook piled up another triple-double in a season full of them. The Minnesota Timberwolves' improving defense made sure he had a fourth double that he wanted nothing to do with. Karl-Anthony Towns had 29 points and 17 rebounds and Ricky Rubio added 14 points and 14 assists to help the Timberwolves to their third straight victory, 96-86 over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. Westbrook has been a one-man wrecking crew this season, entering the game as the second player in league history to average at least 30 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds per game through the first 40 games. His 19 triple-doubles are the most in a season since Wilt Chamberlain had 31 in 1967-68. But he made just 7 of 23 shots against the Wolves and was 1-for-10 from 3-point range. ""It don't mean [expletive],"" Westbrook cracked. ""We lost."" Westbrook had 21 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds on Friday. But he also had 10 turnovers in Oklahoma City's first loss in four games. Westbrook is the only player since 1973-74 to record multiple triple-doubles with at least 10 turnovers in a single season, according to Elias Sports Bureau. ""Just some miscues, my fault on my passes,"" Westbrook said. ""Some were open, some was not. But it happens."" Andrew Wiggins scored 19 points and Brandon Rush had 11 for the Timberwolves, who have won three in a row for the first time all season. The Wolves held the Thunder to 38.8 percent shooting and scored 33 points off of 19 Oklahoma City turnovers. ""There's nothing better than a talented player with confidence,"" Towns said. ""Those are the most dangerous players. I think right now we have a lot of confidence. So right now we're just rolling with it."" Zach LaVine missed his second straight game for Minnesota with a hip pointer, but the Wolves still managed to shoot 45 percent. Towns made 11 of 17 shots, including a beauty of a scoop with five minutes to go that gave Minnesota a 13-point lead. The Wolves' defense had been startlingly poor in its first season under defensive guru Tom Thibodeau but has shown marked improvement of late. Minnesota entered the game sixth in the league in defensive rating over the previous 15 games, then put the clamps on Oklahoma City to improve to 8-8 after a 6-18 start. Enes Kanter had 21 points and eight rebounds for the Thunder. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook surpassed his triple-double total for all of last season. ... Victor Oladipo scored 19 points. ... Kanter hit a 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter, just his fifth of the season. Timberwolves: Rubio also had four steals and five turnovers. ... Rubio's 46 assists over the past three games is tied with Westbrook for the most dimes in a three-game span this season. ... Towns had his 10th straight double-double and 30th of the season. RUBIO SHINES Rubio tied a franchise record with 17 assists in a win over the Rockets on Wednesday, had another 15 assists in the win over Dallas on Monday and was at his best in the third quarter on Friday night. He had six points and seven assists in the quarter, scoring or assisting on nine of Minnesota's 12 field goals in the period. He also checked Westbrook for the entire period, helping to hold him to 0 for 7 shooting with five turnovers in 12 minutes. ""The results are there,"" Rubio said. ""I don't want it to be just a four-game stand. I want to be all season long like that."" NO-KC The 86 points were a season low for the Thunder, who were coming off impressive wins over Denver, Chicago and Memphis. They shot 32 percent from the field and 8 percent (1 for 12) from 3-point range and scored just 36 points in the second half on Friday. ""You're going to have games where you don't shoot the ball particularly well from the 3-point line,"" OKC coach Billy Donovan said. ""That was one of those games. But I thought the turnovers coupled with the fact that we just could not make any plays around the basket when we needed to hurt us.""","400900017"
"ATLANTA --  Isaiah Thomas has no problem taking charge of the Boston Celtics late in the fourth quarter. In the final seconds, Thomas waved off coach Brad Stevens' timeout and ran the play himself, stepping back to hit a 19-foot jumper with 2 seconds remaining, ""He trusts me,"" Thomas said. ""At the end he said, `Hell of a shot."" Thomas scored 13 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter, Al Horford made a triumphant return and the Celtics snapped the Atlanta Hawks' seven-game winning streak with a 103-101 victory Friday night. Paul Millsap and Tim Hardaway Jr. each had 23 points for Atlanta. The Hawks had won 12 of 16 to move into fourth place in the Eastern Conference. But the third-place Celtics hit 17 3-pointers and got a season-high 26 points from reserve forward Kelly Olynyk to push past a Hawks team that missed too many open looks from the perimeter. Horford, a fan favorite during his nine seasons in Atlanta, was booed many times throughout the night after leaving the team as a free agent last summer. He received a standing ovation, though, and waved happily to the crowd after the Hawks showed a brief video tribute between the first and second quarters. ""That was pretty cool,"" Horford said. ""That was a good video looking back at my career here."" Horford finished with 10 points, six rebounds and six assists in 35 minutes. ""Like I said, a guy like that, with that type of character, you can't boo him,"" Thomas said. ""That's disrespectful."" Thomas was unstoppable in the closing minutes, hitting a 15-footer and a 3-pointer before knocking down the 19-footer that made it 103-101. Millsap missed a jumper at the buzzer. ""We were running some different guys at him from the standpoint of getting different matchups in the pick-and-roll,"" Stevens said. ""He made a heck of a shot to win the game. It was a great play."" Boston blistered Atlanta in the third, using a 20-5 run to go up 77-57 on Terry Rozier's 21-footer. Hardaway's short jumper trimmed the lead to 91-85 with 4:24 remaining, and Mike Dunleavy, making his Atlanta debut for the first time since last week's trade, rattled in a corner 3 to pull the Hawks within two at the 2:12 mark. The Celtics hit eight of its first 11 beyond the arc to take a 28-16 lead at the 2:33 mark of the first, but missed their next 10 attempts on 3s to help Atlanta force a 42-all tie on a pair of free throws by Millsap. ""It was a heck of a comeback,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It was a heck of a game. We'll learn from it. We'll be better going forward."" TIP-INS Celtics: Jae Crowder added 18 points, including four 3s. ... Boston began the night ranked 29th in rebounding -- 18 spots behind Atlanta -- but each team grabbed 43 boards. Crowder had a game-high nine and Olynyk had eight. Hawks: G Dennis Schroder picked up his fourth foul midway through the third and finished with just four points on 2 for 11 shooting. ... Reserve forward Mike Muscala went 0 for 7 from the field and didn't score. ... Dunleavy, acquired in the trade that sent Kyle Korver to Cleveland on Jan. 7, scored six points on a pair of 3s. KEEP IT COMING Olynyk, a reserve forward, played so well in the first half, going 7 for 9 from the field for 18 points, that Stevens put him on the floor over Amir Johnson to begin the third. Johnson played just 8 minutes of the second half and ended the game scoreless. TRIBUTE TO PISTOL PETE The Hawks wore dark blue and lime green-trimmed uniforms for the first time since the early 2000s. The strange-looking design was made memorable by Pete Maravich, the star guard who played his first four seasons in Atlanta through 1973-74. MORE TESTS Celtics C Tyler Zeller, sidelined with a sinus infection, didn't make the trip and was inactive for the sixth straight game. Stevens said Zeller has undergone a gamut of tests because he still feels disoriented. ""He gets final results tomorrow but he's feeling a lot better in the last couple of days,"" Stevens said. ""It's dissipated a little bit.""","400900018"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  It's not the start but the finish that matters, though the Orlando Magic did both well. Nikola Vucevic hit 13 of 18 shots, scored a season-high 30 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the Magic to a 115-109 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night. Elfrid Payton scored 19 points and hit a key 3-pointer with 1:17 remaining that gave Orlando some breathing room. D.J. Augustin added 15 points, while Serge Ibaka had 13 points and 10 rebounds as the Magic snapped a four-game losing streak. ""We needed that,"" Vucevic said. ""We needed a game like that to see that we can do it. We've had a lot of games where we were playing pretty well, and the (other) team would make a run and we would kind of fall apart."" Orlando couldn't have plotted a better start to the game, as the Magic hit their first nine shots, while the Blazers missed their first nine, on the way to an 18-1 lead five minutes into the game. But it came down to the final eight minutes, with the score tied at 90. Vucevic and Payton combined to score 15 of Orlando's final 25 points to lead the finishing charge. ""I was very happy with how we started the game but even more proud of how we responded to their runs,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. Portland coach Terry Stotts thought the Blazers, who had won three of four and were coming off a 16-point win over Cleveland, lost a long-range shooting contest. ""It was a perimeter game, and they ended up making more shots than we did,"" Stott said. As for the sluggish start, Stotts said, ""It happens. I thought we had good shots. We had shots around the basket. But the ball wasn't going in."" Damian Lillard scored 34 points and C.J. McCollum had 26, extending his streak to eight consecutive games with at least 25 points, the Trail Blazers' longest in nearly 30 years. After Orlando's fast start, Lillard scored 15 first-quarter points as the Blazers got as close as three points during the first half. Orlando led 54-49 at halftime. Two minutes into the third quarter, Portland grabbed its first lead at 57-56 on a drive by Lillard. But Orlando bounced back, as Ibaka hit back-to-back 3-pointers to lead the Magic to an 82-78 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Lillard pulled Portland to 105-103, but Payton silenced the Blazers crowd with a 3-pointer at the end of the shot clock, putting the Magic in front 108-103 with 1:17 left. ""You get up 18-1 against a team like that and it's not always a good thing. We knew they were going to come after us and they did, but we were able to respond by getting shops late in the game, and hitting big shots,"" Vogel said. TIP-INS Magic: There were a couple family reunions for Magic coaches. Assistant David Adelman returned to Portland where his father Rick, a longtime and now retired NBA coach, lives. Todd Forcier, the brother of Orlando assistant Chad Forcier, is a sports performance specialist for the Blazers. ... Ibaka returned to the lineup after missing the Magic's last game with a right shoulder injury. ... Vucevic has scored at least 20 points in five consecutive games against Portland. Trail Blazers: Starting small forward Maurice Harkless was a late scratch due to a calf strain. Allen Crabbe started in his place. ... Portland guard Tim Quarterman, who on Thursday was assigned to the Windy City Bulls of the NBA Development League, is expected to rejoin the Blazers sometime during the team's four-game road trip next week. Quarterman has appeared in 12 games for Portland this season. ... McCollum's streak of leading Portland in scoring ended at nine games. MCCOLLUM FINISHES FAST It took almost all of 48 minutes, but McCollum scored at least 25 points for an eighth consecutive game, the third-longest in Portland history. Only Geoff Petrie (11 games) and Clyde Drexler (9) have longer streak among Blazer players. McCollum missed his first seven shots, and had only five points at halftime. But a 12-point fourth quarter did the job and he scored his final basket with 15 seconds remaining.","400900019"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  One shootaround was all it took for Kyle Korver to find his shooting groove with his new team. Korver scored 18 points and delivered a needed spark to the second unit in his most productive game since joining Cleveland, and the Cavaliers tuned up for a NBA Finals rematch by beating the Sacramento Kings 120-108 on Friday night. ""Personally it was good to have a game when you got some good looks just to feel good about going forward,"" said Korver, who was just 2 for 10 in his first two games since being acquired from Atlanta. ""Not that I didn't before. You just knew it was going to take some time. I'm excited."" Kyrie Irving scored 26 points and Cleveland snapped a two-game losing streak before taking on Golden State on Monday in its first game at Oracle Arena since winning the NBA title there last June. LeBron James had 16 points and 15 assists, while Kevin Love added 15 points and 18 rebounds DeMarcus Cousins had 26 points and a season-high 11 assists and Rudy Gay scored 23 points for the Kings, who fell to 1-4 on their seven-game homestand. Sacramento was done in by 21 turnovers. ""When you play a team this caliber, you can't spot them points the way we did tonight,"" Cousins said. ""We have to be disciplined and fundamental as we can be. We kind of made it hard on ourselves."" The Cavs sent forward Mike Dunleavy, guard Mo Williams, cash and a protected future first-round draft pick to the Hawks last for Korver, a 14-year veteran whose ability to come off screens and deep range challenge defenses. Korver struggled his first two games as he had no practice time. But after a lengthy morning shootaround he felt more comfortable in the offense. That proved to be key this game, especially after Sacramento had cut a 24-point lead to eight when Arron Afflalo scored on the opening possession of the fourth quarter. Korver responded with a 3-pointer and answered again a few minutes later after Cleveland's lead was cut to six with his fourth 3 of the game. He shot 7 for 10 for the game, making 4 of 6 3-pointers. ""This morning was the first time he got an opportunity to see what we wanted to execute and how he could be a part of that,"" James said. ""It was great to see him making those shots and we want him to keep firing."" The Cavs started fast behind 11 first-quarter points from Love and led by 17 points after one. The lead grew to 21 early in the second before the Kings rallied to cut it to 10. That's when Korver stepped up for the first time, scoring seven points during an 11-0 run that put Cleveland back in control. The Cavs scored nine points in a 59-second span to quickly turn the tide in their favor. TIP-INS Cavaliers: G Iman Shumpert replaced DeAndre Liggins in the starting lineup and hit three 3-pointers in the first quarter. ... James got a technical in the first quarter when he argued a non-call against Gay on a blocked shot. Kings: Cousins got called for a second foul midway through the first quarter on an illegal screen. ... Sacramento has lost four straight to Cleveland. RETRO LOOK Shumpert wore James' retro shoes that will be available to buy again later this month. James said it was no surprise Shumpert found his shooting stroke, matching a season high with 16 points and hitting four 3-pointers. ""He wore my retros in the game,"" James said. ""It must be the shoes.""","400900020"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder has had a consistent message for Rodney Hood this season: Keep shooting, keep shooting, keep shooting. Hood did exactly that Friday night and scored a season-high 27 points as the Jazz rolled over the Detroit Pistons, 110-77. ""He just shoots better when he's decisive,"" Snyder said. ""I think he understands what we want and the message is consistent. He's just got to keep doing it. ""And there's going to be nights where they don't go in. But just keep doing the same thing. That's the way he needs to play."" The third-year guard has been inconsistent this season, but Friday was easily his best game, going 7 for 8 from 3-point range and aggressively looking for opportunities on offense. ""I went 7 for 8 tonight, but I also know how it is to go 1 for 10,"" Hood said. ""I knew they were going to start falling and I was going to get in a rhythm. I just came out firing right away tonight. My teammates told me to keep shooting and my coaches as well. ""I got some confidence last game back in my shot and, this game, just came out aggressive."" The Jazz put away the game in the third quarter with a 28-9 run highlighted by a heavy dose of George Hill, including a pair of back-to-back 3-pointers. They shot 65 percent in the quarter. Hill finished with 22 points and Gordon Hayward added 20. Tobias Harris scored 13 for Detroit and Andre Drummond grabbed 19 rebounds. The Pistons looked lost on defense in the second half. Their poor play was summed up on a third-quarter sequence in which Hayward chased down a loose ball in the backcourt that led to a 3-pointer by Hill while Detroit passively watched the ball bounce away. ""Did you watch the third quarter?"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We couldn't score and they scored every time they got it. ""We can't stop anybody, we just can't. For the first 21 games we were the second-best defensive team in the league and now we are one of the worst. I am frustrated not with our players, I am frustrated with myself that I can't figure this out. We literally can't stop anyone ever."" The Jazz led 45-43 at halftime after the teams exchanged runs in the first 24 minutes. Utah jumped out to a 10-0 lead as the Pistons missed their first five shots to go with a pair of turnovers on their first seven possessions. Detroit responded with a 12-2 stretch to close the first quarter thanks to six points from Harris. The Jazz closed the half with a 9-0 run, including five from Hayward, before Pistons forward Stanley Johnson beat the buzzer with a 3-pointer. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit was without Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who sustained a Grade 2 left rotator cuff strain against the Warriors on Friday. Coach Stan Van Gundy said he's doubtful for Sunday's game. ... The Pistons started a big lineup with Marcus Morris at shooting guard for the first time this season. Jazz: Backup point guard Raul Neto was inactive. ... Dante Exum played 17 minutes after getting three consecutive Did Not Play-Coach's Decisions. ... Hayward is now ninth on the Jazz career assists list with 1,628. ... Utah hit 16 3-pointers. HEAVY HEART Reggie Bullock returned to the Pistons after missing time due to personal reasons. On Thursday, a Baltimore jury acquitted a man of all charges in the 2014 slaying of his transgender sister. The 46-year-old Shawn Oliver was acquitted of all charges after being charged with first-degree murder in the July 2014 stabbing death of 26-year-old Mia Henderson, formerly known as Kevin Long. News media report that Bullock tweeted the verdict on Thursday along with a broken-heart emoticon and ""(hash)standupforMIA."" QUOTABLE ""It has to be fixed or it is going to be a long (expletive) season,"" Pistons guard Reggie Jackson said when asked if things can be fixed.

"LOS ANGELES --  DeAndre Jordan was getting the ball just where he likes it, and the big man known for his lousy free throw shooting only had to go to the line once. Jordan scored 24 points on 12-of-13 shooting, and the Los Angeles Clippers shot 52 percent to cruise past the Lakers 113-97 on Saturday and improve to 6-0 in 2017. ""He was as dominant a force as you can have in the NBA,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""He disrupted everything. He makes you not want to drive or be near the basket."" And for the most part the Lakers weren't. Jordan came flying to make his eight dunks, including a two-handed jam on the game's opening possession. He didn't need to post anyone up around the basket, which irked rookie Lakers coach Luke Walton. ""It would be nice to foul him once in a while,"" Walton said. ""Instead of letting him go 12 for 13 and only shooting one free throw it would be nice to wrap him up a couple of times and make him earn it from the line."" Jordan's shooting was nearly perfect; he tipped in his own miss with 4:41 remaining in the game. He missed his lone free throw attempt. He had 21 rebounds -- 18 on the defensive glass -- among the Clippers' 42 rebounds. ""I see myself getting better throughout the season, but a lot of it is effort, going after balls,"" Jordan said. Chris Paul added 20 points and 13 assists for the Clippers, off to their best start since going 7-0 to begin 1974 when the franchise was located in Buffalo. Their streak is the longest active one in the NBA. ""This isn't our team. We're still missing 32,"" Paul said, noting Blake Griffin's absence while recovering from knee surgery. ""That's our singular focus, keep winning games."" The Clippers shot 52 percent and are 15-0 when they do so. Led by Jordan, they had a season-high 56 points in the paint. Jordan Clarkson scored 21 points for the Lakers, who never led in losing their third in a row and seventh in 10 games. ""We've just got to keep the team growing together, move the ball, make shots,"" Clarkson said. ""We've got to make plays that make things easy for everybody. A lot of it has to do with spacing on the court right now. We've got to work on that."" The Lakers, who shot 44 percent, never made a run in the fourth. The Lakers cut their deficit from 19 points to 10 in the third. After an unsportsmanlike technical for hanging on the rim, Timofey Mozgov dunked to launch a 9-2 run that included consecutive 3-pointers by Brandon Ingram and Nick Young and got the Lakers to 69-59. The Clippers closed with a 15-9 spurt that sent them into the fourth leading 84-68. Jordan had two more dunks, both one-handers. TIP-INS Lakers: Starting F Luol Deng rested after playing 19 minutes in Thursday's loss to the Spurs, well under his 27-minute average. He missed his first game of the season on Jan. 5 at Portland. ... G Lou Williams, the team's leading scorer, made his first start of the season. It was the Lakers' 14th different starting lineup. ... They were averaging 10.1 turnovers (71 total) over the previous seven games and had 15 against the Clippers. Clippers: They had eight turnovers, one off their season low. ...

"CHICAGO --  Jimmy Butler's health and the Bulls' play this week coincided for different reasons. Butler scored 28 points in his return from the flu, and Dwyane Wade had 17 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter in the Chicago Bulls' 107-99 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday. The Bulls desperately needed Butler back after losing their previous three games while he struggled with the flu. He didn't play in two games and was limited Monday night against Oklahoma City. When asked how the last few days went, Butler didn't sugarcoat anything. ""Hell. That's what it's been like,"" Butler said. ""My body was all types messed up, but they let me get better. My guys were taking care of me at home with fluids. Yeah, it wasn't a pretty sight."" After the Pelicans cut a 15-point second-half deficit to one point early in the fourth, Wade scored six straight points to push the advantage to 85-80. Wade made it 89-82 with a 3-pointer, and spun off a defender to convert a three-point play for a 102-91 lead with 2:27 left. Taj Gibson added 15 points and 16 rebounds to help the Bulls snap a three-game losing streak. The Bulls outrebounded the Pelicans 63-42. ""It's pretty obvious the rebounding was the different in the game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""Our defense was solid. Even with the rebounding struggles we had, they still shot 42 percent. You can't give up 21 offensive rebounds and expect to win a basketball game. You just can't do it."" Anthony Davis had 36 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks for New Orleans. The Pelicans won two straight on the road. Butler didn't show any fatigue early on by scoring 19 points in the first half as the Bulls led 55-45 at the half. ""We are obviously so much better with him on the floor,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""You can only talk about a select few in this league that has that type of impact on the game that Jimmy does. Jimmy does everything for us out there."" Davis, who missed New Orleans' victory at Brooklyn on Thursday night because of a sore left hip, had 13 points, five rebounds and three blocks in the half. ""Offensive rebounding killed us,"" Davis said. ""It's tough. Our defense is good. They shot 42 percent but when you give up 21 offensive rebounds it's tough. Then D Wade made some tough shots. Just got to find a way to rebound the ball better."" The Bulls extended the lead early in second half. Butler threw down a dunk, then on a break, Wade set up Butler for a layup that made it 63-48. Former Bull E'Twaun Moore kept the Pelicans in the game in the second half. His 3-pointer cut the lead to 66-60, and kept them within six at the end of the third quarter with another 3. He was 4 for 5 from 3-point range and scored 16 points. CHICAGO AREA BASKETBALL Wade, Davis and Moore all played their high school basketball in the Chicago area. Wade has taken notice with the number of star basketball players in the league that are from the Chicago area. ""It just goes to show that there are a lot of good players that do come through Chicago,"" said Wade. TIP-INS Pelicans: Moore made his first four shots against his former team for 10 points in the first half. He was 2 for 2 from 3-point range.

"WASHINGTON -- John Wall's left wrist and right pinky were both sore, and for the last two days he'd practiced wearing a splint on the right hand. Wall never doubted he'd play, and he scored 25 points to lead the Washington Wizards to a 109-93 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. Wall scoffed when asked if there was any uncertainty that he'd play. ""Come on, you should know better than that. Not at all. Not at all,"" Wall said. Wall, who also had seven rebounds and seven assists, and the Wizards outscored the 76ers 30-15 in the third quarter to take an 86-71 lead. He hit three straight 3-pointers late in the third quarter and celebrated with some new dance steps. ""I did some moves I never tried before,"" Wall joked. Philadelphia raced to an early 13-point lead, but the Wizards outscored the 76ers 24-11 in the final minutes of the first half for a 56-all halftime tie. ""Late second quarter, you could feel the gym turning, you could feel our guys turn,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. The 76ers had won three straight for the first time in more than three years. They played without rookie star Joel Embiid. He sat out to rest after scoring 24 points Thursday night against Charlotte. Jahlil Okafor, who hadn't played in the last three games, had a season-high 26 points for the 76ers. The Wizards have won 11 straight at home, their longest home winning streak since a 15-game run form Feb. 9-Apr. 7, 1989. TIP INS: 76ers: Ben Simmons, the top draft choice last summer, hasn't played thus far because of a stress fracture in his right foot.

""Just the team having the ability to talk to him, rub shoulders with him, and share ideas, be on buses, be on planes.

Wall and Bradley Beal, who had 20 points, outscored their Philadelphia starting counterparts, Nik Stauskas and T.J. McConnell 47-6. INSPIRING WALL Beal also was confident Wall would play. ""That's how he is. If it's not broke, he's going to play,"" Beal said Washington coach Scott Brooks was certain Wall was going to play, too. ""He knows his body as well as anybody,"" Brooks said. ""I would never put him out there if it was going to jeopardize him."" OKAFOR STEPS IN Okafor started in place of Embiid, and played a season-high 35 minutes. ""It felt good to get back on the court,"" Okafor said. ""I thought it was decent. I did feel myself starting to get winded but I was able to fight through it a little bit but I just worked as hard as I could."" PROCESS SERVED: As the Sixers suffered through three awful seasons, losing 199 games, the team's mantra was ""Trust the Process."" It's caught on. Fans who bussed down from Philadelphia chanted it during the first half, and Brooks joked about it when he was asked about the Sixers' improvement. ""The process is paying off, right?"" Brooks cracked.","400900024"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The loss of Rodney Hood to a right knee injury tempered the Utah Jazz's victory over the Orlando Magic. Hood was hurt late in the Jazz's 114-107 victory Saturday night. ""It's unfortunate, for sure, and unlucky,"" Gordon Hayward said. ""Hopefully, he has a speedy recovery. He's a big piece of what we do. It sucks to see anybody go down."" On a fast break after Rudy Gobert blocked Nikola Vucevic's shot, Hood was hurt when his right knee buckled as he went up for a layup. Hood screamed in pain and clutched the knee immediately upon falling, and had to be assisted from the floor. He barely put weight on the leg as he exited the court to the locker room. After the game, the Jazz said it was a hyperextended knee and Hood was walking gingerly but without assistance in the locker room. The Jazz guard, who was wearing an ice pack and elastic bandage, was not made available to the media and will be evaluated again Sunday. Hayward scored 23 points, and Gobert added 19 points and 19 rebounds. Hood had 14 points. Joe Ingles made two 3-pointers in the final 1:07 to wrap up the victory. ""They just got hot from the 3-point line,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""They made three 3s and we fouled two 3-point shots. That's essentially like giving up five 3s in the final three minutes of the game and you're not going to win a lot of games like that."" After an emotional win over Cleveland and a late-night victory over Detroit on Friday night, the Jazz played a lackluster game until the final minutes. The Magic led 102-97 after Aaron Gordon's 3-pointer and Elfrid Payton's driving layup with 3:54 to play, but the Jazz scored 13 straight points en route to their fourth victory in five games. Orlando has lost five of six. Payton had a career-high 28 points and added nine rebounds and nine assists. Despite their reputation as one of the league's most formidable defensive teams, the Jazz provided little resistance to the Magic drives throughout most of the game, especially Payton's flashes to the basket. ""He was terrific,"" Snyder said about Payton. ""He dominated the game. For all intents and purposes, he had a triple-double. He was strong driving the ball and I though we really let him get confident early."" Aaron Gordon added 21 points for the Magic.

FAVORS FLUSHES Favors, who has struggled getting his explosion back after a series of injuries, took a pass from Hayward on the baseline and rose high, dunked and was fouled to give the Jazz the lead during the big run. ""It was great to see that. It was a big play in the game and we took the lead off the play. It was awesome to see that finish and we need more of that from him,"" Hayward said.

"TORONTO -- The Toronto Raptors left the New York Knicks behind in a hurry in a big third quarter. Toronto had a 25-2 edge in the first 9:20 of the third and coasted to a 116-101 victory Sunday. ""I think we just got more physical,"" said Kyle Lowry, who had 16 points and nine assists before coming out late in the third quarter. ""The bigs did a good job of rebounding and we got out and were able to run."" Toronto outscored New York 27-8 in the third quarter to take a 96-62 lead. DeMar DeRozan had 23 points, five rebounds and five assists to lead the Raptors. He joined most of Toronto's starters in resting in the fourth quarter. Norman Powell added 21 points, DeMarre Carroll had 20 points, and Jonas Valanciunas had 12 points and 16 rebounds. The Raptors improved to 27-13, taking the lead for good late in the first quarter. They led by 38 points in the third in winning their third straight game overall and fifth in a row against the Knicks. Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks with 18 points, Justin Holiday had 17, and Derrick Rose added 16. The Knicks are 2-10 in their last 12 to drop to 18-23. ""When you're not scoring, that's when you've got to focus defensively,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said of his team's disastrous third quarter. ""We weren't good enough playing the defense and it just ballooned up from there."" Hornacek sat his starters from the latter part of the third quarter. ""They were not thinking defense, they were thinking offence and their offence wasn't going,"" he said. ""I don't know if it's giving up, you can ask them that but the last group came in and played hard and that's what we need."" The Raptors were 12 for 20 from the field in the third quarter, while the Knicks were 4 for 21 overall and 0 for 4 from the 3-point range. The Knicks also had seven turnovers times in the quarter, leading to 10 Toronto points. The Raptors turned it over four times, but New York was unable score any points off them. ""It happened so quickly, a couple of turnovers, they scored four straight times early in that third quarter and we were just looking backwards from that point,"" Anthony said. DeRozan led the way with 11 points in the third, and Carroll had 10. Toronto took a 69-54 lead into the halftime break. The Raptors matched their season high in a quarter, scoring 42 in the second. They hit seven 3s in the period, led by Terrence Ross, who went 4 for 5 from beyond the arc. ""I was really proud of the way that the starters came out and set the tone, especially starting the third quarter, which has usually been our Achilles heel,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""We came out, set the tone and built a 30-point-plus lead, so my hat is off to those guys."" TIP-INS Knicks: Kristaps Porzingis missed his second straight game with a sore left Achilles. Forward Lance Thomas took an elbow to the head from Valanciunas in the second minute of the game and did not return with concussion-like symptoms. He'll be further evaluated Monday. At one point in the third quarter, the Knicks trailed by 38 points, their largest deficit of the season. Raptors: The Raptors are 8-0 against Atlantic Division teams. .. DeRozan has scored 20 or more points in 12 straight games, matching his longest streak. ... Patrick Patterson missed his second straight game and sixth of the past eight with a sore left knee. DeRozan missed his first five shots from the field but hit eight of his next 11. Toronto dominated the inside game, outscoring the Knicks 66-30 in points in the paint. EARLY RUST The teams combined to shoot 5 for 22 from the field in the first 5:26. HE SAID IT ""It's a little bit embarrassing in the third quarter to be down by 30 or something like that."" -- Brandon Jennings on the game getting away from the Knicks.","400900027"
"ATLANTA --  Now with his third team in two seasons, Mike Dunleavy thinks he's found a good fit with the Atlanta Hawks. The 36-year-old Dunleavy was disappointed to get traded last week from Cleveland, the best team in the Eastern Conference, but Atlanta could offer him a bigger role. ""At this point in my career, the biggest thing is to win, and that hasn't changed from the last team I was on to this team,"" he said. ""I'm just glad we're in a good spot, No. 4 in the East with a chance to get home court in the playoffs."" Kent Bazemore scored 24 points, Dunleavy added 20 and the Hawks beat the Milwaukee Bucks 111-98 on Sunday. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo had 33 points and was a tough matchup in the paint. He has scored at least 30 points in eight games in a breakout season, but had bigger concerns after the game. ""We cannot let Dunleavy come off the bench and have 20,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We didn't defend the 3-point line well. That's basically it."" Atlanta has won eight of nine. The Bucks have dropped three of five. They fell 2 1/2 games behind the fourth-place Hawks in the Eastern Conference. Dunleavy had his first 20-point performance since a first-round playoff game for Chicago on April 30, 2015. Acquired in a deal that sent Hawks fan favorite Kyle Korver to Cleveland, Dunleavy debuted for Atlanta in Friday's two-point home loss to Boston. ""You share the ball, a lot of equal opportunity,"" Dunleavy said. ""You can play off a lot of stuff. If you can cut, you can pass, you can screen, you shoot, it's a great system to be in."" Milwaukee led 20-9 with 6 minutes left in the first quarter. Atlanta went up 50-40 with 6 minutes left in the second. The Bucks tied it at 60 when Antetokounmpo tipped in his own miss early in the third, but they never led in the second half. Coach Jason Kidd called a timeout with Milwaukee down by eight with 2:18 left in the game, only to watch his team have a turnover, a foul and three missed jumpers as Atlanta went up 111-96 on Bazemore's 3 in the final minute. HONORING DR. KING To begin their Forever MLK celebration day, the Hawks had Howard, an Atlanta native, speak briefly to the crowd before tipoff. ""Love conquers hate,"" Howard said in acknowledgment of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday on Monday. The Hawks had several video tributes to King, the slain civil rights icon who made Atlanta his home, all afternoon. A local choir performed at halftime. RISING STAR Antetokounmpo's strong start to the season has impressed Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer. The 6-foot-11, 222-pound forward is the only current NBA player averaging at least 20 points, nine rebounds, five assists, two blocks and 1.5 steals -- all career highs in his four-year career. ""It seems like he's worthy of all the praise he's getting, all the attention he's getting,"" Budenholzer said before adding with a smile, ""I wish he was back in Greece playing."" VETERAN VOICE Reserve guard Jason Terry, in his first season with Milwaukee and 18th overall, wants his young teammates to do a better job of following instructions from Kidd, who played 19 seasons and was a 10-time All-Star. ""At some point we're going to have to understand that what he's telling us is going to come to fruition,"" Terry said. ""Are we going to be ready to execute the game plan? We did not do that tonight, as you see from the results."" TIP-INS Bucks: Jabari Parker finished with 10 rebounds, nine assists and eight points. ... Malcolm Brogdon has scored at least 10 points in nine straight games. The rookie guard, an Atlanta native who starred at Virginia, had eight straight with at least five assists, but dished out none against the Hawks. ... The Bucks hit six 3-pointers. Atlanta hit 13. ... Gave up 32 points on 17 turnovers. Hawks: Reserve F Mike Muscala hurt his left ankle in the first quarter and spent the rest of the game with trainers in the locker room. ...

"DALLAS --  Playing against a much younger team that beat them six days ago, the Dallas Mavericks turned to their depth and veteran savvy. Wesley Matthews had 19 points and Dirk Nowitzki added 17 as the Mavericks spread out the scoring and beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 98-87 on Sunday. Dallas dressed four players with 10 or more years in the NBA -- Minnesota has none -- and all of them reached double figures. J.J. Barea had 15 points Deron Williams had 13 points and 10 assists for the Mavs. ""That's how we've got to play,"" Matthews said. ""That brand of basketball is fun. Everybody has energy, and we're moving the ball well. They're team shots as opposed to one-person shots."" Gorgui Dieng scored 21 points and Andrew Wiggins had 19 for the Timberwolves, who had won three in a row. Minnesota's last four-game winning streak was in December 2012. Karl-Anthony Towns had 18 points and nine rebounds, but the Mavericks largely held him in check after he had 34 points and 11 boards in the Wolves' 101-92 home win over Dallas on Monday. ""We didn't do anything that we usually do to win the game,"" Towns said. ""That's why our winning streak is over."" Dallas broke open a two-point game by closing the third quarter on an 11-4 run, then Barea scored his team's first nine points of the fourth quarter. His bank shot in the lane with 8:01 to go extended the lead to 88-76. ""We're in a good place right now,"" Barea said. ""We know we still have a lot of work to do, but we've got a good feeling in this locker room right now."" Seth Curry then scored the next five points with a 3 and a fast-break layup to give Dallas its largest lead of the game. START IT UP The Mavericks moved up the gametime to 1 p.m. to accommodate the Dallas Cowboys' late-afternoon kickoff at home against Green Bay in the NFL playoffs. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Zach LaVine had missed the past two games with a hip bruise, but warmed up before the game and coach Tom Thibodeau declared him ready to go. He scored 11 points. Mavericks: Announced the signing of guard Pierre Jackson to a 10-day contract. Jackson played for the Mavericks from Dec. 27 to Jan. 6, averaging three points, before being waived. ... Dallas also recalled forward Nicolas Brussino from the Texas Legends of the NBA Development League, where he was averaging 16 points and eight rebounds. VINTAGE DIRK Nowitzki's 17-point effort included a second-quarter stretch in which he scored seven Dallas points in a row. He scored on a leaner in the lane, then on a long pull-up jumper. Then, as the trailer on the fast break, he hit a long 3 that gave the Mavericks their largest lead of the first half, 44-29, sending the crowd into a frenzy and forcing a Timberwolves timeout. ""If I get some daylight, I feel like I have a decent rhythm right now,"" Nowitzki said. ""We had a little run going and sometimes you want to use the momentum. I let it ride and somehow it rode in."" Nowitzki's 28 minutes played gave him 47,621 in his career, passing Reggie Miller for ninth place all-time. PEER RECOGNITION As head of the National Basketball Coaches Association (NBCA), Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle talked about the association's announcement of the Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award. The award will be the only one chosen by an NBA coach's peers and will be announced at the end of the regular season. Goldberg was the first executive director of the NBCA. ""Michael Goldberg is a beloved figure in the coaching world,"" Carlisle said. ""We felt it was time to honor the work that he's done. This is a unique award because it's going to be voted on by peers only. It will have a little extra meaning for coaches. It's really time for something like this to happen.""","400900029"
"NEW YORK -- Even an offense as potent as Houston's can go cold during the long NBA winter. ""It happens,"" James Harden said. ""But as long as we stay at an even level, we just continue to get better, continue to learn from our mistakes, we'll be all right."" Especially against a defenseless team like Brooklyn. Harden had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in his 12th triple-double of the season and the Rockets easily ended their first losing streak by beating the Nets 137-112 on Sunday night. Held to 105 points in losses to Minnesota and Memphis, the Rockets bounced back with 104 after three quarters and handed the Nets their 10th straight loss. Eric Gordon led the Rockets with 24 points and Trevor Ariza added 23. Houston made 21 3-pointers and had five players with at least 16 points. Houston shot just 40.8 percent during its two losses, well below its 46.8 season average, while being held nearly 10 points below its season scoring average. But the Rockets had no trouble bouncing back against the Nets, who allow an NBA-worst 114.3 per game. ""We just could never stop them,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I don't think we stopped them the whole night."" The Rockets matched their season high with a 74-point first half, though the Nets hung with them pretty well and only trailed by eight. Houston opened the third quarter with a 13-2 run to build an 87-68 cushion that grew to 20 later in the period when Harden found Sam Dekker with an alley-oop pass. Trevor Booker scored 18 points for the Nets, who were still without Jeremy Lin (strained left hamstring) on the night they gave out his bobblehead and also rested Brook Lopez. Ariza, just 1 for 6 from 3-point range in a loss to the Grizzlies on Friday, was 6 for 10 on Sunday. Harden, Gordon and Patrick Beverley all made four. ""It's just about rhythm and tonight our rhythm was there,"" Ariza said. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston had 100 points before the fourth quarter for the seventh time this season and 20 or more 3-pointers for the sixth time. ... The Rockets also had 74 points at halftime against the Clippers on Dec. 30. Nets: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 14 points and Randy Foye scored a season-high 13. ... The Nets matched a franchise record set earlier this season with 44 3-point attempts. They have made 15 or more in consecutive games for just the second time in their history. BOBBLEHEAD (AND HAIR) NIGHT The Nets gave out the Lin bobblehead as part of their celebration of Taiwanese culture. ""With the hairdo? So you can change the hair any way you want it?"" asked Mike D'Antoni, who coached Lin in New York. Lin, who has frequently changed his hairstyles, is depicted in braids in the bobblehead, as he wore about the time the Nets signed him over the summer. MEMORABLE MOMENTS D'Antoni was asked if when he sees Lin, he thinks back to the Linsanity days in 2012 and recalls them being kind of fun. ""It wasn't kind of fun, it was really fun,"" D'Antoni said. ""As a coach, it was fun doing it. I was really proud of him and what he's done and it couldn't happen to a better person and I mean it goes deep. That's why you coach for a guy, for moments like that and people like him."" REUNION WEEK Atkinson faced one of his former bosses for the second time in six games. It was Atlanta's Mike Budenholzer on Tuesday and in this game D'Antoni, whom he assisted with the Knicks from 2008-12 and praised Sunday for being ahead of the game when it came to his offensive schemes. ""Great person, great coach and for me it's an honor to have a chance to compete against his team,"" Atkinson said.","400900030"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Russell Westbrook had a big second half and another triple-double, and it still almost wasn't enough for Oklahoma City. Westbrook had 36 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his 20th triple-double of the season and the Thunder beat the Sacramento Kings 122-118 on Sunday night. The dynamic, five-time All-Star guard had 19 triple-doubles last season. He entered Sunday averaging a triple-double and is trying to match Hall of Fame guard Oscar Robertson as the only NBA player to average a triple-double for a full season. What pleased Thunder coach Billy Donovan regarding the latest triple-double was how well Westbrook played after intermission. Westbrook had 25 points, seven rebounds and four assists in the second half, and scored 13 points in the fourth to help thwart a late Sacramento charge. ""Russell's second half was phenomenal. He was really efficient scoring and passing,"" Donovan said. What didn't please Donovan was allowing the Kings to rally from a 12-point deficit in the final 2:04. An 11-2 run capped by a DeMarcus Cousins' 3-pointer pulled the Kings within 116-113 with 26.5 seconds left. ""We played really well on defense outside of the final minute and a half of the fourth quarter,"" Donovan said. ""We allowed 39 points in the fourth quarter. We were fortunate we won. The things we did at the end of the game will get you beat."" Enes Kanter had 29 points and 12 rebounds for the Thunder. Victor Oladipo had 17 of his 23 points in the first half and Alex Abrines had 13 points. Oklahoma City had dropped three of its previous four games. DeMarcus Cousins had 31 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists for the Kings, who have lost two straight and five of six. Rudy Gay had 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Darren Collison had 21 points. The Kings committed 22 turnovers that led to 23 points after having 21 giveaways in a loss Friday to the Cavaliers. They are 1-5 on this seven-game homestand. ""I didn't think we had a lot of momentum,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""At the end of day, I can yell about referees and this and that, but we had 15 turnovers at halftime. It doesn't have to do with anything else."" The Kings battled back and twice cut the lead to three points in the final 25 seconds, but Abrines and Oladipo each made two free throws and Westbrook had a steal and layup to fend off Sacramento. Westbrook made a pair of 3-pointers and had seven points in an 80-second span to put the Thunder up by 15 just past the midway point in the fourth. After a subpar first half where he missed frequent shots and committed five turnovers, Westbrook got going in the third quarter, scoring 11 points and helping the Thunder take an 88-79 lead into the fourth. Thunder starting center Steven Adams took a fall early in the third quarter and eventually headed to the locker room. He was evaluated for a concussion and didn't return. ""We will evaluate him (Adams) some with testing to find out where's he's at,"" Donovan said. TIP INS Thunder: Domantas Sabonis missed all four 3-point attempts and has now misfired on 22 of 23 attempts. Kings: Entering the game, Cousins had a career shooting percentage of 38.6 percent against the Thunder, his lowest versus any team. He was 4 of 11 in the first half.","400900031"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Doug McDermott's troubles vanished in one quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies. McDermott scored a career-high 31 points, including the final two free throws of the Chicago Bulls' 108-104 victory over Memphis on Sunday night. McDermott, who was 7 of 31 from the field in his four previous games, got 20 of his points in the second quarter, helping replace the scoring missing from Dwyane Wade, who did not play on the second night of a back-to-back after the Bulls beat New Orleans at home Saturday. ""You can't be perfect every game, so you've just got to find a way to contribute out there and continue to work on your game,"" said McDermott, who missed only one of seven shots in the second frame. ""That's what I've done, and I was rewarded for the hard work."" Taj Gibson finished with 18 points and eight rebounds for Chicago, and Jimmy Butler had 16 points. Despite McDermott's first-half scoring, the Bulls were still in a battle at the end. Chicago broke a 104-all tie -- the 11th in the game -- with 26 seconds left on a 15-footer from Butler, who also made an 18-footer with 53.6 seconds remaining. McDermott closed the scoring with a pair of free throws with just under seven seconds left. Butler's steal of the ensuing inbound pass sealed the Bulls' second-straight win. Mike Conley led Memphis with 28 points and eight assists, and Marc Gasol had 24 points and 11 rebounds. Zach Randolph finished with 15 points and a season-best 16 boards. The game featured 16 lead changes, and neither team held a double-digit lead. ""We couldn't get to our defensive coverage to save our lives down the stretch,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""The second and fourth quarters, we didn't defend at the level we are capable of defending."" TIP-INS Bulls: Nikola Mirotic missed his fourth straight game dealing with an illness. ... McDermott's 22 first-half points were more than his total for the four previous games (21). ... Chicago scored 14 points in the first quarter, a season low for the opening frame, but its 38 points in the second was a season-high for a quarter by any Memphis opponent. Grizzlies: Gasol made a pair of 3-pointers in the first half, marking 17 games this season he has made multiple shots from outside the arc. ... Memphis made 11 3-pointers in the game and has converted at least 10 3s in 20 games this season, including 11 of the last 14 games. MLK HOLIDAY This is the 15th season Memphis has hosted a game on Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend. The Grizzlies are 6-9 in the holiday game. In recognition of the holiday, Memphis wore special MLK50 Pride uniforms. The black jerseys have sea foam blue numbers, letters and piping with the full T-shirt look instead of the normal sleeveless. The piping replicated the railing in front the rooms at the Lorraine Motel, where King was assassinated in 1968, and the blue color was similar to the doors on the rooms. MISSING WADE Wade's absence meant missing a reunion with Fizdale. Both left the Miami Heat organization after last season -- Wade signing with the Bulls and Fizdale getting his first head coaching job in Memphis. Fizdale said he is sort of a ""basketball romantic"" and would like to have seen Wade retire in Miami. But he predicted after the player's career ""his statue will be out front and (Wade) will be remembered as the great player that he should be.""","400900032"
"LOS ANGELES -- Stan Van Gundy and the Detroit Pistons knew their Los Angeles-based team owner, Tom Gores, would be watching when they visited Staples Center. It was a perfect time to snap a couple of losing streaks while allowing Gores to celebrate the Pistons' first win in his adopted hometown since he bought the team. Tobias Harris scored 23 points and hit a decisive 3-pointer with 30.5 seconds to play, and Detroit ended a three-game skid with a 102-97 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday night. Marcus Morris scored 23 points and Andre Drummond had 15 points and 17 rebounds for the Pistons, who wrapped up their longest trip of the season by beating the Lakers at Staples Center for the first time in seven tries since Nov. 14, 2008. They've also lost 11 straight to the Clippers, but Gores finally got to congratulate his Pistons after a game in LA. ""Every one of us in this organization knows we've got a great owner, and we know we haven't delivered a win here since he's owned the team,"" Van Gundy said. ""That felt almost better than breaking the (three-game losing) streak."" The Pistons won without two injured starters, wrapping up their five-game road trip with a bounce-back performance from their 33-point loss at Utah on Friday, their worst defeat of the season and their 11th loss in 15 games. The Pistons barely hung on down the stretch of a back-and-forth game with the Lakers, who lost their fourth straight despite 26 points from Lou Williams. Detroit had a one-point lead when Harris got the ball from Drummond after Lakers rookie Brandon Ingram deflected it late in an aimless Pistons possession. Harris beat the shot clock with his 3-pointer in front of the Lakers' bench for a 99-95 lead. ""It was a huge win for us, just because we've had some tough games that I think we underachieved in,"" Harris said. ""It was good to see us all out there getting defensive stops and executing."" D'Angelo Russell added 20 points for the Lakers, who have lost 20 of 25 since their 10-10 start to coach Luke Walton's first season. ""I don't want to keep using the `young team' thing,"" Williams said. ""At some point, we've got to show growth as a group. Some things, like ball movement, should be second nature at this point."" GORES' SUPPORT On Saturday, Gores had a three-hour meeting with Van Gundy. The owner and coach both emerged with excitement about the Pistons' future despite that poor six-week stretch since early December. ""(Gores') thing was not to overreact to six weeks out of what has been a 2 1/2-year process,"" Van Gundy said. ""It was good to sit down and talk through things and get his perspective on things."" TO THE BANK Drummond banked in a 62-foot shot at the halftime buzzer, holding his hand aloft from the moment he let it go. Even Lakers fans had to applaud when it put Detroit up 59-57 at halftime after the Pistons had erased a 14-point Lakers lead. ""Did I call it? Of course,"" Drummond said with a grin. TIP-INS Pistons: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed his second straight game with a strained rotator cuff. ... Drummond's 3-pointer was his second of the season. ... F Jon Leuer missed his fourth straight game with a sore right knee. Lakers: Tarik Black went to the locker room in the third quarter after apparently injuring his ankle under the basket. ... Williams converted a four-point play in the second quarter. ... The Lakers have played 45 games already this season, most in the NBA by a long shot. They've played nine games in January already. ... Luol Deng returned to the lineup after sitting out Saturday's loss to the Clippers for rest. He Deng scored two points in 36 minutes. Fellow starter Julius Randle had two points in 32 minutes.","400900033"
"NEW YORK -- Dennis Schroder gave the Hawks the lead and the New York Knicks had three chances to take it back. Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony and Joakim Noah, who they hoped would be the backbone of a contending team, all failed from inside a few feet. ""When things are not going your way, sometimes they go all the way left,"" Anthony said. ""That's a shot that I think I could hit in my sleep."" Schroder scored 28 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 22 seconds left, to lead the Hawks to a 108-107 victory on Monday. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 20 points and Paul Millsap had 17 for the Hawks, who won for the ninth time in 10 games to reach the midpoint of their schedule at 24-17. ""Guys got heart on this team,"" said Millsap, who blocked Rose's shot on a drive to the basket before Anthony missed a fairly easy follow. ""Guys compete and when you compete good things happen."" Anthony scored 30 points for the Knicks, who changed their lineup but it wasn't quite good enough. They lost for the 11th time in 13 games. The Hawks rested Dwight Howard, while the Knicks were without Kristaps Porzingis again because of a sore left Achilles tendon. They gave undrafted rookie Ron Baker his first career start and moved Courtney Lee to the bench. Baker helped spark a 10-0 run to start the fourth with a pair of 3-pointers, but Schroder kept the Hawks in it all the way while making 13-of-16 shots. ""We knew they were going to make their run,"" Hardaway said. ""Their second group does a tremendous job raising the intensity on both ends of the floor. We just had to match that."" It was a much better effort for the Knicks than Sunday, when they reached an embarrassing low by being outscored 27-8 in the third quarter of a 116-101 loss at Toronto. But as usual with the Knicks, the game was only a minor part of the chaos. Anthony responded to questions about a Fanragsports.com piece written by Charley Rosen, a Phil Jackson confidante, that said he had ""outlived his usefulness in New York"" by saying that maybe he needed to have a conversation with Jackson if he felt that way. It's unclear if Jackson does, because he has barely spoken publicly this season and not at all to the New York media since preseason, though Rosen posted another piece Monday that his thoughts were his alone. Anthony said he hadn't heard from Jackson and didn't need to. ""My job is to go out there and play ball and I'm not concerned about that,"" Anthony said. Anthony made buzzer-beaters to end the second and third quarters, but the Knicks needed one more. ""I was surprised he missed that one,"" Millsap said. ""He's made a bunch of tough shots."" TIP-INS Hawks: The Hawks have won five in a row on the road, their longest streak since a 12-game run in the 2014-15 season. ... Hardaway, a former Knicks guard, had his ninth 20-point game of the season. Knicks: The Knicks were also without forward Lance Thomas because of a fractured left orbital bone. MARTIN KING LUTHER JR. DAY STATS The Hawks improved to 17-9 on the holiday, with seven straight victories. The Knicks fell to 20-11 with a two-game winning streak snapped. CARMELO CONCERNS Anthony has a no-trade clause and would need to agree to any deal. Coach Jeff Hornacek, though only in his first season here, says Anthony, like all players, has to deal with trade speculation. ""I think he does a great job of dealing with it and handling that kind of stuff. But does it affect him? I am sure it does in some way,"" Hornacek said. ""But hopefully like most players, the trade deadline comes and goes every year.""","400900034"
"WASHINGTON --  Determined not to give the Portland Trail Blazers' elite guards any feel-good shots, the Washington Wizards knocked down a few of their own and got rolling. Bradley Beal scored 25 points and John Wall had 24 as the Wizards took a page out of the Trail Blazers' playbook by hitting 13 3-pointers in a comfortable 120-101 victory on Monday afternoon. Washington, which relies on the 3-point shot less than almost any other NBA team, made 9 of 13 3-pointers in a 75-point first half and was 13 of 23 in the game. ""When we play defense and get rebounds and get out in transition, teams (have) to collapse when I'm penetrating,"" said Wall, who was 10 of 17 from the floor. ""We moved the ball very well, and guys were knocking down shots and shooting with confidence."" Confidence came from a 4 of 5 start and a 10-0 lead as Beal was hot early. He and Wall outplayed Portland's Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, who Wizards coach Scott Brooks said combined to be as good as any backcourt in the league. Lillard led the Blazers with 22 points and McCollum had 12, but they combined to shoot 11 of 29 from the floor. ""Just staying down on his pump fakes, making it tough for him, using my length to disturb him and just making sure I keep him in front of me because he's one of the quickest guards in the league,"" said Wizards guard Kelly Oubre, whose 18 points were one shy of his career high. The Wizards led by as many as 30 on the way to their 12th consecutive home victory and their fourth win in five games. They limited the Blazers to 8 of 26 shooting from beyond the arc, part of which was self-inflicted. ""I thought our whole team struggled offensively,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""We didn't pass and move. We didn't do things that make us a good offensive basketball team."" Washington did plenty of things to look like a good offensive basketball team, and Brooks was particularly proud of his team's ball movement that helped put the game out of reach. ""I think early in the game when guys get good looks and they see the ball go in, they get confident, they start believing,"" Lillard said. ""Later in the game when we started to contest shots and have more of a presence, it didn't really impact them because they had already seen the ball go in three or four times on the perimeter."" THE HOOK When Marcin Gortat's layup with 4:24 left in the third quarter made it 95-65, Stotts had enough and pulled his starting five because he didn't think the game was going anywhere. ""He's the coach,"" Lillard said. ""He took us out of the game, and that was it."" STREAK OVER McCollum's streak of consecutive games with 25-plus points ended at eight. Beal tried to take McCollum off his game early by being physical, and foul pressure mounted. ""We were getting our heads beat in, we didn't execute our offense, I got some fouls early (and) the game got out of hand,"" McCollum said. MLK DAY Wearing a shirt with the message: ""His dream inspired the world. Never stop dreaming,"" Beal took the microphone to address the crowd of 17,395 on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Brooks said he always stops by the MLK Memorial during his walks around the National Mall, and Stotts said about half the team went to the National Museum of African American History and Culture after practice Monday. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: McCollum became the eighth player to score 1,000 points this season, joining Russell Westbrook, James Harden, DeMar DeRozan, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant and Isaiah Thomas. ... F Maurice Harkless, who was questionable with a left calf injury, was 0 of 5 with no points. Wizards: Improved to 10-2 when F Otto Porter has at least three 3-pointers.. ... Their last 12-game home winning streak came in 1989 as the Bullets. ... F Markieff Morris had 17 points and 13 rebounds for his third double-double of the season.","400900035"
"MILWAUKEE --  Once Joel Embiid regained his footing, the Philadelphia 76ers were fine. Embiid scored 18 of his 22 points in the second half and the 76ers won for the fourth time in five games, beating the Milwaukee Bucks 113-104 Monday. The Sixers improved to 13-26. Their only recent loss was Saturday at Washington, when Embiid didn't play. Embiid is limited to 28 minutes per game while trying to overcome injuries that have slowed his career. ""My legs were really heavy and I didn't play against Washington, so I got out of shape so easily,"" Embiid said. ""In the second half, I just got it going. I rely on my defense to get my offense going and we played really well defensively."" Embiid had 12 rebounds. He made four of nine shots and 13 of 18 free throws. ""He started the game in the first half, very unlike Joel, he really struggled,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""The way he came on in the second half, particularly with his competitive physical mind and the way he played, really set the stage and set the table for our defense."" Philadelphia had lost nine in a row to the Bucks, last beating them on Nov. 22, 2013. Jabari Parker and Giannis Antetokounmpo each scored 23 points for Milwaukee. Antetokounmpo was in foul trouble for most of the second half, scoring only two points in 11 minutes after the break and fouling out with 2:51 to go. ""We had to do something because he really took control of the game in the first half,"" Brown said. ""Our team defense around Giannis improved."" Dario Saric scored 17 points and Ersan Ilyasova added 12 for the Sixers, who made 14 of 37 3-point attempts. The Bucks have given up at least 10 3-pointers in their last seven consecutive games, with opponents taking at least 30 3-point attempts in four of their last five games. ""At some point, we have to understand what the 3 means to us as a team if we want to win,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""We can talk about it, but if there's no effort in guarding it and understanding, again, it starts with effort. If we don't give it, we're going to give up a lot of 3s."" The 76ers used a 12-2 run to take control of the game midway through the fourth quarter. A dunk by Jahlil Okafor began the burst and Embiid capped it with a pair of free throws. Milwaukee missed 10 of its first 13 shots in the quarter to fall behind 97-87 with less than 5 minutes to play. ""Everyone says we have a young team, but that's an excuse,"" Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon said. ""I think there's a lack of focus. We've got to come out collectively, it's not anybody individually. It's a unit."" NOEL LATE SCRATCH Nerlens Noel was a late scratch for the Sixers with a sprained left ankle, leaving Okafor to back up Embiid. Okafor scored 10 points in 20 minutes off the bench. ""I just tried to get loose as fast as I could,"" he said. ""I've been working extremely hard to stay prepared in case something like this happened."" FOUL TROUBLE Antetokounmpo had a marvelous first half with 21 points, making 9 of 11 shots. But the Bucks star picked up his fourth foul with 6:04 left in the third quarter and didn't return until the beginning of the fourth quarter. He lasted just 38 seconds in the fourth quarter before committing his fifth foul and heading back to the bench. BUCKS ROOKIE IMPRESSES Brogdon started for the 10th consecutive game, and scored 11 points with six assists in 28 minutes. He is averaging 13.5 points and the team is 5-5 since he entered the starting lineup. TIP-INS 76ers: G T.J. McConnell was in Philadelphia to have an MRI on his right wrist, which showed no structural damage. Bucks: Parker spoke to the Milwaukee crowd before the game about Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy. ""His legacy, his leadership, his characteristics really resemble what our country needs to be like today,"" he said.","400900036"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana Pacers guard Jeff Teague figures he'll eventually get that elusive triple-double. Until then, he's content to pile up wins. For the fourth time in 30 days, the former All-Star guard flirted with his first career triple double and Paul George scored 19 points to help the Indiana Pacers hold off the New Orleans Pelicans 98-95. Teague finished with 16 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds -- the closest he's come yet this season. ""I'm happy I'm getting some rebounds,"" Teague said. ""I was one of the worst rebounders last year, so to actually get some rebounds this year is good."" The Pacers rebounded from Thursday's embarrassing performance in London by leading almost wire to wire. They trailed only once, at 2-0, and were only tied just three times -- twice in the first 66 seconds and at 91 with 4:10 left in the game. And Teague was a big reason why the Pacers managed to keep the Pelicans at arm's distance. The other reason: Anthony Davis' injury. New Orleans' All-Star center took a hard tumble with 7:08 left in the third quarter when he appeared to be leaping for an uncontested dunk. Myles Turner raced over, hit Davis on the right wrist, sent him sprawling. After Davis got up, he limped toward midcourt before making two free throws and being replaced by Terrence Jones. Davis finished with a team high 16 points but did not return. Team officials said he injured his right thumb and left hip and that X-rays were negative. Davis left with a slight limp but did not speak with reporters. ""I don't know anything yet, we'll check with the doctors,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. Without Davis, the Pelicans couldn't quite come all the way back from a 14-point deficit in the first quarter or two 10-point deficits in the third quarter. Teague broke the 91-91 with a 3-pointer with 3:55 to play and New Orleans had three chances to tie the score in the final 20 seconds. But Jrue Holiday missed a 22-foot pull-up jumper, E'Twaun Moore missed a short runner with 4.8 seconds left and Tyreke Evans fired up an air ball from the corner as the buzzer sounded. ""We let them hang around without their star on the floor,"" George said. ""We're floating around .500. We've got to get some consistency, we've got to find a way."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Moore and Jones each had 15 points. Jones also had eight rebounds. ... Solomon Hill had four points and four rebounds in his first trip back to Indiana since leaving the Pacers in free agency. ... The Pelicans were 6 of 9 on 3-pointers in the second quarter after scoring only 18 points in the first. Pacers: Myles Turner had his eighth double-double of the season -- 18 points and 12 rebounds.  He also had four blocks. ... Thaddeus Young left in the first half after getting poked in the left eye but returned at the start of the third quarter. He finished with 17 points and tied a season-high with six steals. ... Indiana won despite missing four of its last six free throws. ... Pacers guard Rodney Stuckey (sore left hamstring) hasn't played since Dec. 28 and coach Nate McMillan said before the game he isn't expected to play on Indiana's upcoming three-game road trip. FATHER-SON MATCHUP Pacers coach Nate McMillan didn't want Monday's game to turn into an emotional father-son matchup. So after having dinner Sunday with his son, Jamelle, an assistant with the Pelicans, the Pacers coach told his son the same thing he always has. ""We're both trying to win,"" the father said. ""That way it's not a father-son deal. He's been taught to go out there and win."" But the elder McMillan was surprised this day even came. When he was asked if he ever discussed the intricacies of coaching with his son, McMillan quipped: ""No, I didn't. I thought he'd be smarter than that."" HOME, SWEET, HOME The Pacers have won five straight on their home court and have the second best home record in the Eastern Conference at 16-5. And New Orleans knows how tough it is to play at Indiana. The Pelicans have lost seven straight at Indy since their last win in January 2010.","400900037"
"DENVER -- The Nuggets found a connection while hanging out on their recent trip to London. That bond trailed them back to Denver. Nikola Jokic scored a career-high 30 points, Emmanuel Mudiay dished out a career-best 13 assists and the Nuggets followed up their ""home"" win in London with another at the Pepsi Center, beating the Orlando Magic 125-112 on Monday. Jokic also grabbed 11 rebounds and Kenneth Faried scored 20 points for the Nuggets, who certainly packed their surging offense with them when they returned home from Europe. They routed Indiana 140-112 last Thursday during the NBA's Global Games series and remained on that sort of shooting streak, hitting a season-high 58.4 percent from the floor. They also had 33 assists and 76 points in the paint. ""London was great for us, a good team trip,"" Faried said. ""We had fun and enjoyed each other's company."" These days, they're marching to the beat of Jokic, who did a little bit of everything. Most of his shots were from in close, but the 6-foot-10 center also showed his range by hitting a 3-pointer. Jokic also doesn't force shots, dishing out five assists. His unselfishness has been contagious -- the Nuggets had 33 assists. ""If I'm doing that (rubbing off on teammates), I'm so happy,"" Jokic said. ""Because I know if the ball is flying around ... that's really hard to guard. You don't know where the ball is."" Magic coach Frank Vogel was impressed. ""The kid Jokic is playing just terrific basketball,"" Vogel said. ""He creates an element of spread offense that is very, very difficult to handle."" Elfrid Payton scored 20 points and had 12 assists as the Magic fell to 1-4 on their current six-game trip. ""We've got to get a win. We're behind the eight-ball with where we're at in the standings,"" Vogel said. ""It doesn't matter -- home, road, or who we're playing, it doesn't matter. We've got to get a win."" Denver arrived home from London on Friday, took Saturday off and then went through an intense practice Sunday designed to shake any sort of lingering jet lag. ""Now, it's mental,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said before the game. ""Can you push all that tiredness and fatigue and jet lag out of your mind?"" They certain did. Up 69-63 early in the third quarter, the Nuggets pulled away with a 16-2 run. The Magic cut into a 22-point deficit, but Faried put the game away with an emphatic dunk with 1:28 remaining. ""It starts with Nikola. Now you have Emmanuel playing (well),"" Malone said. ""Everybody is trying to play that way. ""Right now, everything on offense we're doing with purpose. If we could get to that on defense, we'd be a pretty good team."" TIP-INS Magic: G/F Evan Fournier was out with a bruised right heel. ... C Nikola Vucevic scored 17 points, and the Magic had seven players in double figures. Nuggets: G Gary Harris suffered a sprained right ankle early in the first quarter and didn't return. X-rays were negative. ... Denver has won 12 of the last 14 at home against Orlando. AN OFFICIAL SHORT The officials operated with a two-person crew after Nick Buchert was a late scratch for personal reasons. It really didn't seem to be an issue for Tom Washington and Justin VanDuyne, who were never really out of position. They called 27 fouls. ALL-STAR ATTENTION? Although Jokic is averaging 13.3 points, 7.9 rebounds and 3.9 assists, Malone doesn't expect his big man to be in All-Star consideration just yet. That has to do with Denver's sub-.500 record and not his play. ""Unless you're winning, I don't think you're going to be in the conversation,"" Malone said. ""With that being said, everybody in the NBA knows Nikola and what he brings to the table. He's probably one of the most fun players to watch.""","400900038"
"BOSTON -- Isaiah Thomas is even starting to amaze some of his teammates. Thomas scored 17 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter, and the surging Boston Celtics beat the Charlotte Hornets 108-98 on Monday night for their ninth victory in 11games. It was Thomas' 25th straight game with 20 or more points. He's been putting up big final quarters of late -- scoring 20 or more three times this season. No other NBA player had done it more than once entering Monday. ""Yeah, he's a special, special player, obviously,"" Boston forward Kelly Olynyk said. ""I don't know if there's another person in the world doing what he's doing. It's unfathomable to sit there and watch every night."" Al Horford had 22 points, while Olynyk and Jae Crowder added 15 apiece for Boston, which has won all three meetings with Charlotte this season. But it was Thomas' late-game performance that kept the Celtics rolling. He credited his teammates for setting him up well in the fourth. ""I'm in a really good place right now,"" he said. ""My teammates put me in a position to be me and that's all I can say."" He even heard chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" late in the game. ""They're pretty cool. It just doesn't seem real for them to be chanting MVP to me in (TD) Garden,"" he said. ""It's a feeling I can't explain."" Kemba Walker scored 24 points and Marvin Williams had 21 for the Hornets, who lost their fifth straight -- all on the road. ""We had things in to get the ball out of his hands, but the way they played, the stuff that they usually go to late, they didn't get to,"" Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said of trying to stop Thomas. ""He made some terrific plays. He's a terrific offensive player."" Thomas scored 13 straight points, pushing Boston ahead 93-83 with his 3-pointer from the left wing with 7 1/2 minutes left. ""He's been playing as well as anyone in our league,"" Walker said of the 5-foot-9 Thomas. ""He's playing with great confidence, making the plays for his team to win games. So, he's been great."" Boston led 80-71 entering the final period. TIP-INS Hornets: Entered averaging the second-fewest turnovers in the league at 12.1 per game. They had 11.

NICE CATCH New England Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount sat courtside behind a basket and made a two-handed grab of a ball flying out of bounds. SPORTS TRANSITION It was the nightcap of a hockey/basketball doubleheader, and 6-foot-4 Celtics guard Marcus Smart entered TD Garden wearing a winter jacket and hat. He paused and stood seemingly unnoticed as a group of youngsters and parents -- most wearing Boston Bruins colors -- walked down a hall to meet some of the hockey players. Smart smiled when a media member said, ""I don't think anyone noticed you."" Later, 6-foot-9 Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara headed past folks walking in for the basketball game.","400900039"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Now, everybody can sit back for a few months and envision the possibility of another scintillating NBA Finals between Cleveland and Golden State. LeBron James vs. Stephen Curry for the third straight time, complete with the hard-nosed play of Draymond Green, dazzling dunks from Kevin Durant and sharp shooting from Kyrie Irving. This regular-season round went to the Warriors, who dominated from the start on Monday -- and it wasn't even close. The defending champs were dismantled on the very floor where they captured the franchise's first title last June. Curry and his superstar supporting cast certainly looked ready to trade more postseason blows with Cleveland. The two-time reigning MVP hit five 3-pointers on the way to 20 points while matching his season best with 11 assists in Golden State's 126-91 rout of the Cavaliers. ""This is high-quality basketball, at its highest level,"" Curry said. ""These are the kinds of atmospheres that you live for. Whether you win or lose, regular season, playoffs, whatever, that you can play in that kind of environment that's always fun."" Klay Thompson scored 26 points with five 3s, and Green produced his third triple-double of the season with 11 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists. He also equaled his career best with five blocks -- and had another confrontation with King James in the process. James had 20 points on 6-of-18 shooting and eight rebounds. But he and Green became the talk once more as their relationship again turned testy. ""I don't think it's a rivalry,"" James reiterated. ""It's two great teams that have aspirations. I don't believe I've ever had a rivalry in the NBA."" Durant added 21 points, six rebounds, five assists and three blocks for the Warriors in a much-hyped matchup merely weeks after Golden State lost 109-108 in Cleveland on Christmas. The Warriors squandered a 14-point lead that day in a loss that fueled them going into Monday. They relinquished a 3-1 advantage in the Finals last year, a failure that motivates them to return to the big stage. And the teams' latest holiday game marked the Cavs' first trip back to Oracle Arena since capturing the title here seven months ago. Irving -- who hit game-winners against Golden State in the past two matchups, including the championship clincher -- scored 17 points on an uncharacteristic day for the Cavs when they committed 15 turnovers to 11 assists. ""They did what they were supposed to do,"" Irving said. ""Right from the start they jumped on us and never looked back."" Cleveland shot just 35.2 percent (31 for 88) overall. Beyond embarrassed, Cavs players headed for the tunnel before the final buzzer even sounded. The latest altercation between Green and James came with 6:55 left in the first half. Golden State led 52-35 when James collided with Green near midcourt, resulting in a flagrant 1 foul on Golden State's emotional All-Star. Green's arm extended across the upper body of James, who went down hard and lay on the court. Green reacted by appearing to mock James for flopping. After a long replay review, a double technical was called on Green and Richard Jefferson. After Curry's pull-up 3 moments before halftime sent his team into the break with a 78-49 lead, the star guard did what looked like a little celebratory breakdancing move on his behind at the sideline. You bet this one felt like more than just any game to the Warriors, looking to regain some swagger in this rivalry after Cleveland had won the past four meetings, including last year's NBA Finals. ""To me it was because they beat us four straight times and that's never fun when a team has your number for four games, so it felt good to redeem ourselves,"" Thompson said. Durant, new to the rivalry this season, appeared downright possessed. KD's driving, emphatic tomahawk jam 1:43 before halftime sent Oracle Arena's sellout crowd into a frenzy. Zaza Pachulia pulled down 13 rebounds as Golden State had a 58-35 edge on the boards. Andre Iguodala came off the bench to make all five of his field goal attempts for a season-high 14 points, and Shaun Livingston added 13. With this one in the books, these teams are done with each other -- for the time being. ""It's intense enough for two matchups,"" Green said. ""If you want to play each other again, try to get to the NBA Finals. The fact you only play twice a year makes it even more exciting because you only have two cracks at it."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland, second in the NBA in 3-pointers (496) coming in and third in 3-point percentage (.385), shot 2 for 12 from behind the arc in the first quarter and had just one assist in the period. The Cavs were 9 of 34 from long range overall. ... Kyle Korver played in his 1,000th career game.

"PHOENIX -- Old-timer Joe Johnson gave the young Phoenix Suns a lesson in clutch shooting. Johnson scored 10 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter, including the go-ahead 3-pointer just before the shot clock expired with 49.8 seconds to play, and the Utah Jazz made it seven in a row against the Suns with a 106-101 victory Monday night. The Jazz scored the final seven points after T.J. Warren's steal and breakaway dunk put Phoenix ahead 101-99 with 1:13 left. The Suns played tight defense on the next possession, when the ball touched Johnson's hands twice. The second time he was in the corner with P.J. Tucker in his face. ""Even though it wasn't the look that we wanted, I knew I had to get a shot up and luckily it went in,"" Johnson said. Devin Booker, the Suns' 20-year-old guard, called it ""an unbelievable shot."" ""I'm sure he's been in that situation plenty of times so I'm sure he's comfortable with it,"" Booker said. ""We played really good defense that possession. You have to credit him on that shot -- a fade-away corner 3."" Jazz coach Quin Snyder wasn't surprised that Johnson, a 13-year NBA veteran who long ago was a rising young star with the Suns, made the shot. ""He's capable of doing that and he knows we believe in him and it was a big-time shot, no question about it,"" Snyder said, ""and he's been doing that for a long time."" Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 17 rebounds for Utah. Gordon Hayward and George Hill scored 17 apiece. Suns guard Eric Bledsoe had 31 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, falling just short of his third career triple-double. Booker, coming off consecutive 39-point games in Mexico City, added 25 for Phoenix. After Booker's 15-footer bounced off the front of the rim, Hayward made it 104-101 on two free throws with 13.6 seconds to play. Gobert blocked Marquese Chriss' driving layup on Phoenix's next possession, and Johnson sealed it with two from the free throw line with 5.7 seconds remaining. Gobert, who took advantage of the absence of Suns center Tyson Chandler, converted a three-point play to put Utah ahead 99-97 with 3:16 left. Bledsoe's basket in traffic inside tied it at 99 with 2:37 left. There it stayed until Warren knocked the ball away from Hayward and scored to put Phoenix ahead for the last time. The Suns led throughout the second and third quarters but were up only 80-79 entering the fourth. Bledsoe had 18 points, five rebounds and five assists in the first half, with the Suns taking a 53-47 lead at the break. Alex Len scored twice to open the second half to give Phoenix its biggest lead at 57-47, but the Jazz came back in a hurry and stayed close throughout the quarter. Joe Ingles' 3-pointer cut the lead to 78-77 with 37 seconds left in the third. Booker sank two free throws and Raul Neto scored on a driving layup to make it a one-point game. Bledsoe's 15-foot running bank shot followed by Chriss' three-point play put Phoenix up 49-43 with 2:19 left in the second quarter. Hill scored on a 21-footer and a driving layup to make it 49-47 before Chriss' dunk on a pass from Warren gave the Suns their six-point halftime lead. Without Chandler, the Suns were outscored 22-6 in second-chance points. ""That's pretty much the ballgame,"" Phoenix coach Earl Watson said. BOOKER'S STREAK Booker, who had 16 points in the second half, scored at least 20 for the sixth consecutive game, the longest streak of his young career. During that stretch, he's averaged just over 30 points per game. With his Mexico City performances, he became the youngest player in NBA history with consecutive 39-point games.

"LOS ANGELES -- The last time Chris Paul went down with an injury, the Los Angeles Clippers went into a tailspin. They're hoping it doesn't happen again. J.J. Redick scored 20 points, DeAndre Jordan had 19 points and 15 rebounds, and the streaking Clippers overcame Paul's latest injury to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder 120-98 on Monday night. The banged-up Clippers tied a franchise record for their best start to a calendar year at 7-0. The team began 1974 with the same mark when the club was located in Buffalo. Los Angeles owns the NBA's longest active winning streak despite being without injured star Blake Griffin. Paul sprained his left thumb in the second quarter of this one and didn't return. ""You worry when he doesn't come back out in the second half,"" Redick said. ""Hopefully, it's not serious, but if it is, Blake is going to be back soon. We'll just continue to play."" Last month, Paul sat out with a left hamstring strain and the Clippers lost six in a row. He came back shortly after their current winning streak began. Coach Doc Rivers said an initial X-ray on Paul's thumb was negative and the star point guard was set to have an MRI on Tuesday. Rivers didn't see the play but said he was told Russell Westbrook came down on Paul's thumb. Despite the injury, the Clippers shot 55 percent and improved to 16-0 when hitting 50 percent or better. They were dominant in the paint, outscoring the Thunder 62-34. ""Our whole goal was to own the paint,"" Rivers said. Westbrook scored 24 points on 7-of-19 shooting in three quarters for the Thunder, the last team to beat the Clippers -- on New Year's Eve -- before the calendar turned and their winning streak began. He was the only starter in double figures for Oklahoma City. ""We weren't ready to play and we didn't play good defense and they were more physical than us,"" Westbrook said. ""We were sluggish."" Jordan had three dunks, including a reverse off a pass from Marreese Speights, in the third quarter when the Clippers stretched their lead to 27 points. Speights finished with a season-high 23 points. ""We're just clicking, all of us,"" Jordan said. ""It's more defense. Our second unit has been amazing. We're coming out with that mindset of playing hard for 48 minutes."" Jordan sat out the fourth when Speights dunked and hit two 3-pointers. The Clippers outscored the Thunder 24-6, including nine points by Speights and six by Redick, to take a 22-point lead in the second. ""We didn't move the ball and we were stagnant,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""We gave them opportunities. We weren't ready to play.""

"NEW YORK --  DeMar DeRozan's double-double and Cory Joseph's career night propelled the Toronto Raptors past the free-falling Brooklyn Nets. DeRozan had 36 points and 11 rebounds, and Joseph set a personal high by scoring 33 on Tuesday night in Toronto's 119-109 victory over Brooklyn. After shooting 3 for 14 in the first half, DeRozan found his stroke and finished 13 for 28. ""I just kept playing the same way,"" he said. ""You know, getting good looks and just going out there and I know it's going to come, it's just more so being patient, not really worrying about the misses."" Toronto won its fourth straight game and extended Brooklyn's losing streak to 11 in a row. Joseph started in place of Kyle Lowry, given the night off to rest. ""Kyle provides a lot of scoring for us,"" Joseph said. ""I knew that slot would be missing today, so I took it upon myself to be more aggressive, try to be aggressive and take what the defense gives me. They were giving up a lot of layups and short floaters, so that's what I was taking and so I happened to be making them."" Terrence Ross added 15 points for the Raptors, who opened the game with an 11-0 run but fell behind after the first quarter. Still, the Nets have not won since Dec. 26. ""You've got to keep going,"" center Brook Lopez said. ""We have a young group and we're learning a lot on the fly, so you've got to just stay positive. We're doing a lot well, just has not translated in the win column. I think we're definitely going to break through soon. We've just got to give ourselves a chance every night."" Lopez had 28 points for the Nets. Caris LeVert and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 14 apiece. Toronto took a 92-85 lead into the fourth quarter and never looked back. DeRozan led the way with 10 points in the third period, equaling LeVert's total in the quarter. Lopez and Joseph each scored 14 in the second. After the 11-0 spurt by the Raptors at the start, Brooklyn rallied to take a 29-26 lead at the end of the first quarter. TIP-INS Raptors: Coach Dwane Casey was asked what his expectations are for this season after losing in the Eastern Conference finals last year. ""We always want to advance. I'm not going to put a level on where we've got to get to or anything like that. Our thing is to continue to get better. We can't just try to get as many wins as we can and hope it works in the playoffs,"" he said. ... Joseph started for the first time since April 8, 2016. ... Lucas Nogueria experienced blurred vision and was checked for a concussion in the locker room after being hit in the head during the first quarter. He did not return. . Patrick Patterson (sore left knee), Jared Sullinger (left foot surgery) and Delon Wright (right shoulder surgery) were out. Nets: Coach Kenny Atkinson discussed what he's seen from veteran Quincy Acy, who is nearing the end of a 10-day contract. ""Love his energy. Love his pop, his aggressiveness and how competitive he is. We'll talk about it after the game with our group. I've been pleasantly surprised in his limited minutes,"" Atkinson said. ... Jeremy Lin (strained left hamstring) was out.","400900043"
"MIAMI -- The way the Miami Heat saw it, this was a reward. Goran Dragic had 21 points and eight assists, Wayne Ellington scored 18 off the bench and the Heat -- saddled with one of the worst records in the NBA -- overcame another triple-double from James Harden to beat the Houston Rockets 109-103 on Tuesday night. Dion Waiters scored 17, Tyler Johnson had 16 and James Johnson added 15 for the Heat, who trailed by a point midway through the fourth quarter before putting the game away with a 20-5 run. ""I'm glad to see our guys get rewarded finally for all the work, but that doesn't guarantee anything,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We talk about it all the time. You keep on putting in deposits, to the team, to the work, continue to work to get better ... trust that process."" Harden had 40 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for the Rockets (32-12), his 13th triple-double of the season. He shot 12 for 30 from the field and got his triple-double with an assist to Montrezl Harrell with 12.6 seconds left, an uncontested dunk with the Heat simply waiting for the clock to run out. Harrell had 13 points for the Rockets, who got 12 from Patrick Beverley. ""They played hard and they beat us,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""There's not much else to say."" Hassan Whiteside added 14 points and 15 rebounds for Miami in a game that had 19 lead changes and 15 ties. Dragic found Ellington for a corner 3 with 1:41 left to give Miami an 11-point lead -- the largest either team had to that point. The Rockets turned it over on their next possession, James Johnson got a runout dunk and the Heat (12-30) soon finished off the win. ""We got open shots. We just missed them,"" Harden said. ""We gave ourselves a chance, especially in that third quarter. Fourth quarter we didn't play as well as we need to."" TIP-INS Rockets: Clint Capela returned after missing 15 games with a small left fibula fracture and started at center. He was scoreless in nine minutes. ... The Rockets were without Ryan Anderson (flu), and Eric Gordon -- bothered by a sore ankle -- shot 3 for 17. ... Harden's triple-double was only the seventh posted by an opposing player in a game (including playoffs) at Miami -- and the second in three weeks, after Russell Westbrook did it on Dec. 27. Heat: It was Miami's first home game since Jan. 1. ... Okaro White was signed to a 10-day contract Tuesday, but did not play. ... Floyd Mayweather was courtside, as he's been for several Miami games this season. ... Miami held the Rockets to a 9-for-39 night from 3-point range. ... Miami's bench outscored Houston's 51-32. TECHS FOR EVERYONE Spoelstra received a technical early in the third quarter, upset after Rodney McGruder got hit with his fourth foul in 13 minutes. D'Antoni drew a technical with 5:40 left, and Beverley got one with 1:12 left. HARDEN IN MIAMI Shooting has never been easy for Harden in Miami. He was 3 for 18 in two games at AmericanAirlines Arena in the NCAA tournament for Arizona State in 2009. He's a 38 percent shooter in 11 games at Miami as a pro, 30 percent from 3-point range -- and his teams are 3-8 in those games.","400900044"
"CHICAGO --  Wesley Matthews was mad at himself after Jimmy Butler's clutch shot in the final minute. He exacted his revenge on the other side of the court. Matthews made a go-ahead 3-pointer from the wing with 12 seconds left, and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Chicago Bulls 99-98 on Tuesday night for their first three-game winning streak of the season. ""We've been struggling, it's been tough for 2 1/2 months, but guys kept hanging in and believing in each other,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Games like this give us even more confidence."" Six players scored in double figures for the Mavericks (14-27), including all five starters. Harrison Barnes had 20 points, Seth Curry added 18 and Dirk Nowitzki finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds. Dallas trailed 98-96 after Butler's long jumper over Matthews in a matchup of Marquette products with 23 seconds left, but Carlisle decided against a timeout and Deron Williams drove into the lane before kicking out to Matthews for the 3. ""Jimmy came down and made a great play. He went over the top of me and shot,"" Matthews said. ""And I can't really take much credit for the other end of the court. D-Will came down in transition. I think everyone was expecting a timeout, which was a good play by Coach to not do that. ""D-Will made a great play, he found me, and I just had to knock it down."" Matthews then prevented Butler from getting a shot off in the final seconds, and Dwyane Wade missed a potential game-winning jumper from the corner on his 35th birthday. ""They did a good job of pressuring on us, making us make tough shots,"" Wade said. ""Wes Matthews is a great defender and he did a great job of just pressuring Jimmy and making us get to other things at the end."" Butler finished with 24 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds for the Bulls, who had won two in a row. Robin Lopez scored 21, and Wade had 17 on 8-for-21 shooting. Wade's fadeaway jumper gave the Bulls a 94-90 lead with 3:18 remaining, but they struggled to score down the stretch of another disappointing performance at home. Chicago (21-22) dropped to 13-9 at the United Center, including home losses to the under-.500 Knicks, Lakers, Trail Blazers, Timberwolves and Mavericks. ""We've just got to be better, man,"" Butler said. ""It's the same mistakes over and over again."" Chicago played without forward Taj Gibson, sidelined by left ankle soreness. Paul Zipser, a second-round pick in last year's draft, started in Gibson's spot and finished with five points and three rebounds in his 13th game of the season. Gibson, averaging 12 points and 7.3 rebounds, could return Friday night at Atlanta. He had played in every game this season. Dallas put together a 15-4 run spanning halftime to open a 64-51 lead on Barnes' turnaround jumper with 8:38 left in the third. But Chicago kept chipping away at the deficit, and Lopez's three-point play off a pass from Butler trimmed the Mavericks' lead to 76-74 heading into the fourth. BULLISH AGAINST THE BULLS The Mavericks earned their fourth consecutive win against the Bulls, including a 107-82 victory in their first meeting this season. They swept the series against Chicago for the second consecutive season for the first time since 2002-03 and 2003-04. TIP-INS Mavericks: C Andrew Bogut missed his third straight game with a right hamstring strain. ... Williams had 11 points, nine assists and six rebounds, and reserve J.J. Barea scored 12 points.

He helped the U.S. win gold in Rio de Janeiro last summer. ...

"SAN ANTONIO --  After struggling to keep pace with the Minnesota Timberwolves for 24 minutes, San Antonio turned to its defensive stopper and offensive catalyst. Kawhi Leonard has been both for the Spurs all season, showing off his all-around game once again. Leonard had 34 points and San Antonio overcame a strong start by Minnesota for a 122-114 victory Tuesday night. ""That is what he does,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He plays both ends of the floor like nobody's business."" Leonard's fourth straight 30-point game helped him become the first San Antonio player to score 950 points in the first half of a season since Tim Duncan in 2003. ""I'm just happy we got the win,"" Leonard said. ""I just try to approach every game like it's a Game 7 of the Finals. You don't care about numbers, you just want to come out with a win."" Coming off a career-high 38 points on Saturday against Phoenix in Mexico City, Leonard was 12 for 17 from the field to spoil Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau's 59th birthday. ""He is an MVP candidate,"" Thibodeau said. ""When you look at All-Stars and MVPs, you look at what they do for their team in winning. There are people that can get stats, but they don't contribute to winning. He does everything to help his team win."" San Antonio went on a 20-2 run bridging the third and fourth quarters in winning its seventh straight against Minnesota. LaMarcus Aldridge added 29 points on 12-for-20 shooting for the Spurs. San Antonio had difficulty with Minnesota's explosive starting lineup. Karl-Anthony Towns had 27 points and 16 rebounds, and Ricky Rubio added 21 points and 14 assists. Zach LaVine scored 18, Gorgui Dieng had 17 and Andrew Wiggins 10. The Timberwolves' starters dominated the first half. Minnesota's 41 points in the second quarter were a season high for any period and the most points in a quarter by a San Antonio opponent this season. Minnesota shot 30 free throws in the first half, eight shy of the most by a San Antonio opponent all season. ""They played great,"" Aldridge said. ""They got to the basket. I thought they had us on our heels for a while. I thought guys did better in the second half, adjusting, trying to guard without fouling."" Minnesota was held to 11 free throws in the second half, the same number of turnovers it had in the final two quarters. ""We've just got to hit shots. We can't be worrying about free throws,"" Towns said. The Spurs held the Timberwolves to 43 points in the second half. TIP-INS Timberwolves: LaVine has 29 points, nine rebounds and three assists in his past two games since returning from a two-game absence caused by a bruised left hip. ... Minnesota is 4-22 when allowing 100-plus points. ... The Timberwolves' last win against San Antonio was April 8, 2014, a 110-91 victory at home. ... Minnesota's previous high for a quarter was 39 points in the first against Orlando on Nov. 9. Its previous high for the second period was 35 in that same game against the Magic. ... The Timberwolves are 5-15 on the road. Spurs: Leonard has scored in double figures in 73 straight games, the seventh-longest active streak in the NBA behind LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Isaiah Thomas, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Demarcus Cousins. ... Tony Parker collected his 6,500th career assist, joining James as the only two active players with 6,500 assists and 18,000 points. John Stockton, Isiah Thomas, Gary Payton and Oscar Robertson are the only other players to reach those milestones. ... Popovich was assessed his fourth technical foul of the season with 3:41 left in the first quarter for berating Michael Smith over a non-call. ... The Spurs are 20-1 this season when Patty Mills has at least two 3-pointers. Mills was 3 for 5 on 3s in scoring 11 points. WORK IN PROGRESS The Spurs have the third-best start in franchise history at 32-9, but the coaches and players agree they must improve. ""We've still got a lot of work to do,"" Leonard said. ""I think we could rebound the basketball a little better and also get our 1-on-1 defense better."" San Antonio has struggled in the first half of games for much of the season and has lost five home games after going 40-1 at home last season. ""We're not where we want to be, that's all I know,"" Popovich said. ""No team is where they want to be. Maybe Golden State is, but the rest of us are trying to get there."" The Spurs have the league's second-best record despite those struggles, sitting three games behind the Warriors (35-6). HE HAS MY VOTE Thibodeau believes Leonard is in line to win his third straight Defensive Player of the Year award. Leonard made only one steal, but was a disruptive force while holding Wiggins to 3-for-8 shooting. Leonard also grabbed seven rebounds. ""He's at the top every year. He's very disruptive and the demeanor he plays with, he gives their team a lot of poise,"" Thibodeau said.","400900046"
"LOS ANGELES --  All the Denver Nuggets needed was a trip across the Atlantic Ocean to find their groove. After snapping a five-game losing streak Thursday with a win over the Indiana Pacers in London, the Nuggets have returned to find home suddenly more accommodating. They held off a furious rally by the Los Angeles Lakers for a 127-121 victory Tuesday night that marked their third straight. Denver led by 19 late in the third quarter only to see the Lakers close to 120-119 with under two minutes to play. Wilson Chandler responded with a dunk and scored five points in the final 1:40 as the Nuggets hung on. ""They had all the momentum and the crowd going, but we had enough poise down the stretch to get the win,"" coach Michael Malone said. Denver's offense was led by center Nikola Jokic, who had 29 points and 15 rebounds. Will Barton added 26 points and eight assists, and Kenneth Faried had 20 points and seven rebounds. ""We had a little more time in London just to bond, just to be around (each other) off the court,"" Jokic said. ""We had more time to be together and I think that helped us."" The Lakers looked lost for most of Tuesday's game. They came out flat, fell behind by 14 points in the first quarter and were down by 17 heading into the final period. Veteran guard Lou Williams scored 14 of his team-high 24 points in the fourth to key the comeback bid. Nick Young had 22 points, and Jordan Clarkson scored 19 for the Lakers. ""We just started playing for each other,"" Clarkson said. ""We have to figure out how to play that way to start the game."" The struggling Lakers have lost five consecutive games and 21 of 26. They were still down by 11 with five minutes to play when the 3-pointer helped make for a nervous finish. Williams hit two 3s and Young one to pull the Lakers within two. Moments later, a Clarkson 3-pointer had them within one at 120-119 with 1:52 to play. But then Chandler scored five of his 14 points the rest of the way to help the Nuggets escape. They had beaten Orlando on Monday, making Tuesday's victory only their second in eight back-to-backs. ""Early in the season we probably lost this game, to be honest,"" Chandler said. ""But everybody held their composure, everybody made big plays."" After his starters struggled, Lakers coach Luke Walton went largely to his reserves, particularly in the fourth quarter. ""We found that competitive spirit again,"" Walton said. ""We found that passion where we want to play."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Jokic is on a roll. In his previous 19 games, he's had 12 double-doubles and averaged 18.1 points and 9.6 rebounds. ... Denver has outrebounded its opponent in 33 of its first 40 games, with two ties. Lakers: F Luol Deng missed the game with a sprained right wrist. ... Two of the team's top three scorers are reserves (Williams at 17.6 points per game and Clarkson at 13.9), which explains why the Lakers lead the NBA in bench scoring (49.4 ppg). ... Los Angeles has started 13 different players and no Laker is averaging 30 minutes per game. ZUBAC RESPONDS Lakers center Ivica Zubac, a 19-year-old rookie drafted in the second round, had the best game of his young career. Zubac has spent time in the Development League and had appeared in only 10 NBA games, but Tuesday he put together his first double-double, scoring 11 points and pulling down a team-high 13 rebounds. He also had three blocked shots. ""They were getting everything they wanted for most of the game, and then when he got in there he started changing shots,"" Walton said. ""I'm not going to say he turned a corner. I'm just saying he was really good tonight.""","400900047"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid cupped both ears, imploring fans to cheer even louder, and flashed a wide smile as he soaked in the ""MVP"" and ""Trust The Process"" chants. With Embiid leading the way, the Philadelphia 76ers are no longer the laughingstock of the NBA. Embiid scored 26 points, Ersan Ilyasova added 18 and the resurgent Sixers beat the Toronto Raptors 94-89 on Wednesday night for their seventh win in nine games. ""I'm trying to change the culture and I like to get the fans into it,"" Embiid said. ""I play better when the fans are chanting and cheering for us. That's what I love. The fans have been great."" Embiid, who was questionable because of the flu, surpassed 20 points in fewer than 30 minutes in his 10th straight game. The Sixers are only 14-26, but they have rejuvenated a city that has patiently waited for a winner through three miserable seasons. ""The fans are fantastic,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""We're all starving for success, some good feelings, some wins. And then to feel it, it's addictive. These fans deserve it. They're dying for us to get this right."" DeMar DeRozan scored 25 for the Atlantic Division-leading Raptors, and Kyle Lowry had 24 points. After DeRozan gave Toronto an 86-85 lead, Embiid made a tying free throw. Embiid then grabbed a rebound after DeRozan missed a jumper and T.J. McConnell's layup put Philadelphia ahead 88-86 with 1:09 left. Cory Joseph missed a 3-pointer on Toronto's ensuing possession and McConnell sank a pair of free throws. Embiid then blocked Lowry's shot and sent fans into a frenzy. Coming off a 36-point performance in a win at Brooklyn a night earlier, DeRozan missed his first six shots but finished strong with 14 points in the fourth quarter. ""We didn't play physical enough."" Lowry said. ""They played with passion and energy. That's one thing they got us on."" Embiid put all his skills on display on consecutive possessions early in the fourth quarter. He threw down a thunderous slam off a pass from Sergio Rodriguez and then nailed a 3-pointer from the top of the circle, earning a rousing ovation. Embiid opened his arms wide and raised them high in the air as fans went wild. Dario Saric got the crowd on its feet screaming minutes later with consecutive blocked shots and then nailed a 3-pointer, pumping his fist twice as he went back on defense. ""I like to bring energy,"" Saric said. SHADY'S BACK Former Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSean McCoy, the franchise's career leading rusher, sat courtside and received a standing ovation when he was shown on the video screen. McCoy was traded to Buffalo in March 2015. TIP-INS Raptors: F DeMarre Carroll left after injuring his neck midway through the third quarter. It wasn't clear whether Carroll collided with a teammate or a Sixers player, but he stayed down for a couple minutes and needed help walking off the court.  ...

"WASHINGTON --  Somehow, according to Tony Allen, the Memphis Grizzlies did not spend too much time discussing how to defend Washington Wizards forward Otto Porter Jr. heading into Wednesday night's game. Big mistake. Porter hit a career-high six 3-pointers, the better-known John Wall made two key late layups, and both players finished with 25 points, helping the Wizards edge the Grizzlies 104-101 for their 13th consecutive home win. ""I didn't even know he was on the scouting report today. I didn't hear two words about him until the end of shootaround. It was just about (Bradley) Beal and Wall,"" Allen said. ""We've got to pay better attention to our opponents and have a little better focus coming into games."" If Porter keeps this up, everyone will be paying more attention to him. At game's end, he ranked second in the NBA in 3-point shooting at 45 percent. ""A lot of people don't give Otto a lot of focus or credit in their game plan or scouting report. And every night he comes in, does everything he's supposed to do,"" said Wall, who had 13 assists and heard ""MVP!"" chants from the crowd. ""We believe in him."" Porter was 6 for 8 on 3s against Memphis, which opted to have defensive specialist Allen shut down Beal until fouling out with 6 1/2 minutes left. ""I try to just prepare myself to be able to knock down shots,"" Porter said, ""no matter who's guarding who."" He started 4 for 4 from beyond the arc in the opening 7 1/2 minutes, and then made another pair of 3s in the fourth quarter. The Wizards are 11-2 when he makes at least three 3s. ""The way he was shooting,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said, ""he should have shot 10 more."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Marc Gasol led Memphis with 28 points, and Mike Conley had 20. ... Went only 8 for 25 on 3s. Wizards: Just 4-13 on the road but 18-6 at home, where they've compiled their longest winning streak since a 15-game run in the 1988-89 season. ... Wall extended his steal streak to 29 consecutive games, the longest active run in the NBA. ... Wall picked up his ninth technical foul of the season. `BAD CALLS' Memphis got James Ennis III a wide-open look for a 3 that he missed at the buzzer after a jump ball was called -- despite attempts by Wall and Brooks to call a timeout when Beal got trapped by two defenders. ""There was no really, like, good flow to the game. The refs were blowing the whistle. It was bad calls at both ends of the floor,"" Beal said. ""Nobody was able to play today."" TURNAROUND The Wizards led 66-51 at halftime thanks to 53.3-percent shooting. After the break, Washington missed its first seven shots and Memphis made things competitive. Conley said that the players spoke to each other in the locker room at halftime, without any coaches: ""We just talked amongst our team, our players, and just, you know, (said), `What are we going to do to change it? What do we have to do?"" BAD ON BACK-TO-BACKS Washington plays again Thursday night at New York, and the Wizards have played poorly in the second game of back-to-backs, going 1-7. The good news for the Wizards? Their only victory in that situation came against the Knicks on Nov. 17. ""Sometimes we run out of gas. It happens,"" said Markieff Morris, who had 17 points and 12 rebounds.","400900049"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker is focused on Charlotte's record. He isn't very interested in the All-Star game right now. Walker scored 23 points, and the Hornets stopped a five-game slide with a 107-85 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. ""We haven't been doing a great job of winning consistently (so) the All-Star game is the last thing I'm going to think about right now,"" Walker said. While Walker is brushing off talk about next month's game in New Orleans, he is making a strong case for a spot on the Eastern Conference team. He is averaging 23 points and shooting 41.3 percent from 3-point range this season. Walker went 4 for 8 from behind the arc against Portland and 8 for 14 from the field overall. But he said he doesn't think he has done enough this year to make the All-Star game for the first time, citing the team's 21-21 record. ""Not really, if you ask me,"" Walker said. ""Especially because of where my team is. But like I said, I really don't care honestly."" Coach Steve Clifford said Walker is playing at an All-Star level, but doesn't know if he will be selected. ""It's not a question of whether or not he's playing like an All-Star -- he's an All-Star-caliber guard, no question about it,"" Clifford said. ""The factors will be looking at the other point guards in the East. The East is loaded. Point guard is the best position in our league right now and also, a lot of other guys are playing on teams with better records than ours.  It's about winning."" The Hornets snapped an eight-game streak of allowing at least 100 points. Charlotte led 79-72 after three quarters but blew the game open in the fourth behind eight quick points from Frank Kaminsky. The reserve had all 11 of his points in the final quarter, including three 3-pointers. Walker had a big first half, hitting 6 of 9 shots and three 3-pointers to help the Hornets build a 54-46 lead. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Made all 11 free throws, but shot 8 of 31 from beyond the 3-point arc. Hornets: Bench outscored Portland's reserves 44-22. HIBBERT'S BIG NIGHT Charlotte center Roy Hibbert played what Clifford called the best game of his season. The 7-foot-2 Hibbert, who came in averaging 5.2 points per game, had a season-high 16 points on 7-of-8 shooting and provided two of the game's biggest highlights. He brought the crowd to its feet on a drop-step drive through the lane and an unexpected one-handed dunk over Meyers Leonard. A few minutes later, Hibbert threw a backdoor alley-oop pass intended for Kaminsky that inadvertently went in. Hibbert didn't even crack a smile as he jogged back down court. ""That was a helluva pass, shot -- I don't know what it was,"" Walker said with a laugh. ""I'm just glad it went in."" Hibbert, who has battled through knee issues this season, said he wasn't trying to score, but glad it went in. ""That was a bad pass and a bad shot, that's all I can say,"" Hibbert said. LOSING WAYS Damian Lillard scored 21 points and C.J. McCollum had 18 for Portland, which has lost three straight and 16 of 22 since Dec. 5. ""As a group we have to let last year go,"" Portland center Mason Plumlee said. ""If it was the first 10 games of the season we could talk about building on last year. This is a new team, this is a new group and we aren't playing how we did last year so it's a new season, new challenges. We have to make the most of this group and this team, and the situation we are in."" TURNOVERS Charlotte turned 16 Portland turnovers into 21 points. ""We had some turnovers and they took advantage of every little thing,"" Lillard said. ""It seemed like they were getting what they wanted. They played a comfortable game and we didn't make them very uncomfortable.""","400900050"
"BOSTON --  New York's locker room door opened and music was blaring in the background. It's not a scene that's happened after too many Knicks' games lately. Derrick Rose matched his season high with 30 points, and the slumping Knicks beat the Boston Celtics 117-106 on Wednesday night. New York played without injured starters Kristaps Porzingis and Joakim Noah, but Mindaugas Kuzminskas and Willy Hernangomez each scored 17 points to help make up for their absence. ""It was a big win for us to come in here and kind of put everything to the side in spite of what's been surrounding the team, and really focus in on playing basketball and winning,"" said forward Carmelo Anthony, who reiterated his desire to stay in New York on Tuesday. It was just their third win in 14 games in a season that's been sliding away quickly since the calendar turned to 2017. ""These guys are a determined bunch,"" New York coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""They've had some bad breaks, we've had some bad games, but they stay in there together."" Isaiah Thomas led Boston with 39 points, his 13th time this season with 30 or more points. Jae Crowder added 21 for the Celtics, who lost for only the fourth time in 17 games. Al Horford, Boston's big free-agent acquisition during the summer, had five points on 2-of-14 shooting. He was 1 for 8 on 3-point attempts. ""That was definitely tough for me because they were good looks,"" he said. ""I even felt good on a few of them. They just didn't go in."" Boston closed to 97-96 on Jaylen Brown's two free throws with just under eight minutes to play, but Justin Holiday and Courtney Lee nailed 3-pointers 29 seconds apart, pushing New York's lead back to seven. Rose then capped an 8-0 spree by putting in his own miss after Thomas missed a jumper -- his seventh straight shot that was off. ""Just playing my game,"" said Rose, who was 13 for 24 from the floor. ""Just waiting for coach to call my number, just like tonight -- he called my number."" TIP-INS Knicks: Porzingis was out with a sore left Achilles and Noah was sidelined by a sore left ankle. Porzingis missed his fourth straight game, but did shoot before the game. Noah played in their last game. Both big men are expected to undergo MRIs on Thursday. ... F Lance Thomas was also out (fractured left orbital bone). Celtics: G Avery Bradley was a late scratch with a sore right Achilles after warming up. He played in Monday's win, but had missed the previous four games after straining the same Achilles. THAT SAYS IT ALL ""We didn't have a look most of the night that you felt good about,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. HE WANTS TO BE AN ALL-STAR When the All-Star starters are announced Thursday night, Thomas said he'll be watching the nationally televised NBA game. As far as being one: ""I should be,"" he said. BOARD DAMAGE The Knicks owned a 57-33 rebounding edge, doubling up Boston 18-9 on the offensive glass. ""The more desperate team, the better team tonight, the more aggressive team -- they won,"" Stevens said. SPECIAL MOMENT The fans gave a loud ovation to 11-year-old Stephen Register of Needham, Massachusetts, late in the opening quarter when he was shown on the Jumbotron. On Tuesday, as part of a Make-A-Wish memory, the team signed him to an honorary one-day contract and he practiced with Celtics players Amir Johnson and Kelly Olynyk, received a personalized team jersey, and participated in a press conference with players asking him questions. He was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy.","400900051"
"New Orleans --  Given a huge assist by the NBA schedule-makers, the New Orleans Pelicans took full advantage. Anthony Davis had 21 points and 15 rebounds and the Pelicans cruised past the road-weary, short-handed Orlando Magic 118-98 on Wednesday night. Tyreke Evans and Langston Galloway added 18 points each for the Pelicans, who never trailed after the first quarter and extended their lead to as many as 28 points. Aaron Gordon and Elfrid Payton had 14 points each to lead Orlando, which finished 1-5 on a season-long six-game trip that featured five games in the last eight days. The Magic played their third straight game without leading scorer Evan Fournier, who is out with a bruised right heel. ""They were in a tough situation,"" said Pelicans point guard Jrue Holiday, who had a season-high five steals along with 14 points and five assists. ""We were going at them from the start, punching them in the mouth."" The Pelicans, back from their own season-long five-game trip, beat the Magic down the court all night to start a season-long six-game home stretch. New Orleans had 29 fast break points in the first half, passed its season-high of 30 midway through the third quarter and finished with 38. ""Our pace was very good,"" Davis said. ""Whether they scored or missed, we tried to get it out real fast."" Trailing 25-20 the Pelicans took the lead for good by outscoring the Magic 12-4 to end the first quarter. New Orleans led 65-52 at halftime, 92-73 at the end of the third quarter and was ahead by as many as 28 points in the fourth even though Davis and Holiday sat out the entire period. The Pelicans fell just short of their season-high of 121 points. Their 15 3-pointers were one shy of their previous best, with Evans and Galloway each hitting four. Orlando hung with New Orleans early but ran out of gas quickly. After making 12 of 21 shots in the first quarter, the Magic went 27 of 67 the rest of the way. ""We have to figure it out,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""We have to stay together, we have to keep our heads up and keep believing in what we are and can be. We just aren't happy about how we played tonight."" TIP-INS Magic: Orlando is 3-4 in games Fournier has missed, losing four of the last five. . The Magic fell 4 1/2 games behind Chicago for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Pelicans: New Orleans ended a four-game losing streak to Orlando that dated to a season-opening victory in 2014-15. . When the teams met in November, the Pelicans were without Davis and Holiday and lost 89-82. ANOTHER INJURY After playing the entire first quarter, Davis went to the locker room for X-rays on his left hand, leaving with an injury for the third time in the last five games. The X-rays were negative, and he re-entered the game with 4:54 left with tape on two fingers. In his absence, the Pelicans extended their lead from 32-29 to 54-42. MEEKS OUT Jodie Meeks, who started in place of Fournier, left with a dislocated right thumb in the second half after hitting it on Davis' knee, further depleting the Magic. ""I have no idea,"" Meeks said when asked how long he would be out. ""This is the first time it's happened to me. Unfortunately it's on my thumb, and you do everything with your thumb, so we'll see after the MRI. The X-rays look pretty good so we'll see what happens.""","400900052"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden and the Houston Rockets used their defense to get back on track. Harden had 38 points, eight assists and six rebounds, helping the Rockets beat the Milwaukee Bucks 111-92 on Wednesday night. Houston had dropped three for four, but it recorded a season-high 12 blocked shots and held Milwaukee to 39.8 percent shooting. ""That was the key to the game,"" Harden said. ""I think we're realizing that in order for us to get to where we want to go, we have to get stops. When we get stops, we are 10 times better."" Harden drilled a straightaway 3-pointer with six minutes left to give Houston a 13-point lead and shimmied his shoulders down the court in a celebratory dance as the Bucks called timeout. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 32 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and three blocks for Milwaukee, which struggled to score in the first half. Jabari Parker scored 15 points on 5-for-15 shooting, and reserve Michael Beasley had 14 points and eight boards. Antetokounmpo was visibly frustrated after he was called for goaltending on a chase-down block of Harden as the game slipped away late in the fourth quarter. ""I've got to do a better job of playing harder, especially in the fourth quarter,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We could have had that game today, but we gave it away."" Houston shooting guard Eric Gordon recaptured his touch after struggling from the field while playing on a tweaked ankle in the Rockets' 109-103 loss in Miami on Tuesday night. Gordon went 7 for 17 from the 3-point range and finished with 25 points. The Rockets played without sharp-shooting power forward Ryan Anderson, who was sidelined by the flu for the second straight game. They missed his long-range presence, going 4 for 20 from beyond the arc in the first half before finishing 14 for 44. Bucks coach Jason Kidd said Houston's late success behind the 3-point line helped the Rockets pull away. ""At the beginning of the game, we made a conscious effort and did a really good job,"" Kidd said. ""But you have to have some pride and it has to be a team effort. Tonight, we just didn't give it."" Milwaukee had a five-point lead at the end of the first quarter, but was outscored 30-12 in the second. The Rockets allowed a season-low 39 first-half points and led by 13 at the break. Montrezl Harrell had 12 points, eight rebounds and five blocks for the Rockets, who host NBA-leading Golden State on Friday night. Harden, Patrick Beverley and Clint Capela each added two blocks. In their only previous matchup this season, the Rockets defeated the Warriors 132-127 in a double-overtime thriller in Oakland on Dec. 1. ""Obviously, we get a big test on Friday,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""But we're ready to see how good we really are."" HIGH PRAISE After their scoring duel, Antetokounmpo called Harden the best player in the league. ""He's tough to guard, and the guys around him makes him even tougher to guard,"" he said. ""He's doing a great job of find his teammates and being unselfish."" ONE HALF OF THE TWIN TOWERS Rockets Hall of Fame center Ralph Sampson -- one half of the franchise's Twin Towers along with Hakeem Olajuwon in the 1980s -- was honored with a video montage as part of the team's ongoing celebration of its 50th season. The 7-foot-4 big man sat courtside and received a standing ovation when introduced to the Toyota Center crowd. The Rockets also handed out Ralph Sampson figurines as a promotional giveaway. TIP-INS Bucks: Greg Monroe and Rockets C Nene each received a technical after they tangled on a rebound late in the third quarter. Monroe never re-entered the game. ... Parker also had seven rebounds. Rockets: In Anderson's absence, Trevor Ariza moved from small forward to power forward, and Corey Brewer started in his place. Ariza and Brewer combined for just seven points but played critical roles on the defensive end.","400900053"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  The Detroit Pistons were happy to be home after a five-game West Coast trip. They played like it, too. Reggie Jackson scored 26 points to lead the balanced Pistons to a 118-95 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night. It was Detroit's first game at the Palace since beating Charlotte on Jan. 5. ""Man, I felt like we haven't been here in a while,"" said Marcus Morris, who finished with 14 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. ""My time is a little off because we've been over there for so long. It feels great to be back home."" Each of Detroit's starters scored in double figures, and the Pistons shot 49.5 percent from the field. Tobias Harris had 19 points, Reggie Bullock finished with 15 and Andre Drummond added 13 points and 17 rebounds. Detroit raced out to a 42-18 first-quarter lead and never trailed. ""We played well, we made shots,"" Morris said. ""Tobias got off to a great start and we just continued to go, continued to move the ball. It was one of our better quarters of the season."" Paul Millsap had 21 points and eight rebounds for the Hawks, who had won nine of 10. Dennis Schroder added 13 points and six assists. Atlanta shot 38.5 percent from the field, including a 6-for-25 performance from 3-point range. ""Games like that happen,"" Millsap said. ""They came out and punched us, punched us hard. We weren't able to come back from that."" The Pistons scored the first seven points of the game on the way to their big first quarter. Detroit went 16 for 26 from the field, including a 6-for-7 start from 3-point range, in the opening period. Detroit continued to dominate in the second quarter, building a 54-24 advantage on Morris' free throw with 7:35 left. Atlanta cut the deficit to 20 later in the period, but trailed 69-45 at halftime. ""Credit to Detroit,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""They were better than us in every phase of the game. They were well prepared."" Detroit, which 2/3 on its West Coast trip, outrebounded Atlanta 60-32, and went 10 for 25 from beyond the arc. ""We played with confidence and a lot of effort,"" Jackson said. ""From start to finish, we played really well."" WORTH NOTING The Hawks traded guard Mo Williams to Denver and signed guard Gary Neal to a 10-day contract. Neal scored four points in the loss. In exchange for Williams, the Hawks reacquired the rights to Cenk Akyol and a $2.2 million traded player exception, which they must use within the next year. Williams, who has not played all season, was acquired by the Hawks along with Mike Dunleavy in a trade that sent Kyle Korver to Cleveland. TIP-INS Hawks: F/C Tiago Splitter (right calf strain) and F/C Mike Muscala (left ankle sprain) did not play. ... Wednesday's margin of defeat was the Hawks' largest since a 128-84 loss at Toronto on Dec. 3. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. played college basketball at Michigan and his dad, Tim Hardaway, is a Pistons assistant. Hardaway Jr. finished with 10 points. Pistons: F Jon Leuer (right knee) and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (left rotator cuff strain) did not play. ... Detroit's 42 points in the first quarter was its highest total for any quarter this season. ""I thought that was our best quarter of the year, in terms of both offense and defense combined,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. BROTHERLY LOVE The Pistons host Washington on Saturday night, giving Morris a chance to play against his brother, Markieff Morris. ""They've been playing really well, so I know they're coming in with a lot of confidence,"" Marcus Morris said. ""Coming off our two wins, we have a lot of confidence, too, so I think it's going to be a great game.""","400900054"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Russell Westbrook promised to pay back Zaza Pachulia for a hard foul. Kevin Durant had the last word against his old team -- again. Durant dazzled with a season-best 40 points, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-100 on Wednesday night despite Westbrook's 21st triple-double. Westbrook had 27 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists in an improved showing from his 20-point outing on 4-for-15 shooting when OKC first faced Durant here 2 1/2 months ago and watched him dismantle the Thunder from every which way. ""You can't deny the history obviously with him with OKC,"" Stephen Curry said. ""It's one of those games the intensity is high and at all costs you want to get the win."" In his two games against the Thunder, Durant has scored 79 points on 28-for-40 shooting. He hit seven 3-pointers in the first meeting, a 122-96 Warriors rout Nov. 3 at Oracle Arena. Durant also had 12 rebounds Wednesday. ""The efficiency of this guy is just amazing. He's not going to win the MVP because there are a lot of people out there who are playing extremely well,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""But I don't think anybody's more efficient. He doesn't need the ball and he still scores big numbers."" Curry added 24 points and eight assists, and Klay Thompson had 14 points after he arrived back in the Bay Area just in time to play after a short absence dealing with a personal family matter. This one had tension, which just might be the norm from here on out whenever Durant faces the Thunder. There were words exchanged and stare downs, and of course a few hard fouls -- then an occasional smile to balance things out, like when Durant missed on a driving tomahawk jam and the ball shot back to midcourt. This atmosphere wasn't that much different from two days earlier when the champion Cavaliers visited Golden State's home floor and left with an embarrassing 126-91 defeat. Enes Kanter added 22 points and nine rebounds off the bench for the Thunder, who missed center Steven Adams for a second straight game with a concussion. Westbrook shot just 8 for 23 this time and missed all but one of his six 3-point tries, but made 10 of 11 free throws. He also had 10 turnovers, including a travel on which he took five steps before beginning to put the ball to the floor -- ""He forgot to dribble. ... I guess the limit is six steps,"" Curry said. With 4.4 seconds left in the first half, Pachulia collided with Westbrook and clobbered the OKC star in the face as the Warriors center went with his man as Kanter set a screen on Andre Iguodala. Westbrook went down and grabbed his face in obvious pain and Pachulia glared at Westbrook as he stood over him. The play went to official review before Pachulia received a flagrant 1 foul, drawing boos from the sellout crowd. ""I'm going to get his ass back. Straight up,"" Westbrook said. Golden State outscored Oklahoma City 37-22 in the third to turn the game into another blowout on the way to wrapping up 9-1 stay in Northern California over the past 3 1/2 weeks. Durant posted his 11th game with 30 or more points and fifth with at least 30 points and 10 boards. As dominant as KD has been against the Thunder, the Warriors still must go to Oklahoma City on Feb. 11 and March 20. WEST INJURED Golden State backup power forward David West sustained a non-displaced fracture of his left thumb and will be re-evaluated in two weeks. He has brought key energy and a steadying force with the second unit. ""It's a big loss,"" Kerr said. ""David has been fantastic."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City is 5-11 on the road against Golden State and hasn't won on the Warriors' home floor since Dec. 18, 2014. ... Adams wasn't with the team. Warriors: Golden State was tied at halftime for the first time all season. ... After outrebounding the Cavs 58-35, the Warriors led the category 46-36. ... Golden State committed 13 first-half turnovers and 18 total, taking better care of the ball after the break.","400900055"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Tightly clutching the game ball in the locker room, Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan was all smiles for a variety of reasons. Paul George scored 24 points, Jeff Teague had 22 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds, and the Pacers used a big second half to beat the Sacramento Kings 106-100 on Wednesday for McMillan's 500th career victory. The veteran coach is 29th on the wins list for NBA coaches. Only three other active coaches -- Gregg Popovich, Doc Rivers and Rick Carlisle -- have 500 or more victories. Indiana's impressive rally on the road made it one sweet night for the 52-year-old McMillan, who is in his first season with the Pacers. McMillan's team trailed by as many as 22 points in the first half, and then outscored Sacramento 65-40 in the final two quarters to win for the seventh time in eight games. ""When I started coaching, I started as an assistant coach, I never really thought about being a head coach,"" McMillan said. ""To be a part of this league this long and to win 500 games I the NBA is a blessing."" George presented McMillan with the game ball in the locker room after helping the Pacers outscore the Kings 35-21 in the fourth. ""We came out flat again on the road, we had a bad approach in the first half,"" George said. ""But we hung in there and played as a group after that and kept chipping away at the lead. We don't like being in that position. We need to start games on the road with more focus."" DeMarcus Cousins had 25 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for Sacramento, which lost Rudy Gay to a suspected torn left Achilles tendon in the third quarter. It was Cousins' fifth career triple-double. The Kings closed out a 1-6 homestand and have dropped eight of 10 overall. Gay, Sacramento's second-leading scorer, fell to the floor while driving to the basket and was carried off the court. Gay, who had 21 points, will be evaluated Thursday. ""That's a tough thing to watch, man. ... I hate it for him. I spoke to him and told him I'll keep you in my prayers,"" Cousins said. Reserve Al Jefferson had 20 points in 17 minutes for the Pacers, and Myles Turner had 16 points. George made a jumper and Teague connected on two foul shots to give Indiana a 99-98 lead with 1:56 left. George then hit another jumper and Thaddeus Young's block on Cousins set up a key dunk by Turner in the final seconds. Darren Collison, Arron Afflalo and Kosta Koufos each had 11 points for the Kings. Collison also had nine assists and four steals. NOTING TEAGUE Teague rebounded from a poor first half and flirted with his first career triple-double for third time in five games. He had 16 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds Monday in a win over New Orleans. Against the Kings, the veteran point guard picked up two early fouls, went scoreless in the opening quarter and had four points in the first half. ""Jeff got in foul trouble early, but he came out in the second half attacking and finding his teammates,"" McMillan said. ""He really showed some fight in the second half."" TIP-INS Pacers: Shot 41 percent from the field in the first half and were outrebounded 24-11. Kings: Finished the homestand with a 1-6 record. . Reserves Omri Casspi (strained tendon) and Ty Lawson (ankle sprain) were unavailable.","400900056"
"CLEVELAND -- Before their first home game following a long trip that ended with a miserable thud at Golden State, Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue showed his team video clips to remind them who they are. The message? ""Do that,"" LeBron James said. Kyrie Irving scored 26 points, James, his All-Star teammate, had 21 points and 15 assists, and Cleveland looked more like an NBA champion in a 118-103 win over the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night. The Cavs were back in Quicken Loans Arena following a six-game road swing (their longest of the season) that concluded with an embarrassing 35-point loss to the Warriors. But on their home floor, they had better offensive balance, ball movement and defense while improving to 30-11 -- the same record Cleveland had at the halfway point of its 2016 NBA title season. Channing Frye scored 18, Iman Shumpert 17 and James Jones 14 while filling in for star forward Kevin Love, still bothered by back spasms. ""Coming off our road trip we just weren't playing Cavalier basketball,"" said James, ""and getting the ball popping from one side to the other. It was good to get back to the way we've been playing for most of the season."" Tyson Chandler had 22 points and 16 rebounds, but the Suns lost for the fourth time in five games. Phoenix closed within 12 in the fourth, but was unable to get any closer. ""They always make the right play offensively and defensively,"" said Suns guard Devin Booker, who finished with 21 points on 4-of-12 shooting. ""They're always on a string together on both ends of the floor. You can hear them talking out there. You can hear them communicating. I guess that's one thing you can learn from them, how comfortable they are with themselves and the way they talk to each other."" Already thin on their front line with Love out, the Cavs lost forward Tristan Thompson in the second quarter with a dislocated left index finger. However, Thompson returned after halftime. And Cleveland's offense was in a much better rhythm from the start after a trip that wasn't always pleasing to the eye. Irving and James shined as always, but it was the contributions of Cleveland's supporting cast that made the difference. ""We definitely needed it,"" James said. ""We needed guys to step up and you know, we had that tonight out of everybody, especially Channing."" While trying to integrate newly acquired Kyle Korver into their rotation on the road, the Cavs got into some bad habits as they forced passes to one of the league's best shooters. A couple of practices seem to have helped as Korver made a pair of 3-pointers in the second quarter of his home debut to help Cleveland open a 21-point lead. The Suns made a brief run in the third and got within 12 before Shumpert hit a pair of 3s and Jones hit one from long range. IRON MAN Thompson injured his finger when he got it caught on Chandler's jersey. For a moment, he was worried it might affect his consecutive games streak that now stands at 411 -- the longest current run in the league. ""Once they told me it was only dislocated, I knew the streak was still alive,"" he said. TIP-INS Suns: G Brandon Knight returned after missing two games with a sprained right wrist, but had a short night after committing four fouls in four minutes in the first half. ... Chandler has at least 15 rebounds in six straight games, matching the club record set by Jim Fox in 1969. ... Booker had averaged 30 points in his past six games. Cavaliers: Korver finished with nine points. ... James, who missed his 46th career triple-double by one rebound, will be making his 13th consecutive All-Star Game appearance next month. He said the honor never gets old. ""Just means I've been doing something right in this league,"" he said. ""Means I'm consistent and taking pride in my individual ability to go out and produce for the team every night, and whatever team I've been on in my career. It's always great to see my name up there with the best guys in the league, so it's a pretty cool thing."" ... G J.R. Smith has had the hard cast removed from his surgically repaired thumb.

"MIAMI --  Just like in 2006 and 2011, the Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks are essentially in the same place. Different spot in the standings, though. Goran Dragic had 32 points, Tyler Johnson scored 10 of his 23 in the fourth quarter and the Heat beat the Mavericks 99-95 on Thursday night, snapping Dallas' season-high three-game winning streak. ""Like an old-school Miami-Dallas game,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. He said it with a smile, not entirely serious, of course. The stakes in Heat-Mavs games are far different now, with both teams languishing in the bottom half of their respective conferences and not going back and forth in the NBA Finals. But both franchises have been a bit better of late, providing hope for the second half. ""We worked hard for this, the whole team,"" Dragic said. ""We lost a lot of close games, but we're getting better in those close games and we feel like tonight we defended well, the ball was moving and we made the right plays."" Hassan Whiteside scored 13 and Dion Waiters added 12 for the Heat. Dirk Nowitzki had 19 points for Dallas, which went 1 for 8 from the field during a late stretch of the fourth quarter and never got the lead again. ""It was a really tough stretch for us,"" Nowitzki said. ""We went from being up a couple to down seven or eight and then we put the starters back in or the other unit, so that was a bad stretch ... and after that we had to play catch-up."" Wesley Matthews scored 18 for the Mavericks, who got 15 apiece from Harrison Barnes and Seth Curry. ""It's not exactly 2011,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""It's two franchises that are competitive, and that are playing a little better in recent games. It's a competitive game. We've had health issues. They've obviously had health issues."" Nowitzki made two of three free throws with 18.5 seconds left to get the Mavs within 95-92. The Heat needed to burn two timeouts before even getting the ball inbounded on the ensuing possession, and Johnson hit two from the line five seconds later to help seal the win. TIP-INS Mavericks: J.J. Barea scored 13 points and has reached double figures in 11 of his 17 games this season. At 32, he's on pace to average more than 12 points a game for the first time. ... Dallas took only 11 free throws to Miami's 29. Heat: Miami improved to 3-21 when trailing at halftime. Dallas led 53-44 at the break. ... Okaro White made his NBA debut. He was signed to a 10-day deal earlier this week. ... Wayne Ellington got his 1,000th career rebound and is one 3-pointer shy of 500. PROMOTION ISSUE A fan avoided injury when a door -- depicting a hotel room door -- on a wheeled frame fell over during a promotion after the first quarter. The promotion had several fans slide hotel ""keys"" into the door, and the one that worked won a hotel stay. The floor was slightly damaged near midcourt. BOGUT CLOSER Dallas center Andrew Bogut missed his fourth straight game with a right hamstring strain. He worked out on the court before the game and is improving, though he isn't expected to play Friday against Utah.","400900058"
"NEW YORK --  John Wall scored the pivotal points and made the saving steal, though the Knicks thought the Wizards had another defender who impacted their final possession even before Wall ended it. Carmelo Anthony and Courtney Lee said a Washington assistant coach standing on the court too close to Lee kept him from taking a tying 3-point attempt. He instead passed to Brandon Jennings, who had the ball stolen by Wall. ""He was on the court,"" Anthony said. ""They had six players on the court."" Wall didn't need extra help. He had 29 points and 13 assists and scored the surging Wizards' final four points in the last 32 seconds of their 113-110 victory Thursday night. Otto Porter Jr. made six 3-pointers for the second straight night and added 23 points, but the Wizards needed big plays from Wall to win their fourth in a row. He made two free throws to put Washington back on top after New York had rallied to take a 110-109 lead, then rebounded Anthony's miss and left all the Knicks in his dust as he raced down the floor for a dunk with 13.7 seconds to play. ""Just trying to make the big-time plays,"" Wall said. ""But, if it's me scoring or me passing, I'm going to live with the results if it's the right read and the right play, and tonight I came up with some big shots and we won."" Anthony finished with 34 points but threw the ball to Lee near the Wizards' bench on the last possession. Lee said he heard someone standing close to him and yelling as if he was a nearby defender, confusing him enough into thinking that if he took the shot, it could be blocked. Replays showed Wizards assistant Sidney Lowe standing on the court near Lee, who dribbled left and passed the ball hurriedly to Jennings, who had it knocked away by Wall. ""I'm not sure if he had his hands up or not, but I mean, he fooled me,"" Lee said, adding he thought the NBA should look into the play. ""I still should've took the shot, I mean it's at the end of the game, but I drove and tried to make a play. I seen Brandon standing there but it didn't work out."" Derrick Rose added 20 points and Kristaps Porzingis came off the bench for 15 in his return from a sore left Achilles tendon. The Wizards trailed 67-66 at halftime after Anthony scored a Knicks-record 25 points in the second quarter, then outscored New York 34-19 to take a 100-86 lead into the fourth. The Knicks came all the way back to take a 110-109 lead when Rose put back his own miss with 48 seconds to play. Wall handled things from there as the Wizards won for the seventh time in eight games. They are 20-10 following a 3-9 start. ""It's good to get a road win. We've had so many last-second shots on the road that didn't go our way,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""It's nice to get a close-out tonight."" Porter, who matched the career high for 3-pointers he set Wednesday against Memphis, had 15 points in the third quarter. The Wizards are 12-2 when he makes three or more 3s. TIP-INS Wizards: Wall, the NBA leader in total steals, has one in a career-best 30 straight games. ... The Wizards have won six straight at Madison Square Garden. Knicks: Joakim Noah missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle.

"SAN ANTONIO -- The San Antonio Spurs got a glimpse of their future and it was both encouraging and daunting. Kawhi Leonard scored 34 points, rookie Dejounte Murray added a season-high 24 and the short-handed Spurs overcame a pregame injury to Pau Gasol in beating the Denver Nuggets 118-104 on Thursday night. Denver's three-game winning streak was snapped despite a career-high 35 points from Nikola Jokic. Leonard had his fifth straight 30-point performance, right after learning he was elected to start for the Western Conference in the All-Star Game for the second consecutive season. ""I'm just happy that my hard work is paying off,"" Leonard said. ""It's just another stepping point to my career and hopefully I can keep going from there."" Murray demonstrated his potential, playing a career-high 34 minutes in place of ailing point guard Tony Parker. But the Spurs' immediate future is uncertain without Gasol, their starting center. ""We're going to have it looked at tomorrow, but he's going to be out for a while,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. Gasol broke the ring finger on his left (non-shooting) hand when he jammed it against Kyle Anderson's shoulder while attempting a running hook during pregame warmups. The 16-year NBA veteran immediately clutched his hand and left the court. X-rays revealed the break, and the Spurs said they should have a better idea how long Gasol will be out following additional tests Friday. The Spurs were also unexpectedly without Parker and then Popovich. Gasol and Parker were both late scratches due to injury, and Popovich was ejected for the first time this season. ""I thought the biggest thing was find a way to get a win without Tony and Pau,"" forward David Lee said. ""Just sticking to the game plan. One of the strengths of this team is depth, so we just tried to step up and play the same way."" Lee had 10 points and 16 rebounds while starting in place of Gasol. Murray attempted to take one of Lee's rebounds away, but the veteran glared at the rookie from Washington. ""The guy gets every shot and then he's trying to take all the rebounds, too,"" Lee said, smiling. ""I was like, `Come on, rook, know your place.' He played an unbelievable game tonight."" Parker sat out with a sprained left foot. The 6-foot-5 Murray responded by shooting 7 for 11, including 3 of 5 on 3-pointers. ""I felt like I had a rhythm the whole game,"" he said. ""I was confident even before he told me I was going to start."" Popovich did not get to see the Spurs improve to 15-2 at home since Nov. 11 after picking up his fifth and sixth technical fouls. Zach Zarba ejected Popovich with 1:36 remaining in the first half after he became incensed over a foul called on Davis Bertans against Jokic. Minutes earlier, Popovich was upset over a non-call for Bertans. TIP-INS Nuggets: Jokic has led the team in scoring or shared the high mark in 10 of Denver's past 18 games after doing so just once in the previous 22 games. ... C Jusuf Nurkic had five points, leaving him one shy of 1,000 for his career. ... F Juancho Hernangomez made his second career start. Spurs: Gasol missed his first game due to injury this season. He sat out two games for rest. He is averaging 11.7 points and 7.9 rebounds in 39 games. ... Parker has missed eight games this season, including two for rest. He missed three games with a sore right knee, one due to a bruised left quadriceps and another because of a bruised left knee. ... At least one Spurs player has appeared in the All-Star Game in all but two of the franchise's 40 years in the NBA (1989 and 1997). ... Leonard has scored in double figures in 74 straight games, the longest streak by a Spurs player since Tim Duncan had 75 in 2004-05. BLOWING THE WHISTLE Nuggets guard Emmanuel Mudiay had some fun when Popovich got ejected, shadowing Zarba and mimicking the official calling a technical foul and ejecting the Spurs' coach. ""It was funny,"" Mudiay said, unable to stifle his laughter. ""I don't think he wanted to coach today, that's what it was."" Popovich continued walking onto the court and screaming at the officials despite attempts by San Antonio assistant Ettore Messina to hold him back. Mudiay said he was having fun and meant zero disrespect to ""one of the best coaches in the world."" ""I love that dude, man,"" Mudiay said. ""(Former Spurs coach) Larry Brown is somebody that I talk to a lot and that's one of his best friends, so I know Coach Pop just a little bit. He's a great guy.""","400900060"
"LOS ANGELES --  Karl-Anthony Towns knows he needs to have more nights like this one if he's going to reach his goal of greatness. Towns scored 37 points, including the go-ahead jumper with 45 seconds left, and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the injury-depleted Clippers 104-101 on Thursday night to stop Los Angeles' seven-game winning streak. ""I just took what the defense gave me,"" Towns said. ""I just tried to make shots, even if they were hard. I put all my will, my passion, my determination at the end of the game and put it on the line. If you want to be great in this game you've got to be willing to take those kinds of shots."" Towns, who scored 27 in the second half and 15 in the final quarter, benefited from the Clippers playing a smaller lineup, mainly because the Timberwolves countered with a lineup that included guards Kris Dunn, Tyus Jones and Zach LaVine. ""He got better spacing in the second half,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeaux said of Towns. ""Part of that was playing smaller, with more shooting. It opened things up for him. ""The depth where he was catching the ball was a big plus. Then he got into a rhythm, and hit the 3, and mixed his game up pretty well."" Andrew Wiggins added 27 points, including two free throws with five seconds left that helped Minnesota snap its six-game road losing streak. DeAndre Jordan had a career-high 29 points and 16 rebounds to lead the Clippers, but was unable to make enough free throws down the stretch to keep his team in front. ""Karl Towns played so well it overshadows what DJ did,"" said Austin Rivers, who scored 20 points for Los Angeles. ""But DJ had a heck of a night. Sixteen rebounds and 29 points. You can't ask him to do any more. DJ did his part."" The Clippers, now 7-1 in 2017, played without star point guard Chris Paul, who tore a ligament in his left thumb Monday during a 120-98 victory over Oklahoma City. Paul underwent surgery Wednesday and is expected to be out six to eight weeks. ""There are a lot of things CP can do that Ray and I just can't do,"" Rivers said. ""We just have to be ourselves and play hard. I think our effort can outweigh things. We're undermanned. We've got to play harder than everybody else."" Los Angeles is still missing star forward Blake Griffin due to injury as well. He is expected back in a week or two. ""I thought we stopped playing downhill in the fourth quarter,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""There might have been a little fatigue there in the fourth."" Minnesota pulled to 97-96 when Towns sank a 3-pointer with 2:48 to play. At the other end, the Timberwolves hacked Jordan repeatedly, looking to take advantage of his poor foul shooting. The big man went 4 of 8 from the line over five possessions, setting the stage for Towns to drain a jumper from the left elbow that tied it at 98 with 2:28 to go. After Jordan made one of two again, Wiggins missed from the outside and Jamal Crawford hit a 14-footer with 1:28 left for a 101-98 Los Angeles lead. Towns answered with a short jumper to pull Minnesota to 101-100 with 1:12 remaining. Crawford missed a short jumper before Towns hit an 18-footer with 45 seconds left to put the Timberwolves up 102-101. After J.J. Redick missed a 3-pointer from the right side, Wiggins grabbed an offensive rebound at the other end and made two free throws to put Minnesota up by three. Redick and Crawford missed long 3-point attempts in the final four seconds. TIP-INS Timberwolves: At one point in the fourth quarter, the T-Wolves fielded a lineup of LaVine, Wiggins, Towns, Jones and Dunn, in which the 21-year-old rookie Dunn was the oldest player on the floor. ... This was the first road victory for the Timberwolves since they beat Atlanta on Dec. 21. They won despite allowing the Clippers 60 points in the paint. Clippers: Los Angeles shot 48 percent from the field but went 4 of 22 on 3-pointers. ... The 7-0 mark tied the franchise record to start a calendar year. The team was also 7-0 to begin 1974 when the franchise was located in Buffalo. ... The Clippers play 10 of their next 11 on the road. They open a five-game trip in Denver on Friday night, return home to play Golden State on Feb. 2 and then set out on another five-game swing.","400900061"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Booed relentlessly just a few weeks ago, Robert Covington is quickly becoming one of the most popular athletes in Philadelphia. Covington scored 22 points and made two 3-pointers in the final 40 seconds to lead the streaking 76ers to a come-from-behind 93-92 win over the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night. It was Covington's second game-winning basket this month after his buzzer-beater stunned Minnesota on Jan. 3. ""I'm a fighter,"" said Covington, a sharpshooter who endured some struggles earlier this season. ""That's what I've been my whole life. Fans were booing me at one point. I just kept working, that's the main thing. I'm not going to let that deteriorate my game."" Ersan Ilyasova scored 24 points and Joel Embiid had 18 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and four blocks before leaving the game with a minor injury for the Sixers, who have won three straight and eight of their last 10. Embiid, who sparked the recent surge, bruised his left knee in the second half and didn't play the final 8:50 of the game. But the Sixers rallied for the victory without their prized center as Covington drilled the winner with 4.5 seconds left before Mason Plumlee missed a shot at the buzzer on the other end. ""These guys are fun,"" said Embiid, who was the first person off the bench to celebrate with Covington. ""When the game is close like that and you're able to pull it out, it's fun. The crowd is into it. Cov made a big shot once again, and we got a win."" Damian Lillard scored 30 points to lead the Blazers, who have lost four straight. C.J. McCollum had 16 points and Plumlee finished with 14. ""I thought we played hard,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""And I thought we deserved to win the game."" Trailing by 13 at the half, the Sixers charged back to take their first lead at 66-65 with 3:23 left in the third quarter on Covington's three-point play. Covington later hit a 3-pointer to pull Philly within one at 91-90 with 38.2 seconds remaining in the game after the Blazers led for almost all of the fourth quarter while Embiid sat on the bench. Embiid's injury occurred midway through the third quarter when he came down awkwardly after a thunderous dunk, bringing a hush to the nervous crowd. The star center, who missed his first two NBA seasons because of injuries, came back in to start the fourth quarter to massive cheers and ""Trust the Process"" chants from a near-sellout crowd at the Wells Fargo Center. But Embiid only played a few more minutes before the Sixers decided to sit him for the remainder of the game for precautionary reasons. His streak of 10 straight games with 20 points or more was snapped. ""You're concerned,"" Brown acknowledged. ""He plays with such reckless abandon, I think we're going to be feeling this regularly. That's just who he is. As he plays more basketball and continues to grow, he will not avoid those situations but manage them a little more."" TIP-INS Blazers: Portland dropped to 7-18 on the road this season, which includes a 5-11 mark vs. the Eastern Conference. ... Former Sixer Evan Turner, who played in Philly from 2010-14, scored four points on 2-for-10 shooting and was booed every time he touched the ball. 76ers: The Sixers signed Chasson Randle to a second 10-day contract before the game. Since initially being signed on Jan. 9, Randle has appeared in two games for Philly and had 10 points in 16 minutes in Monday's win over Milwaukee. . After learning Embiid wasn't named an Eastern Conference starter in the All-Star Game, Brown said he'll get to work trying to help convince fellow coaches to name him a reserve. ""I think Joel is gonna slide in there,"" the Sixers coach said. ""I think the people that are now going to close the deal understand how unique and special he is."" THE SHOT THEY WANTED Plumlee had no regrets about taking the final shot of the game, feeling like he got a ""good look"" at the basket. ""I make it, we win; I miss it, we lose,"" he said. ""So I'm OK with it. But it was a good play."" Lillard was equally frustrated that he missed a free throw right before Covington's winning 3. ""That's the one that's going to keep me up at night,"" he said. ""This one's on me."" IT'S NOT HOW YOU START ... Lillard was hot early for Portland, scoring nine points in the first 4  1/2 minutes and finishing with 16 points in the first quarter to help Portland take a 33-22 lead after one. The Blazers, who went with a different starting lineup that featured Turner and Noah Vonleh in place of Al-Farouq Aminu and Maurice Harkless, maintained a double-digit lead for most of the second quarter before taking a 56-43 lead into halftime. ""We just didn't finish,"" Plumlee said. ""We played better throughout the game than we have in the past three or four, but you've got to finish it to get a win.""","400900062"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker and his Charlotte Hornets teammates were getting a little tired of hearing about how they couldn't beat the top teams in the Eastern Conference. They took care of that on Friday night. Walker scored 32 points on 11-of-16 shooting, and the Hornets routed the Toronto Raptors 113-78. The Hornets entered the game a combined 0-7 against Cleveland, Toronto and Boston, the top teams in the East. Walker called it an ""important"" win. ""We have been hearing about how we haven't been playing well against the top teams, which is obviously true, so we wanted to come out with great intensity right from opening jump,"" Walker said. ""We did that."" Walker, who came in averaging 23 points and looking to earn his first All-Star selection, scored 16 points in the pivotal third quarter, including a four-point play to close the quarter as the Hornets outscored the Raptors 33-15 to build a 25-point lead. Walker didn't play at all in the fourth quarter after the Hornets stretched their lead to more than 30. The 6-foot-1 point guard also finished with eight assists. ""He came out and set the tone for them offensively with his speed and quickness, attacking the rim,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""We have to have some resistance. We were trying to trap him and we can't allow him to go around our trap."" Hornets coach Steve Clifford called it his team's best game from start to finish. Kyle Lowry had 24 points and DeMar DeRozan added 23 points for the Raptors, who have lost two straight. The Hornets held the Raptors to 33 percent shooting and limited them to a season-low 78 points. Charlotte (22-21) came out strong with Walker effectively running the pick-and-roll with Cody Zeller. Walker scored 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting in the first half and had four rebounds and three assists. The Hornets have won eight of their last nine at home, with the only loss coming against the Cavaliers. TIP-INS Raptors: Held to 18 points on 31 percent (7 of 22) shooting in first quarter. ... Lowry picked up a technical foul in the first half for arguing a call. Lowry was upset earlier in the game when he took a shot the mouth and thought he should have gotten a foul called but didn't. ... Jared Sullinger was assessed a flagrant 1 foul in the fourth quarter after knocking over Nic Batum on the way to the basket. Hornets: Walker has scored at least 20 points in 30 of Charlotte's 43 games this season. It was Walker's seventh 30-point outing of the season. ... Marvin Williams has made a 3-pointer in 17 straight games. ... The Hornets are 15-1 when holding opponents under 100 points. LOOKING AHEAD Clifford said it's important the Hornets immediately put the win behind them and turn their focus to Brooklyn. ""We have a team coming in tomorrow night that put 120 on us the last time we played them,"" Clifford said. ""It will be one of those nights that determine, you know, what kind of team we're going to be. We've got to find a way to come back with the same concentration level and same attention to detail."" FRANK THE TANK Frank Kaminsky had a solid night off the bench for the second straight game, scoring 16 points and grabbing eight rebounds. ""Again, when those guys off the bench came in tonight they sustained the play,"" Clifford said. ""If you're going to be good. last year our big strength was our depth. We need everybody to play well and that's what we're getting right now."" SHOOTING STRUGGLES Casey said with his team having a tough week shooting the ball -- they lost the 76ers earlier in the week -- it's time to rely on the defense to carry them. ""That's when your defense has to pick back up,"" Casey said. ""Your defense has to carry you until your offense comes back around. You go through that during the season. The most important thing is we have to stay together, stay positive.""","400900063"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Jeff Green not only challenged his Orlando Magic teammates, he challenged himself to play with more urgency and passion following a loss to New Orleans that capped a frustrating six-game road trip. It seems the message got through. Green and the Magic rebounded from their 1-5 road trip with a dominating 112-96 victory over Milwaukee on Friday night in their first game back at Amway Center since Jan. 6. Green sparked the win with his 16 points off the bench that came primarily on transition baskets and driving layups. ""It was definitely there,"" the veteran forward said of the improved passion and urgency the team played with Friday. ""We communicated and I'm not talking just on offense but on defense. We were on the same page, we were in synch and we communicated. ""When we are on the same page we have a chance to be one of the top defensive teams."" It certainly looked that way against the Bucks. Milwaukee, which had led by as many as 10 points in the first quarter, went through several scoring droughts as Orlando contested every basket. Bucks forward Jabari Parker led all scorers with 25 points and recently named East All-Star starter Giannis Antetokounmpo had 17 points, but both players had to put up 17 shots. The Magic made Milwaukee work for its 41 percent shooting while their offensive flow seemed much better even with two of their best scorers sidelined Friday with injuries. Orlando shot 46 percent from the field and had 25 assists, which was indicative of its ball movement all night. ""When you're struggling you have to commit to your process, commit to your work,"" said Magic coach Frank Vogel, whose team snapped a three-game losing streak. ""You have to commit to get better every single day. The focus was good tonight, the urgency and desperation was good tonight. Hopefully we can keep it going."" Milwaukee, which has now lost four straight, is simply trying to figure out how to remain in contention for one of the Eastern Conference playoff spots. The Bucks held a players' only meeting after Friday's game and it took coach Jason Kidd over 35 minutes following the game to address the media. ""If we don't score the ball we tend to take a step back,"" Kidd said. ""Those were the things we were talking about."" TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee led by as many as 10 points early in the first quarter, but went scoreless in the final four minutes of the period to allow Orlando to turn its deficit into a 25-23 lead going into the second quarter. Magic: Orlando is extremely thin at the shooting guard spot with starter Evan Fournier listed as day-to-day with a heel injury. Reserve guard Jodie Meeks is now out four to six weeks after a MRI on Thursday revealed he has sprained ligaments in his right thumb. C.J. Watson started shooting guard Friday night. ... Former star point guard Penny Hardaway was inducted into the Magic's Hall of Fame on Friday and honored during the game. ROUGH MEETING Apparently the conversation during the Bucks' players-only meeting got heated at times. Parker says he wasn't well received when he expressed his point of view. ""I spoke up for the first time and it didn't go my way,"" he said. ""I got thrashed, but hey, I guess I gave them another perspective.""","400900064"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The Memphis Grizzlies are relying on 3-pointers as an offensive weapon this season, and the green light even extends to their big men. Center Marc Gasol and reserve power forward Zach Randolph used long-range shooting to key a strong third quarter, providing the Grizzlies a big lead en route to a 107-91 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Friday night. Gasol, who finished with 28 points and nine rebounds, connected on a trio of 3-pointers in the third quarter and Randolph closed the frame with a 35-footer that gave the Grizzlies an 83-64 lead, an advantage large enough that Kings coach Dave Joerger gave the bulk of his starters the rest of the night off. ""I hadn't hit (a 3-pointer) in a long time, so I was long overdue,"" said Randolph, who finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Gasol and Randolph were a combined 5 of 9 from outside the arc, part of Memphis connecting on 11 of 28 from 3-point range. ""When they're making shots, it makes us really hard to guard,"" said guard Mike Conley, who had 16 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. ""It opens up the paint for us. . I literally just kind of walked to the rim a few times. That's a byproduct of our big guys being able to space the court with their 3-point shooting."" Tony Allen had 13 points and 10 rebounds as six Memphis players reached double figures in scoring. DeMarcus Cousins led the Kings with 19 points and 10 rebounds, while Garrett Temple added 14 points and Ty Lawson had 13 for Sacramento, which has lost four straight and seven of its last eight. Memphis started slow, but rebounded in the middle of the game. The Grizzlies carried a 49-42 lead into the break. The second-quarter performance, coupled with Gasol's 15 points in the third, provided Memphis a 68-41 advantage spanning the middle two quarters. ""They were just getting easy shots coming down,"" Lawson said. ""We started the game off good, but then, after that, they were knocking down shots and getting into the pain. Just doing what they wanted to do."" TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento played its first game without starting F Rudy Gay, the team's second-leading scorer at 18.7 points a game, who sustained a season-ending Achilles tendon injury in Wednesday's loss to Houston. ... Cousins received a technical foul near the end of the first half, his 14th of the season. ... Cousins recorded his 21st double-double of the season. Grizzlies: Reserve G Troy Daniels left the game in the second quarter with a right knee injury and did not return. He said after the game he was unsure when the injury occurred. ...

LONG AND WINDING ROAD Friday's game in Memphis was the start of an eight-game road trip for Sacramento. Next stop on the journey: Chicago to face the Bulls on Saturday. This marks the second time in three years the Kings have had an eight-game trip. ""You just kind of go on tour,"" Joerger said. ""Play some games and go to the next place and play a game and `where do I sleep tonight' and `what hotel room number have I got.""","400900065"
"NEW ORLEANS --  The Brooklyn Nets didn't have to worry about a fourth-quarter flop this time. Brook Lopez and Bojan Bogdanovic scored 23 points apiece and the Nets ended an 11-game losing streak, routing the New Orleans Pelicans 143-114 on Friday night for only their ninth win of the season. Outscored by identical 31-16 margins after leading at the end of the third in recent defeats to the Pelicans and the Toronto Raptors, Brooklyn built a 25-point advantage after three and cruised with its highest point total in a non-overtime game since April 17, 1982. Caris LeVert added 17 points on 6-of-6 shooting for the Nets, who had seven players in double figures while beating their season high for points by 16. Their 29-point victory was 11 more than their previous largest. They also set season highs for points in the second quarter (37) and points in any quarter with 43 in the third. ""We had that energy about us I'd say from about five minutes into the game on,"" Lopez said. ""It never dropped regardless of what was happening. It was really spectacular for us."" Anthony Davis led New Orleans with 22 points and nine rebounds despite leaving in the third quarter with a right quadriceps contusion. The defeat was a huge comedown for him and the Pelicans a day after he was named a starter for the NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans. ""It wasn't one person that killed us,"" said Pelicans guard Tyreke Evans, who shot 2 for 10. ""It was the whole team. We had no excuses. We have to make shots and play better."" The Nets, who hit only 9 of 42 3-pointers in a loss to the Pelicans when Davis did not play on Jan. 12, sank 13 of 23 through three quarters and finished 15 of 30. Brooklyn also had no problem getting to the basket. Spencer Dinwiddle drove through the lane for an uncontested dunk to make it 57-44 in the second quarter. The next time down the court, little-used reserve Quincy Acy scored at the rim over a hobbling Davis. ""It feels great, especially to get one on the road like this,"" LeVert said. ""We definitely needed one for sure."" By the time Davis exited, the Pelicans already were hopelessly behind. The Nets even rested starting forward Trevor Booker, their leading rebounder, and guard Sean Kilpatrick, their top scorer off the bench. Coach Kenny Atkinson said they were healthy but would not play, with a schedule of 10 games in 17 days a large factor. The Pelicans led 32-29 at the end of the first quarter, the same score they had in Wednesday's victory over Orlando. Nothing else was the same as the Nets took them apart with 57.8 percent shooting while holding them to 41 percent. Dante Cunningham had 14 points for New Orleans, but eight came in the first four minutes. Jrue Holiday added 12 points and eight assists. TIP-INS Nets: The Nets' 14-game road skid was nowhere near their longest. They lost a then NBA-record 34 in a row spanning the end of 1989-90 and the start of 1990-91. ... Five Brooklyn reserves scored in double figures and the bench accounted for 73 points. Pelicans: The Pelicans did not make Davis available after the game. ... The Pelicans had won six in a row against the Nets. ... Brooklyn's 43 points in the third quarter tied the franchise record for most points allowed in a quarter. REPLACEMENTS Joe Harris started for Booker but played only 13 minutes, scoring 8 points with 2 rebounds. Acy, signed to a second 10-day contract earlier Friday, had 12 points and 8 rebounds in 22 minutes after Atkinson compared his skill set to Booker's. ""That's an interesting group,"" Atkinson said. ""They're fast and long. Maybe we stumbled onto something."" HOMETOWN ALL-STAR On Thursday, Davis was named an All-Star starter for the game in New Orleans. He played less than 10 minutes as a reserve in 2014, the last time the game was in New Orleans. Said coach Alvin Gentry: ""It's important for him to represent this city. I don't think people realize how much he loves this city and what it means for him.""","400900066"
"HOUSTON --  The Golden State Warriors wanted to make sure the Houston Rockets wouldn't beat them from the 3-point line. They carried out their plan perfectly, forcing the NBA's most prolific 3-point shooting team into a terrible shooting night in a 125-108 victory Friday night that extended Golden State's winning streak to six games. Kevin Durant scored 32 points and the Warriors used a big third quarter to build a huge lead and coast to the victory. In a matchup of two of the best teams in the Western Conference and All-Star starting guards Stephen Curry and James Harden, the Rockets fell short. Houston, which entered the game leading the NBA with 667 3-pointers, was just 7 of 35 behind the arc. Harden went 0 for 5 and Eric Gordon, who entered the game leading the NBA with 160 3s, missed all seven attempts. ""I think it was good defense on our part,"" Durant said. ""They missed a couple of open ones, but that's from -- they didn't have a rhythm. I think we did a good job of putting a hand up on the shots and getting out and rebounding ... for the most part we contested, forced them to shoot in the paint and got out and ran."" Houston's 20 percent shooting on 3s tied a season low for a Golden State opponent and was just the fourth time this season that the Rockets made fewer than 10 3s. ""None of us are happy, but it happens,"" Harden said. ""So what? What's next? And that's what our motto is."" Clint Capela had 22 points and Harden added 17 points with 11 assists for the Rockets, who are third in the West behind Golden State and San Antonio. The Warriors were up by five at halftime and used a 12-4 run to open the second half and stretch their lead to 74-61. Golden State got six points from Durant in that span, including a dunk and a nifty reverse layup. Houston got four points from Capela after that before Golden State used a 10-2 run, with 3s from Draymond Green and Curry, to make it 84-67 midway through the period. Golden State pushed the lead to 99-79 entering the fourth. Houston won the first game against Golden State this season in two overtimes to snap an eight-game, regular-season losing streak to the Warriors. But it was clear the Rockets wouldn't make it two in a row after they scored just 22 points and went 0 for 10 on 3-pointers in the third quarter. Houston scored the first five points of the fourth quarter to cut the deficit to 99-84. But Golden State used a 9-4 run after that to extend its lead to 20 points by the midpoint of the quarter, and many fans started heading for the exits. Curry finished with 24 points and made five 3-pointers, including one with about 3 1/2 minutes remaining that left the Warriors up 117-93. Both teams cleared their benches after that. TIP-INS Warriors:  Golden State made 15 of 38 3-pointers. ... Klay Thompson added 16 points. ... Green had 15 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Rockets: Ryan Anderson had one rebound in nine minutes in his return after missing two games with the flu. ...

He received a huge ovation when he was shown on the Jumbotron during a timeout in the second quarter. Watt, who won NFL Defensive Player of the Year last season, played just three games this season before having season-ending back surgery. SLEEP OVER The Warriors had planned to fly out of Houston on Friday night, but a team spokesman said after the game they were staying an extra night because the weather was too bad to leave. Houston has experienced flooding this week as heavy rains blanketed the area for several days. NO DANCING ON MY WATCH Durant said along with limiting Houston's 3-point shooting, keeping Harden in check was a focus on Friday night. ""You don't want Harden up there dancing with the ball, shooting step backs and running down court dancing,"" he said. ""So we did a good job of limiting his shots, making him pass the ball and contesting shots as well at the 3-point line.""","400900067"
"ATLANTA --  Dennis Schroder thought his night was over with the Atlanta Hawks leading by 30 points late in the third quarter. He headed to the bench to watch the entire fourth quarter, only to get called into emergency duty for one hurried last minute. ""A win is a win,"" the fourth-year point guard said. ""We played great the first three quarters. The fourth quarter -- it happens. We were relaxing a little bit."" Schroder scored 23 points, Paul Millsap added 14 and the Hawks held back a late scare to beat the Chicago Bulls 102-93 on Friday night. Dwight Howard and Thabo Sefolosha combined by 24 points for Atlanta, which has won 10 of 12. The Bulls put up little resistance all night until their reserves outscored Atlanta's backups 37-8 from the last minute of the third quarter until the last minute of the fourth. The run ended when Bobby Portis' dunk cut the lead to 95-90 with 1:08 remaining. Chicago trailed by 22 at the end of the first, by 29 at the end of the second and 30 at the end of the third. Atlanta's lead was tenuous enough that Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer brought back Millsap with 1:56 remaining and Schroder with 1:34. Schroder hit a jumper to make it 97-90 and Millsap pulled down a defensive rebound that led to a 10-point lead. Jimmy Butler finished with 19 points for the Bulls, who looked uninspired most of the night. They have dropped five of seven. ""We need to come out better, man,"" Butler said. ""We need to start playing better from the jump, a full 48 minutes. It's terrible basketball. That's not the way we're supposed to play, man. It's so disappointing."" For the Hawks, the outcome was the exact opposite from Wednesday's blowout loss at Detroit. The Hawks trailed by 24 in the first and never recovered. ""I thought the focus and effort were very good,"" Budenholzer said. ""You have a team with character, a team with pride."" Leading 22-10 in the first quarter Friday, the Hawks went on a 16-3 run that ended with Malcolm Delaney's 3 early in the second. The lead swelled to 32 on Schroder's 3 early in the third. Chicago missed its first 11 attempts beyond the arc before Butler's 3 cut the lead to 49-26 with 5 minutes left in the second. Atlanta has won six straight in the series. ""It's got to be something inside you to want to go out and compete and give yourselves an opportunity to win basketball games,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""Tonight's effort, we didn't allow that."" DOUBLE WHISTLE Howard and Bulls C Robin Lopez each received a technical foul late in the third. Lopez laid a hard foul on Howard, who took exception and used his shoulder to lean into Lopez's shoulder and push Lopez back as he walked slowly to the free throw line. Lopez stood on the side of the lane for the first foul shot and was whistled for the technical as he and Howard kept jabbering at each other. Lopez left the game and sat on the floor near the Bulls' bench. Howard left a minute later. Neither played in the fourth. TIP-INS Bulls: There were a few thousand Bulls fans among the announced crowd of 16,328. One of the few chances they had to cheer was on Butler's alley-oop feed to Dwyane Wade for a third-quarter dunk. That was as good as it got until Portis jammed late in the game. Wade, a 12-time All-Star in his first season with Chicago, scored four points on 2-for-10 shooting. ... Portis and Paul Zipser each scored 10 points. Jerian Grant had 12. Hawks: The 29-point halftime lead was a season high. ... The 13 points allowed tied a season low in the first quarter. ... Budenholzer wouldn't speculate when F Mike Muscala will return after missing three straight games with a sprained left ankle.","400900068"
"DALLAS -- Rudy Gobert was helping the Utah Jazz even when missing free throws in overtime. Gobert, who finished with career highs of 27 points and 25 rebounds, missed both of his free throw attempts with 1:50 left. But the second one ricocheted right back to him, and he fed the ball to Joe Johnson for a tying 3-pointer. The Jazz went on to a 112-107 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. ""That was the plan. Coach called it,"" Gobert said with a smile. After a miss by Deron Williams on the ensuing possession and a foul in the aftermath, Joe Ingles put the Jazz ahead to stay by making two free throws with 1:35 left. Gobert had seven rebounds in the extra five-minute period, and finished with his 29th consecutive 10-rebound game. ""What I love about Rudy, is he's trying to win the basketball game and he doesn't like to lose,"" teammate Gordon Hayward said. ""He's got a fire inside of him and it's definitely something that you can feel when you're out there."" Hayward had 26 points, including a big 3-pointer late in regulation. Johnson finished with 15 points. Harrison Barnes had 19 points for Dallas, which had seven players score in double figures. Williams had 16 points and Seth Curry 15. Williams had consecutive layups high off the glass in overtime, the last with 1:36 putting the Mavericks up 107-104. Hayward's 3-pointer with 1:06 left in regulation had put the Jazz up 96-95, then Gobert had a rebound that led to his layup at the other end for a 98-95 lead with 36 seconds left. That rebound by Gobert came after a missed 3-pointer by J.J. Barea, who aggravated a left calf issue on the shot. He was playing in only his 18th game and now will miss some more. ""Same calf, different area,"" Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. ""It's going to be a while. It's going to be likely weeks and not days."" Curry, who had been on the bench for a long stretch, re-entered the game for Barea and made a wide-open tying 3-pointer from the left corner with 25 seconds left. TIP-INS Jazz: Gobert's rebounding streak is now 10 games longer than the previous Jazz record that had been shared by Paul Millsap (2008-09) and Truck Robinson (1977-78). Only four other NBA players have had a 30-game streak of 10-rebound games since 1997-98. ... The Jazz went to overtime for the first time this season. Mavericks: After losing at Miami on Thursday, Dallas is 0-8 in the second game of back-to-backs. ... The Mavs scored on 10 consecutive possessions in the fourth quarter before Barnes had a turnover out of a timeout with 2:40 left. Barnes had scored seven consecutive points during that stretch. ... Andrew Bogut missed his fifth straight game since tweaking his hamstring last week after coming back from a right knee problem. 20-20 FIRST When the 7-foot-1 Gobert was asked what took him so long to get his first 20-20 game, he responded, ""I can't do everything right away. Got to do it slowly."" The 24-year-old Gobert is in his fourth NBA season. Asked if he should be an All-Star, he said, ""Yes, to be honest. ... I think I should be an All-Star for sure."" SHOOTING STRUGGLES Dirk Nowitzki matched his season high with 10 rebounds for Dallas, but was just 1-of-13 shooting for three points. A minute into the fourth quarter, the 13-time All-Star and MVP from 10 years ago twice grabbed his own misses before being blocked on a third try. TRYING TO STOP TIME After Hayward's miss with 2 seconds left in regulation, Carlisle was immediately trying to call timeout while Williams tried to gather the rebound. ""They didn't see it -- although none of them told me that,"" Carlisle said. The buzzer sounded, and officials reviewed the play. Two-tenths of a second were put back on the clock and the ball went to the Jazz since Williams lost the ball out of bounds. The Jazz called two timeouts but were unable to get an alley-oop shot, the only possible way to score in that little bit of time.","400900069"
"LOS ANGELES --  Although Luke Walton resisted the urge to shout about it, the coach was clearly proud of what the Los Angeles Lakers can do when their crowded schedule allows them to have a couple of real practices. Lou Williams scored 27 points, Nick Young hit five 3-pointers and the Lakers snapped their five-game losing streak with a 108-96 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. Julius Randle scored 16 points while Young and rookie Brandon Ingram added 15 apiece as the Lakers made a prolonged second-half surge to win for just the sixth time in 27 games. The Lakers have played an NBA-high 47 games, and practice days have been painfully rare for Walton and a youthful team that desperately needs more work in the gym. With the two previous days off, the coach put his team through two thorough workouts, and the results showed in one of the Lakers' best efforts since November. ""We've played this well before,"" Walton said. ""How long can we maintain it? How long before this is just how we play basketball? That comes with guys just getting time together."" Even after D'Angelo Russell left with a leg injury on their second possession, the Lakers showed off excellent ball movement and balanced scoring. Williams hit four 3-pointers in another prolific outside shooting performance, and Young put on his usual theatrics while peppering the Pacers with big buckets. ""We just picked it up in practice,"" Young said of the Lakers' improved effort. ""We just picked our energy up, stayed with it, and that's about it."" Young also went to the locker room after hyperextending his left knee late in the first half, but he returned for the second half. The Lakers played without veteran forward Luol Deng, who has a sprained right wrist. Paul George scored 21 points and Al Jefferson added 20 for the Pacers, who had a dismal second half in just their second loss in nine games. Indiana committed 12 turnovers and hit just 14 shots after halftime, getting outscored 35-22 in the third quarter. ""I just saw (the Lakers) scrap harder,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""They wanted the ball more. They went after the ball. ... I thought we were sloppy, certainly sloppy on the offensive end of the floor. Twenty-one turnovers? It's ridiculous at this time of the season. We just have to mature."" TIP-INS Pacers: C.J. Miles failed to convert a four-point play in the third quarter. ... One game after Jefferson hit his season high with 20 points at Sacramento, the center matched that total in the first half at Staples Center. He didn't score in the second half, missing all four of his shots. Lakers: Larry Nance Jr. has been cleared to resume practice and to play limited minutes in their next game. The second-year forward has missed 16 games since Dec. 20 with a bone bruise in his left knee. ... Jose Calderon played 19 minutes in Russell's absence, putting up seven points and six assists. D-LO DOWN Russell mildly sprained a ligament in his right knee and strained his right calf on the Lakers' second possession. Russell was injured when he lost his footing while going around a screen set by Randle. Russell's left leg alarmingly stretched backward, and he stayed down while holding his right knee before eventually walking to the locker room. Russell entered the game averaging 14.8 points, 4.5 assists and 3.8 rebounds per game in his second NBA season. He will be re-evaluated Saturday before their road trip. ""Awkward position that I fell in caused a little pain, but I'm all right,"" Russell said. GOING AWAY The Pacers dropped to 6-15 outside of Indianapolis, and they aren't sure why. ""We've yet to find our identity on the road, but for some reason, we know how to play at home,"" George said. ""I don't know what it is, but we are totally different when we play on the road."" COUGHING IT UP Jeff Teague led the Pacers with six turnovers, while Myles Turner had five and George four. ""Some of the turnovers we made were head-scratching,"" McMillan said. ""Careless with the ball. Absolutely no value with that basketball. You have to value the ball. We were just loose with the ball all night long.""","400900070"
"BOSTON -- The Portland Trail Blazers could have limped home with a winless road trip on their minds. Instead, they relied on Damian Lillard's late-game performance and made the long cross-country flight a lot more enjoyable. Lillard had a three-point play with 47 seconds left in overtime and finished with 28 points to lift the Trail Blazers to a 127-123 victory over the Boston Celtics on Saturday night, snapping their four-game losing streak. ""To have that fight in us,"" Lillard said was the goal. ""It would have been easy to say: `We played last night, tough loss, five o'clock game, back-to-back.' It would have been easy to play hard, show up and let the game slip."" CJ McCollum scored 35 points to lead Portland, which lost in the closing seconds in Philadelphia on Friday night. Lillard added seven assists. Portland entered the day nine games under .500, but Boston coach Brad Stevens felt it's a lot more talented team than the record. ""This is a team that was a fourth or fifth seed in the playoffs last year,"" he said. ""They're starting to obviously work some other guys in, but they're healthy and they played really well today."" Isaiah Thomas led Boston with 41 points, his 14th time this season with 30 or more points. Marcus Smart and Al Horford each scored 17 for the Celtics, who have lost two straight after winning 13 of 16. ""We played well, they just made shots, therefore we didn't get stops,"" Thomas said. ""We're slowly trying to get back to where we were last season, getting that defensive mindset."" Thomas nailed a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:24 to play in OT, pushing Boston ahead by one, but Al-Farouq Aminu was fouled on the next possession and hit both free throws to move Portland back in front. Lillard then drove the lane, was fouled and hit the free throw. Mason Plumlee had a short jumper in the lane and a free throw in the closing 24 seconds. With Boston trailing by one in the closing seconds of regulation, Lillard went to the line and hit two free throws, making it 113-110 with 10.8 seconds left. But Terry Rozier's 3-pointer from the right wing tied it with 8.4 seconds left. Lillard then back-rimmed a long jumper at the horn, sending the game to OT. ""We needed it,"" Portland guard Evan Turner said of the win. ""We talk about not dropping our heads."" Portland forward Noah Vonleh fouled out in just 17 minutes of action, scoring eight points with six rebounds. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Turner faced the Celtics for the first time since he signed a free-agent deal with Portland during the offseason and had 12 points. He spent two seasons in Boston and got a nice ovation in pregame introductions. ""It was cool. I appreciated it, being in Boston, from what it could have been. It could have been boos,"" he said. "". ... F Ed Davis was out with a wrist injury. Celtics: G Avery Bradley was out for the second straight game with a sore right Achilles. He played in one game after missing five because he strained the same Achilles. ... F Jonas Jerebko was out due to an illness. IT DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY Portland coach Terry Stotts said Turner did a solid job on Thomas despite the 5-foot-9 guard collecting his third 40-plus game of the season. ""I thought Evan did a heck of a job,"" he said. ""I thought Evan really competed against him and it goes to show how good Isaiah Thomas is because I thought Evan made him work for his points."" Turner said it was a lot of work chasing him around. ""He's talented,"" he said. ""The dude has a lot. For his height and size you can't give him enough credit.""","400900071"
"James Harden drives past the Grizzlies defense and into the paint for a layup and foul. (0:19) AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  Marcus Morris used an assist from his twin brother to help the Detroit Pistons beat the Washington Wizards. Morris scored 25 points and tipped in the winning basket at the buzzer, using Markieff's shoulder to help elevate himself and get his hand on the ball, as the streaking Pistons won their third straight, 113-112 on Saturday night. ""I grabbed him, put my hand on his shoulder and got him back because he blocked my shot the play before that,"" Marcus Morris said of Markieff. ""I knew that was him (standing there). You can't make that call at the end of the game."" After the Wizards took a 112-111 lead on Bradley Beal's two free throws with 1:13 left, Detroit had numerous chances to win on its final possession before Marcus Morris tipped in Tobias Harris' missed runner with no time left. ""I just stayed on my side,"" Marcus Morris said. ""I stayed with it, crashed the glass and happened to be in a good spot."" Markieff Morris, who used to be teammates with his brother in Phoenix, gave Marcus credit for the winner, but called it a ""lucky"" tip. ""I should have blocked it,"" Markieff said. ""Tough loss for us, but you bounce back."" Reggie Jackson had 19 points and eight assists, while Harris added 18 points and nine rebounds for the Pistons, who let a 16-point lead slip away in the fourth quarter before Marcus Morris' big bucket. ""It was a nice, solid win,"" Jackson said. ""It was a tough win for us."" John Wall finished with 19 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds, and Markieff Morris added 19 points and nine rebounds for Washington, which had its four-game win streak snapped. ""We battled and fought,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""One rebound short of winning that game."" The Pistons led 98-82 after three quarters, but the Wizards fought back, getting within six at 105-99 on Markieff Morris' layup. The teams traded baskets over the next few minutes before Washington gained a 110-109 advantage on Morris' dunk with 2:14 remaining. ""Our energy was good and we played really hard,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""It's all about wins."" Washington scored the first nine points of the game, but the Pistons took their first lead, 20-19, on Marcus Morris' 3-pointer and led 30-26 after the first quarter. Detroit took its biggest edge of the half, 41-30, on Reggie Bullock's 3-pointer. The Wizards got within three points on two occasions, but trailed 61-55 at the break. The Pistons controlled the third quarter, building their lead to 16 points on Ish Smith's free throw to end the period. TIP-INS Wizards: Danuel House Jr. (right wrist fracture) and Ian Mahinmi (knee) did not play. ... Washington played its third straight close game, beating New York 113-110 and Memphis 104-101 in their last two. ... G Trey Burke played college basketball at Michigan. He finished Saturday with seven points off the bench. Pistons: G Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (left rotator cuff strain) did not play. ... Detroit capped its five game West Coast trip with a 102-97 win over the Lakers and beat Atlanta 118-95 in their first game back at the Palace. ... Marcus Morris also grabbed 11 rebounds for his third double-double this season. ROAD WOES Washington fell to 5-14 overall on the road, including 5-9 against Eastern Conference opponents. The Wizards are much better at home with an 18-6 record. ""It's hard to beat somebody when they score that many points,"" Markieff Morris said of Saturday's loss. ""You've just got to move on.""","400900072"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Nic Batum has certainly had better shooting nights. But the eight-year NBA veteran from France was feeling pretty good after making two clutch 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to help the Charlotte Hornets defeat the Brooklyn Nets 112-105 on Saturday night for their third straight win. ""I missed some easy that I need to make,"" Batum said. ""So I feel like when it's a close game like that, I need to make some big plays and I did."" After letting a 17-point first half advantage slip away, Charlotte grabbed the lead for good with 3:21 left in the game when Batum got a fadeaway 3-pointer to fall after the ball bounced lazily on the rim four times before going in. Batum, who was fouled on the play, added the free throw to complete the four-point play. Batum added a 3-pointer from the left wing on the next possession to push the lead to 104-98. Kemba Walker then sank a leaning 3-pointer from the top of the key to give Charlotte some extra breathing room. Coach Steve Clifford said he has no idea how Batum shoots the ball so well off-balanced. ""He's done it since before he got in the NBA,"" Clifford said. ""He's got great balance and hand-eye coordination."" Batum finished with 16 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the Hornets. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had 17 points and 14 rebounds for Charlotte, which avenged a 120-118 loss to the Nets on Dec. 26 in which Randy Foye beat them with a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Brook Lopez had 24 points for the struggling Nets, who have lost 12 of their last 13 and failed in their quest to become the last NBA team to reach double digits in wins this season. ""We came in and we were exhausted from last night and had a bad first quarter, but we responded to that,"" Lopez said. ""We came in the second half and definitely made it a game and that's the way we've got to play every night."" TIP INS Nets: Jeremy Lin remained out with a hamstring injury. ... Attempted 41 3-pointers in the game, making 17. ... Lopez had his 15th 20-point game this season. ... Quincy Acy had a season-high 14 points off the bench. ... Had a season-high 30 assists. Hornets: Shot 54.5 percent in the first half from the field, including 6 of 13 from 3-point range to build a 60-46 lead. ... Marvin Williams has made a 3-pointer in 18 straight games. TOUGH FIRST QUARTER The Hornets jumped out to a quick 16-4 lead as the Nets missed 11 of their first 12 shots from the field. Clifford called it the team's best first quarter of the season, considering the Nets put up 143 points against New Orleans the night before. ""They're hard to guard,"" Clifford said. ""They have so many ways to drive the ball. They're very difficult to guard. I thought our guys battled hard."" 3-POINT SHOOTING Charlotte, which made 14 of 29 3-pointers, had seven of those in the fourth quarter. ""Two of them were off our turnovers,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""You turnover, you have to sprint back, matchup and find 3-point shooters. Credit to them, they made some huge shots."" SCHOOL IN SESSIONS Here's a rarity this season: Ramon Sessions, Charlotte's backup point guard, had 17 points and actually outscored All-Star candidate Kemba Walker, who had 16 points. ""Kemba carries us every game, so when we can step in and give those guys a rest,"" Sessions said. ""Last game, he didn't have to play in the fourth quarter, so during the season if we can get those stretches where he doesn't have to play as many minutes that will be good for us in the long run.""","400900073"
"ATLANTA -- The young Philadelphia 76ers are on the rise, but the Atlanta Hawks' experience and attention to detail made the difference Saturday night. Paul Millsap scored 22 points and combined with Dwight Howard to dominate on the boards as the Hawks beat the Sixers 110-93 for their ninth win in 11 games. Howard grabbed 15 rebounds in addition to scoring 13 points, Millsap added 10 rebounds and Atlanta used a 48-38 rebounding edge to beat Philadelphia for the sixth straight time. The Sixers (15-27) lost for just the third time in 11 games, done in partly by 21 turnovers that led to 17 Atlanta points. Nothing mattered more than the way the Hawks (26-18) were shooting in the second quarter. They made 16 of 23 shots and outscored the Sixers 37-29 in the period to take a 62-54 halftime lead. ""We got into a good rhythm,"" said Millsap, who shot 9-of-14. ""We were moving the basketball, playing with each other, all the things that make us successful."" Ersan Ilyasova led the Sixers with 21 points, and when Robert Covington (15 points, 10 rebounds) made two free throws with 6:46 left in the game, Philadelphia had whittled an 18-point third-quarter deficit to a 94-87 Atlanta lead. The Hawks cruised from there to win for the 11th time in 13 games. They are a season-high eight games over .500, and a half game behind the Celtics for the No. 3 spot in the East. WRONG END OF RUN In the second game of back-to-backs, the Sixers looked as if they ran out of gas in the second quarter about 24 hours after their 93-92 win over the Trail Blazers. ""There was an energy that wasn't with us tonight,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""I think the second group struggled. I thought that the energy and the activity of that second group tonight wasn't what it has been."" HOWARD'S HEROICS When the Atlanta Falcons play the Green Bay Packers on Sunday in the NFC championship game in the Georgia Dome, which is less than a mile from Philips Arena, Howard said he'll be cheering like mad. ""I don't want to jinx myself, but I said before the season the Falcons and Patriots would be in the Super Bowl,"" the Atlanta native said. ""Go Falcons! Rise up!"" TIP-INS Sixers: Saturday was to be a rest day for center Joel Embiid anyway, and while he didn't play against the Hawks his availability is unclear after he suffered a knee contusion in Friday's win over the Trail Blazers. Brown said Embiid will be further assessed upon the team's return home. ... Backup point guard Sergio Rodriguez did not play for just the fifth time in 42 games, including 30 starts. Brown said he's trying different combinations. Hawks: Backup big man Mike Muscala missed his fourth straight game with a left ankle sprain. ... Atlanta has scored 100 or more points in six of the last seven games. KEEP PUNCHING Although the Sixers scored just 16 points in the fourth quarter on 5-of-16 shooting, they made a game of it with late defense. Atlanta missed seven of its first nine shots in the quarter as Philadelphia cut the deficit to seven points. ""I think the last time we played them, we came out at halftime and the game was pretty much over from there,"" said point guard T.J. McConnell, who finished with eight points, a game-high 11 assists and three of Philly's eight steals. ""But this time, they punched us in the mouth again and we didn't go away. We've kind of been showing that resiliency.""","400900074"
"NEW YORK --  The Phoenix Suns had more reason to feel good about their future, while the New York Knicks just missed a chance to escape their frustrating present. Devin Booker scored 26 points and made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 31 seconds left, and the Suns beat the Knicks 107-105 on Saturday night. ""It was just an excellent pass by (Eric) Bledsoe,"" Booker said. ""I'm thinking he's going to come off the screen but I'm always shot ready. He made a perfect pass, hit me in the hands and I just shot it with confidence. Ended up being a big shot, the last points of the game."" Carmelo Anthony's attempt at a winning 3-pointer rimmed out as Phoenix snapped a two-game losing streak and handed New York its second loss in a row. ""That was a tough one to digest right there,"" Anthony said. ""We got the play that we wanted, got the shot that we wanted, got the look that we wanted, did everything but went in."" Bledsoe added 23 points, while P.J. Tucker and Marquese Chriss each had 15. Anthony led the Knicks with 31 points but was scoreless in the fourth quarter. Derrick Rose had 26 and Kristaps Porzingis scored 14. Rose made a layup to give the Knicks a 105-102 lead, but Booker responded by drawing a foul on Courtney Lee and sinking both free throws to cut the deficit to one. Rose missed a jumper from the top of the key, P.J. Tucker missed a point-blank layup and Ron Baker missed a driving layup to set up Booker's 3-pointer from the wing. The teams traded misses before Anthony took the inbounds pass after a timeout and launched a 3 that spun around the rim before falling out to give the Knicks their 13th loss in 16 games. Anthony scored 12 points in the third quarter, which ended in a 90-all tie. The Knicks eventually opened a 103-98 lead, their largest of the game, but couldn't hold on as Jeff Hornacek fell to 0-2 against the team he previously coached. Anthony led all scorers at the half with 19 points, but Booker paced Phoenix with 15 and the Suns took a 61-55 lead into the locker room. TIP-INS Suns: Coach Earl Watson praised Tucker's defensive ability. ""The thing about defense is there's no perfect technique. It's all on intensity, passion, toughness and a lot of heart. He plays with that every time he touches the court. He's one of our best players. To me, he's the most underrated defender in our league, especially on isolations."" ... Derrick Jones Jr. was inactive. Knicks: Hornacek reflected on the first half of the season. ""It's been an interesting year, I'd say. It was a tough beginning with Derrick Rose missing a bunch early, part of putting in the offense and getting a new group of guys together as familiarity and he wasn't able to be there for a big part of that so we were trying to win those first few games on the fly, Joakim with his hamstring early. There have been some distractions that we've had to keep the guys kind of together, the losing, minor injuries here and there. Overall, I think the guys have done a pretty good job of staying together. We still look at it when we have all our guys we still have a good chance."" LINE THEM UP New York went back to its original starting lineup of Joakim Noah, Porzingis, Anthony, Lee and Rose for the first time since Jan. 12 against the 76ers.

"MIAMI --  When Miami Heat guard Goran Dragic barely beat the shot clock with a 28-footer to seal Saturday's win, he retreated upcourt waving his arms, eager to coax more noise from the modest crowd. Riding a three-game winning streak for the first time since last March, the Heat and their fans finally have something to cheer about. Dion Waiters tied a career high with 33 points and Dragic added 25 to help the last-place Heat to a 109-97 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, who are headed the opposite direction. Bucks coach Jason Kidd shook up his lineup, but they lost their fifth game in a row and second in as many nights. Following a defeat Friday at Orlando, the Bucks held a long players-only meeting that became heated at times. ""We have a lot of games to be played,"" Kidd said after the latest loss. ""There's no reason to panic."" Waiters went 12 for 19, including 5 for 8 from 3-point range. Backcourt mate Dragic went 8 for 13 and had six assists. ""Those guys were making so many shots I almost shot a 3,"" center Hassan Whiteside said. ""They take our team to another whole level when they play like that."" Whiteside added 16 points and 15 rebounds while missing one shot. The Heat made 53 percent, just shy of their season high. ""Guys are playing better,"" Whiteside said. ""I don't know what really got into guys, but I like it. We're hitting shots we were missing earlier in the season."" Miami improved to 14-30 thanks to its modest winning streak. ""It feels better than 0-3,"" coach Eric Spoelstra said. Kidd said the Heat's record affected the Bucks' performance. ""One of the things that we struggle with is looking at the team's record and not coming out with that same intent if we're playing Cleveland, if we're playing Golden State,"" he said. ""That's something we have to get better at."" Following Friday's players-only meeting by the Bucks, forward Jabari Parker said he wasn't well received when he expressed his point of view. Parker was held out of the starting lineup Saturday for the first time this season for violating a team rule. Kidd declined to discuss the violation. Parker had 16 points and seven rebounds in 32 minutes off the bench. ""It's just a challenge, and I just try to be as positive as possible,"" he said. ""I thought he did a great job,"" Kidd said. All-Star starter Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24 points and 10 rebounds for Milwaukee. The Bucks led early, but Rodney McGruder and Dragic sank 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to put the Heat ahead 68-56 midway through the third quarter. Waiters barely beat the 24-second clock with a 3-pointer that made it 103-91 with 2 1/2 minutes left. Dragic's buzzer-beater with 1 1/2 minutes to go put Miami ahead 106-94 lead. TIP-INS Bucks: While Parker sat out the first quarter, Bucks rookie Thon Maker made his first career start, and guard Matthew Dellavedova started for the first time in 13 games. Maker had six points in 18 minutes, and Dellavedova had 15 points and seven assists. Heat: Okaro White, who made his NBA debut Thursday after signing a 10-day deal, played 19 minutes but still hasn't scored. ""His box score doesn't really show the impact he had defensively,"" Spoelstra said. ""He finds ways to fit in."" GOING INSIDE Waiters hurt the Bucks repeatedly with drives from the perimeter. ""I just try to play every game like it's my last,"" he said. ""Tonight the coaches told me to be aggressive, be me, and do what I do best -- get to the rim. I was able to do that."" TRAINER'S ROOM Guard Tyler Johnson sat out with a sprained left shoulder he injured in the Heat's game Thursday. His status is day to day.","400900076"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Sam Dekker made his first career start a memorable one. Dekker, subbing for the ill Ryan Anderson, scored a career-high 30 points, James Harden added 29 points and 10 assists and the Houston Rockets leaned on their usual 3-point offense to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 119-95 on Saturday night. Dekker, in his second year out of Wisconsin, said he didn't prepare for the game any differently knowing he would be on the court for the tip. And the opening showed there wasn't any nervousness. Dekker connected on his first five shots before finishing the night 12 of 19, including 6 of 11 from outside the arc. ""I did feel very comfortable from the jump and felt very locked in,"" Dekker said when asked about butterflies, later adding: ""When your first few go in, it really puts you at ease and (you) just kind of think everything is going to go in after that."" Eric Gordon added 21 points as the Rockets built the lead to 20 midway through the fourth and eventually 26 in coasting home. Marc Gasol scored 32 points and Mike Conley added 15 for the Grizzlies, who lost for the third time in the last four. ""Our brains were gone,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said of his team's offense. ""We couldn't stop them, so offensively, we were going down."" Houston shot 51 percent overall and 38 percent from distance. ""We had open shots, and we were able to knock them down,"" said Harden, who finished 7 of 9 from the field and 4 of 6 from 3-point range. The Rockets' aggressive defense gummed up Memphis' offensive flow. Houston defenders double-teamed Memphis and closed out on jumpers. The Grizzlies struggled shooting the entire night, finishing at 37 percent. Houston took the lead in the first half and never really let up the rest of the night in bouncing back from a home loss to Golden State on Friday. By the third quarter, the Rockets stretched a 58-49 lead to a 91-72 advantage entering the fourth as Dekker steadily paced the Houston offense. ""He played well. He played really well,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""He hit the 3s that we needed. . Really good game for him."" TIP-INS Rockets: Anderson missed his third game with the flu. He sat out two games and tried to play in Friday's loss to Golden State before leaving after nine minutes on the floor. ...The Rockets used their 10th different starting lineup this season. ... Despite missing their first seven from outside the arc, the Rockets ended the night 16 for 42. Houston has failed to connect on at least 10 3-pointers in only four games this season. Grizzlies: Reserve G Troy Daniels sat out after injuring his right knee in Friday's win over Sacramento. ... F Chandler Parsons, who sat out Friday's win over Sacramento for rest, returned to action, scoring 12 points. .Before Saturday's loss, the Grizzlies had won 10 straight when Gasol scored at least 30 points. BACK-TO-BACKS The game featured two of the most successful teams playing on the second night of a back-to-back. Houston is now 11-1, while the Grizzlies, who beat the Kings on Friday, dropped to 8-3 on the second night of back-to-backs. ONE FOR THE MEMORY BANK ""I think I'll remember that my first career start was in Memphis the rest of my life,"" Dekker said. ""That's something you always dream about doing, regardless of the circumstance. I just tried to take advantage of it and happened to have a good night."" HOLD ON THERE, YOUNGSTER Ah, but even with Dekker's successful first start, the role is only temporary. ""I think he knows what he needs to do, and he's doing it,"" D'Antoni said. ""Now, we'll throw him back on the bench because Ryan will be back next game.""","400900077"
"CLEVELAND -- As Kawhi Leonard peeled the ice bag off his swollen left hand, Manu Ginobili hobbled through San Antonio's locker room, his back stiffened from a run-in with LeBron James. And 20 minutes after the game, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was in sweats still going over his team's defensive breakdown in the final seconds. ""We messed up on that last play,"" Leonard said. ""We could easily be in double overtime right now."" The Spurs may not have survived it. Leonard scored a career-high 41 points, LaMarcus Aldridge had 16 points and 12 rebounds, and San Antonio downed Cleveland 118-115 despite missing starters Tony Parker and Pau Gasol. Leonard scored six in OT, including a game-sealing dunk with 4.9 seconds left, as the Spurs regrouped after a late collapse in regulation. David Lee, making a rare start in place of the injured Gasol, added 14 points as San Antonio improved to 18-4 on the road. James and Kyrie Irving scored 29 apiece for the Cavs, who had the last shot in regulation and plenty of opportunities in the extra five minutes. Cleveland still had a chance to tie it in the final second of overtime, but Kevin Love missed a 3-pointer. The matchup between two of the NBA's best teams didn't disappoint. There were clutch shots, defensive stops, drama and in Leonard vs. James, a budding rivalry between superstars. ""Great game. Anybody's game,"" Popovich said. ""Comes down to making shots. At the end of regulation we had some great shots that didn't go down. In overtime they had some great shots that didn't go down. It happens."" James helped force overtime with a 30-footer with 34.8 seconds left. James then forced Leonard to miss a contested fadeaway, giving the Cavs chance to win it, but James missed an off-balance 3 in the final second as the teams went to the extra session tied 107-all. San Antonio did not score in the final 2:47 of regulation. Irving scored Cleveland's first six points in overtime to give the Cavs a 113-111 lead, but Patty Mills got a second chance after badly missing a 3 and knocked one down to make it 114-113. Aldridge's two free throws put the Spurs up three before James committed his seventh turnover and the Cavs appeared to be done. But James forced a jump ball and won the tap, but in attempting to save the ball from going out of bounds, Love, who missed the previous game with back spasms, whipped it behind his back to Leonard, who went in for his dunk. James lamented his turnover with 24 seconds left. ""We botched the play,"" he said. ""(Coach Tyronn Lue) T-Lue drew it up in the timeout and we as a group didn't execute it the right way. We've got to be able to execute. Coming out of a timeout. We just sat down. We got our break. As a ballclub that's trying to win a championship, we can't have you go from a timeout to the court and forget what you're supposed to do. It's that simple."" TIP-INS Spurs: Leonard also played a career-high 46 minutes. ... Scored at least 100 points for the 20th straight game. ... Leonard is the first San Antonio player to score at least 30 in six straight games since Mike Mitchell in 1986. Cavaliers: Shot 12 of 22 from the line. ... James has marveled at how San Antonio continues to fly under the radar despite its championship pedigree. ""I think it's that they don't boast and brag about what they accomplish,"" he said. ""They're not flashy. They just win and they're consistent over there, but they've done a great job of just going about their business."" Lue has his own theory why the Spurs get overlooked. ""Maybe Pop has it in his contract to fly under the radar,"" he joked. ""They're good every year."" INJURY UPDATE Gasol is expected to miss at least one month after undergoing surgery on his broken left hand. The 7-footer got hurt during warmups on Thursday night, and his loss will not only test San Antonio's depth but may force the Spurs to sign another big man. Parker has a sore left foot, which isn't considered serious, but he's also expected to sit out Monday's game at Brooklyn.","400900078"
"DENVER --  The short-handed Los Angeles Clippers were no match for a Denver Nuggets team in the midst of perhaps its best stretch of the season. Nikola Jokic scored 19 points and Denver beat the Clippers 123-98 on Saturday night for its fourth win in five games. Denver has scored more than 120 points in each victory during that span. ""We're playing together,"" Jokic said. ""We're sharing the ball and our defense today was outstanding. We're trying to help each other. We're just starting to play more together."" Danilo Gallinari, Will Barton and Wilson Chandler added 18 points apiece for the Nuggets. The Clippers, meanwhile, have lost two games in a row since opening January with seven consecutive wins and fell to 2-7 this season when playing without both Chris Paul (thumb injury) and Blake Griffin (right knee). ""I think the biggest thing is we need to compete no matter who is on the floor,"" Clippers guard Austin Rivers said. ""It doesn't matter who is out, we've just got to compete. I think we did it to start, but after a couple bad things happened to us, we let it mess with us."" Gallinari said the Clippers are a tough team to contend with even without Griffin and Paul. ""They're a different team, no doubt, but at the same time, with Raymond Felton and other guys that stepped up, they still have a very good team with a lot of veterans and a lot of experience,"" Gallinari said. ""They're still dangerous even without those two great players."" Marreese Speights had 18 points to lead the Clippers. Rivers added 16 points and DeAndre Jordan had 13 rebounds to go with his 14 points. Denver, which never trailed, led by as many as 17 points in the first half and was up 59-45 at the break. Kenneth Faried had 11 of his 13 points in the first two quarters. The Clippers cut it to 61-53 on a layup by Rivers early in the third quarter but the Nuggets outscored the Clippers 34-18 during the rest of the period. Gallinari capped the surge with a 3-pointer as the period ended, allowing the Nuggets to take a 95-71 lead into the fourth quarter. Chandler then scored seven straight points for the Nuggets, including a 3-pointer, as Denver stretched its lead to 29 points in the opening minutes of the final period to put the game out of reach. TIP-INS Clippers: Paul is expected to be sidelined six to eight weeks because of the ligament tear in his left thumb, which he sustained earlier this week. ... Griffin has missed 17 games since undergoing a procedure on his right knee but is getting close to a return. Nuggets: G Gary Harris missed a second consecutive game because of an ankle injury. ... Gallinari (ankle) and F Darrell Arthur (knee) were both back in action after missing the previous game against San Antonio. ... Jokic, who also grabbed 10 rebounds, has a double-double in 13 of his last 20 games. SOMETHING TO PROVE ""Blake is coming back, so that will help but that shouldn't matter though. We have a really good team whether (Chris Paul) plays or not. We have a good team and I think we are going to prove that."" -- Austin Rivers, on the Clippers' outlook.","400900079"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  George Hill insisted there was no extra motivation in facing his former team for the first time since being traded during the summer. Motivation or not, the Utah Jazz point guard torched the Indiana Pacers for one of his best games of the season. Hill scored a season-high 30 points and the Jazz led wire-to-wire in a 109-100 win over the Pacers on Saturday night. He was seven shy of his career high. ""I think it was significant for him in that I don't think any of us wanted this game to be significant,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder. ""We wanted it to be a game against a very good team that's been playing very well. ""I'm happy that he stayed within himself. You didn't feel like he was trying to do anything because of the fact that this is his previous team. ... This is one of the better games he's played since early in the year. ... We wanted him to be aggressive ... attacking downhill in pick-and-roll and making good reads."" The Jazz relied on the Indiana born-and-bred duo of Hill and Gordon Hayward to defeat their hometown team. The game marked the first time Hill had played the Pacers since being traded from Indiana to Utah over the summer. The three-team deal with the Hawks sent Jeff Teague, who scored 19, from Atlanta to Indiana. Hill was aggressive from the onset and peppered his former team with a variety of dribble-drives, pull-ups and three 3-pointers. Hayward dropped an efficient 27 on 8-for-13 shooting from the field. ""It's fun,"" Hill said. ""You practice with them for five years straight. You create that bond with them, so you kind of know what they're doing and ... what breakdowns are because I've been there so long. ""Just tried to make plays. Wasn't nothing that we did differently. ... It's good anytime you play well. I'm probably my biggest critic when I don't play well. At the end of the day, we've been winning. ... It's fun to be out there with the guys that you've made relationships with for five years, but that had nothing to do with the game today.."" The Pacers opened the fourth quarter with a 10-2 run to cut the Jazz lead to 62-60, but Utah answered with a 12-0 run with every point scored by Hill or Hayward to put the game away. Paul George scored 19 for the Pacers before getting ejected with 6:41 left in the game. Thaddeus Young added 19 points and nine rebounds for Indiana. The Jazz took a 60-50 advantage into halftime that should have been more. Neither team put together a significant run, but the Jazz consistently scored a pair of buckets in a row while the Pacers rarely strung consecutive baskets in a row. The Jazz led by 17 midway through the second quarter, but the Pacers chipped away and cut the lead to 10 thanks to Teague's pull-up 3-pointer just before halftime. ""We knew they were efficient in their offense,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillian said. ""We knew they were physical defensively. ""We didn't have success on this road trip like we wanted we have to back to home and focus on defending home court again."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana is now 6-16 on the road and 16-5 at home. McMillian said they need to outscrap opponents on the road and they haven't done that this season. ... McMillan was ejected after his second technical with 2:10 left in the game. Jazz: Rodney Hood missed his third consecutive game due to a right knee hyperextension and bone bruise. ... Alec Burks came off the bench and scored a season-high 13 points in a season-high 18 minutes. ... Rudy Gobert had his 31st double-double of the season with 19 points and 11 rebounds. HIGH PRAISE Pacers president Larry Bird told the Indy Star that second-year forward Myles Turner has the chance to be ""maybe the best player"" in franchise history in a story that ran Friday. He scored 13 and grabbed seven rebounds. ""It's a great thing to be respected by such a legend in himself,"" Turner said. ""That's obviously one of the goals I have for myself long-term. ...  I appreciate the praise, but I'm not there yet. ""There's no pressure with that. The only pressure I feel is the pressure I put on myself. It's more of a `he's got my back' kind of a thing."" QUOTABLE ""Bad calls, I take credit for two of them, but, come on,"" George said about the foul trouble. ""You tell me that three guys guard me and each ended up with three fouls total. It's crazy, it's nonsense. ""Honestly, ask me about the game. Don't ask me anything about officials right now because they're bad.""","400900080"
"CHICAGO -- Following an embarrassing road loss the previous day, Dwyane Wade felt the Bulls were desperate for a win on Saturday night. ""I like this team when we're desperate,"" he said. ""For some reason, we play better desperate."" Wade had 30 points and two key steals in the final minute, Jimmy Butler added 23 points and Chicago overcame a 42-point performance by DeMarcus Cousins for a 102-99 victory over the Sacramento Kings. Wade, who had 13 points in the fourth quarter, snapped a 99-all tie by making a free throw with 14 seconds left. He had missed a breakaway dunk after making a steal, but Cousins was called for a questionable foul for putting his hand on Wade's hip as he tried to dunk the ball. Cousins was incredulous immediately after the call and turned over four trash cans on his way to the locker room after the game. But by the time the media was allowed in the locker room -- nearly a half hour after the game ended -- his tone was more sarcastic than angry. ""They made the absolute right call,"" he said. ""Incredible job by the referee crew tonight. I don't have a complaint in the world. They should get more recognition on how well they ref these games. They don't get the credit they deserve, so kudos to them. I applaud them."" At that point, Cousins -- who also had 14 rebounds and was 16 for 28 from the field -- clapped his hands several times. Wade acknowledged that the contact by Cousins wasn't the reason he missed the dunk. He said he simply took off too early and came up a little short. ""Hey, sometimes you get a call, sometimes you don't,"" Wade said. ""Personally, I haven't gotten a lot all year, so I'm not gonna apologize for nothing."" Besides, Sacramento still had plenty of time for a potential game-winner at the other end. But Wade came up with another steal and fed Michael Carter-Williams for a breakaway basket to seal the win. Chicago had dropped two straight, including a loss Friday night at Atlanta where coach Fred Hoiberg questioned the team's effort. ""The last couple of minutes, it was a desperate team trying to win a ballgame and doing whatever it takes,"" Wade said. TIP-INS Kings: They have dropped seven straight in Chicago. Sacramento's last win was a 102-98 victory on Dec. 21, 2009 -- a game in which the Kings trailed 79-44 for the largest comeback in franchise history. Bulls: F Doug McDermott appeared to break out of slump with a 31-point effort (in 33 minutes) against Memphis on Jan. 15, but has a combined 12 points on 5-for-18 in the three games since. He had three points on 1-for-5 shooting on Saturday. BOOGIE'S NIGHT The loss and the disputed foul call overshadowed a great game by Cousins, who pumped in back-to-back 3-pointers down the stretch to give the Kings a 97-95 lead with just over two minutes left. ""His play is incredible,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""He just keeps getting better."" Said Wade: ""DeMarcus was giving us everything we could have asked for."" ON THIN ICE Cousins wasn't whistled for a technical foul on Saturday, but has a league-high 14 this season. If he accumulates 16, he will be suspended one game, then one game for every other infraction thereafter. FREE-THROW EDGE In a game where neither team held a double-digit lead, a deciding factor likely was Chicago making 12 more free throws (28 to 16). Wade and Butler were a combined 22 for 25 from the line. Cousins was 8 for 9 from the line.","400900081"
"JaVale McGee and Kevin Durant talk about having to adjust to playing a game at 12 p.m. EST against the Magic. (0:28) ORLANDO, Fla. --  The noon Eastern Standard Time tipoff was more than a little challenging for Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors. At first, anyway. Tied at halftime, the Warriors woke up. Curry and Klay Thompson each finished with seven 3-pointers and the Warriors won their seventh straight game, beating the Orlando Magic 118-98 on Sunday. This was the first Eastern time zone noon tip for the Warriors since 1995, when they lost by 34 points in Orlando. ""It just challenges you mentally,"" Curry said of the early start. ""We were talking about it in the locker room before the game. It is early, but it doesn't matter what time the game is, we have go out and get a win.""

Curry went 7 for 13 on 3s and scored 27 points while Thompson as 7 for 9 from behind the arc and had 21 points. The Warriors shot 19 of 42 overall from 3-point range while the Magic went 7 for 28. After trailing by 11 in the first half and committing a dozen turnovers, the Warriors went into the break even at 50. ""Third quarter was great,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""It seems to be the time when we pick up our defense and it translates into some transition hoops and 3-pointers.""

"DALLAS --  Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks had something to prove on Sunday following two straight tough losses. Coming off a three-point effort in an overtime loss on Friday, Nowitzki scored all 13 of his points in the first half and Dallas gave the Los Angeles Lakers the worst loss in their history, 122-73. ""We didn't show up to play,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""It's embarrassing for us as a team and for us as an organization. The effort just wasn't there tonight, which I don't understand."" The 49-point defeat just edged Los Angeles' two previous worst losses at 48 points, most recently 123-75 at Utah on March 28, 2016. The Mavericks' winning margin was the third-largest in their history. It was Dallas' 13th straight win over the Lakers, who have lost six of their last seven games overall. After a season-best three-game winning streak, the Mavericks had blown a nine-point halftime lead at Miami on Thursday and lost to Utah on Friday. Nowitzki was 1 for 13 against the Jazz, including a missed 3-pointer that would have tied the game in overtime. ""I looked sluggish the other night on that back-to-back,"" Nowitzki said, ""but took a day off yesterday, didn't do anything. Felt a lot better today."" The game was close for 10 minutes, with Dallas leading 23-22 before the Mavericks scored the next 15 points to blow it open. Nowitzki had seven points during the run. He played just 20 minutes. Justin Anderson led seven Mavericks in double figures with a game-high 19 points in 16 minutes, his most playing time since Dec. 27. The Mavericks led 67-33 at the half and never looked back. They both scored their most points and allowed the fewest in a half and a game this season. The 34-point halftime lead was the third-largest in franchise history. The Lakers scored their fewest points in a quarter, a first half and a game. ""What's deflating is that we didn't guard anybody tonight,"" Lakers forward Julius Randle said. Lou Williams led the Lakers with 15 points. Dallas' Seth Curry scored 14 points, including seven straight in the first quarter. Wesley Matthews and Deron Williams also had 13 points. Devin Harris and Pierre Jackson scored 10 each. Rookies Jackson and Nicolas Brussino (eight points) each reached career highs. TIP-INS Lakers: They played without D'Angelo Russell, second on the team at 14.3 points per game. An MRI taken Saturday showed a mildly sprained right MCL and strained right calf. That left the Lakers with rookie Brandon Ingram starting at point guard, and they had a season-low 10 assists. ... Larry Nance Jr. (bone bruise, left knee) returned after missing 16 games and scored four points. Mavericks: Dallas' record winning margin was 123-70 win at home over the 76ers on Nov. 13, 2014. They beat the Knicks 128-78 in New York on Jan. 24, 2010. ... J.J. Barea missed his 26th game this season because of a strained left calf aggravated on Friday. Coach Rick Carlisle said he didn't expect Barea back until after the All-Star break (Feb. 24 at the earliest). Andrew Bogut (strained right hamstring) could return this week, according to Carlisle.

"TORONTO --  Following a career-high 40-point game, Phoenix Suns guard Eric Bledsoe begrudgingly conceded he might be playing the best basketball of his career. ""I guess, I guess. I'm just trying to win, man,"" he said after leading the Suns to a 115-103 win over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday night. Bledsoe added 13 assists and six rebounds and Phoenix gave Toronto its third straight loss. The Suns trailed from the 2:13 mark of the second quarter until tying it at 95 with 7:29 to play. After DeMarre Carroll and Bledsoe exchanged baskets, Phoenix went on an 18-6 run to take the game away from the Raptors. It was the second road win in two nights for the Suns, who had to come from behind late to beat New York on Saturday. Devin Booker added 20 points and the Suns completed a season sweep of the Raptors for the first time since 2013-14 and improved Phoenix to 11-6 against Eastern Conference teams this season. After going through a number of injuries and absences earlier in the season, particularly to starters T.J. Warren and Tyson Chandler, Phoenix coach Earl Watson said things are starting to come together for his young team, the fourth-youngest in the NBA as of opening night. ""I wish I could tell you that we've really changed a lot of things, but we didn't,"" he said. ""We just stayed with what we know works -- transparency, accountability, tough love but unconditional love and the guys, it's all about them, so give them all the credit."" Toronto coach Dwane Casey was less than impressed with his team's effort. ""When your shots aren't falling, you have to make it up on the defensive end, and we did not do that tonight,"" he said. ""We let our offensive woes go to the defensive end, not get stops, crucial stops, get the ball under control."" Chief among the wayward shooters was Kyle Lowry, who had 15 points but shot just 1 of 9 from beyond the arc. Lowry capped his night by getting ejected for a flagrant-two foul following contact with the head of Brandon Knight with 1:30 to go. ""Honestly I thought he was going to go for a floater, I swiped across and hit his head,"" Lowry said. ""He took another dribble. I'm not a dirty player and I already sent a text to him to apologize."" DeMar DeRozan led the way for Toronto with 22 points, but was forced to leave the game with 1:30 to play after rolling his ankle landing on a teammate's foot. TIP-INS Suns: One night after setting the mark, Chandler ended his franchise record and career high of consecutive 15-plus rebound games at seven with nine rebounds on the night. ... F Dragan Bender left with 9:03 remaining in the second quarter with a sore right ankle and did not return. Raptors: F Patrick Patterson (left knee) missed his sixth consecutive game. ... The Raptors got double-digit points from all five of their starting players. HOME AT LAST Toronto's prized free agent signing Jared Sullinger played his first home game for the Raptors on Sunday night. After missing the first 41 games of the season following left foot surgery, the forward made his debut in Friday's loss in Charlotte before entering the fray Sunday with 3:56 to play in the first. He played 13 minutes and had nine points. DRAWING LEVEL With 22 points Sunday, DeRozan tied Chris Bosh for second in franchise history with 265 games with at least 20 points. Vince Carter leads the way with 273 such games.","400900084"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- Karl-Anthony Towns and Nikola Jokic represent the big men of the new millennium -- versatile, do-everything combo guards in the bodies of centers who are giving their downtrodden franchises hope that better days are right around the corner. Towns has gotten the better of the one-on-one matchup against Jokic in all three games against Denver this season. On Sunday, he finally got a win, too. Towns had 32 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists and hit the go-ahead shot with 42.5 seconds left to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 111-108 victory over the Nuggets. Towns hit 13 of 19 shots and also had four blocks and Andrew Wiggins scored 24 points in Minnesota's fourth straight home win. Shabazz Muhammad scored 20 points off the bench and the Wolves rallied from nine points down midway through the fourth quarter for the win. ""He's playing out of his mind right now,"" Wiggins said of Towns. ""He's doing it all. Rebounding, scoring, defending, everything. There's nothing he's not doing right now."" Gary Harris scored 22 points and Jokic had 18 points and eight rebounds for the Nuggets on the second night of a back-to-back. Wilson Chandler and Jamal Murray added 17 points each for Denver, which played without Emmanuel Mudiay because of a sore back. Kris Dunn had 10 points and nine assists for the Wolves while starting for Ricky Rubio, who missed the game to attend his grandmother's funeral. The Wolves were down 100-91 midway through the fourth quarter when Towns and Muhammad keyed a 12-2 run. Muhammad finished the spurt with a layup for a 103-102 lead, Wiggins hit a 3-pointer and Towns knocked down a jumper from the baseline to put the Wolves up for good in a thriller. ""At the end of the game when the ball touched my hands, I knew I wanted that shot,"" said Towns, who hit a similar jumper to help the Wolves beat the Clippers on Thursday. TIP-INS Nuggets: Danilo Gallinari had 14 points and six rebounds. ... Mudiay stayed home in Denver to get treatment for his back. The hope is that it is a short-term injury. Timberwolves: Gorgui Dieng was limited to six minutes in the first half after picking up three quick fouls in the first quarter. ... Rubio is expected to rejoin the team on Monday. ... Towns became the second player in franchise history to have consecutive games with at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. Kevin Garnett did it five times. SHABAZZ SHINES Muhammad made 9 of 14 shots, including two 3s and hustled on defense as well, giving the Wolves some much-needed production off the bench. Zach LaVine had another quiet night as he works his way back from a hip injury, but Muhammad picked up the scoring slack. He reached double figures for the fourth time in seven games and played all 12 minutes in the fourth. ARTHUR'S EDGE Nuggets forward Darrell Arthur had 10 points and three blocks in 21 minutes and had a huge defensive flurry early in the fourth quarter. He blocked shots by Towns and Wiggins and forced a travel by Towns during a 9-0 run that put Denver in front. He was listed as questionable with a sore left knee, and Malone said a minutes restriction prevented Arthur from finishing the game. ""Every minute Darrell was on the floor, he fought,"" Malone said. ""He made Towns work."" POINT MURRAY Mudiay's absence meant the rookie Murray moved from shooting guard to point guard with the second unit. He was a team-best plus-13 for the game and said he felt comfortable playing there despite his reputation as a scorer. ""I finally got a good home,"" Murray said. ""I love playing the point, my natural position.""","400900085"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- John Wall firmly believes the Washington Wizards are a good team with plenty of playoff potential. The key, he said, ""is we just got to believe it every time we step on the court."" Wall had 24 points and seven assists, and the Wizards looked plenty confident as they continued their run up the Eastern Conference standings with a 109-99 win against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night. Markieff Morris added 23 points and eight rebounds as Washington won for the fifth time in six games. ""It was a big game for us,"" Wall said. ""We are playing defense and moving the ball. We're improving. We're improving a lot of ways. "" Otto Porter Jr. was active all night with 14 points and 13 rebounds for his seventh double-double of the season. Bradley Beal made four 3-pointers on his way to 18 points, helping the Wizards shoot 54 percent from the field while the Hornets struggled to stop the pick and roll. Washington also held Charlotte to 39 percent shooting. The Hornets had won nine of their last 10 home games, but the Wizards jumped on them early. Washington (24-20) shot 57 percent from the field in the first half and led 60-48 at the break. Charlotte (23-22) pulled within five early in the fourth quarter, but the Wizards responded with an 11-0 run capped by a steal and breakaway jam by Kelly Oubre Jr. ""We waited way too long to really pick things up tonight,"" Hornets guard Kemba Walker said. ""The game was over when we really tried our hardest and you know it can't be that way. We kind of reverted back to the way that we've been playing, playing in spurts, making a lot of mistakes that we haven't made in the last three games before tonight. It hurt us tonight."" TIP-INS Wizards: The Wizards have won their last three against the Hornets, including both games this season. ... Improved to 12-2 when shooting better than 50 percent from the field. ... Wall registered his 25th 20-point game of the season. Hornets: Walker picked up a technical foul in the second quarter for arguing a call after a frustrating start in which he opened the game shooting 1 of 9 from the field. ... Outscored Wizards 40-22 in bench points. ... Walker has now made 1,515 free throws as a Hornet, passing Larry Johnson for second all-time. NOT PHYSICAL ENOUGH For the second time this season, Hornets coach Steve Clifford expressed frustration over his team's lack of physicality against the Wizards. ""It was the biggest part of the game,"" Clifford said. ""We've got to regroup."" DEFENDING KEMBA Walker had 21 points for the Hornets, but only made 7 of 24 shots from the field. Wall and the Wizards big men kept him bottled up most of the night. ""He's having an All-Star year,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""I thought John and our bigs did a good job of making him miss shots. He missed a couple of looks that he probably would make. He's as hard to guard as anybody in this league and he's playing very well."" Added Wall: ""He got some good looks but our bigs did a good job in the pick and rolls of challenging him. BEAL STEPS UP Beal, who was drafted third overall in the 2012 NBA draft, one spot behind Charlotte's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, has struggled shooting the ball of late. He was just 6 of 16 overall against Charlotte, but Brooks said his teammates haven't lost confidence in him as a scorer. ""You're going to go through stretches of the season where you're not going to shoot the ball well,"" Brooks said. ""It helps when you have teammates that are going to continue to believe in him and believe in each other. Sometimes it takes a shot to change your mojo.""","400900086"
"NEW YORK -- With star forward Kawhi Leonard and three other regulars out, the Spurs' lineup was different. The expectations from their coach never are. Patty Mills scored 20 points, LaMarcus Aldridge had 16 and San Antonio rolled to a 112-86 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Monday night. Pau Gasol (broken bone, left hand) and Tony Parker (sore left foot) didn't even make the road trip, while Manu Ginobili was scheduled for a night off but couldn't have played anyway because of back spasms. Then Leonard, the Western Conference player of the week, was scratched. Without them, the Spurs put seven players in double figures and turned the game into a blowout with a 39-point third quarter. They improved to 19-4 on the road. ""Everyone gets excited to be able to get the chance to get out there and play, but nothing changes,"" Mills said. ""The game plan's still the same, what's expected of us is the same, so it's just that opportunity. But there is that excitement when we do it the right way, play the right way, share the ball and everyone does their little piece."" The Spurs announced Leonard was resting, though coach Gregg Popovich said the All-Star forward had a sore left hand, which was wrapped after Leonard was hit while scoring a career-high 41 points in an overtime victory at Cleveland on Saturday. ""Our depth is one of our strengths and everybody's ready to play, and of course Pop makes it very clear what he expects out of us out there, whether it's the first-team guys or the role players doing that,"" said David Lee, who had 15 points off the bench. Isaiah Whitehead scored 19 points for the Nets, who got more bad news before the game when they announced Jeremy Lin will be sidelined another three to five weeks after aggravating his strained left hamstring. They have lost eight straight at home. ""For whatever reason we didn't come out with the energy and that's one thing that our team I will say usually brings,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Tonight we didn't bring it. I am disappointed. I am disappointed for the fans."" TIP-INS Spurs: With Gasol out, the Spurs signed veteran center Joel Anthony to a 10-day contract. The two-time NBA champion with the Miami Heat was with the Spurs in preseason but Popovich said they had too many players and no room for him. ... The Spurs have scored 100 or more points in 21 straight games, their longest streak since 22 in a row in 1995. Nets: Brooklyn gave guard Caris LeVert the night off. LeVert had foot problems in college that delayed the start of his rookie season, but Atkinson said LeVert was just getting a night of rest and wasn't hurt. ... The Nets have lost the last four meetings. POP THE POLITICIAN Popovich chided himself for sounding like a politician when he said Leonard would be out for ""an injury that's not really an injury."" ""That's an ignorant statement, wasn't it?"" Popovich said, joking that ""I shouldn't have done that. But it wasn't a lie."" TRADE TALK Nets general manager Sean Marks said Lin's injury wouldn't influence whether he felt any urgency to trade center Brook Lopez, whose name is mentioned annually in trade rumors, before he could get hurt and ruin any chance of a deal. ""If things come up that make sense for us to move on, and that's got nothing to do with Brook, that's got to do with anybody, then we'll take a look at it,"" said Marks, a former Spurs player and assistant GM. ""If not, we won't just jump the gun because of this, no.""","400900087"
"ATLANTA --  Jamal Crawford felt he was ready to break out of his shooting slump. A little advice from Dominique Wilkins helped, too. Crawford scored eight of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Atlanta Hawks 115-105 on Monday night. Los Angeles also went 14 for 24 from 3-point range while improving to 1-1 on a five-game trip. Austin Rivers scored 27 points, and J.J. Redick had 17. Crawford's final basket was a successful drive after Atlanta cut the Clippers' lead from 24 to five points. Crawford had made only 7 of 41 shots in his last four games, and his shooting woes were the subject of a pregame question to coach Doc Rivers just as the guard walked by. Rivers shifted the question to Crawford, who had a quick answer. ""Let's change that narrative tonight,"" Crawford said. Crawford, who played for the Hawks from 2009-11, followed through with the plan, making 9 of 20 shots. He said he spoke before the game with Wilkins, a Hall of Famer who works as a TV analyst with the Hawks, and he offered him encouragement to keep shooting. ""It really hit home,"" Crawford said. Rivers said Crawford's chat with Wilkins could lead in only one direction. ""I think once I saw him talking to Dominique I said, `He's going to shoot tonight!"" said Rivers, who played with Wilkins with the Hawks. Crawford's big game helped the Clippers take a 38-13 advantage in bench scoring. Kent Bazemore led the Hawks with 25 points. Dennis Schroder had 21, and Dwight Howard added 16 points and 12 rebounds. Austin Rivers' 3-pointer with 54 seconds remaining helped seal the win. Rivers made 5 of 10 3s. The Clippers led 69-45 before Atlanta finally gained momentum late in the third period. Back-to-back three-point plays by Howard cut the lead to 79-71. The Hawks kept the deficit under 10 points much of the final period. TIP-INS Clippers: Raymond Felton had 14 points. ... Austin Rivers sat on the court holding his ankle following a missed layup and then left the game, heading straight to the locker room, with 1:58 remaining in the first half. He returned to start the second half. Hawks: The Hawks took only their third loss in their last 14 games. ... Falcons players Brian Poole and Taylor Gabriel drew cheers when shown on the videoboard, one day after Atlanta beat Green Bay in the NFC championship game. ... The Hawks fell to 22-6 when scoring at least 100 points. ... Bazemore tied his season scoring high. MAGIC NUMBER The Clippers made exactly half of their shots from the field -- 42 of 84. They are 17-0 when shooting at least 50 percent. MILLSAP BLOODIED Atlanta's Paul Millsap had 19 points and seven assists. After the Hawks cut the deficit to five points, he had to leave the game with a cut on his elbow. ""It's tough losing the best player on your team,"" Schroder said. Millsap said the real key was Atlanta lacked ""a sense of urgency"" in the first half. MISSING STARS The Clippers improved to 3-7 while playing without stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul. Griffin, who had arthroscopic right knee surgery on Dec. 20, warmed up before the game and Doc Rivers said he ""most likely"" will play Tuesday night at Philadelphia. Paul is expected to miss six to eight weeks after tearing a ligament in his left thumb on Jan 16. ""When a team is without their stars, they're going to move the ball and try to play the right way,"" Millsap said. ""They did that. I think we maybe took a little bit for granted.""","400900088"
"Dion Waiters drains a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the fourth quarter leaving the Warriors just 0.6 seconds on the clock. The Warriors aren't able to convert giving the Heat a 105-102 win. (0:55) MIAMI --  Dion Waiters went from air ball to game-winner. Waiters made a 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds left to cap his 33-point effort, and the Miami Heat beat Golden State 105-102 on Monday night to end the Warriors' seven-game winning streak. It was the second straight game in which Waiters tied his career high, and this one came after a frantic final few minutes in which the Heat blew a 10-point lead -- with a Waiters air ball of a 15-footer as part of that collapse. But he more than atoned with his last shot of the night, sending Miami to its biggest surprise of the season. ""He's not scared. He's not afraid,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He's fearless. He wants those moments as much as anybody."" Kevin Durant tied the game on a dunk with 11.7 seconds left. With no timeouts, Waiters walked the ball up the court, made a couple moves on Klay Thompson, and then connected from straightaway. ""I knew it was good,"" Waiters said. ""He let me get to my shot."" Goran Dragic scored 19 points for Miami (15-30), which finished a 4-0 homestand. Luke Babbitt added 11, and Hassan Whiteside had 10 points and 15 rebounds. Durant scored 27, Thompson had 22 and Stephen Curry added 21 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists for the Warriors (38-7). Curry missed a corner jumper as time expired, though referee Brian Forte signaled his attempt was a two-point try anyway. ""We get everybody's best shot,"" said Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who even with the loss clinched the right to coach the Western Conference in next month's All-Star Game. ""Miami played great."" Waiters shot 13 for 20 from the floor, 6 for 8 from 3-point range. ""Those are tough shots that Dion made,"" Curry said. ""He obviously played well, but we didn't do anything to help ourselves."" Miami was up 98-88 before the Warriors started rallying. Curry made a pair of free throws, Thompson hit a 3-pointer and Durant added another 3 as Golden State ran off eight straight points. Waiters answered with a 3 for the Heat, but Durant and Shaun Livingston both scored at the rim in the final minute as the Warriors closed to 101-100 with 21.4 seconds left. Dragic made one of two free throws, and the Warriors set up a play where Durant went baseline for the tying score. But Waiters had the last make of the night. ""It's good to see guys in the locker room feel good about beating a great basketball team,"" Spoelstra said. TIP-INS Warriors: Andre Iguodala (rest) got the night off. ... Monday was the second anniversary of Thompson's NBA-record 37-point quarter against Sacramento. ... Livingston has now played more games in Miami as a member of the Warriors (three) than he did as a member of the Heat (two) Heat: Miami was 13 for 30 from 3-point range, and survived on a night where it shot 16 for 27 from the line. ... Okaro White became the 232nd player to score in a Heat uniform, getting his first points on a putback in the second quarter. CURRY HONORS Curry will have a busy Tuesday in his native North Carolina. First, his old number will be retired at Charlotte Christian High. And after that, the student section at Davidson's Belk Arena will be named in his honor at halftime of the game there against Duquesne. JOHNSON OUT Heat guard Tyler Johnson missed his second straight game with a left shoulder strain. It's unclear if he'll accompany Miami when the team flies to New York on Tuesday. Johnson has 14 consecutive double-digit scoring efforts off the Miami bench, the second-longest such streak in franchise history.","400900089"
"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. --  With Rudy Gay out for the season, the Sacramento Kings are in for quite a challenge on this eight-game road trip. ""Everybody has to step their game up,"" backup guard Ty Lawson said. ""Everybody has been working hard, and now that Rudy went down, we can show what they've been working on."" Lawson scored 19 points and helped turn the game around with a second-quarter flurry, and the Kings snapped a five-game losing streak with a 109-104 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night. DeMarcus Cousins had 22 points and 14 rebounds, but Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy credited the Sacramento backcourt. ""(Cousins is) a great player. He didn't have a great night,"" Van Gundy said. ""I thought their guards really hurt us even more than he did."" Lawson scored nine points in the second, and the Kings outscored the Pistons 37-24 in the quarter to take a 65-62 lead into halftime. A 3-pointer by Lawson put Sacramento up 101-90 in the fourth, and the Kings held on from there to stop Detroit's three-game winning streak. Andre Drummond had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Pistons. The Kings lost Gay on Wednesday to a ruptured left Achilles tendon. Then they set off on this eight-game trip. Detroit was game No. 3. Sacramento has won only two of its last 10 games, and both victories were against the Pistons . ""Stan probably doesn't like me too much,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""It's a crazy deal how it works. I like their team a lot and think he does a great job."" Detroit jumped out to an early 11-point lead and led 38-28 after one quarter, but the Pistons were outplayed after that. Lawson scored seven points in a span of 38 seconds early in the second. ""I'm getting the ball, pushing it and seeing what happens,"" Lawson said. ""It's just being aggressive, trying to get to the basket. I hit my first couple shots, everybody started collapsing, and then we started finding open shots from 3."" Detroit began the second quarter with a lineup of five backups -- Tobias Harris, Aron Baynes, Ish Smith, Stanley Johnson and Reggie Bullock. That group was outscored 16-6 in the first 3:06. MARQUEE MATCHUP Cousins got the best of Drummond in a matchup of two of the game's top big men. Both had double-doubles. Drummond leads the NBA with 209 double-doubles since he entered the league in 2012-13. Cousins is second in that span with 206. ""He is a do-it-all guy,"" Drummond said. ""He moves the ball around. He is able to shoot it from the 3 and he is great attacking the basket as well."" TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento had 17 second-chance points. The Pistons came in allowing only 9.4 per game. ... Sacramento's bench outscored Detroit's 52-30. Pistons: Detroit G Kentavious Caldwell-Pope returned after missing four games with a left rotator cuff injury. He scored 14 points but went only 4 of 14 from the field. ... F Jon Leuer scored 15 points on 6-of-6 shooting in the first quarter. He didn't score again. BETTER OFF DRIVING? Sacramento's previous game was Saturday at Chicago, but what figured to be a simple trip to the Detroit area Sunday turned into a bit of a mess. A team spokesman said the Kings' flight was delayed and they were on the plane for about seven hours.","400900090"
"MILWAUKEE --  Relegated to a reserve role in his previous game for breaking a team rule, Jabari Parker came out in ""attack mode"" against the Houston Rockets. His play inspired teammate Giannis Antetokounmpo. Antetokounmpo had 31 points, Parker scored 20 of his 28 in the first half and the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a five-game losing streak Monday night with a 127-114 victory over the Rockets. ""I see my teammate, my brother on the court, my guy, be in attack mode, and I'm like, yeah, this is the night, I've got to be in attack mode, too. We've got to get this one,"" Antetokounmpo said. James Harden just missed a triple-double with 26 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, but committed 11 of Houston's 22 turnovers. Patrick Beverley added 18 points for the Rockets, who fell to 1-1 on their five-game road trip. Milwaukee made 59 percent of its shots, including 11 of 23 from 3-point range. ""We had a really good game last game (at Memphis) defensively, and this game we just let up,"" Harden said. ""In order to get where we want to go, we have to be consistent on that end of the floor."" Antetokounmpo made 11 of 17 shots and scored nine points in the final 4:16. Houston got no closer than six points in the final three minutes. Parker was back in the starting lineup one game after coming off the bench while being disciplined for talking to the media about a players-only team meeting Friday night. ""This win really puts us in the right direction, the right mind frame,"" Parker said. ""Hopefully, we can use this as energy toward the next one."" Jason Terry's 17-foot jumper sparked an 11-0 run that gave Milwaukee the lead for good, 101-99. The Bucks extended the margin to 110-99 when Tony Snell hit a 3-pointer with 6:48 left. Terry had two steals during the spurt and Houston committed four turnovers. ""We just turned the ball over a little bit carelessly, and they answered on the other end with it,"" Houston's Ryan Anderson said. Greg Monroe added 17 points and 10 rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench for Milwaukee, which lost 111-92 at Houston last Wednesday. Nene had 17 points, and Clint Capela and Anderson scored 16 apiece for Houston. The Rockets scored nine consecutive points to take a 78-77 lead on Capela's dunk with 8:03 left in the third quarter. Milwaukee guard Matthew Dellavedova had 10 points in the quarter, though, and the Bucks led 93-91 heading into the fourth. The Bucks made 14 of 18 shots in the second period to open a 68-64 lead at halftime. Milwaukee shot 68 percent (28 for 41) in the first half. Milwaukee's 68 points before halftime were the most the Rockets have allowed this season, frustrating coach Mike D'Antoni. Parker made eight of 12 shots and had six rebounds and five assists in the first half. ""He's a handful and once he gets started, it's hard to turn him off,"" D'Antoni said. LINEUP INTACT With Anderson returning from the flu and Capela regaining his starting role, the Rockets used their preferred starting lineup for the first time since Dec. 17 when Capela went out with a broken leg. The lineup of Capela, Anderson, Beverley, Harden and Trevor Ariza went 15-2 through Dec. 17. DEFENDING HARDEN Parker said the Bucks wanted to keep the ball out of Harden's hands as much as possible. ""When the ball is in his hands the majority of the time, it's usually going in the right direction (for Houston),"" he said. ""His assist-to-turnover ratio is very good and he scores 30 points a game. We just try to limit him and make it as tough as possible."" TIP-INS Rockets: Harden didn't attempt a shot until he was fouled while taking a 3-pointer with 53 seconds left in the first quarter. He made his first five shots and didn't miss until there was 6:21 left in the third. ... Sam Dekker, who scored 30 points in his first NBA start Saturday night, came off the bench and had four points in 17 minutes. Bucks: Milwaukee scored the first 14 points of the second quarter, opening a 47-33 lead on Monroe's hook with 8:11 left. ... John Henson, who had started 34 consecutive games at center, was replaced by Miles Plumlee and didn't play.","400900091"
"NEW ORLEANS -- LeBron James stroked his beard as he sat in his locker and tried to make sense of Cleveland's recent slide. Losses to powerhouses like Golden State and San Antonio were a little easier to shake off. But Monday night's result with New Orleans All-Star Anthony Davis in street clothes was tougher to take. ""We're not very good right now,"" James said. ""A lot of it is energy and effort."" Terrence Jones filled in brilliantly for the injured Davis, tying a career high with 36 points, grabbing 11 rebounds and blocking James' dunk attempt late in the fourth quarter, and the Pelicans held on for a 124-122 victory against the late-charging Cavs. ""I just wanted help my team get a win and I think that's what I did,"" Jones said. Jrue Holiday added 33 points and 10 assists for the Pelicans, and Langston Galloway capped a 12-point night with a clean steal on James' drive in the final minute, preventing the Cavs from erasing a deficit they had trimmed from 22 late in the first half to three with 1:32 left in the game. Kyrie Irving scored 35 of his 49 points in the second half, mixing decisive jump shots with dazzling drives, but Cleveland fell to its fifth loss in seven games. James had 26 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds, and Kevin Love scored 22 points for the Cavaliers, who could not quite keep pace with a Pelicans squad that tied a season high for 3-pointers with 16 and shot 49.4 percent (43 of 87). ""They definitely beat us to the punch,"" Irving said. ""You've got to give them credit. They came out and Terrence Jones and Jrue did an unbelievable job attacking the paint, getting other guys involved and other guys made big shots."" ""For us, we have a few things that we've got to correct, especially our interior defense,"" Irving added. ""Going forward, we'll be all right."" Donatas Moteijunas had 14 points for New Orleans, while Dante Cunningham scored 11. Each hit a pair of 3s. The Cavs drained 15 3s, eight by Irving, whose step-back jumper from long range had Cleveland within three with 21 seconds to go, but the Cavs got no closer until Love's anticlimactic 3 in the final second. REDEMPTION Embarrassed by a 29-point loss to NBA-worst Brooklyn at home on Friday, the Pelicans were eager for a chance to redeem themselves with a competitive showing against an elite team. That did not appear likely when New Orleans announced less than an hour before tip-off that Davis would be unable to play because of a lingering right leg bruise. Coach Alvin Gentry inserted Jones for Davis as the starting center, and he responded with arguably the most dynamic half of play in the fifth-year veteran's career. He hit all eight of his shots in the first half, scoring 22 points on an array of jumpers -- including two 3s -- weaving drives and feisty put-backs. Holiday got into an equally prolific rhythm, hitting three first-half 3s and highlighting several impressive drives to the hoop with a two-handed dunk. Holiday's pullup jumper from just inside the 3-point line with 6 seconds left in the second quarter gave him 22 points and New Orleans a 70-48 lead, and Holiday pumped his fist while one of the biggest crowds of the season went wild. ""We wanted to come out here as a team and just prove that we had a lot of fight in us,"" Jones said. ""We wanted to come out here without Anthony and just put on a great effort for the fans and ourselves."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Coach Tyronn Lue was assessed a technical foul by official Leroy Richardson after the coach chastised Richardson for a late whistle giving Moteijunas free throws following a missed layup. ... The Cavs won the teams' only other meeting this season, 90-82 in Cleveland on Jan. 2. ... Irving slung in what would have been a sensational, off-balance, one-handed shot from about 30 feet, but it didn't count because it came too late after Irving was fouled by Tyreke Evans as the pair pursued a loose ball near mid-court. Pelicans: New Orleans improved to 2-2 without Davis in the lineup. ... G E'Twaun Moore, who is 6-foot-4, delighted the crowd by rejecting the 6-8 James near the basket in the first half. ...

"INDIANAPOLIS -- Carmelo Anthony rescued the Knicks in the nick of time Monday night. After watching his teammates relinquish a 17-point lead over the final 17 minutes, New York's star forward finally took matters into his own hands. With the score tied at 103 and 23.4 seconds left, Anthony beat a switch and knocked down a 14-foot baseline jumper to help the Knicks hold on for a rare victory at Indiana, 109-103 over the Pacers. ""I don't even want to think about that -- if this one got away,"" Anthony said after scoring 26 points and grabbing five rebounds. ""This is the time where we have to come together as a group and lock in and figure this thing out."" This time, they finally got it right. The win ended a two-game skid overall and a nine-game regular-season losing streak at Indiana, where the Knicks last won on March 17, 2012. And after his team was 6-7 in games decided by four or fewer points, Anthony made sure New York came out on top this time. Yes, an overly aggressive Anthony drew a foul that sent his Olympic teammate, Paul George, to the free throw line with a chance to tie the score at 103 with 42 seconds to go. The league's top free throw shooter didn't miss. But after the Knicks called a timeout, Derrick Rose found Anthony in the perfect spot and he took care of the rest. Rose finished with 20 points and six assists. ""It was devastating -- what, three, four losses were like this? Five or six games like this?"" Rose said. ""All of them are devastating. This one would have been another one on the list. Like I said, it makes you a better team."" For a while, it looked as though the Knicks would coast. After falling into a 14-point hole, they charged back with a 40-point second quarter to take a 62-58 halftime lead and extended the margin to 84-67 with 4:58 left in the third quarter. George, who had 31 points and seven rebounds, and Myles Turner, who had 22 and 10, quickly led the Pacers back. They cut the deficit to 86-75 after three, got within 100-99 on Turner's acrobatic dunk off a rebound and finally tied the score on George's free throws. But Anthony answered with his clutch basket, Turner dropped a pass that rolled out of bounds and the Pacers didn't score again. ""The second quarter was a huge quarter,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""When you play like that, you've got to make plays down the stretch."" TIP-INS Knicks: Courtney Lee and Willy Hernangomez each had 14 points. Justin Holiday finished with 13. ... Injured forward Lance Thomas (fractured left orbit) has rejoined the team and been fitted for a new mask but is not yet ready to play, coach Jeff Hornacek said. ... New York shot 22 free throws in the first half and finished 31 of 35 from the line. Pacers: Have lost three straight. ... C.J. Miles replaced Glenn Robinson III in the starting lineup and scored 10 points but missed a 3-pointer from the corner in the closing seconds. ... Indiana was outscored 18-3 on fast-break points. ... Indiana has lost four games this season after leading by double digits. GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY While George received his Olympic ring from USA Basketball before the game, he was not the only gold medalist in the building. Dream Team member Larry Bird took his usual seat in the corner near the Pacers bench. Former Pacers star and 1996 gold medalist Reggie Miller sat at the broadcast table. Anthony, of course, was on the court with George, and in the stands was outspoken Indiana University swimmer Lilly King. Miller had a photo taken with King before the game and told reporters he became a big fan of King's because of her brash talk in Rio.","400900093"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Russell Westbrook sure looked like an All-Star starter. Westbrook hit a pull-up jumper with 1.4 seconds left, and the Oklahoma City Thunder stopped Utah's six-game win streak with a 97-95 victory over the Jazz on Monday night. ""I didn't want to take the shot too early,"" Westbrook said. ""I was open early, but kind of waited. I wanted to knock some time off the clock. ""Coach made the decision to bring it up the floor and that was good for us. Got the shot I wanted."" Westbrook lost out to Stephen Curry and James Harden in the race for the starting guards for the Western Conference for the Feb. 19 game in New Orleans. In his first game since the All-Star lineups were announced on Thursday, it was business as usual. Westbrook took over down the stretch and scored 11 of the Thunder's final 13 points after going cold in the third quarter. He finished with 38 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for his 22nd triple-double of the season and No. 59 for his career, tying Larry Bird for fifth on the career list. ""I don't think he even made a shot in the third quarter,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""He was doing other things. I thought that he gave great effort defensively. ""No one is going to stay hot an entire game like he was. I give him a lot of credit for just having a great level of belief and trust in himself and confidence and belief in the way he plays."" Alec Burks missed the final shot for the Jazz as time expired. Victor Oladipo scored 18 for Oklahoma City. Gordon Hayward led Utah with 17 points. The Thunder took a 56-53 lead into halftime after Westbrook dominated the second. The dynamic point guard scored 14 in the quarter to give him 22 at the break. ""He's gonna have makes and misses,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""It's tough to take everything away from him. You're up and he's at the rim. Too far back and he's shooting a 3. There was a couple times maybe we could have contested a little better, but that's easier said than done."" TIP-INS Thunder: C Steven Adams returned from a two-game absence due to a concussion. ... Reserve Enes Kanter scored 14 against his former team. ... The Thunder are 2 1/2 games behind the Jazz for the fifth spot in the West. ... Rudy Gobert was one rebound shy of his 31st consecutive 10-plus rebound game. Jazz: Hall of Fame coach Jerry Sloan sat with his Hall of Fame point guard John Stockton during the game. ... Utah is in the midst of a six-games-in-nine-days stretch and Snyder thought his team looked drained Monday. ... The Jazz led by as many as nine in the fourth quarter. ... Rudy Gobert was one rebound shy of his 31st consecutive 10-plus rebound game. STAYING PUT The Jazz announced Monday that ownership of the team and Vivint SmartHome Arena has been transferred from Gail Miller to a legacy trust in a move that ensures the team will remain in the family for generations. Miller said the primary reason for the transfer is to make sure the team stays in the state. HOOD UPDATE Rodney Hood missed his fourth consecutive game with a right knee hyperextension and bone bruise. ""The original timeline was two to four weeks and, as far as I know, he's on track with that,"" Snyder said. ""He's been in getting treatment and starting to do some work on the court. They're doing all the different measurements and balance tests and all those things. ""He's making good progress. But I don't know if that means we're going to see him later this week or next week. There's another phase there to clear him for some more competitive stuff ... and see how he's feeling. But right now he's feeling good.""","400900094"
"TORONTO --  Down a trio of stars on Tuesday night, many NBA teams would struggle to get the job done. Not the San Antonio Spurs. Without Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker and Pau Gasol, the Spurs beat the Toronto Raptors 108-106 for their fifth straight victory. ""One thing about being here is it's more about the system,"" said LaMarcus Aldridge. ""They've been good over the years of plugging guys into the system. . We try to have players here who we can plug in and get the job done."" Aldridge led the Spurs with 21 points, while Patty Mills added 18 and fellow reserve Davis Bertans chipped in with 12. The Spurs improved to 36-9, their third-best record through 45 games, behind only the 38-7 records of the 2010-11 and 2015-16 squads. On top of that, they improved to 20-4 on the road, the eighth team in NBA history to win 20 of their first 24 games, according to NBA Stats. ""There's a couple times we've had some guys out and in the past we've always had a next-man-up mentality and guys always performed and got it done,"" said Danny Green. ""I think we're just now getting that chemistry, guys are getting confident and starting to pick up that slack."" In a back-and-forth fourth quarter that saw eight lead changes -- after just two in the preceding 36 minutes -- the Spurs finally took control on a floating jump shot from rookie Dejounte Murray with 1:29 to play. Terrence Ross shot an airball on a 3-pointer on the Raptors' next possession, and after four consecutive scoreless possessions between the teams, Aldridge had a chance to establish a four-point lead with 11.3 seconds left on a pair of free throws, but he missed his second shot. Norman Powell cut the lead to one with a dunk with 6.2 seconds remaining, and after Aldridge split another pair of free throws with 5.1 seconds to go, Powell missed a 3-pointer as time expired. ""Down the stretch, very honestly, it just went away,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""We didn't do anything special to deserve it other than playing hard just like they did, so we're thrilled with the win."" The mood around the Raptors' locker room was somewhat less jubilant after they lost four in a row for the first time since March 4-10, 2015. With Eastern Conference All-Star starter DeMar DeRozan sidelined with a sprained ankle, Kyle Lowry had 30 points and Ross added 21 off the bench. After falling behind by as many as 13 points, Toronto didn't take its first lead of the game until 1:19 to go in the third quarter, and ultimately fell just short in the see-saw fourth. ""I was really proud of the way they played,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""It comes back to the will thing. It's not the 3-point shots or the fancy plays, it's the fundamentals: box out, free throws, layups tonight in the second half."" Despite registering his fifth 30-point game of the season, and putting in a game-high 41:45 of court time, ultimately Lowry chose to place the blame on himself for his team's current woes. ""I'm just going out there, do whatever my job is, and right now it's to go out there and try and win games, and unfortunately I'm not doing a good job of that right now,"" he said. ""Got to figure it out, got it figure it out no matter what."" TIP-INS Spurs: Leonard (left hand) and F Jonathon Simmons (right wrist) sat out. ... Green tied his season high with four blocked shots. He had four against Boston on Nov. 25. ... San Antonio scored 100 or more points for the 22nd consecutive game. Raptors: DeRozan (right ankle) was inactive for the game. Following the sprain he suffered in Sunday's loss to Phoenix, the Raptors said that he will also miss Wednesday's game in Memphis before they re-evaluate the injury. ... F Jared Sullinger made his first start since April 13, 2016, when he was still with Boston. ... After missing the last six games with a sore left knee, Patterson returned to action on Tuesday. THE HUNGER FOR VICTORY ""You make adjustments, make substitutions, get certain groups on the court, call timeouts, yell and scream and beg and love and be crazy and then you win or you lose and then what happens? You get to go to dinner, which is sometimes the best part of the evening, with a nice glass (of wine)."" -- Popovich, on the ups and downs of the game of basketball. MOVING ON UP With his 1,126th win Tuesday night, Popovich is now one from tying Jerry Sloan for most career wins with one NBA franchise. Casey had described Popovich as the best coach in all of sports earlier in the day, but before the game, Popovich politely disagreed. ""That's very flattering but obviously untrue,"" he said. ""I've been around a long time and we've won some games, and if you've forgotten, I got to coach Tim Duncan. That made me look pretty good.""","400900095"
"PHILADELPHIA --  M. Night Shyamalan could not have scripted a twist ending from his courtside seat as implausible as this one: The 76ers pulled off a stunner over the 30-win Clippers without injured center Joel Embiid. Nerlens Noel scored 19 points, Richaun Holmes had 18 and Philadelphia beat Los Angeles 121-110 on Tuesday night. The Sixers rallied from 19 points down and proved yet again they are now a team trying to win games instead of tank seasons. ""We come here, put in the work every day and it's starting to show for us on the floor,"" Holmes said. Embiid, out with a left knee contusion, waved his arms from the bench as the crowd shouted ""Trust the Process"" in the waning minutes. Noel had three blocked shots in Embiid's spot and the Sixers hit 10 3-pointers to spur the second-half rally. The Sixers are 3-10 without Embiid this season. Blake Griffin, a five-time All-Star, scored 12 points on 3-of-11 shooting in his first game since Dec. 18.  He averaged 21.2 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists this season, and played in 26 of the Clippers' first 28 games. Jamal Crawford hit six 3s and scored 27 points for the Clippers. J.J. Redick had 22. ""This one's more disheartening,"" Crawford said. ""You have to put those games away, by any means. This one's on us."" Embiid continues to be hampered by the knee he hurt on Friday night. He's scheduled to sit out Wednesday night's game at Milwaukee because he does not play in one game of back-to-back sets. The Sixers listed 17,591 at the Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday, another stout crowd for a franchise coming off one of the worst stretches of seasons in NBA history. Embiid's growing popularity has forced the Sixers to at least consider playing him only the home game when they play on consecutive nights. ""We are mindful that our fans want to see Joel play,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""It's one of several layers that influence the decision on when to play Joel. But it's certainly on our mind to do the right thing by our fans."" While fans are crushed when Embiid doesn't play, Brown said other Sixers see his absence as their opportunity to develop and contribute. ""I think those type of words come to my mind more than `woe is me' stuff,"" Brown said. ""That's not it. That's not it at all. We wind our guys up and we play NBA basketball and here we go."" Jahlil Okafor missed his chance to start and was held out with right knee soreness. Noel made the most of his first start of the season, and Dario Saric and Holmes were clutch off the bench. The Clippers made 12 of 19 3-pointers in the first half and rolled to a 19-point lead until the Sixers got going in the third. DeAndre Jordan missed four straight free throws -- the last one on an airball -- that sent the crowd into a frenzy not heard in Philly in some time. Noel finished an alley-oop and Sergio Rodriguez's fast-break layup gave the Sixers an 87-86 lead. The 76ers rallied from 19 down to win for the first time since Dec. 23, 2014, at Miami. ""You get a 19-point lead, nothing's guaranteed, but you've got to secure it,"" Clippers assistant Mike Woodson said. TIP-INS Clippers: Doc Rivers did not coach the Clippers because of an illness. Woodson ran the team. ... Griffin had a shot blocked on a spin move in the paint by Holmes. 76ers: Shyamalan wore a ""Trust the Process"" shirt and visited with Embiid. Shyamalan's daughter sang the national anthem. Comedian Kevin Hart also watched from a courtside seat . ... Brown has yet to (hash)RaiseTheCat after a 76ers win. ""The Australians would be proud of it,"" Brown said. SIMMONS UPDATE Ben Simmons, the No. 1 overall pick, has continued to improve in his recovery from a broken right foot. Simmons, who hasn't played this season, started light 1-on-1 drills against a 76ers D-League player. ""I'm just really happy with the path and plan we have in place for him,"" Brown said. The 76ers have held out Embiid and Noel for full seasons as they recovered from injuries. Simmons may not settle for the same fate, but the Sixers aren't going to rush back a player they project as a cornerstone with Embiid for years. ""It's nice and slow,"" Brown said. ""It's not dramatic. It's not anything that people should read into, here he is. It's not that. It's slowly building him up, very cautiously to a point where we can welcome him back, legitimately to the team.""","400900096"
"WASHINGTON -- The Washington Wizards arrived dressed in black funeral wear for what they openly labeled a grudge match. Bradley Beal made sure they won it. Beal scored 13 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter, and the Wizards extended their home winning streak to 14 games with a 123-108 victory over the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night. ""I wanted to win, man. I wanted to win bad,"" Beal said. ""Especially to keep our home streak going. Especially after the last game we played them. We had a little chip on our shoulder."" John Wall added 27 points, and Markieff Morris had 19 points and 11 rebounds as the Wizards exacted some revenge after complaining of dirty play in two previous meetings with the Celtics. The second one, a 117-108 Celtics home win, featured five technical fouls and ended with Wall and Boston's Jae Crowder nearly setting off a brawl. That prompted the Wizards to show up to Verizon Center on Tuesday wearing all-black, funeral-themed clothing. Wall's apparel consisted of a designer T-shirt beneath a varsity-style jacket as he arrived. Beal, who created the idea, arrived in an oversized black winter trenchcoat, complete with hood and matching scarf. He would later have his best offensive night since that game in Boston. ""We just wanted to have fun, man,"" he insisted afterward. ""That's all we were doing. Nothing personal. Of course it was a subliminal (message), but we were just having fun at the end of the day."" Isaiah Thomas scored 25 points and had 13 assists, but shot 1 of 7 in the fourth quarter in Boston's third straight loss. Al Horford added 22 points and Crowder had 17 for Celtics. Boston allowed the Wizards to shoot 57.8 percent from the floor, its worst field goal percentage defense of the season. ""They got whatever they wanted on their offensive end,"" said Crowder, who insisted the game took no extra significance for the Celtics. ""I don't think it's a rivalry,"" He added. ""They won the game tonight. Next question."" The Wizards never trailed and controlled the game throughout. After building their lead to 12 three times in the second half, they finally stretched it to 110-97 when Beal hit a driving bank shot, absorbed Marcus Smart's foul and converted a three-point play. A few possessions later, Beal stole Crowder's pass to Thomas and converted a finger roll to make it 114-100. Wall's dunk and three-point play over Kelly Olynyk, complete with a biceps flex in the middle, made it 119-104. ""They seen everything that we said, and we seen what they said,"" Wall said. ""I think it was just a great team game. Nobody do anything dirty. Two teams competing (against) each other trying to get a win."" TIP-INS Celtics: Shot 2 of 12 (16.7 percent) from 3-point range in the first quarter. ... Thomas scored 20 or more points for the 28th consecutive game. ... C Tyler Zeller was available for the first time since a sinus infection sidelined him at the start of the new year. He did not play. Wizards: Hold the league's longest active home winning streak and would tie their third-longest in franchise history with their next home win. ... Made their first six field goals to take an early 13-6 lead. .. Improved to 3-7 in the second game of back-to-back sets. GET ME IN, COACH Smart got into an argument with assistant coaches during the fourth quarter, and coach Brad Stevens said the dispute came because Smart wanted to return to play, but was on a minutes limit for the half. ""Of course I wanted to go back in, just like everyone else, to play it out and give it everything they have and leave it on the court,"" Smart said. ""We had different opinions."" FASHION SENSE Wizards forward Otto Porter may have gotten the best reviews for his all black suit, complete with matching black shirt, tie and shades. Washington coach Scott Brooks appreciated the team-bonding aspects of the idea, even if he wasn't willing to join in. ""My daughter just texted me and she said, `Do not wear your black jeans, because you kind of look a little chunky in them,"" Brooks said. ""So I wore my blue jeans tonight.""","400900097"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Dwyane Wade trusts his natural feel for the game when it's time to defer and allow Jimmy Butler to take over down the stretch. The 14-year veteran guard also knows when his new team needs more of him late in the games. He sensed it Tuesday night, scoring seven of his 21 points in the fourth quarter to propel the Chicago Bulls to 100-92 road win over the struggling Orlando Magic. It was the second straight game that Wade took over in the fourth quarter to lead Chicago to victory. ""Each game is different and it calls for something different,"" Wade said of how he and Butler play off each other. ""Like I said earlier in the year, I think we are both more dynamic when we are both able to score."" Both took turns in the fourth as the Bulls pulled away in otherwise close game. Butler scored six of his 20 points in the fourth quarter as they took turns pulling up for jumpers and driving to the basket against a Magic team that was playing without three of its top four guards. But Wade just seemed to have a little more energy as he played the role of scorer and facilitator in setting up his teammates for easy baskets throughout the fourth quarter. ""He's been huge lately,"" Butler said. ""He's taking and making shots, tough ones at that, passing the ball to the open guy. Me and him both decided to miss a couple of wide-open layups tonight, that's part of it. But he has been huge."" His performance took a little pressure off Jerian Grant, who was inserted back into the starting lineup at point guard before the game. Wade's vision also played a part in backup center Cristiano Felicio's 12-point, 10-rebound performance. ""He is obviously a guy who can get it going at any time,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said of Wade. ""He had three big buckets going into halftime to get him some confidence and little rhythm and then was awesome in the fourth quarter to close the game."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago shook up its point guard position before Tuesday night's game. Grant replaced Carter-Williams in the starting lineup. Hoiberg said Carter-Williams, who didn't play, has been demoted and will come off the bench and did not immediately name a backup, although Rajon Rondo was the first off the bench. Magic: Injuries caused the Magic to shuffle their starting lineup for the second game in a row. With Augustin out with an ankle injury from Sunday's loss to Golden State, Vogel shifted C.J. Watson, who started at shooting guard Sunday, to backup point guard and coming off the bench. Jeff Green and Aaron Gordon both started at the wings to match up better against Butler and Wade, Vogel said. Fournier, the starting shooting guard, missed his sixth straight game with a sore right foot. ...The MRI on Augustin's sprained ankle came back negative but he is listed as day-to-day. ... Meeks had surgery on his right thumb Tuesday morning and is out indefinitely. DEPLETED BACKCOURT With Evan Fournier, Jodie Meeks and D.J. Augustin all out with injuries, the Magic's backcourt struggled. That was most evident in the 19 turnovers the team committed. Point guard Elfrid Payton, who had to play 38 minutes because of the lack at the position, committed eight of the costly turnovers. ""Well, they're good at turning teams over and we know we can't over penetrate,"" said Orlando coach Frank Vogel.  ""But we're missing our shooting guards so it's a little bit of a challenge with what we have in terms of perimeter shooting."" MAN IN THE MIDDLE Felicio, who struggled with catching the ball in the paint early in the season, thrived underneath most of the night when Chicago went to its smaller lineup. He defended Nikola Vucevic decently in the paint and when Butler and Wade found him for lobs inside he made good, converting four of six.","400900098"
"DENVER --  For the second straight game, Jameer Nelson took over late to try and rescue the Denver Nuggets from a fourth-quarter collapse. This time he was successful. Nikola Jokic had 23 points and 11 rebounds, Nelson scored seven of his 17 points in the last four minutes and the Nuggets held on to beat the Utah Jazz 103-93 on Tuesday night. It was redemption for both the Nuggets and Nelson. On Sunday, Denver let a nine-point lead slip in the final minutes and Nelson missed a potential game-tying jumper with 2 seconds remaining as the Minnesota Timberwolves prevailed 111-108. ""I've made a ton of tough shots and a ton of big shots in my career -- and I've missed a ton -- so it doesn't bother me,"" Nelson said. ""It's a basketball game, you're going to make some shots, you're going to miss some shots. I understand it. My team understands it."" The Nuggets led by 17 with a minute left in the third quarter before the Jazz made their push. Rudy Gobert scored eight of his 11 in the fourth and Boris Diaw's reverse layup cut the lead to 92-88 with 2:49 remaining. But Denver countered with an 8-0 run as Nelson scored five points, including a 3-pointer that pushed the lead back to 100-88 with 1:17 remaining. The Nuggets held on from there for their fifth win in seven games. Darrell Arthur added a season-high 16 points off the bench. ""At times we haven't closed the game and tonight we were able to do that,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Hopefully that's a sign of growth. It's great to have veteran guys step up."" Derrick Favors scored 18, George Hill had 17 and Diaw added 16 for Utah. Alec Burks, who played up the road from the Pepsi Center at the University of Colorado, had 13 points as he continues to work back from an ankle injury. ""I'm feeling good,"" Burks said. ""We as a team just weren't getting shots to fall."" Utah lost on consecutive nights after winning six straight. The Jazz blew an eight-point lead in the fourth on Monday as Russell Westbrook hit a game-winning jumper with 1.4 seconds to lift division rival Oklahoma City to a 97-95 win. The Jazz looked drained most of Tuesday, something Utah coach Quin Snyder scoffed at after the game. ""Everybody's fatigued, it's January,"" Snyder said. ""I don't want our guys to think about being fatigued."" The Nuggets outscored the Jazz 41-17 in the last 14 minutes of the half to take a 51-39 lead. Arthur made three consecutive 3-pointers as part of an 11-0 run and Jokic had four of his 10 points in the half in the last 41 seconds. TIP-INS Jazz: The Jazz fell to 17-6 with Hill in the lineup. They are 10-0 when he scores 20 or more points in a game. ... SG Rodney Hood (knee) missed his fifth consecutive game. Nuggets: Jokic has 16 double-doubles in his last 24 games. ... PG Emmanuel Mudiay missed his second straight game because of lower back soreness. ""Obviously his back is still bothering him,"" Malone said. ""There is no need to rush him back."" SLOW AND STEADY The Jazz came into Tuesday's game ranked 29th in the league in offensive pace (93.5) and 27th in points per game (99.6), but still lead the Northwest Division. ""Golden State sets the bar with their pace and they're so explosive offensively, it's easy to say that's the way you should play because it's effective,"" Snyder said. ""But it's effective for Golden State. It wouldn't be effective for us."" A stingy defense has also proved effective for the Jazz. They rank second in defensive efficiency (101.3). KING ARTHUR Arthur finished 5 of 7 from the field and 3 of 3 from 3-point range. He has scored 10 or more points in five of his last six games, averaging 11.3 points on 57 percent shooting from the field and 56 percent from 3-point range. The 28-year-old is 50 of 100 from the field this season. ""I think our developmental coach has been helping me a lot so I'm just trying to stay consistent and shoot the same way every time,"" he said.","400900099"
"PHOENIX --  Buzzer-beating victories for the Timberwolves are almost as rare as a balmy Minnesota day in January. So Tuesday night's was one to be savored. Andrew Wiggins sank an 18-foot pull-up jumper as the game ended to give the Timberwolves a 112-111 victory over the Phoenix Suns. ""I wasn't going to let no one stop me,"" Wiggins said. It was the first buzzer-beating win for the Timberwolves since Luke Ridnour made a floater to beat Utah on Feb. 22, 2012. Tuesday night's play had other options. ""But my mind was made up once I got the ball. I was going to shoot it,"" Wiggins said. ""I got to my spot. I knew the pull-up would be there. `' He wanted a chance at redemption after missing one of two free throws with 12.1 seconds to go. It still put Minnesota ahead by a point but cleared the way for two free throws by P.J. Tucker that put Phoenix on top 111-110 with 6.3 seconds left. That was just enough time for Wiggins to lose his footing, regain it, then toss in the winner. ""It almost seemed like whoever had the ball last would win,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""So that was a long six seconds, but he stumbled, picked it up, made it. That's amazing athleticism and concentration. Usually, if you can knock a guy off his rhythm, the shot never falls in."" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said Wiggins fought through the contact on the play. ""He got through that and got the shot off,"" Thibodeau said. ""He got to his spot, which is part of the design of that play, to get to his spot. He had the concentration and the mental toughness to take all the stuff that happened on that play and make the shot. It was a great play by him."" Devin Booker overcame a slow start to make 5 of 6 shots in the fourth quarter, three of them 3-pointers, for 26 points for the Suns. Tyson Chandler had a season-high 22 points and grabbed 17 rebounds for Phoenix. Eric Bledsoe added 18 points, including a three-point play that tied it at 109 with 1:05 remaining. Karl Anthony-Towns scored 18 and Gorgui Deng and Shabazz Muhammad 16 apiece for the Timberwolves, who have won three in a row of six of their last eight. Phoenix led by as many as 11 points in the first half and Minnesota by 14 in the second. Wiggins' spinning drive to the hoop with 32 seconds left in the third quarter gave the Timberwolves an 87-79 lead going into the fourth. But the Suns outscored Minnesota 14-5 to start the final quarter, taking a 93-92 lead on Booker's running jumper with seven minutes left. Wiggins' turnaround 14-footer put Minnesota back on top 94-93 with 6:46 remaining. The Timberwolves never led by more than four points after that and there were four ties before Wiggins missed a free throw for the only time in eight attempts all night. But he made the second to put Minnesota ahead 110-109. Despite the outcome, the Suns like the direction they are heading. ""We're taking steps forward,"" Booker said, ""but we still have a long way to go."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota swept the season series with Phoenix 3-0 and has won four in a row against the Suns, something the Timberwolves haven't done since 2004. ...

"CLEVELAND --  The criticism quieted. The problems persist. LeBron James and the NBA champions are a mess right now. Arron Afflalo dropped a 3-pointer with 17.3 seconds left in overtime as the Sacramento Kings rallied for 116-112 win Wednesday night over the slumping Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost for the sixth time in eight games and are dealing with a major distraction after James challenged the team's commitment to winning and demanded roster changes. Following the latest troubling loss, James quickly dressed and answered a handful of questions before heading home. ""We gotta get better,"" he said. ""That's all."" James recorded his second straight triple-double, finishing with 24 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists. Kevin Love had 21 points and 16 rebounds and Kyrie Irving scored 20, but it wasn't enough as the Cavs didn't play with poise down the stretch and missed 17 of 34 free throws. DeMarcus Cousins had 28 points and 10 rebounds for the Kings, who trailed by five with 2:30 in overtime before battling back. Darren Collison added 23 points for Sacramento, which also trailed by 10 in the fourth quarter. ""Never a doubt,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said with a laugh. Things weren't so funny down the hall in Cleveland's locker room. James, who typically takes up to an hour to get showered and dressed, was already packing some belongings and a late-night, take-home meal into a bag when the media was allowed to enter. James wore a ""Klutch Or Nowhere"" shirt, a nod to business partner Rich Paul's sports management group, and a baseball cap for ""Uninterrupted,"" his sports multimedia site. He wasn't in a talkative mood after the Cavs let a win slip away on their home floor and fell to 5-7 in January. Earlier in the day, James met with his teammates, coach Tyronn Lue and general manager David Griffin to discuss the biting remarks he made following a loss on Monday at New Orleans. Griffin was most upset with the superstar's assertion that the Cavs appeared satisfied with one title. ""It was the most misguided comment that came out of any of this,"" Griffin said. While Griffin said he was pleased with the meeting, James refused to characterize the talk. ""I'm just trying to win ballgames,"" James said. ""That's all that matters."" After Afflalo's 3, James missed a deep 3-point attempt for the Cavs, who were then forced to foul Cousins. Sacramento's big man made one of two to put it away. Sacramento had lost eight of 10 coming in and is on an eight-game road trip. The Kings have won back-to-back games for the first time since winning four in a row in December. ""This is our first complete full game of the season,"" Cousins said. ""Anybody who stepped on the floor played some type of part in this win. We battled. We took some hits, but we came back on our own. "" MELO OUT Griffin would not comment on a report the New York Knicks called the Cavs about a deal involving Love for Carmelo Anthony, one of James' closest friends. ""I have no reaction,"" James said when asked about the proposed trade. ""We got 14 guys in here. We need to be ready every night. Who we got in here we gotta play. We can't play fantasy basketball. We got who we got and we gotta go out and play."" TIP-INS Kings: Cousins has recorded 10 straight double-doubles. .... Sacramento's grueling trip includes three back-to-backs, putting a heavy physical strain on the players. Joerger said it's a challenge to keep the Kings fresh. ""We try to break it up a little bit, try to do something different at practice,"" he said. ""Keep guys loose, keep guys fresh, not wear them out. It comes around and goes around. Sometimes you are the beneficiary. We all think we're getting the wrong end of it, but it does come around. We're OK."" ... F Omri Casspi missed his sixth straight game with a strained tendon in his right foot. Joerger doesn't know how long Casspi will be out. Cavaliers:  Griffin said it's possible he won't make any moves before next month's trade deadline. ""We have enough on this team to win a championship,"" Lue said before the game. ""We can get better. I know Griff is going to make us better and he's going to do the best he can."" ... Drama is nothing new to the Cavs, who have resembled a soap opera at times. ""It's hard for me to tell you we're dealing with a lot of adversity when we're No. 1 in the East,"" Griffin said. ""But we have a tendency to be our best when our backs are against the wall, so I have no reason to believe that won't be true now."" ... F Richard Jefferson was excused for the birth of a child.","400900101"
"BOSTON -- In a midseason matchup of MVP contenders, the loudest chants at TD Garden were for the little guy carrying the Celtics. As the amped-up crowd serenaded Isaiah Thomas, the 5-foot-9 star played like an MVP with 38 points and nine assists to help Boston beat James Harden and the Houston Rockets 120-109 on Wednesday night. ""It's stuff you dream of as a little kid,"" Thomas said. ""I always said to be in the Garden, to play for the Celtics and for them to be chanting MVP is like, it doesn't seem real."" It was Thomas' 15th game this season with at least 30 points and his 29th consecutive outing with 20 or more. Jae Crowder added 23 points and 10 rebounds, and Al Horford totaled 20 points and nine assists for Boston (27-18), which had lost three straight. Harden finished with 30 points and 12 assists, Ryan Anderson scored 19 and Sam Dekker had 15 off the bench as the Rockets (34-15) lost for the sixth time in nine games. ""They created a lot of mismatches,"" Harden said after a 6-for-18 shooting night. ""Isaiah made big plays, whether it was scoring or making the right pass."" Boston erased a 58-52 halftime deficit and led by as many as eight in the third quarter before Houston pulled to 88-86 entering the fourth. With 5:12 remaining and the game tied at 98, Thomas hit two free throws after a flagrant-1 foul on Harden and followed with a jumper and a driving hook to put the Celtics up 104-98. Terry Rozier hit a 3-pointer before layups by Horford and Crowder capped the 13-2 spurt that put the game out of reach. Harden scored 37 points and the Rockets escaped with a 107-106 win in their only other meeting with Boston this season at Houston on Dec. 5. Horford missed a potential game-winning layup as time expired. ""I felt like I played a good game there and had a good shot to win and didn't make it,"" Horford said. ""But that's in the past and we had a good opportunity here and we won."" TIP-INS Rockets: G Eric Gordon (lower back tightness) was a last-minute scratch. ""He just went out to shoot and felt good. Then during the shooting, something just caught him,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ... C Nene (rest) had the night off after playing two games in three days before Tuesday's off day. Celtics: F Jonas Jerebko was on the receiving end of Harden's flagrant-1 foul in the fourth. Harden's hit split Jerebko's lip open, and he received stitches after the game. ""It wasn't intentional or anything,"" Jerebko said. ""Stuff happens."" ... G Avery Bradley (sore right Achilles) missed his fourth straight game. Boston coach Brad Stevens said last Saturday that Bradley would miss all four games this week. SMART SAYS SORRY Smart apologized for his heated argument with assistant coaches during the closing seconds of Tuesday's game at Washington, calling his behavior ""childish and unprofessional"" on Twitter. Smart did not start Wednesday, but Stevens said that had nothing to do with the outburst. ""That was one of the first times where you could tell his emotions took control of him,"" Thomas said. ""We know he means well ... and we need (him) to be Marcus Smart, and he was Marcus Smart tonight."" Smart had seven points and six assists in 30 minutes. ELECTRIC GREEN The Celtics announced a sponsorship deal with General Electric and will wear ""GE"" patches on their jerseys starting next season. Boston's home and away uniforms haven't changed much over the years, but Stevens didn't have any problems with the patches. ""We wore (alternate) gray (jerseys) with sleeves yesterday,"" Stevens said. ""It seems like they change every week. I can't keep up with them.""","400900102"
"NEW YORK -- Both the Miami Heat and Brooklyn Nets are streaking. They're going in opposite directions, though. Dion Waiters scored 14 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter, including the clinching 3 with 6.8 seconds left, and Miami overcame an 18-point deficit in the final period to beat beleaguered Brooklyn 109-106 on Wednesday night. ""Oh man, I love that moment,"" Waiters said. ""You can never shy away from that. You just can't be afraid of taking them shots. I just wanted to get it over with and fortunately I made the shot."" Wayne Ellington had 22 points and Goran Dragic added 17 for the resurgent Heat (16-30). Last in the Southeast Division, they have won a season-best five straight games. Brook Lopez scored 33 for Brooklyn, including a career-high seven 3-pointers. Brooklyn (9-36) has lost 14 of 15 and owns the worst record in the NBA. The Heat trailed 89-71 entering the fourth but outscored the Nets 38-17 the rest of the way. ""Obviously, it was a tough, gritty fourth quarter,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""This was an important challenge for us, coming off four home wins, to be able to handle success."" Okaro White's 3-pointer with 58 seconds left gave Miami its first lead, 102-101, since midway through the second period. After Spencer Dinwiddie missed a jumper with 42 seconds left, White connected on two free throws. Trevor Booker brought the Nets within one on a layup with 30 seconds remaining before Waiters hit his clinching 3. ""I think we just ran out of gas,"" Booker said. ""They grabbed the momentum and kept it and we slowed down."" Lopez scored the Nets' first 13 points, but the Heat led 34-30 after the first quarter. Miami opened a 42-32 advantage on Dragic's three-point play with 10:40 left in the second, but the Nets outscored the Heat 34-13 the rest of the quarter and took a 66-55 halftime lead following Sean Kilpatrick's 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""Defensively we were not as solid as we are usually,"" Dragic said. ""Then the second quarter they came out blazing; they made every shot. We kind of just jogged, didn't get back. That put us in a tough situation, but I am glad we responded how we did."" Brooklyn opened the second half with six straight points. Miami got within 10 before the Nets raced out to their 18-point lead heading into the fourth. Willie Reed (14 points) and White (10) each scored in double figures for the Heat. Bojan Bogdanovic had 17 points, Caris LeVert scored 12 and Dinwiddie finished with 10 for the Nets. ""We were leading the whole game. We were right there. If that's the positive to take from it, then that's what we've got to take from it,"" LeVert said. TIP-INS Heat: Rodney McGruder's 29 starts are the most by a Heat rookie since Mario Chalmers started all 82 games in 2008-09. ... Miami has won five straight in Brooklyn since losing 104-95 in double overtime on Jan. 10, 2014. Nets: Brooklyn has not won at home since a 120-118 victory over Charlotte on Dec. 26. ... Joe Harris missed his third straight game with a sprained left ankle. He had started the previous nine. MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME It took 92 days for the Nets and Heat to play each other this season. They have now begun a stretch in which they will face each other three times in 17 days. ALWAYS READY Bogdanovic is the only Net to play in all 45 games this season. He has started all but one of them.","400900103"
"CHICAGO --  One huge run to end the game gave the Atlanta Hawks a gutsy win after it appeared they were headed toward a lackluster loss. Dennis Schroder scored 24 points, Paul Millsap added 21 and the Hawks finished with a 19-4 spurt to beat the Chicago Bulls 119-114 on Wednesday night. Thabo Sefolosha scored 18 and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 17, hitting four of Atlanta's season-high 17 3-pointers. Dwight Howard had 16 points and 12 rebounds, and Kent Bazemore scored 16 as the Hawks pulled out their 12th win in 15 games. They also beat Chicago for the seventh straight time. ""We just stayed focused, we stayed together,"" Howard said. ""We hit some big shots. We stayed composed. It shows our growth as a team."" Jimmy Butler led Chicago with 40 points, and Dwyane Wade scored 33. But the Bulls let a 10-point lead slip away down the stretch, and both stars questioned the team's desire afterward. Wade focused on the younger players, saying, ""I'm 35 years old, man. I have three (NBA) championships. It shouldn't hurt me more than it hurts them. They have to want it."" Butler said his team doesn't deliver effort on a consistent basis and doesn't take losses as hard as it should. ""If you're not (mad) after you lose every game, something's wrong,"" he said. ""This is your job. This is supposed to be what you love to do. Not everybody looks at it this way. I want to play with guys who care and play hard and want to do well for this organization, that want to win games."" BIG RUN It was 110-100 after Wade hit a pull-up jumper with 3:02 remaining. The Hawks called a timeout, and everything changed after that. Atlanta picked up the pace on offense and grabbed some important rebounds after getting beaten on the glass most of the game. Millsap, Schroder and Hardaway nailed 3s on consecutive possessions to start the game-ending run. Schroder gave Atlanta a one-point lead with a layup after Chicago's Paul Zipser missed a 3, and Howard made one of two free throws to make it 112-110 with 58.6 seconds left. After Butler banked in a pull-up shot, Howard threw down an alley-oop on a pass from Kent Bazemore. Chicago's Nikola Mirotic missed a 3 with 25.3 seconds left, and Schroder and Sefolosha combined to make five free throws in the final 20 seconds. ""It's big-time,"" Schroder said. ""You can see the difference. If we play lazy, don't play with pace and just play sloppy we go down 15, 10, 20. But if we play with our pace, we can beat everyone. We've got to do a better job of playing for 48 minutes, doing it day-in, day-out every game.""

Michael Carter-Williams remained on the bench for the second game in a row after starting the previous 12. TIP-INS Hawks: Rosters for the Rising Stars Challenge were announced on Wednesday, and the way Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer sees it, G Malcolm Delaney should have been included. ""If you look at analytics, you look at minutes played, you look at how his team is performing, he clearly is one of the guys who should be on the U.S. roster,"" he said.

"MILWAUKEE -- The Philadelphia 76ers showed plenty of resiliency playing without leading scorer Joel Embiid for the second consecutive night. After scoring a season-high 72 points in the first half, the 76ers had just 16 in the third quarter and watched a fourth-quarter lead evaporate before gaining control in the waning moments to defeat the Milwaukee Bucks 114-109 on Wednesday night. ""They were up early, they came back late in the game but we still found ways to get efficient shots and it worked out for us,"" said Nerlens Noel, who hit a late jumper to help seal the win. The 76ers won for the fifth time in six games and have won back-to-back games without Embiid, who continues to recover after bruising his knee on Friday. ""We want to better execute some of the things we have drawn up, but in general, their perseverance in finding a way to get a win was outstanding,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Gerald Henderson led the 76ers with 20 points, Ersan Ilyasova and Dario Saric added 17 apiece. ""We had confidence down the stretch. It just comes with experience, good and bad,"" Henderson said. Greg Monroe's season-high 28 points led the Bucks. Jabari Parker added 20 and Giannis Antetokounmpo had 17 points and 12 rebounds. Trailing by 14 at the half, the Bucks cut into the 76ers' lead and trailed 88-82 heading to the fourth. A 3-pointer by Matthew Dellavedova gave Milwaukee a 97-96 lead with just less than six minutes left. A frenetic series of lead changes and ties then ensued over the next five minutes. With the Bucks leading by three, Parker stole a cross-court pass but was called for a foul after inadvertently hitting Robert Covington in the face as he accelerated up the court. Covington made both free throws. After a backcourt violation, Noel drew a foul and converted two free throws to give Philadelphia the lead. Noel then hit a jumper and Ilyasova made two free throws to put the game out of reach. ""We just didn't execute having the lead,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. Key turnovers hurt the Bucks late, including an errant in-bounds pass by Monroe that sailed over Antetokounmpo's head. ""That's definitely a game we should have won,"" Monroe said. ""We would have had a different outcome if I would have made that pass."" Philadelphia outscored Milwaukee by 20 in the second quarter to take a 72-58 lead at the half. ROOKIE REWARD Milwaukee guard Malcolm Brogdon is the only second-round draft pick named to play in the Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend. ""He's a very talented man on and off the floor,"" Kidd said. ""He's playing at a very high level and it's well deserved. I think he'll be considered for Rookie of the Year if he continues to play the way he's playing."" Brown felt second-year player T.J. McConnell, the 76ers point guard, should have been selected, as well. ""We are 9-2 with him as a starter,"" he said. ""T.J. McConnell should be in that game."" ANTETOKOUNMPO ACCOLADES Brown said Antetokounmpo's level of play continues to develop. ""His balance as to how he uses his physical gifts is starting to be better realized,"" Brown said. ""There was always this sort of reckless abandon that he attacked the game with. I think that it's becoming more polished, more sophisticated."" TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid (left knee contusion) and Jahlil Okafor (right knee soreness) didn't make the trip. ... Richuan Holmes appeared to injure his right elbow after a hard fall in the second quarter. He left a short time later and received treatment on the bench from a trainer.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Marc Gasol scored a career-best 42 points, and the Memphis Grizzlies needed every last one of them. Gasol's night was capped by the deciding two free throws with 36 seconds left, as the Grizzlies sent Toronto to its fifth straight loss with a 101-99 victory over the Raptors on Wednesday night. Gasol's final free throws ended a 12-0 run by the Raptors that tied the game at 99. Kyle Lowry's fadeaway 28-footer from the left wing bounced off the rim as time expired, saving Memphis from wasting Gasol's effort. ""The ball went in early, and the rim got a little bigger,"" the 7-foot-1 center from Spain said. ""And I just kept shooting."" The performance started with Gasol collecting Memphis' first 16 points. Then, he closed out the scoring with the deciding free throws. ""I think we all saw it right from the beginning -- he had a goal in mind that he was not going to go down watching,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. Zach Randolph finished with 16 points for Memphis, while Tony Allen had 15 points and 11 rebounds. Gasol converted 14 of 25 shots, including going 5 of 10 from 3-point range. ""It's so much fun to watch and be a part of,"" said guard Mike Conley, who had 11 points. ""Tonight was something special. It got to the point where everybody was just trying to get him the ball."" Lowry led the Raptors with 29 points, including 14 in the fourth quarter, to lead Toronto's final charge, erasing a 12-point Memphis lead. Norman Powell had 21 points and Cory Joseph finished with 15 points. ""I love our competitive spirit down the stretch,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said, adding: ""We've got to do it earlier in the game. We've got to come out and put our foot down."" With the Memphis lead at 12 -- matching its largest of the game -- the Raptors rallied behind Lowry, scoring 12 straight. He had 10 of those points, including a 4-point play. The Toronto rally tied the game at 99 with 1:31 remaining. But Gasol's final free throws meant the difference. ""We locked in during the fourth quarter, but I think we have to come out with that sense of urgency from the rip,"" Lowry said.

"NEW ORLEANS -- Russell Westbrook made the right play at the right time again, swinging a pass to Victor Oladipo for an open 3-pointer that slammed the door on the Pelicans' comeback attempt and completed a historically significant triple-double for the Oklahoma City Thunder superstar. Westbrook had 27 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, passing Larry Bird with his 60th career triple-double, and the Thunder beat the Pelicans 114-105 on Wednesday night. The accomplishment was not lost on Westbrook, who at 28 is too young to have enjoyed Bird's best basketball with Boston when it happened but certainly understands what it means to be in the same conversation. ""Obviously, he's a legend for a reason,"" Westbrook said. ""It's an honor, man. You never take this game for granted. Obviously, to be able to play the game I love every night and to be able to do that is a great accomplishment."" Pelicans All-Star Anthony Davis left late in the second quarter after aggravating a right thigh injury that kept him out of New Orleans' upset of the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. The Pelicans trailed the Thunder by 12 when Davis left, and they went down by as many as 22 early in the third before rallying to as close as five points. Steven Adams had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and Enes Kanter 17 points and 11 boards for the Thunder, who outscored the Pelicans 62-54 inside, thanks in no small part to Westbrook's distribution of the ball. ""I just read the defense,"" Westbrook said, noting he was aware of when New Orleans' defense was focused on him and noticed ""wide open"" teammates. ""My job is to try to get us an easy basket."" After Westbrook's 3 gave the Thunder their largest lead at 67-45, the Pelicans used runs of 10-0 late in the third period and 9-0 in the middle of the fourth to get as close as 105-100 on Solomon Hill's dunk with 5:34 left. That's when Oladipo, who had 15 points, stepped up for the Thunder, starting with a 3 that gave Westbrook his 10th assist. ""He's going to be one of the best ever to play the game,"" Oladipo said. ""He's just playing as hard as he can. He does whatever it takes to win. There's a relentlessness to him that's rare, and to be able to witness that and be part of history is a blessing."" Shortly after his 3, Oladipo disrupted a handoff from Donatas Motiejunas to E'Twaun Moore and broke away for a layup that made it 110-102. New Orleans never recovered. Moore scored 18 for the Pelicans, who trailed for all but the first two minutes of the tilt. ""We have to play the whole game the way we played in the second half,"" Moore said. ""If we do that, we have a good chance."" Hill, Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans each scored 14 for the Pelicans. FAST START The Thunder raced to a double-digit lead in the first quarter, dunking four times and hitting three 3-pointers en route to a 33-20 advantage. The early highlights included Kanter's dunk over both the 6-foot-11 Davis and 7-footer Omer Asik, while being fouled by Asik. ""You can't dig yourself a hole against that team like that and expect for you to be able to win,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""It has to be the perfect storm, and you know, we did a good job of fighting our way back in it; but one missed shot, one bad turnover, one something and then all of a sudden they go down and score and you're right back in the hole again."" Westbrook scored 17 points in the first half, hitting a pair of 3s and notching seven points on free throws. Oklahoma City finished the half with a four-point play, when Oladipo hit a 3 while Adams was fouled in the paint by Motiejunas. Adams hit the free throw to make it 64-45 at halftime. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Each team had a rookie selected to the Rising Stars game during All-Star weekend -- Oklahoma City's Domantas Sabonis and New Orleans' Buddy Hield. Both will be playing for the World team. Thunder coach Billy Donavan said the selection of Sabonis -- a Lithuanian who played for Gonzaga -- is a tribute to Thunder scouts, to coaches who have worked to develop his game and to Sabonis himself for having the ability to ""affect our team in a positive way."" Hield is from the Bahamas and played for Oklahoma in college. ""It's well deserved,"" Gentry said. ""I don't think anyone works any harder.""

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Beating the stacked Golden State Warriors is tough enough. Beating them when they're coming off a loss is becoming darn near impossible. Kevin Durant scored 16 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter, Stephen Curry added 28 points on six 3-pointers in his annual homecoming game and the Warriors rallied to beat the Charlotte Hornets 113-103 on Wednesday night. It stretched the Warriors' streak of not losing back-to-back regular-season games to an NBA-record 132 games. ""It's big because you never want to get that negative energy in your locker room if you can avoid it,"" Curry said. ""Every game is big, but there is just another level of intensity that you need to avoid a losing streak."" Klay Thompson had 19 points for the Warriors, who avenged a 105-102 loss to the Miami Heat on Monday. ""We're resilient, we're persistent and ... we just kept grinding it out,"" Durant said. Curry capped a memorable trip home in which he had his high school jersey retired and was honored at Davidson College with the naming of ""Section 30"" at Belk Arena where the Wildcats play their home games. ""Both schools that I played for and the Warriors got a win, so that's a solid trip,"" said Curry, who was 11 of 23 from the field, including 6-of-12 shooting from 3-point range. After trailing by six at halftime, the Hornets grabbed the lead with a 19-4 run to start the second half and led 80-75 entering the fourth quarter. It was only the eighth time this season the Warriors trailed after three quarters. But they stormed back in the fourth behind Durant, who drove the ball hard to the basket and got to the line. He finished 10 of 10 at the line and his two free throws with 5:25 left gave his team the lead for good. ""I think KD going to the line the way he did, not settling for jumpers but attacking was big,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""Anytime the game is slipping away from you, it's important to get to the free throw line. It stops the momentum of the other team, it allows you to set up your defense and you get some easy points."" Fittingly, Curry provided the knockout punch with two 3-pointers in the final three minutes to seal the victory. TIP INS Warriors: Curry's college coach Bob McKillop sat courtside to watch the game. ... Golden State twice fouled Marco Belinelli on 3-point attempts resulting in seven points in the fourth quarter, including the technical foul on Thompson for arguing one of the calls. Hornets: Roy Hibbert started in place of Cody Zeller, who missed the game with a quadriceps contusion. ... Spencer Hawes had a big first half for the Hornets with seven points, 10 rebounds and three assists off the bench. NO MORAL VICTORIES Hornets coach Steve Clifford refused to quantify the game as a moral victory for his team. ""I love this city, but that is one of the problems,"" Clifford said. ""It's not OK (to lose this game). We have to get the past that point. We're good now. We're not the Hornets of five years ago, OK? I love our fans and everybody is saying, `Great effort,' but that's not OK. We did a lot of good, but it's not OK."" NO BUTTERFLIES Curry said this was the first time he has played in Charlotte and not had butterflies before the game. Not that it really mattered, though. He came in averaging 36.3 points and 6.7 assists while shooting 53 percent from the field in his previous three games in Charlotte. Curry's return following his second MVP award drew a crowd of 19,639, the largest to see a game at the Spectrum Center.

Dirk Nowitzki added 19 points for Dallas, which was coming off a 49-point blowout of the Los Angeles Lakers. The last-place Mavericks (16-29) have won five of seven. Carmelo Anthony, the subject of trade talk, scored 30 points to lead the Knicks. Courtney Lee had a season-high 23 for New York, which has lost 14 of 18. Dallas played without Wesley Matthews and lost Deron Williams to injury late in the first half. ""That is the story of our season right now,"" Curry said. ""Guys are going down so everybody is stepping up."" Barnes, one of the few Mavs players who has been healthy all season, scored 13 after halftime. ""Once I got hurt and other guys got hurt, he kind of got thrown in the fire,"" Nowitzki said of Barnes. ""He's been fantastic. Just being in that position more and more, you get more experience, and he's tough to guard now."" Dallas led by as many as 10 in the third quarter, but the Knicks rallied to get within one twice in the fourth quarter. Down 89-88, the Knicks had the ball on a fast break, but Ron Baker missed a 3-pointer from the right corner. Curry followed with a long jumper at the other end, keying an 8-0 run as New York turned the ball over on three consecutive possessions. ""We've got to stay away from careless turnovers,"" Anthony said. ""We had eight in the fourth quarter; that's the game right there. We've got to do a better job taking care of the ball, protecting the ball, getting what we want."" Nowitzki gave the Mavericks the lead for good at 65-63 in the third quarter when he scored off an offensive rebound. Dallas went on a 14-2 run capped by Dorian Finney-Smith's 3-pointer with 3:08 left in the period, giving the Mavericks their biggest lead at 75-65. TIP-INS Knicks: Kristaps Porzingis played only five minutes in the first half after picking up three fouls. He scored all 13 of his points after halftime. ... Rookie center Willy Hernangomez had a career-high 16 rebounds. ... New York coach Jeff Hornacek said forward Lance Thomas had a mask to protect his fractured orbital bone, but was still experiencing headaches during workouts so the team will take its time returning him to action. Mavericks: The team signed guard Pierre Jackson to a second 10-day contract, and he played 24 minutes largely in place of Williams. If the Mavericks want to keep Jackson longer than 10 days, they would be required to sign him for the rest of the season. MEDICAL UPDATE Williams came up limping after he stepped on Joakim Noah's foot late in the first half. Williams hit a 3-pointer later in the same possession but asked out of the game and went straight to the locker room. He was diagnosed with a left big toe sprain and sat out the second half. He will likely miss more time. Matthews sat out after straining his right hip on Sunday. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said Matthews will miss at least one more game. On the plus side, Andrew Bogut returned to action after missing six straight games with a right hamstring strain. NO DISTRACTIONS Despite his name coming up in trade speculation, Anthony said after the game that the chatter was not a distraction to him or the team. ""Until management comes to me and says something, that's something I can't feed into,"" he said. ""At this point, I really don't have any reaction to it. It's something that we've talked about, it's something that we've discussed amongst each other, it's something that we don't want to bring into this locker room.""","400900109"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Trail Blazers' celebration of the 40th anniversary of their 1977 NBA championship ended appropriately -- with a win. Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum scored 24 points apiece and Portland beat the Los Angeles Lakers 105-98 on Wednesday night, with players from the championship team looking on. It was Portland's 11th straight victory in regular-season games against the Lakers. With two consecutive wins, the Blazers look to build some much-needed momentum. They host Memphis on Friday night before Golden State on Sunday. ""I think it's a great opportunity for us,"" Lillard said. ""I just asked somebody in the locker room, `When was the last time we won three games in a row?' We had to look at the schedule to see."" Los Angeles was led by Lou Williams with 31 points, including six 3-pointers. The Lakers were coming off a 122-73 loss at Dallas on Sunday, the most lopsided loss in franchise history. The Lakers trailed by as many as 14 points in the third quarter, but Williams made three consecutive 3-pointers to get Los Angeles within three at 89-86 with just over nine minutes to go. After the Lakers got within a point, Allen Crabbe's pull-up jumper gave the Blazers a 91-88 lead with 6:38 left. Nick Young's 3-pointer tied it, quieting the crowds' `Beat L.A.' chant. Young made another 3 to give Los Angeles a 94-91 lead. Lillard made three free throws after he was fouled by Jose Calderon to tie it, and Portland pulled in front on McCollum's 3-pointer. McCollum extended the lead with a reverse layup with 2:40 left. The Blazers led the rest of the way. Mason Plumlee had 19 points and 13 rebounds for the Blazers, who defeated the Celtics in Boston 127-123 in overtime on Saturday to snap a four-game losing streak. Portland was without Ed Davis for the second straight game because of a left wrist injury, and also missed Maurice Harkless, who had a calf injury. The Lakers didn't have D'Angelo Russell for the second straight game because of a sprained right knee and calf. He is expected to miss up to two weeks. Calderon started in his place. ""We had a great opportunity tonight, we had momentum,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""They did a good job of keeping their composure and making plays down the stretch. Ultimately, it just wasn't our night."" The Lakers held a 31-30 lead at the end of the first quarter, but Portland opened the second on a 9-2 run to go up 41-33 on Pat Connaughton's layup. Williams' floater got the Lakers back within one at 45-44. They evened it at 52 on Ivica Zubac's dunk and took a lead on Young's free throw, but Portland had a 59-58 edge at halftime. Williams led the Lakers with 16 points at the break, while McCollum had 16 for Portland. The team honored players from 1977 championship team at the half. ""I think we're playing much better. I think that's what we need to be focused on,"" Lillard said about the upcoming games. ""It's a great opportunity for us to show we're getting it together."" TIP INS Lakers: Jim Buss, the team's executive vice president of basketball operations, was in Portland for the game. ... The Lakers have lost seven of their last eight games.  ... The Lakers outrebounded the Blazers 30-22. Trail Blazers: It was the third of four meetings with the Lakers this season. ...  Portland's starting five scored 86 points. HONORING THE PAST Players from the 1977 championship team were feted with a banquet Tuesday night and a celebratory luncheon earlier Wednesday before a halftime ceremony for the fans. Blazers coach Terry Stotts wore a vintage plaid blazer in a nod to the late Jack Ramsay, coach of that team. It was somewhat fitting that the Blazers were playing the Lakers because Walton is the son of Bill Walton, who was on that `77 team and included in the celebration. Luke Walton is named after `77 teammate Maurice Lucas, who was often greeted with cheers of ""Luuuuke!"" ""If he's out there in a Blazer jersey, I won't be upset,"" the younger Walton said about his dad's presence at the game. ""But I would hope he's rooting for us. He should. I'm his son."" Stotts said afterward: ""It was good to get the win when we're celebrating the championship team.""","400900110"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Just when it looked as if the Oklahoma City Thunder might squander a big lead, Russell Westbrook unleashed his full fury on the Dallas Mavericks. Westbrook scored 17 of his 45 points in the final 8:23 to help the Thunder beat the short-handed Mavericks 109-98 on Thursday night. Oklahoma City led by 16 late in the third quarter, but the advantage was down to six when Westbrook checked in after a Dallas timeout. The NBA scoring leader made 7 of 10 shots in the fourth quarter, including 3 of 4 3-pointers. ""I could tell in the timeout that he felt like he was getting ready to kind of explode, to be honest with you,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. Westbrook was 16 of 29 overall from the field after being named an All-Star reserve earlier in the night. He had eight rebounds and three assists, ending his triple-doubles streak at three games. Victor Oladipo added 17 points, and Steven Adams had 15 in Oklahoma City's third straight win. The Thunder's excitement was dimmed when they learned that forward Enes Kanter fractured his right forearm punching a chair in the second quarter. Kanter is the team's No. 3 scorer and one of the league's top reserves. ""It was tough, man,"" Westbrook said. ""To do it the way he did it is very unfortunate. He's a strong man, and he'll be back better."" Adams said Kanter likely will struggle with how he has affected the team. ""He didn't mean to do it, obviously,"" Adams said. ""It's just one of those frustrating times where it just happened to like -- he did what he did, you know. He's already hard on himself. No one else can be as hard as he is on himself. He's probably just feeling so under the weather. I feel bad for him."" Harrison Barnes scored 31 points, and Justin Anderson added 17 for the Mavericks. They had won five of seven. Dallas was without four of its top five scorers. Forward Wesley Matthews sat out with a right hip strain, forward Dirk Nowitzki rested on the second game of a back-to-back, guard J.J. Barea was out with a left calf strain, and guard Deron Williams was out with a sprained left big toe. Oladipo made a 3-pointer with 5.3 seconds left in the first half to put the Thunder up 53-52, but Dorian Finney-Smith answered with a 3 as time expired in the half to put the Mavericks up 55-53. Oklahoma City gained control in the third quarter and put the Mavericks into foul trouble. Westbrook scored 13 points in the period, and Oklahoma City led 87-73 heading into the fourth quarter. Dallas roared back in the opening minutes of the final period and cut Oklahoma City's lead to three, but rookie Domantas Sabonis drained a 3-pointer, and Dallas called a timeout. Westbrook then checked in after a short rest and finished the job. ""We put up a good fight,"" Anderson said. ""It's tough when we did great the whole night. Westbrook got hot there at the end shooting threes. We were answering him with twos, and that's a tough battle to win."" --- TIP INS Mavericks: Dallas committed just one turnover in the first quarter. ... Rookie G Pierre Jackson suffered a left hamstring pull in the second quarter and only played 13 minutes in his first career start. Thunder: Westbrook went without an assist in the first half, and without an assist or rebound in the second quarter. ... Oklahoma City shot 51.4 percent overall. ... Kanter finished with four points in nine minutes. STAT LINES Barnes made 13 of 26 shots, made both of his 3-pointers and all three of his free throws. QUOTABLE Dallas G Devin Harris, on strategy against Westbrook: ""We kind of took everyone else away. We tried to make one guy beat you, and he made some shots. That's just how it goes sometimes.""","400900111"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  On a night when he was picked for his fourth All-Star game, Paul George looked every bit the part. Karl-Anthony Towns was right there with him, but the young Minnesota Timberwolves star will not be joining George in New Orleans next month. George scored 32 points after being picked for his fourth All-Star game to lead the Indiana Pacers to a 109-103 victory over the Timberwolves on Thursday night. ""I've got to bring it,"" George said. ""I've got to be ready at all times, always got to have the mindset to be aggressive."" Myles Turner added 23 points, and Jeff Teague had 20 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds to help the Pacers snap a three-game losing streak. Indiana outrebounded Minnesota 44-34 and shot 52 percent. Towns had 33 points and 10 rebounds, Zach LaVine scored 23 points, and Andrew Wiggins had 21 for Minnesota. But the Timberwolves missed a chance for their first four-game winning streak since 2012. ""It felt like we were a step slow all night,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. The Pacers had lost three in a row and four of six since a trip to London snapped a five-game winning streak. ""Ever since we got back from London we haven't been the same team since before we left,"" Teague said. ""We had to come out tonight and play with a lot of energy, played hard, and just got to continue to keep going."" George was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference about an hour before tipoff, and he came out firing with the 21-year-old Wiggins checking him. George hit 3 of 4 3-pointers and got Wiggins to foul him on a 3-pointer with seven minutes to play. Thibodeau picked up a technical foul for arguing the call and George, the leading free throw shooter in the league, made all four foul shots for an 86-81 lead. Towns hit a pair of 3-pointers to try to jumpstart a Wolves charge and LaVine hit another to cut the deficit to 96-90. But Teague and C.J. Miles each hit 3-pointers late in the shot clock down the stretch to turn back the Wolves. ""We almost pulled it off,"" Towns said, ""but almost isn't good enough."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana is 12-2 this year in games in which they shoot 50 percent. ... F Kevin Seraphin was scratched with a sore right knee. Coach Nate McMillan said he tried it in practice on Wednesday and was still sore so they held him out. ... The Pacers shot 55.6 percent (10 for 18) from deep. Timberwolves: Nemanja Bjelica struggled offensively, making just 1 of 6 shots and 1 of 5 3-pointers, many of them open looks. ... Minnesota had been one of the best rebounding teams in the league over the last month, but were soundly beaten in that category on Thursday night and were outscored 13-5 in second-chance points. ... Towns had his 35th double-double of the season. ALL-STAR GEORGE ""I think being a reserve is personally special because the coaches are voting you in and have more respect for your game. Obviously, I love being a starter as well, but it's always a special and a humbling opportunity to be an All-Star in this league."" -- George on his selection. BIG MOMENT After Wiggins made a layup to pull Minnesota to 106-103 with 15 seconds to play, Teague took the inbounds pass and headed up the sideline. It appeared that he stepped out of bounds, which would have given the Wolves the ball with 12 seconds left. But officials didn't call it, Teague squirted up the sideline and fed Turner for a dunk to seal it. ""He was out of bounds, so it's (down) three with a chance to tie,"" Thibodeau said. ""But we put ourselves in a bad position."" ROUGH NIGHT The Towns family had a rough night. Karl-Anthony was left off the All-Star team and his father, Karl, was hit by Wolves mascot Crunch during a stunt in the second quarter. Crunch slides down the stairs on a sled, but he hit Karl Towns' leg. Big Karl stayed in the game though, watching the second half with an ice pack on his right knee, but needed crutches to leave the arena.","400900112"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic is the biggest reason for Denver Nuggets' rise, so when he went down hard Thursday night there was deep concern. When the news came back that the 21-year-old center had only a left hip strain there was audible relief. ""I'm glad it wasn't anything serious,"" Darrell Arthur said. ""He's probably going to sit a couple of games so we can get him back. We're definitely going to miss him out there."" They were happy Jokic was around for most of the game against Phoenix. The Serb had 29 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists before leaving late in Denver's 127-120 victory over the Suns. Jokic went down without contact under the Phoenix basket with 1:47 left. He was on the floor for a while with the entire Nuggets team surrounding him. He finally stood and limped to the locker room as the Nuggets closed out their fifth straight home win. General manager Tim Connelly and veteran Mike Miller stood outside the exam room, and when Jokic came out with his older brothers he walked to the locker room on his own. X-rays after the game were negative and he was sitting at his locker with ice on his left hip. The team said he will have an MRI done on Friday morning. ""It's mixed emotions in the locker room,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Nikola is truly beloved by all of his teammates. He has no ego, he's a young kid, he likes to have fun, he's a little bit goofy, and the guys love him for that. For all the success that he's having he's still the same kid, and that's why everybody cares about him and respects him."" Danilo Gallinari added 23 points, and Will Barton had 16 for Denver. The Nuggets have won six of eight. Eric Bledsoe led Phoenix with 28 points, Devin Booker had 24 and T.J. Warren added 21 points and eight rebounds. Down by nine in the third quarter, Denver closed the period with a 14-5 run to take a 96-92 lead. The lead changed hands a couple of times, with Bledsoe leading the way for Phoenix with 14 fourth-quarter points. Jokic kept pace with nine points in the period. His last basket, a short jumper in the lane, gave the Nuggets a 125-118 lead. ""They made some plays and we couldn't get no stops,"" Bledsoe said. The Nuggets hit 21 of 25 free throws in the second half and outscored the Suns 30-14 from the line. Denver also held a 46-28 advantage on the glass. ""Rebounds, minus-18 for the game; minus-18 at the free-throw line,"" Phoenix coach Earl Watson said. ""Those are numbers you can't overcome, but we still had a chance to win."" TIP-INS Suns: G Dragan Bender was inactive with right ankle soreness. The rookie missed Tuesday's game against Minnesota as well. ... Jared Dudley was back in the lineup after sitting out Tuesday. Nuggets: G Emmanuel Mudiay sat out his third straight game with lower back soreness. Coach Michael Malone said before the game that he didn't think Mudiay would miss many more games. ... The Nuggets signed F Johnny O'Bryant to a 10-day contract. MARQUESE TALENT Watson didn't need long to decide he wanted Phoenix to get Marquese Chriss last summer in the draft after watching his pre-draft workout. ""The type of things he did athletically above the rim I hadn't seen done before,"" Watson said. ""I wanted to shut the workout down after the first 10 minutes. To me it was a no-brainer."" The 19-year-old Chriss has been solid for the Suns while learning on the job. His demeanor on and off the court reminds Watson of his former teammate, Russell Westbrook. ""Russ had this demeanor off the court of just the nicest person in the world but you get him on the court and you think he can't be a nice person in real life,"" Watson said. ""Marquese kind of has that same thing."" Chriss was in foul trouble Thursday and was held to five points in eight minutes.","400900113"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Gordon Hayward was all smiles late Thursday night, and for good reasons. He officially became an All-Star in the afternoon and the Utah Jazz got back in the win column hours later. Hayward scored 24 points to help the Jazz beat the Los Angeles Lakers 96-88. The Jazz ended a two-game losing streak and the Lakers have now dropped eight of their last nine. ""It sounds nice,"" Hayward said about being an All-Star. ""Definitely just rewarding for a lot of work that I did. Definitely wouldn't have gotten it without my teammates, without the coaches. Put in a lot of work in this summer with Johnnie Bryant and Isaiah Wright. ""We've been a lot more successful this year than in past years. I've always said, when a team's successful the individual accolades come after that."" Utah used a 16-0 run in the third quarter, punctuated by a Joe Ingles-to-Hayward alley-oop to give the Jazz a 68-56 lead that they never relinquished. The stretch was jump-started by Rudy Gobert's rim protection on the defensive end as the Lakers went more than six minutes without scoring. He finished with six blocks, matching his season-high. The Lakers answered with a 14-4 fourth-quarter run, but never got closer than 80-76. ""I don't think we're playing real well right now,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""It's not surprising given the amount of games we've played recently and re-integrating certain players -- every week there's a new guy that's able to play. What that does is, it affects your rhythm. ""The beginning of the third quarter Rudy took the game over on the defensive end. That's how we're going to win."" Hayward had another efficient night, shooting 7 for 14 from the field while George Hill chipped in 12. The short-handed Lakers struggled to find offense against the best scoring defense in the league were just 4 for 14 from 3-point range. Lou Williams scored a team-high 20 off the bench while both Jordan Clarkson and Ivica Zubac added 16. ""We went dry,"" Lakers forward Larry Nance Jr. said. ""Couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. Our offense just wasn't clicking for us tonight."" TIP-INS Lakers: Julius Randle did not start due to a viral infection. Lakers coach Luke Walton said he was available in case of emergency. ... Tarik Black started for the first time this season. ... D'Angelo Russell missed his third consecutive game due to an MCL sprain and calf strain. ... Russell and rookie Brandon Ingram were selected to compete in the Rising Stars Challenge Jazz: Rodney Hood returned to the starting lineup after missing five games with a knee hyperextension and bone bruise. ... Trey Lyles and Dante Exum were selected for the Rising Stars Challenge. ALL-STAR DEBUT Hayward was named a reserve on the Western Conference All-Star team Thursday, his first time making the team. The seven-year veteran is the first Jazz player to reach the All-Star team since Deron Williams in 2010-11. He entered Thursday averaging a career-high 21.8 points and 5.7 rebounds to go along with 3.5 assists and 1.0 steals. OUTSIDE LOOKING IN Gobert did not make the All-Star team. The 7-foot-1 Frenchman leads the league in blocks (118), defensive rating (97.8), true shooting percentage (.682) and points per shot (1.88) and is second in field goal percentage (.664) and offensive rebounds (176) and third in total rebounds (591). ""I'm frustrated, but it's not what I play for,"" Gobert said. ""I play to win games. I try to keep improving every day. You know, that's how it is. There's some things you can't control sometimes and I make sure I control what I can control. ""I thought I had a chance, but I already knew how it works in this league. I thought I had a chance, but I wasn't counting on it."" Gobert smirked when asked if it's motivation for the future and said, ""That's a dumb question.""

""He's probably the best shot blocker in the league and he showed us why tonight.""","400900114"
"PHILADELPHIA -- The 76ers closely guarded Houston's potent 3-point threats rather than double-team James Harden, and the Rockets' All-Star guard made them pay with a memorable offensive performance. Harden scored 51 points and added 13 rebounds and 13 assists to lead the Rockets to a 123-118 victory over Joel Embiid and Philadelphia on Friday night. Harden became the first player in league history with multiple 50-point triple-double performances in a single season. He scored 53 points and added 16 rebounds and 17 assists in a win over the New York Knicks on New Year's Eve. There now have been three 50-point triple-doubles this season (Russell Westbrook has the other one) after there were just six in the first 70 seasons of the NBA. Harden, who had 19 of his points in the third quarter Friday night, has posted at least 30 points and 10 assists in 18 games this season. The NBA's second-leading scorer, he finished two points shy of tying his career high from that Dec. 31 game. He was 16-for-28 from the field, including 6-for-11 from 3-point range, while making 13 of 14 free throws. ""He played about as good as you can play,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""I've been around a lot of players, but it doesn't get much better than that. I've never seen better than that."" Harden recognized Philadelphia's strategy and took advantage. ""Just tried to be aggressive [in] attack mode and make plays for my teammates,"" he said. ""They weren't leaving our shooters, so we had to figure different ways to be aggressive and attack them. In the second half, we figured it out."" Harden had 36 points at halftime. Nene added 21 points for the Rockets, who snapped a two-game skid while winning for just the fourth time in 10 games. Embiid had 32 points and seven rebounds in his return to the lineup after missing the previous two games with a knee contusion. Embiid, who was questionable until about 45 minutes before tipoff, showed that he was just fine with an emphatic, left-handed dunk over Nene for Philadelphia's first two points, drawing loud cheers from the 76ers' crowd. ""You're not going to see a more jaw-dropping play in the league, really,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. It was also the 7-foot-2 center's first game since Thursday's announcement that he was not among the reserves chosen for the All-Star Game, which some in Philadelphia considered a snub. ""He's a problem,"" Harden said. ""Big, athletic, can shoot the 3. He has an extremely bright future as you can see."" The streaking 76ers lost for just the third time in the past 11 games. The Rockets were without second-leading scorer Eric Gordon, who missed his second straight game with a back injury. But the relentless Harden made up for Gordon's absence. ""You saw a legitimate candidate for MVP,"" Brown said. Philadelphia's coach didn't second-guess his decision not to double-team Harden. ""You have to pick your poison,"" he said. ""You say, 'What sword are we going to die on?' And you saw it."" Houston snapped a 61-all halftime tie with a 12-0 run over the first 2:51 of the second half. Harden scored 10 of the points, including a dunk that made it 75-63. Houston's lead reached as high as 13 in the period, and the Rockets entered the fourth ahead 94-82 after Harden's step-back baseline jumper as time expired. Embiid scored eight straight to open the fourth quarter, drawing roars from the capacity crowd that has become the new norm in Philadelphia these days after he hit his second straight 3-pointer to make it 94-90 with 10:47 to play. But the Rockets scored the next six points, and Philadelphia never got closer than four the rest of the way. Nik Stauskas pulled the 76ers within five at 117-112 with 52.8 seconds to play on a reverse layup. After a miss by Houston, Nene blocked Embiid's 3-point attempt with 20 seconds left to seal the victory. Embiid's health Embiid said afterward that his knee injury is a bone bruise and that doctors said he would need two to three weeks to heal. He injured the knee Jan. 20 versus Portland. ""It's a little bit sore,"" Embiid said. ""But I felt great. I think I could have done more to help us win, especially on the defensive end."" Electric atmosphere Philadelphia's home fans were loud and raucous, something that had been missing during the team's rebuild over the previous three seasons. Harden took note. ""Exciting,"" Harden said. ""Philly fans are always exciting. The atmosphere was good. It got me going a little bit. I'm sure it got my teammates going. It's always fun to play in games like that.""

"CLEVELAND --  LeBron James thinks a rocky January can help the Cleveland Cavaliers in the long run. ""The road to a championship or the road to success shouldn't be a bed of roses,"" he said after scoring 31 points Friday night in a 124-116 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. ""It's never been my road. I shouldn't expect anything different. So having bumps in the road, I think it builds character."" Kyrie Irving added 28 points and the Cavaliers ended a turbulent week with a much-needed victory. The NBA champions had lost three straight and six of eight while James questioned whether the organization was fully committed to winning a second title. The Cavaliers took advantage of a timely visit from the NBA's worst team. Irving scored 20 points, and James added 10 in the third quarter when Cleveland built an 86-62 lead. Kevin Love, named to the All-Star team Thursday, had 13 points and 14 rebounds. ""Yeah, I feel better,"" said Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue, whose team is 6-7 this month. ""It feels good to get a win anyway you can get it."" The Nets have lost four straight and 15 of their last 16. Brooklyn played without leading scorer Brook Lopez (rest) and top rebounder Trevor Booker (illness). Sean Kilpatrick led Brooklyn with 18 points, and Bojan Bogdanovic had 17. James criticized the roster's construction following a loss to New Orleans, which played without All-Star Anthony Davis, on Monday. He met with his teammates, Lue and general manager David Griffin, prior to a loss to Sacramento on Wednesday. Griffin said he understood James' frustration, but took issue with the four-time MVP's assertion that the Cavs appeared satisfied with one title. Asked Friday about his relationship with owner Dan Gilbert, James said, ""He's the owner of the team, I'm one of the players on the team. It's not about me and it's not about him, so, it's a non issue."" The controversy has left Lue dealing with a distraction while his team has gone through its toughest stretch of the season, but Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson knew the Cavaliers might take out their frustrations on his team. ""Putting them on edge isn't the best thing in the world (for us),"" Atkinson said. Cleveland led by 11 in the first half and took a 55-47 lead into halftime on Richard Jefferson's 3-pointer at the buzzer. James and Irving took over in the third as Cleveland raced to a 24-point advantage. Brooklyn scored nine straight points and trailed 86-73, but Irving hit two 3-pointers and scored on a drive to the basket, pushing the lead to 94-73. BREAK TIME? The Cavaliers began a stretch of three games in four days, which ends with a back-to-back set at home against Oklahoma City on Sunday and Monday at Dallas. ""We've been looking at resting a couple of guys a little bit down the road,"" he said. ""Not sure what game. We've got to get to playing right first. Once we start winning again then we'll look at resting guys."" TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn dressed 10 players.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Indiana coach Nate McMillan wanted the Pacers to get tough Friday night. Paul George made sure they did with a finishing flurry. He scored the last six points of regulation to force overtime then gave the Pacers the lead three times in overtime to lead Indiana back from a 16-point third-quarter deficit for a 115-111 victory over Sacramento. ""I told our guys before the game tonight, we won't play another game like this unless we play Sacramento again. It's old school basketball,"" McMillan said. George thrived with that style to help the Pacers win for the second straight night. He finished with 33 points in 45 minutes, made 16 of 17 free throws, grabbed four rebounds and had three assists -- and the stat line didn't even do his effort justice. At the end of regulation and again at the end of overtime, George doubled down on DeMarcus Cousins both times and allowed his teammates to come up with crucial blocks. His teammates pitched in, too. Jeff Teague fell just short of his first career triple double, finishing with 17 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. C.J. Miles had 18 points on six 3-pointers and Myles Turner scored 14 points and had four assists. But it was George's scoring punch that allowed the Pacers to close the 16-point deficit to six after three, to erase an 11-point deficit with 6:30 left in regulation and finally steal a win. ""It's a gut check that we're not as bad as what the score is showing right now,"" George said when asked about playing from behind. ""I give my guys credit for always staying in the game, staying in the fight, regardless of how the game is going."" Cousins had 26 points and 16 rebounds but missed three shots in the last 60 seconds of regulation including an alley-oop lay in at the buzzer. Darren Collison also had 26 points for Sacramento, which has lost six of eight. The Pacers forced overtime by closing regulation on a 17-5 run. George then opened overtime with a driving layup to give Indiana its first lead since early in the second quarter and after the teams each traded two baskets, George made a 21-footer with 35 seconds left to make it 113-111. Teague's two free throws with 2.0 seconds to go sealed it. ""We had them on their heels the whole game but not in the last five minutes,"" Collison said. ""They became more aggressive, they were being more physical."" TIP-INS Kings: Coach Dave Joerger and Pacers coach Nate McMillan wore bow ties in honor of Michael H. Goldberg, who served as executive director of the NBA's coaching union for nearly four decades. He died late last week at age 73. ... ... Matt Barnes and McMillan traded words during a timeout in the fourth quarter but nothing was called. ... Sacramento was 11 of 16 on 3-pointers in the first half but went 2 of 10 in the second half and overtime. ... Kosta Koufos had 12 rebounds. Pacers: George has scored 30 points in three straight games. ... Miles moved past Austin Croshere (376) for No.  8 on the Pacers' career list for 3s during their NBA era. Miles has 382. ... The Pacers swept the season series for the first time since 2013-14. APOLOGIES Before the game, Joerger went out of his way to apologize to the Cleveland Cavaliers for the team's Twitter post following Wednesday night's 116-112 overtime victory. The image had a sword through the letter ""L"" instead of the Cavs' usual letter ""C."" Joerger brought up the subject unprompted and said he didn't know how it happened. ""That is their (the Cavs) logo and that is something that needs to be apologized for,"" Joerger said. ""That should not have happened."" BACK-TO-BACK Coming into the game, the Pacers were just 1-7 on the second night of back-to-backs this season. So McMillan challenged the Pacers to change course and they did. ""It was just the will to come out and get this game,"" Turner said.","400900117"
"BOSTON -- Three quarters was plenty of time for Isaiah Thomas to extend his streak of scoring at least 20 points. Thomas made it 30 games in a row with 21 points, then got to watch the entire fourth quarter from the bench as the Boston Celtics routed the Orlando Magic 128-98 on Friday night. ""All we really care about is the win, but it was great to get our first blowout of the year and be able to rest in the fourth quarter,"" Thomas said. ""The whole team played a great game tonight."" Rookie Jaylen Brown added a career-high 20 points, Jae Crowder scored 19 and Kelly Olynyk made all seven shots he attempted, finishing with 16 points. It was the most points the Celtics have scored this season, five better than Boston's total in a 127-123 overtime loss to Portland on Jan. 21. The Celtics' previous high score in regulation came in a 128-122 loss to the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers on Nov. 3. The Celtics closed the first quarter on a 15-0 run and continued pulling away from there to their widest margin this season. ""I thought our shooting and the way we shared the ball were really good,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""The shooting will come and go, but hopefully we can keep sharing the ball like that. That was good."" The Celtics outscored Orlando 36-17 in the third quarter and finished the game with 39 assists, 11 coming from Marcus Smart and eight from Thomas. Boston also dominated inside, outscoring Orlando 54-34 in the paint and outrebounded the Magic 47-37. ""It's good to get one of those wins,"" Thomas said. ""We haven't had one this season, so it was good for our confidence. We played the right way tonight and we took care of business."" Nikola Vucevic and Damjan Rudez finished with 14 points apiece to lead the Magic, who trailed by as much as 40 and lost their third straight and fell to 3-11 in January. ""I think we're frustrated,"" coach Frank Vogel said ""I think we're undermanned and we have guys trying to perform roles outside their realm. It doesn't look pretty right now."" It certainly didn't Friday night. Boston topped 100 points before the end of the third period and got a bonus at the end when Terry Rozier went to the line with the clock reset to 1 second after a video review. Rozier made both foul shots and the Celtics led 104-65 entering the fourth quarter. Boston held a 68-48 halftime lead after shooting 61 percent (28 of 46) in the first half. The Celtics outrebounded the Magic 25-16 in the first two periods and outscored Orlando 38-28 in the paint. The second half was much like the first. Elfrid Payton converted a three-point play for the Magic that cut the margin to 79-59 with 7:07 left in the third. Thomas answered with a 20-foot jumper that got the Celtics going on a 22-5 run. Thomas added a 3-pointer and set up Jonas Jerebko for a layup, followed by another miss by the Magic and fastbreak the other way for a layup by Smart. Crowder hit a 3-pointer to make it 93-62, then stole the ball from Bismack Biyombo and Thomas converted the turnover into another 3-pointer. KING OF NEW ENGLAND With the outcome all but decided, Boston fans got a running start on the Super Bowl with chants of ""Brady!"" throughout fourth quarter after a fan appeared on the scoreboard monitor wearing a No. 12 Patriots jersey. MAGIC MELTDOWN The Celtics' shooting was above 60 percent until dropping off slightly in the fourth quarter. Vogel credited Boston for hitting the shots, but felt his own players contributed to the Celtics' shooting success. ""We're not playing like good defensive players and I'm not tying these guys together like a good defensive coach. It's a collective failure right now on that end that we have to get right,"" he said. ROAD REST The Celtics had a late night ahead with a flight to Milwaukee for a game Saturday, so it was an easy choice for Stevens to rest his starters and let Boston's reserves finish off the rout. ""We've got a lot of games this week, so hopefully that's a good thing,"" Stevens said. TIP-INS Magic: Payton had 12 points and had seven assists, and Aaron Gordon scored 13 points for the Magic. ... G D.J. Augustin returned to the lineup after missing Tuesday's loss to Chicago with a sore right foot. ... G Evan Fournier (sore right foot) participated in some of the morning shootaround, but did not dress and missed his seventh straight game. Celtics: Boston's 68 points in the first half was the most the Celtics have scored in the first two periods this season, topping 64 points in the first half of the opener at Brooklyn. ... Thomas was selected as a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the second straight year. ... C Al Horford (groin) sat out Friday, but was probable to play Saturday night at Milwaukee, Stevens said. ... G Avery Bradley (sore right Achilles' tendon) missed his fifth straight game.","400900118"
"TORONTO --  Faced with the prospect of the Toronto Raptors losing six straight games for the first time in more than four years, Kyle Lowry certainly lived up to his All-Star billing. With 32 points and six assists in a game-high 38:45 of court time, the recently named Eastern Conference All-Star drove the Raptors to a 102-86 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night. In the process, the Raptors snapped their longest losing streak of the season at five games, beating the Bucks for the seventh consecutive time and 13th in the last 14 meetings. ""We needed to get off this losing streak and everybody felt that tonight and we had an opportunity to do it,"" Lowry said. ""Friday night, our home crowd, we tried our best to win the game and we did it."" With fellow All-Star and leading scorer DeMar DeRozan sidelined for a third straight game due to a sprained ankle, it fell to Lowry to lead the Raptors in scoring for the third outing in a row. He shot 9 of 18 from the floor. ""I thought he stepped up. The bigger the moment, he performs,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. ""It is the reason he is a three-time All-Star; he carried us."" While Lowry captured the plaudits, Casey was equally complimentary of his team's defensive play, a sore point for the Raptors' coach during the losing streak. He singled out the play of DeMarre Carroll on another Eastern Conference All-Star, Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was held to 19 points, six rebounds and a game-high eight assists after burning the Raptors in the team's two previous meetings this season. ""I compared him to Magic Johnson at this stage,"" Casey said of the Bucks' forward. ""He has the same skill set and once he starts shooting that jump shot, he's going to be dangerous. I thought DeMarre did an excellent job on him."" Having trailed since the 4:49 mark of the first quarter and by as many as 19 at one point, the Bucks clawed to within seven entering the fourth. But powered by 3-pointers from Lowry and Patrick Patterson, the Raptors started the final period on a 13-5 run to take control again, handing Milwaukee its seventh loss in eight games. Bucks coach Jason Kidd acknowledged his team ""didn't do a good job"" on Lowry. But after getting back into the game at the start of the fourth, he was disappointed Milwaukee couldn't push on from there. ""That group in the second quarter got us back in the game,"" Kidd said. ""From there, it's a 77-70 ballgame as bad as we were playing. We just got off to a bad start in the fourth quarter."" Jabari Parker led the way for the Bucks with 21 points and a career high-tying 13 rebounds for his first double-double of the season. While he said the team was remaining positive, he highlighted the poor start as really making it an uphill battle for the Bucks. After jumping out to an 11-5 lead, Milwaukee was unable to stop the Raptors from responding with a 31-6 run in the first quarter. ""That's where the game was lost, right in the first few minutes of the game,"" Parker said. ""We always trailed from there and it's bad playing with a deficit."" TIP-INS Bucks: Having entered the game leading the NBA in points in the paint with an average of 50.9, Milwaukee was held to 44. ... Milwaukee was outrebounded 47-43. Raptors: DeRozan (right ankle) missed his third straight game. ... With his 11 rebounds, the Raptors improved to 17-8 this season when Jonas Valanciunas reaches double digits in boards. DON'T LOOK NOW Toronto has been second in the Eastern Conference for most of the season, but the recent five-game losing streak has the Raptors looking over their shoulder as Boston, Atlanta and Washington are all within 2 1/2 games. Casey is anything but surprised, though. ""Like I said, it's going to be a dog fight between two and four, five,"" he said. ""That group is all right there together, a lot of equal teams, so we've got to get ready for that mentally and physically."" NORTH STAR Lowry was given a standing ovation midway through the first quarter as a Jumbotron presentation recognized the guard for his third consecutive All-Star nod. Lowry was voted on as an Eastern Conference reserve Thursday and will join DeRozan at next month's game in New Orleans, the third time in franchise history that the Raptors will send two players to the game. FINDING THEIR TOUCH After shooting just 26 percent (36 of 140) from 3-point range during their five-game losing streak, Toronto started to heat up from beyond the arc, converting on 40 percent of its attempts Friday night as six players connected.","400900119"
"NEW YORK -- The New York Knicks know there isn't much time left to make a playoff push. There may be less time for Carmelo Anthony and his teammates to convince management to keep them together. Anthony shook off some boos and a rough shooting night to score 18 points, Courtney Lee added 16 against his former team and the Knicks beat the Charlotte Hornets 110-107 on Friday night. Anthony finished 8 for 26 from the field and had just one basket in the fourth, but it was a big one, a jumper with 13 seconds left and the Knicks clinging to a two-point lead. Lee carried the Knicks while Anthony struggled, scoring nine straight New York points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:39 left. Lee came to the Knicks in the summer after helping the Hornets to the playoffs last season. ""I think our sense of urgency is picking up and we realize that we can't keep saying it's early in the season,"" Lee said. ""We're four or five games out of the playoffs, I think we realize now that time is running out."" The Knicks are actually only two games behind eighth-place Chicago, despite some prolonged struggles after a 16-13 start. That has put the attention squarely on Anthony's future in New York. He has a no-trade clause and can stay in New York as long as he wants, but that hasn't stopped speculation that his time here could be nearing an end, with a few reports that the Knicks have been trying to find a deal. If they do, it would seem to signal that President of Basketball Operations Phil Jackson is giving up on this group. Perhaps a strong stretch before the Feb. 23 trade deadline would make him think otherwise. ""I don't think we're playing out there to be convincing,"" Anthony said. ""I think we understand what's at stake right now, and that's having an opportunity to creep back up there in one of those top eight spots."" Kemba Walker had 31 points and 10 rebounds for Charlotte a night after being chosen as an All-Star for the first time. Marvin Williams added 17 points but the Hornets made just seven baskets and had a long dry spell in the fourth quarter. ""We just missed shots,"" Walker said. ""I thought we got great shots. Shots that we normally knock down we kind of missed them, especially me. I thought I got some great looks but just didn't drop."" Kristaps Porzingis also scored 18 points for the Knicks, getting off to a strong start but finishing the game on the bench after fouling out. Brandon Jennings, getting extra playing time after Derrick Rose was hurt, scored 15 points. Anthony added 11 rebounds but frustrated fans with his shooting. He was booed on some misses, including some loud ones after he was way off on one attempt in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte fell to 0-7 on the road in January. ... Jeremy Lamb was active but didn't play after missing the last seven games with an inflamed metatarsal. ... Cody Zeller sat out his second straight game with a bruised quadriceps Knicks: Rose sprained his left ankle in the third quarter and left the game with 13 points. The Knicks said X-rays were negative. NO-STAR Anthony wasn't elected a starter for the All-Star Game by fans for the first time since coming to the Knicks and wasn't voted a reserve by Eastern Conference coaches. ""A little disappointed but at this point there's kind of bigger things to worry about,"" he said. ""As a competitor you want to participate in that weekend, knowing how much fun it is, knowing the importance of kind of being down there, and just enjoying that break, that's something that I'll miss the most."" NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME The Knicks had their game against the Lakers on Monday, Feb. 6 dropped from TNT's coverage lineup on Friday. The network will instead show Cleveland at Washington as the opener of that night's doubleheader. MISS ME? The Hornets liked Lee but re-signing Nicolas Batum was their priority last summer. Lee was asked if his old teammates missed him Friday. ""A couple of them said that, but they had their opportunity,"" he said.","400900120"
"CHICAGO -- The mantra of every struggling team is to keep working and things will eventually turn around. Although it rarely works out that way, the Miami Heat are trying to be the exception. Goran Dragic had 26 points and 11 assists, Willie Reed scored 20 points and Dion Waiters added 19 to lead the Heat to their sixth straight win Friday night, a 100-88 victory over the bickering Chicago Bulls. Dragic was asked what has pleased him most about the streak following an 11-30 start. ""That we're doing it as a team,"" he said. ""We're playing for each other, we're fighting for each other. Everybody's feeling comfortable. We know what we need to do. As long as we take care of business with the defense, we feel like can play with anyone."" Dwyane Wade had 15 points to lead the Bulls, who began the day with a team meeting and ended it with a second straight frustrating loss. Wade and Jimmy Butler started the controversy when they questioned the desire of the team's younger players following a loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday. Rajon Rondo fired back a day later, criticizing Wade and Butler in an Instagram post. All three players were fined, and Wade and Butler were held out of the starting lineup as punishment. ""We obviously had a very emotional day,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""It's not an excuse for how we played. It's the worst game we've played all year, in my opinion."" Butler was the first off bench and received a loud ovation from the United Center crowd when he checked in with 6:53 remaining in the first quarter. Wade also received a loud ovation when he entered 28 seconds later. Rondo, though, was greeted by some boos when he checked in with 5:05 to go in the first. Whether it was the controversy or coming off the bench, Butler never developed a rhythm and finished with just three points on 1-for-13 shooting. ""I'll be back,"" he said. ""I promise I will be back. I am not worried at all."" Miami took control with a 24-14 advantage in the third quarter to break open a tie game at halftime. The Bulls tried to rally in the fourth, but the Heat answered every charge. ""I liked our toughness, in the second half especially,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. TIP INS Heat: C Hassan Whiteside didn't play because of a sprained right ankle suffered Wednesday night against Brooklyn. Bulls: Part of the frustration for Wade and Butler against the Hawks was losing a game in which they combined for 73 of the Bulls' 114 points. It was the first time they each had scored at least 30 points in a game this season. MEDIA UNFRIENDLY Besides Wade and Butler not starting, all three players were fined for airing grievances in the media and on social media. General manager Gar Forman made his displeasure known in the team meeting and in individual talks with the players. ""It's not how we want to operate,"" Forman said. ""It is totally unacceptable, and we made it very clear to the players that were involved that it's unacceptable. It's a distraction that's not needed. I think it's a detriment to team growth."" NO REGRETS With the controversy and recent struggles, Wade was asked if he had any second thoughts about signing with the Bulls after spending his first 13 seasons with the Heat. ""I've been happy,"" he said. ""The process of losing ballgames is never fun. ... I'm not having fun being an average team, from that standpoint, but I am enjoying the journey."" MOVING ON As part of his Instagram post, Rondo said his ""vets"" with the Celtics didn't take days off, a clear shot at Wade. ""I could take that as a personal attack,"" he said. ""But what's that going to do for me? Come in here and fight Rajon because he said his vets practiced every day? I'm 35. I'm not practicing every day. That's very clear.""","400900121"
"NEW ORLEANS -- Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry's smile and laugh gave him the look of a coach who was practically giddy about a second victory over an elite team in five days. Yet his words and tone told the story of coach still trying to figure out why his team is so erratic. Jrue Holiday scored 23 points, Anthony Davis had 16 and tied a career high with 22 rebounds, and New Orleans snapped San Antonio's five-game winning streak with a 119-103 victory Friday night. ""We're capable of beating anybody,"" said Gentry, whose team beat Cleveland on Monday. ""Obviously, this week we've kind of proven that with wins over the world champs and then a team that's going to have an opportunity to win a world championship. ""That says a lot but we keep going back to that word, `consistency,"" added Gentry, whose team lost to league-worst Brooklyn last week and trails Denver by two games for the Western Conference's final playoff spot. ""We can't do it just against the great teams. ... We've got to do it against the teams that are struggling -- like we are -- to get into the playoffs."" The Spurs had been winning lately despite having starters Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker sidelined with nagging injuries. San Antonio fell with both back on the court. Leonard, returning from sore left hand that caused him to miss two games, scored 23, but showed some rustiness, missing 10 of 16 shots. Parker, who'd sat out four games with a sore left foot, hit only two of seven shots and one miss was a momentum-stalling air ball from the right corner in the final five minutes. ""We ran out of gas. New Orleans was aggressive. They played great for 48 minutes. They moved the ball, hit the boards hard and got loose balls,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Kawhi did a good job. Tony, again, hasn't played in 10 days."" Terrence Jones scored 21 points and Solomon Hill added 16 points -- including 5-of-7 shooting from 3-point range -- for New Orleans, which made 10 of 20 3-point shots in the second half to finish 13 of 30 from deep. LaMarcus Aldridge had 14 points and 13 rebounds, and Davis Bertans added 14 points for the Spurs, who trailed by only a point to start the fourth quarter. But the Pelicans were composed at home and pulled away thanks to late surges by Jones, who scored 11 in the fourth quarter; Tyreke Evans, who scored nine of his 11 points in the final period; and Hill, who scored seven points down the stretch. New Orleans' lead grew to 21 on Davis' soaring, one-handed, put-back dunk, which made it 119-98 with 1:25 to go. Asked why such performances have been more elusive than routine for New Orleans, Davis said it was ""a mental thing."" ""No matter who we have on the floor or who we're playing against, we need to move the basketball, play for each other, and play defensively,"" Davis said. ""We did that tonight. We did it against Cleveland."" New Orleans held a slim lead after one quarter, but Leonard asserted himself offensively in the second, when his 14 points helped fuel a 37-point period for the Spurs. David Lee also was active inside in the first half, with 10 points that included a pair of dunks and two put-backs. The Spurs briefly led by as many as 11 before Holiday's 9-foot pull-up made it 57-48 at halftime. ""We had a great first half,"" Parker said. ""In the second half, they were shooting the ball very well. They made a lot of 3s, so we have to give them credit."" GAME LEGS Donatas Motiejunas, signed earlier this month and playing his 10th game, scored 10 points, reaching at least that many for a third straight game. He also had seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks -- one from behind on Bertans' fast-break layup attempt. ""I feel more and more confident out there and all the players are starting to trust me,"" Motiejunas said. ""What I see is we're super talented and any time we beat a good team, our noses go up and the average team comes in and teaches us a lesson. ... We need to learn from these things."" TIP-INS Spurs: Leonard scored fewer than 30 for the first time in six games. ... Aldridge has nine double-doubles. ... San Antonio fell to 20-5 on the road.

""It's real hard to stop us, especially when we're making shots. We're just one of those teams with a lot of firepower. Tonight was one of those nights."" Otto Porter Jr. had 21 points and 11 rebounds, John Wall scored 19 and the Wizards moved within a half-game of the Southeast Division lead by romping past the Atlanta Hawks 112-86 on Friday night. Washington has won three straight and 10 of 12, improving to 20-8 since Dec. 5. Kent Bazemore scored 15 and Dwight Howard had 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Hawks, suddenly clinging to that slim lead in the Southeast. They had won 12 of 15 and were coming off an inspiring victory with a late rally Wednesday at Chicago. Atlanta's momentum fizzled not long after the opening tip. The Hawks never led, and they lost by at least 23 points for the fifth time this season. ""There's nothing to sum up,"" guard Tim Hardaway Jr. said. ""We got our butts kicked, plain and simple."" All five Washington starters scored in double figures for the 15th time this season, most in the NBA. Marcin Gortat, Bradley Beal and Morris each had 15 points. Hawks forward Paul Millsap, selected to his fourth straight All-Star team this week, scored a season-low four points. ""We just came out lackadaisical,"" he said. ""We didn't give them any resistance. They could go wherever they wanted to go, shoot whenever they wanted to shoot. I think it's more on us. We have to focus on ourselves and figure it out."" Morris kept Millsap in check by limiting his effectiveness in the paint. ""He's one of the best players in the league,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""He had an off night. Some of it was us, but he's hard to stop, and I thought (Morris) did a good job of making him take tough shots."" Washington took the first of two 14-point leads in the first quarter on Beal's 3-pointer. The Wizards went up by 16 early in the second on Beal's layup and took a 25-point lead in the final minute before halftime on Porter's 3. Wall's layup made it a 30-point advantage midway through the third. TIP-INS Wizards: Outrebounded the Hawks 52-41. ... Have won three of four on the road but are just 7-14 overall away from home. ...

Howard wore a Julio Jones jersey during pregame introductions, and mascot Harry the Hawk was in a Matt Ryan jersey. Late in the second quarter, Falcons running back Devonta Freeman and receiver Mohamed Sanu were introduced to a rousing ovation.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard wasn't saying whether he had extra individual motivation down the stretch against the Memphis Grizzlies. But there was no doubt the Portland guard, passed over for the All-Star Game, was determined. Lillard scored 33 points, including 13 straight late in the fourth quarter, and the Trail Blazers held off the Grizzlies 112-109 on Friday night. ""Obviously, Dame carried us,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""It was good to see him have a stretch like that. He hasn't had one of those in a while."" Allen Crabbe added 23 points off the bench for the Blazers, who have won three straight for the first time since early December. Mason Plumlee had his fourth double-double in a row with 13 points and 10 rebounds. Marc Gasol, coming off a career-high 42 points Wednesday in a victory over Toronto, scored 32 for the Grizzlies. Zach Randolph added 17 points and 13 rebounds. Portland led by 18 in the first half, but the Grizzlies closed the gap in the third quarter and the teams traded the lead in the fourth. Lillard gave Portland a 97-96 lead with a step-back jumper with 5:40 left, then added a 3-pointer to extend it. Randolph answered with a layup for the Grizzlies, but Lillard hit another 3 to push it to 103-98. After Mike Conley made a 3-pointer for the Grizzlies, Lillard added his third straight 3 to give Portland a 106-103 edge with 3:45 to go. ""We tried to trap him,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""We had our best defender on him. But he made some right in Tony Allen's face. You couldn't guard it any better. ... He was nailing the ones he needed to make."" Conley made a pair of free throws with 1:31 remaining to get the Grizzlies to 110-109 before CJ McCollum's floater provided the final margin. McCollum finished with 18 points. Lillard had just eight points in the second and third quarters. He finished the fourth with 15. ""You've got to have a short-term memory. Whenever the game's on the line, whatever has happened leading up to that point, you've got to be able to forget about it,"" he said. Asked afterward if he had any extra motivation Friday night because he was left off the Western Conference All-Star team, Lillard shook his head: ""No comment,"" he said. In a TV interview coming off the court, Lillard said the snub did drive him. ""Anytime something like happens, you've got to find the right place to put it,"" he said. Portland was without Ed Davis for the third straight game because of a left wrist injury. Maurice Harkless missed his second game with a calf injury. The Grizzlies had starters JaMychal Green and Chandler Parsons back in the lineup after both missed a 101-99 victory at home over Toronto. Both had left knee issues. Memphis was without rookie Deyonta Davis because of personal reasons. There was a scary moment when Lillard slipped on the floor, but he continued playing and returned to start the second half. Trailing 62-56 at the break, the Grizzlies closed to 64-60 on Conley's 3-pointer. Memphis narrowed it again to 76-74 on Gasol's jumper, but Crabbe answered with consecutive 3-pointers for the Blazers. Vince Carter made the second of two free throws to finally give Memphis the lead at 86-85 early in the fourth quarter. Crabbe matched his career high with his sixth 3-pointer to put Portland up 90-88 with 10 minutes left. The Blazers held onto the lead until Randolph's layup put Memphis back in front 94-93. Conley finished with 17 points and 10 assists. TIP-INS Grizzlies: It was the opener of a six-game road trip for Memphis. The 10-day journey is the longest for the Grizzlies since they were gone for six games between March 24 and April 1, 2007. ... Carter turned 40 on Thursday. Trail Blazers: Stotts suggested before the game that perhaps the Blazers' record, at seven games under .500, had something to do with why Lillard and McCollum were snubbed for the All-Star Game.  ""Disappointment,"" Stotts said. ""I think both are playing at an All-Star level."" GASOL HONORED After his 42-point performance against the Raptors, Gasol learned he had made the West reserves for the All-Star Game. Fizdale said the center was deserving of the honor. ""We're lucky to have a big guy like that and an All-Star like that,"" the coach said. ""He's really starting to take a stronghold on becoming a superstar and really attacking it and embracing it. It's fun to watch.""","400900124"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  While DeMarcus Cousins had another huge night, the All-Star was more excited about getting some big-time help from his teammates. Cousins had 35 points and 18 rebounds, and four others Kings had at least 13 points as the Sacramento Kings beat the Charlotte Hornets 109-106 on Saturday night for their third win in the last four games. Darren Collison had 17 points, Anthony Tolliver added 14 and Aaron Afflalo and Willie Cauley-Stein chipped in with 13 apiece for the Kings (19-28). ""It makes my job a whole lot easier,"" said Cousins, who has 27 double-doubles this season. ""Guys have been great lately. They are believing. Their confidence is high, which we need, and we're just on the right path and we feel it."" Cousins scored the go-ahead basket with 14.3 seconds left on a driving layup from the right side of the lane, saying the only thing he saw was ""the basket."" ""We are realizing what is going to win us games and it's not iso(lation) basketball,"" Cousins said. ""When we are making the defense work and getting the best shot for the team and just finding the open man, we are realizing that is working for us."" But Cousins proved again why he is a dominant force inside with seven offensive rebounds. ""Even when they did miss he got the rebound and put it in,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. The Hornets had a chance to take the lead in the closing seconds as Kemba Walker dished out to an open Frank Kaminsky at the top of the key, but the 7-footer shot an airball with 1 second remaining. Cousins grabbed the rebound and was fouled, making one free throw for the final margin. ""DeMarcus understands that the defense is giving him all sorts of looks,"" Collison said. ""The good thing about DeMarcus that I've seen if he's not scoring ball, he's telling guys to continue to hit their shots. He understands the game."" TIP-INS Kings: Outscored the Hornets 48-38 in the paint. ... Tolliver provided a big lift off the bench in the first half with 11 points on three 3-pointers. Hornets: Walker has 34 20-point games this season. ... Clifford picked up his eighth technical foul of the season in the second quarter after arguing for a charge on Cousins against Walker. ... Walker moved into third place in franchise history in field goals made (2,586), passing Gerald Wallace. He is behind only Dell Curry and Larry Johnson. STOPPING KEMBA Walker had 20 points in the third quarter and appeared to be heating up for a big fourth. But the Kings held him to one shot attempt and no points in the final quarter. When asked what his team did to stop Walker, Kings coach Dave Joerger joked, ""Put some stuff in his water down at their bench down there."" ""He carries a big load for this team,"" Joerger said. ""He's well-deserving of the honor of being an All-Star. I've seen it only twice a year, but it always seems like especially in the last three minutes, you don't want the ball in his hands in a close game. Maybe we got into his legs. We tried to be up in pick-and-rolls and give him looks where you know, smaller guys don't like playing in small spaces. We just tried to take it out of his hands."" TURNOVER ISSUES The Hornets paid Nic Batum $120 million to make plays, and he's certainly doing that with 19 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. But Batum's turnovers are beginning to become a concern. He has 31 in the last eight games, including four games with at least five.","400900125"
"MIAMI --  There was only one quarter in which Miami figured out how to slow down Detroit. That was enough for the Heat. Goran Dragic scored 23 points, Wayne Ellington added 19 and the Heat pushed the NBA's longest current winning streak to seven games by topping the Pistons 116-103 on Saturday night. The Heat outscored Detroit 26-12 in the fourth quarter, holding the Pistons to 30 percent shooting. ""Our toughest, most physical, most committed minutes were there at the end,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""That's what's good to see."" James Johnson scored 18 and Dion Waiters added 17 for the Heat, who tied a season high with 14 3-pointers. Ellington made three in a span of less than two minutes of the fourth quarter as Miami pulled away. Miami was 11-30 at the midway point of its season -- and hasn't lost since. Only Golden State, San Antonio and Houston have put together longer winning streaks this season than the Heat run of late. ""We are clicking on all cylinders,"" Waiters said. ""We're playing together, having fun, and guys are making plays. We're just playing the right way. We're healthy and it's fun."" Reggie Jackson scored 24 for Detroit, which got 17 points and 20 rebounds from Andre Drummond. Tobias Harris added 16 points and Marcus Morris scored 14. ""Down the stretch we were terrible. Terrible,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We didn't make plays. We've got to find better stuff down the stretch. ... I don't know if defenses have us figured out or what, but we're just not making plays."" Ellington's first in that late trio of 3s came with 4:38 left, giving the Heat a nine-point lead. He struck again about a minute later, and the last of those with 2:55 remaining put Miami up 114-101. Miami won despite getting outscored 62-40 in the paint. The Heat more than made up for that by outscoring Detroit 42-12 from 3-point range, and somehow looker fresher down the stretch -- even though Miami was on a back-to-back and Detroit had not played since Monday. ""We had time off to prepare and figure ourselves out and hone in on what's going to separate us from other teams in the fight from teams that are going to fade,"" Jackson said. ""Defensively we've just got to be better."" TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit came in allowing 101 points per game; the Heat got to 101 points with 7:26 remaining. ... Drummond had his 30th double-double of the season secured by halftime. ... The Pistons were averaging 98.5 points entering January; through 12 games this month, they're averaging 106.8 per game.

He finished with nine points and 12 rebounds -- with five points and six boards in the fourth quarter alone.

"MILWAUKEE -- Jae Crowder's mind went quiet in overtime in Boston's fourth game in five nights. ""No pressure,"" he said. Crowder scored four of his 20 points on free throws in the final 28 seconds of overtime and Isaiah Thomas had 37 points to help the Celtics beat the Milwaukee Bucks 112-108 on Saturday night. ""It's always special when I come here and we get a win,"" said Crowder, who played at Marquette. ""I see a lot of familiar faces around the building, including the ushers, stuff like that. It's always a great feeling to come back."" Boston won its third straight after squandering a 16-point second half lead and a 42-point first quarter, its best of the season. ""I thought we played pretty darn well, to be honest, and then defensively and in the overtime I thought we were excellent,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee with 21 points, and Greg Monroe had 14 points and 13 rebounds. The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. Boston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3s to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. ""We're taking a step forward toward the right direction,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We got back into the game, but we weren't mature enough to close it out."" RALLY FALLS SHORT The Bucks trailed 69-53 early in the third quarter, taking the lead briefly with just under 5 minutes to play on a three-point play by Monroe, who scored 10 of his 14 in the final quarter. ""I was just trying to be aggressive,"" Monroe said. ""Just trying to make the right play."" Thomas hit a 3 and the Bucks couldn't tie it again until Monroe hit the first of two free throws with 37 seconds to play that tied it at 102. TIED UP THOMAS Thomas' 3 with 4:33 left was his final points of the night. The Bucks switched up defenses on him, doubling him off screens and forcing him to give up the ball. ""They were face guarding, denying, double-teaming -- they were doing it all,"" Thomas said. When he tried to make plays, he pressed, including missing an off-balance 3-pointer that would've won the game in the closing seconds of regulation. Crowder said it was an important lesson for the Celtics for the future. ""The playoffs, it's not going to be easy, we can't depend on him to do everything in the playoffs on the offensive end,"" Crowder said. ""That's what good teams find a way to do, they find a way to score and a way to get a win without their offensive threat."" MAKER'S MARK First-round draft pick Thon Maker received his second career start in place of center Miles Plumlee. He provided a jolt during Milwaukee's rally in the third quarter, scoring four points and blocking a shot by Thomas that energized the crowd. ""I thought he changed the game in the second half,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""His effort was great, and we'll see how it goes when we get to Utah."" TIP-INS Celtics: Thomas has scored 20 or more in 31 straight games and 30 or more 16 times this season. ... C Al Horford (sore groin) did not travel with the team. ... G Avery Bradley (sore right Achilles' tendon) missed his sixth straight game. ... Gerald Green's 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter gave Boston a 42-27 lead. It was the most points for Boston in any quarter this season. Bucks: Parker had a tough night, going 2 for 13 from the field and finishing with four points. ... It was the first game between these two teams. They'll play twice more this season in Boston on March 29 and April 12.","400900127"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- When Kevin Durant arrived in Golden State this season, Stephen Curry made an extra effort early in the season to make sure his new teammate got his shots. Warriors coach Steve Kerr wanted Curry to know how important it was for him to be aggressive as well. With his first halfcourt buzzer-beater of the season followed by a dazzling quarter, Curry looked just like the player who won the MVP the past two years. Curry scored 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter following his long-range shot to end of the first half, leading the Warriors to their ninth win in 10 games, 144-98 over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night. ""I have to be aggressive,"" Curry said. ""That's the thing about us. We do have a lot of talent. There's a balancing act with it."" Curry had too often deferred early in the season but has been looking for his shot more of late. He had nine 3-pointers against the Clippers on a night that began with his playing status in doubt because of a sore left quad. ""What Steph has realized is he can just be himself and let it fly,"" Kerr said. ""He doesn't have to worry about Kevin or anybody else. We feed off Steph's energy and shooting."" Durant added 23 points and Klay Thompson scored 16 to give Golden State its eighth straight win over its Southern California rival. Blake Griffin scored 20 points for the struggling Clippers, who have lost four of five since star point guard Chris Paul went down with a torn ligament in his left thumb. ""We just got embarrassed on national television so nobody's feeling good right now,"" guard Austin Rivers said. The Warriors broke open the game with a 17-6 run over the final 2:14 of the first half. Draymond Green helped spark it when he blocked Griffin and then beat him back down the floor for a dunk. Curry punctuated the half with his 51-footer to make it 72-51. Curry dove to the floor in celebration before dancing with his teammates. This was his first basket of the year from beyond 40 feet after making four last season. Curry picked it up in the third, when he outscored the Clippers 25-23. He made back-to-back 3s late in the quarter to make it a 34-point game. His eighth 3 of the night in the final minute of the third made it 117-74. ""Coming out, I made my first shot in the third quarter and that just continued the trend,"" Curry said. ""Big mo going into the half and we were able to keep that energy as a group and have an amazing third quarter."" TIP-INS Clippers: DeAndre Jordan made all four shots and is shooting 82 percent over the past six games. Warriors: Golden State outshot its opponent for a 21st straight game, the longest streak in the league since Miami also did it 21 straight in 2004-05, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. ... F Andre Iguodala, playing on his 33rd birthday, recorded his 5,000th career rebound in the first quarter. QUOTABLE Coach Doc Rivers, on if the Warriors have a mental edge on the Clippers: ""Well, they should have one if they don't. ... If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge."" HOMECOMING Clippers forward Marreese Speights played his first regular-season game at Oracle since leaving the Warriors as a free agent in the offseason. He got a warm ovation from the crowd when he checked in for the first time and quickly allowed Curry to blow past him for a layup. Speights finished with five points. ""Mo is one of my favorite people that I have ever been around,"" Kerr said. ""He's just got a smile on his face all the time. He loves to play. He loves to shoot, he's a phenomenal shooter. He was such a pro for us the last couple of years."" SPEAKING OUT Kerr, who has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump, was asked for his reaction to the crackdown on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. He said he didn't want to distract from the game but did say: ""What's happening right now is really scary and disconcerting.""","400900128"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol and Mike Conley took turns carving up the Utah Jazz on Saturday night. Randolph scored a season-high 28 points, Gasol added 18 and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Jazz 102-95. ""We really did a good job of moving the basketball tonight and really playing off one another, especially when one guy has it going,"" Conley said. ""We didn't go away from that. Z-Bo had so many opportunities down low early. We just kept trying to exploit that as long as we could. Then when they took that away, we went to Marc. Then when they took that away, we went to me. ""We were just trying to go down the line and find different areas to attack them."" Randolph bullied defenders in the post throughout the night and Gasol worked the Utah defense both inside and out, routinely hitting turnaround fade-away jumpers and going 4 of 5 on 3-pointers. The Grizzlies took a 52-43 lead into halftime after a 13-2 run gave Memphis a 10-point lead. Randolph had his way with the Jazz post defenders and scored 10 of his 14 first-half points in the second quarter. ""We just continuously moved onto the next play and it gave us a chance to win,"" Grizzlies coach David Fizdale said. The Jazz shot just 26.3 percent from the field in the second quarter and never led in the second half. Conley helped keep the Jazz at bay in the fourth quarter and finished with 23. Rodney Hood led the Jazz with 20 points. ""We did some things that weren't intelligent that made it harder on ourselves,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said about Randolph and Gasol. ""We just weren't disciplined. We come double-team when they hadn't dribbled the ball. But there's a reason you're trying to help, they're as good as they are. ""Those three guys were terrific tonight. They were men. ... They were really, really good. ... We were not a good defensive team tonight. If we're going to play defense like that, we're not going to win many games."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Chandler Parsons did not play due to a planned recovery day. ... Brandon Wright did not play due to a left ankle injury. Fizdale called him day-to-day. ... Deyonta Davis missed his second consecutive game due to personal reasons. ... Memphis has finished two games of a six-game road trip, its longest since 2007. Jazz: Forward Derrick Favors rested and did not play. Trey Lyles started in his place. ... Alec Burks scored double figures for the fourth consecutive game with a season-high 15 points. ROTATIONS The Jazz have had a revolving door at the backup point guard with Shelvin Mack, Dante Exum and Raul Neto all being shuffled in and out of the rotation. With the return of Burks, Snyder has started to use a three-wing combination without a point guard much more. Neto was inactive Saturday, Mack didn't play and Exum logged five minutes. ""Continuity is always good, but it's got to fit where you are,"" Snyder said. ""By virtue of injury ... we've had cause to have different combinations and different guys. ... This is probably November for us with some of those rotations. ""It would be good to settle into something. I don't know if that's going to be possible. The main thing is you want to be as good as you can be.""

"PHOENIX --  The Denver Nuggets set up residence at the free throw line in the third quarter Saturday night and made the most of their time there. The Nuggets sank 18 of 19 free throws in the period to pull away and beat the Phoenix Suns for the second time in three nights, 123-112. ""Tonight we lived at the line,"" Denver coach Mike Malone said, ""which allowed us to set our defense up, which allowed us to control the tempo and slow them down."" Danilo Gallinari scored 32 points and Kenneth Faried had 21 points and 13 rebounds for the Nuggets, winners of three straight and seven of their last nine. Eric Bledsoe scored a career-high 41 for the Suns. Devin Booker added 23. Denver won despite the absence of center Nikola Jokic, who left with a left hip flexor strain late in Thursday night's 127-120 victory. The Nuggets were in the penalty situation with 8:19 still to play in the third quarter. ""We went to the bonus really early,"" Gallinari said, ""so we had to take advantage of that and give ourselves a chance to get to the free throw line."" They certainly did. Bledsoe didn't have much to say about the Nuggets' foul-line parade. ""Ask the refs,"" he said. The Suns, not surprisingly, were in foul trouble in the quarter. Starting forwards T.J. Warren and Marquese Chriss had five apiece and Booker four. Denver finished the game 37 of 42 at the line. ""They do a great job just attacking the rim, attacking the paint, putting themselves in bonus situations,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""Same thing happened in the second (quarter) in the game in Denver. The last few games versus them, they shot 70 free throws."" Phoenix went to the line more than a few times, too. The Suns were 24 of 32, led by Bledsoe's 14 of 15. Jameer Nelson added 17 points for the Nuggets and Gary Harris 15. Denver outscored the Suns 36-22 in the third quarter and was up 95-76 when Wilson Chandler scored inside with 1:02 to play. The Suns scored the final seven points of the period to cut Denver's lead to 95-83 entering the fourth. But Phoenix never got closer than seven in the final 12 minutes. ""We played defense,"" Faried said. ""We got back into it, got to the free throw line, we got back in transition. They were getting a lot of open shots and we isolated them and tried to make them take tough shots."" Early, the Suns were off and running. They used a 19-3 first-quarter run to go up 29-13 on Brandon Knight's 10-foot floater. The first quarter ended with Phoenix up 33-21 and the Nuggets shooting 33 percent (7 for 21). But Denver got it going in the second, outscoring the Suns 15-5 to tie it at 44 when Gallinari converted a three-point play with five minutes left in the half. Denver never quite caught the Suns the rest of the half. Bledsoe's two free throws with 7.6 seconds to play put Phoenix up 61-59 lead at the break. TIP-INS Nuggets: Jokic is Denver's second-leading scorer at 15.5 points per game and had posted 17 double-doubles in the last 25 games. ..The Nuggets have beaten the Suns six straight times and swept the season series 4-0. ... Denver's only first-half lead was 10-8. Suns: Bledsoe's previous career high was 40 set in Toronto on Jan. 22. ... Booker scored at least 20 for the 12th straight game, the first player to do so in his first or second season since Blake Griffin did it 14 in a row in 2010-11. ... Phoenix was without rookie Dragan Bender for the third straight game with right ankle soreness.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  While the rest of his Minnesota Timberwolves teammates were on the court for pregame warmups, Karl-Anthony Towns was in the back sleeping, trying to squeeze every second of rest he could while battling a cold that nearly kept him out of the game. The Brooklyn Nets sure could've used Towns to take a sick day. Towns had 37 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks to lead the Timberwolves to a 129-109 victory over the Nets on Saturday night. ""Today was a long day for me. I'm glad it ended well,"" said Towns, who made 15 of 26 shots. ""Was real close to getting a DNP tonight."" Andrew Wiggins added 23 points and four assists, and Zach LaVine scored 20 points for the Timberwolves, who have won seven of their last 10 games. Minnesota shot 51 percent and outscored Brooklyn 17-8 in second-chance point to respond after a tough home loss to Indiana on Thursday night. Brook Lopez had 25 points and seven rebounds and hit 3 of 6 3-pointers for the Nets, who have lost five straight and 21 of their last 23 games. Sean Kilpatrick added 14 points. ""I felt like they dominated us,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We couldn't stop them. Physically, I thought they overwhelmed us. We got to do better."" Towns had everything working against the Nets. Lopez didn't have the quickness to keep up with him, Justin Hamilton wasn't strong enough and Trevor Booker didn't have the size. After Brooklyn trimmed a 16-point deficit to five in the third quarter, Towns scored six straight points to jumpstart a 10-0 run that gave the Wolves some breathing room for good. He hit a 3-pointer from the top of the arc and scored on a nifty left-handed baby hook to help the Wolves take an 89-74 lead. ""There's so much he can do and he's such a threat pretty much anywhere on the court,"" Lopez said. ""It makes it tough. You have to be aggressive with him and try to make his catches and looks as difficult as possible."" Shabazz Muhammad scored 18 points off the bench for Minnesota, and Gorgui Dieng added 12 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Nets: Lopez scored the first 10 points for Brooklyn. ... The Nets scored 58 points in the paint after coming in seventh in the league in that category. ... The Nets outscored Minnesota 50-23 off the bench. Timberwolves: PG Ricky Rubio was limited to 23 minutes because of foul trouble. He still finished with 14 points. ... Towns topped 30 for the ninth time this season. ... Kris Dunn played well while Rubio was out, putting up seven assists and five boards in 26 minutes. HOLLIS-JEFFERSON REACTS Nets forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, who is Muslim, got emotional pregame while talking about an executive order from President Donald Trump that cracked down on refugees and visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries. ""You can't judge a whole group by one's actions at the end of the day,"" Hollis-Jefferson said, according to the New York Post. ""And I feel like that's not right. That's definitely not right. You can't speak for all Muslims, because all Muslims' hearts aren't like that. Most of them are pure, really believe in a different way and a different livelihood."" Trump said it is ""not a Muslim ban,"" but the order was protested at airports around the country and a federal judge issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to Trump's ban. Hollis-Jefferson did not play in the second half because of a sore right ankle. TOWNS FAMILY UPDATE In addition to Towns' illness, his father Karl used crutches to get around Target Center after Wolves mascot Crunch accidentally injured Big Karl's knee during a stunt on Thursday night. ""Both Townses are down, but not out,"" Karl-Anthony cracked. CHANGE COMING? After another lackluster defensive effort, Atkinson said he will consider making changes to the starting lineup to try to find players more willing and able to produce on that end of the court. ""I think we've had a streak where we're not defending. That's not acceptable,"" Atkinson said. ""That's not the type of program we're trying to run.""","400900131"
