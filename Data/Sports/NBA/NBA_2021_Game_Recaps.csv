"Jae'Sean Tate drives towards the basket, goes behind the back and slams home the impressive dunk. (0:21) James Harden was back in a Houston uniform. It’s still unclear how many more times that’ll happen. The three-time defending NBA scoring champion made his preseason debut with the Rockets on Tuesday night, after starting to practice with his team just one day earlier following a late arrival to training camp amid incessant trade speculation. Harden scored 12 points in 21 minutes and the Rockets beat the San Antonio Spurs 112-98. Harden also had four assists, three rebounds and two steals. He checked out for the final time with 5:02 left in the third quarter, having missed his final four shots. John Wall and Ben McLemore each had 15 points for the Rockets, who got 11 points apiece from Eric Gordon and Jae’Sean Tate and 11 rebounds from DeMarcus Cousins. As expected, Wall and Harden were the starters in the Houston backcourt. “It can be really good,"" first-year Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “To have two dynamic ballhandlers on the floor who can do a bunch of different things, play off each other, create for each other, it can be really, really good."" Harden was not planning to address reporters after the game. “Just happy to see him back out there on the floor,"" McLemore said. Lonnie Walker IV scored 17 for the Spurs, who got 13 points, seven assists and five rebounds from Dejounte Murray. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 12, while Rudy Gay and Devin Vassell each added 11 for San Antonio. Harden seemed anything but disinterested to start his first live game action of the season. He stood immediately to the right of Silas in the pregame huddle, his eyes staring intently at whatever the coach was sketching on a dry-erase clipboard before taking the floor. Harden's first shot was a made straightaway 3-pointer and his second attempt led to him getting fouled from beyond the arc and making three free throws. So, his shooting touch was there, at least at the outset — as was his touch on passes. He connected with Danuel House on a three-quarter-court chest pass to set up a dunk late in the opening quarter, timing clearly not much of an issue after a couple months off. Harden went 3 for 10 from the field, including 2 for 6 from 3-point range. He also went 4 for 5 at the free-throw line. “I thought our young guys played him pretty wisely,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “I think we fouled him one time on a 3-point shot, but that's going to happen with him. He's pretty clever. We were better on him than we were John Wall. I thought John Wall got by us much too often."" Wall said he isn't recruiting Harden to stay in Houston, focusing instead on how they can work best together as teammates now. “He's going to do what's best for him. ... I don't try to ask him about that because that's his personal business,"" Wall said. The Rockets lost guard Chris Clemons with 9:58 left, after he was taken off the court in a wheelchair. Clemons made a 3-pointer for an 87-74 Houston lead, and after retreating to the defensive end for the ensuing possession, appeared to take a bad step and immediately began reaching for his right Achilles area. There was no immediate diagnosis of Clemons’ injury, but given his reaction when it happened and as he was being wheeled off the floor it was reasonable to think that the Rockets were bracing for bad news. “Right when it happened, I knew exactly what it was,"" said Wall, who has dealt with Achilles surgery himself. There are four games Wednesday, followed by seven on Thursday, eight on Friday and then three in the preseason finales Saturday. The regular season begins on Dec. 22. Tuesday’s games: 76ERS 108, CELTICS 99 At Philadelphia, Shake Milton scored 19 points, Joel Embiid added 18 and Tobias Harris finished with 16 points and a game-high nine rebounds for the 76ers in the preseason opener for both clubs. Ben Simmons had 10 points and six assists for Philadelphia. Jeff Teague scored 18 for Boston. He shot 7 for 9 on a night where some Celtics struggled mightily from the field; Jaylen Brown made his first shot and went 0 for 10 the rest of the way, and Jayson Tatum finished just 4 for 13. Payton Pritchard had 12 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter for Boston. Tatum finished with 10 points.","401265849"

"Duncan Robinson knocks down a Christmas Day record-tying seven 3-pointers to help the Heat beat the Pelicans. (1:10) MIAMI -- — Erik Spoelstra remained perfect on Christmas, and a record-tying show from Duncan Robinson helped him stay that way. Robinson made seven 3-pointers — tying the Christmas single-game mark — and scored 23 points, helping the Heat beat the New Orleans Pelicans 111-98 to start the NBA’s holiday quintupleheader Friday. “It's super special to play in Christmas,"" Robinson said. “I certainly don't take it for granted."" Goran Dragic scored 18 points, Bam Adebayo had 17 and Avery Bradley finished with 12 for Miami, and Spoelstra improved his Christmas record as Heat coach to 8-0. “I wasn't even aware of that,"" Spoelstra said. “Just shows you that we've had some really good teams here and teams that have had the opportunity to play on Christmas."" Precious Achiuwa and Tyler Herro each scored 11 for Miami, which lost Jimmy Butler at halftime with right ankle stiffness. Zion Williamson had 32 points and 14 rebounds in 38 minutes for New Orleans — the rebounds and minutes both being career highs. Brandon Ingram finished with 28 points. But the Pelicans shot 40% to Miami’s 51%. “We made some defensive mistakes that we shouldn't have,"" said Josh Hart, who scored 12 for New Orleans. “Lack of communication. We've got to communicate better on the defensive end."" Robinson’s seven 3s tied the Christmas mark Ingram set last year. “The guy is a great, great shooter. He's going to have nights like that,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “But at least three of them were ones where we could have done a better job."" JJ Redick’s 3-pointer with 7:43 left cut Miami’s lead to 91-85 and came during a stretch when the Heat went five minutes without a field goal. But the Pelicans got no closer. The Heat restored order by scoring 11 of the game’s next 13 points, and when Achiuwa — the rookie who had strong defensive minutes — forced Williamson into a turnover with 3:55 left, the entire Miami bench rose in celebration. “We knew they would make a run, but we stayed composed,"" Dragic said. New Orleans led 17-9 midway through the opening quarter — and got outscored 52-21 by Miami over the next 13½ minutes, with the Heat hitting nine of their 13 first-half 3s in that span on the way to a 23-point lead. The Pelicans chipped away, getting within 66-53 at the half and 88-79 after three. But New Orleans shot only 30% in the final quarter and Ingram went scoreless in those 12 minutes after playing the entire third period. Van Gundy lamented playing Ingram so much in the third. “Probably not optimal play-calling on my part, either,"" Van Gundy said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson's previous career high was 34 minutes. ... Redick fouled out for the second time in 898 career regular-season games, and missed six of his seven shots. ... The Pelicans are now 1/3 on Christmas. Heat: Andre Iguodala started the second half for Butler. ... Miami improved to 11-2 on Christmas. It hadn’t played on the holiday since beating New Orleans in 2015, and hasn’t lost on Dec. 25 since 2007. SEASON’S GREETINGS Heat forward Moe Harkless this week helped pay rent for about 50 New York families in dire economic circumstances this holiday season, plus covered lost wages and other essential expenses. “Means the world to me,” Harkless said. COMING HOME Veteran ref John Goble was crew chief and got to be home for Christmas; he’s a Miami native. Marc Davis (lives in Chicago, crew chief Friday in Milwaukee) and John Goble (lives in Connecticut, crew chief Friday in Boston) also got to work near home for Christmas.","401266794"
"Kawhi Leonard goes for 23 points and Paul George adds 21 in the Clippers' 121-108 win vs. the Nuggets. (2:21) DENVER -- — Kawhi Leonard was hurt and the Denver Nuggets were mounting a rally like they did three months ago. This time, the Los Angeles Clippers didn’t allow Denver to complete the comeback. Leonard had 21 points before taking an elbow to the face in the fourth quarter, Paul George scored 23 points and had nine assists, and Los Angeles beat the Nuggets 121-108 on Friday night. It was the second straight big win for LA, which beat the Lakers on Tuesday night. “We’re a different team than last year,” George said. The Clippers led by 11 with 6:11 left Friday night when Serge Ibaka went up for a rebound and caught the side of his teammate’s face with his right elbow. Leonard lay bleeding on the court before walking to the locker room. “He got up and walked off the floor, so he’s going to be good,” LA coach Tyronn Lue said. Leonard was ruled out shortly thereafter and was being evaluated postgame, but it did put a scare into George. “Really worried. I was thinking the worst,” George said. “I didn’t know if he was concussed or what actually happened, I just saw him laying on the ground. That was first and foremost, making sure he was OK.” The Clippers didn’t need Leonard to close out a Nuggets team that upset them in the second round of the Western Conference semifinals last season. Nikola Jokic finished with 24 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds for Denver, which has dropped its first two games of the season. Jamal Murray added 23 points, 13 coming in the fourth. The Nuggets rallied from double-digit second-half deficits in Games 5, 6 and 7 of the second-round series in September, winning all three and wiping out LA’s 3-1 lead to advance to the Western Conference finals. It was a surprising end for a team many thought could beat the Lakers and advance to the NBA Finals. George said he has put that disappointment in the past. “I buried last year, left last year in the bubble,” he said. “This is a new season, new team, new goals, new everything. I was ready and poised and confident coming into this year, and I was prepared coming into this season.” Denver wasn’t able to do it again but made a run after trailing by 24 late in the third quarter. The Nuggets used an 11-0 run into early in the fourth, and two 3-pointers by Murray sliced a 98-74 deficit to 106-95 with 7:35 left. “When you’re down 25, it’s about pride and about effort,” Murray said. “We wanted to play hard and let the lead take care of itself. We saw the lead chip away like we did in the playoffs, we just couldn’t get over the hump.” Leonard went out soon after but Denver never got the deficit under 10. “They made a run, we lost Kawhi so we could have lost our composure, lost our game, but we took a good timeout,” Nicolas Batum said. “We kept moving the ball and made big shots.” TIP-INS Clippers: F Marcus Morris (sore right knee) missed his second straight game, but coach Lue said he is day-to-day. “He’s been doing his own rehab with the sports science team and he’s progressing,” Lue said. Nuggets: F JaMychal Green sat out with a left calf strain. Green, who played for the Clippers last season, has yet to play in the regular season after signing with Denver in the short offseason. SCROOGED AGAIN Denver was playing on Christmas night for the second straight season, with both ending in double-digit losses. Last year the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Nuggets 112-100 in Denver, stopping a seven-game winning streak. “Two years in a row we weren’t ready to play on Christmas night,” coach Michael Malone said. “Bah humbug.”","401266795"

"Steph Curry drains a 3-pointer in the second quarter to pass Rick Barry for second on Golden State's all-time scoring list. (0:23) MILWAUKEE -- — Khris Middleton scored 31 points and the Milwaukee Bucks routed the Golden State Warriors 138-99 on Friday to win their first Christmas Day home game in over half a century. Middleton went 10 of 15 overall and 6 for 8 from 3-point range, leading a strong performance from deep for his team. He totaled 58 points in his first two games of the season. “The weeks before the season, I just tried to put in good work, work on my game,” Middleton said. “So far, it's been working for me.” Milwaukee was 20 of 37 on 3-point attempts, while Golden State was 10 of 45. The Warriors were outscored by 65 points in their first two games, the second-highest total in NBA history through two games to 71 points for the 1987-88 Clippers. Golden State lost 125-99 at Brooklyn in its season opener. This was the second-most lopsided score of any Christmas Day game in NBA history. The Syracuse Nationals beat the New York Knicks 162-100 on Dec. 25, 1960. “The thing I was most disappointed in is we just had two good days of practice with our execution working on getting in our offense and making hard cuts and reads, and we did not execute much of anything,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “It was kind of scattered and disorganized. I'm disappointed in that. I've got to take the blame for that. I'm the head coach.” Milwaukee's only other Christmas home game came during the franchise’s inaugural season in 1968. The Bucks were on the road for Christmas the last two seasons, losing at Philadelphia in 2019 and winning at New York in 2018. Bucks players got a Christmas surprise before the game when they received videotaped messages from their families in a move orchestrated by team officials. “It was definitely the best gift that I got today,” Bucks guard Jrue Holiday said. Then they went out and delivered a dominant performance to bounce back from a season-opening  122-121 loss at Boston  in which Celtics star Jayson Tatum banked in a go-ahead 3-pointer and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo missed a potential tying free throw in the final second. Antetkounmpo had 15 points and 13 rebounds against Golden State, but the two-time reigning NBA MVP shot 4 of 15 from the floor and 7 of 15 from the foul line. Stephen Curry scored 19 points for Golden State, and rookie James Wiseman had 18. Andrew Wiggins had 12. Jordan Poole and Brad Wanamaker added 11 each. Donte DiVincenzo and D.J. Augustin each scored 13 for Milwaukee. Holiday had 12 and Bobby Portis added 10. TIP-INS Warriors: F Draymond Green sat out for the second straight game because of a sore right foot. … This marked the 12th time Kerr was part of a Christmas Day game. He has played in five and coached in seven. … The Warriors dropped to 13-17 in Christmas Day games. This was their eighth straight Christmas Day appearance. Bucks: Augustin made his Bucks debut after sitting out the Celtics game due to a strained left calf. The 33-year-old Augustin signed with the Bucks last month after spending the last four seasons with Orlando. CURRY MILESTONE WATCH Curry increased his career points total to 16,458, overtaking Rick Barry (16,447) to move into second place on the Warriors' list. Wilt Chamberlain holds the franchise record after scoring 17,783 points for the Warriors. Curry was 2 of 10 from 3-point range to give him 2,499 career 3-pointers. The two-time MVP is looking to join Ray Allen (2,973) and Reggie Miller (2,560) as the only NBA players to make at least 2,500 3-pointers. Curry went 5 of 5 from the line to extend his streak of consecutive successful free-throw attempts to 55. He is chasing Barry's franchise record of 60 straight from 1976-77.","401266797"
"Jayson Tatum hits the tough fade away 3-pointer with Kyrie Irving right on him as the shot clock expires. (0:29) BOSTON -- — Kyrie Irving scored 37 points with eight assists in his return to Boston and Kevin Durant added 29 for Brooklyn on Friday to lead the Nets to a 123-95 victory over the Celtics. Jarrett Allen added 11 rebounds for the Nets, who remained perfect so far this season and sent Boston to its first loss. Irving was 7 of 10 from 3-point range in his first regular-season game at TD Garden since he opted out of his Celtics contract in 2019. “We’re going to continue to see them. We’re in the same division,” Irving said, adding that there was “nothing added” to his motivation in playing his former team. Jaylen Brown scored 27 with eight rebounds for the Celtics and Jayson Tatum had 20 points and eight boards. The Celtics beat Milwaukee in their opener on Wednesday on Tatum's last-second shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo, but they couldn't do it again in their second straight matchup against a team expected to contend in the Eastern Conference this season. “The benefit of playing these two games against two other great teams is that it forces you to be better,"" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. ""It tests you to see where you’re at, it sets the bar, and now you know what you have to strive for.” The game began after a moment of silence for former Celtics player and coach K.C. Jones, who died earlier Friday. Durant scored 16 points in the third quarter, when the Nets outscored Boston 35-23 to turn a three-point deficit into an 86-77 lead. He scored nine straight Brooklyn points at the beginning of the third when the Nets took the lead for good. ""It’s still impressive to watch after all these years,"" Nets coach Steve Nash said. “For him to have little runs like that is nothing in his mind. For mere mortals in the NBA, it’s impossible to think of.” Boston led by three at the half before being outscored 35-23 in the third quarter, including a 9-0 run that turned a three-point edge into a 82-70 lead. It was 86-79 early in the fourth when the Nets, even with Irving and Durant on the bench, again scored nine in a row to open a 16-point lead. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn has beaten the Warriors with Klay Thompson and Draymond Green sitting out and the Celtics with Kemba Walker injured. “We just need to stay hungry. This means nothing,” Nash said. ... It was Durant’s 10th visit to the TD Garden in 14 seasons -- his fewest in any NBA city. Celtics: Jeff Teague was perfect from 3-point range in the exhibition season and 4 for 4 in the regular season opener before missing his first in the third quarter on Friday. ... Tatum scored zero points in the first quarter and 12 in the second. ... Tatum’s passed Walter McCarty and moved into eighth place on the Celtics’ all-time 3-pointer list, with (418). Isaiah Thomas is seventh with 460 and Paul Pierce is first with 1,823. ... Celtics coach Brad Stevens was called for a technical foul arguing about a foul call against Daniel Theis in the second quarter.","401266798"
"LeBron James jokes about how he has to drink wine to alter his free throw shooting, especially after an air ball at the line tonight. (0:44) LOS ANGELES -- — When LeBron James checked the stat sheet as he left the Staples Center court after his latest high-scoring Christmas victory, he realized the Lakers had scored 138 points with a mere 22 from him. The NBA champions already look like they could be even better this year. In their second game of the new season, even Luka Doncic didn't stand a chance of keeping up. Anthony Davis scored 28 points and James became the second-leading Christmas scorer in NBA history during the Los Angeles Lakers' 138-115 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. Montrezl Harrell scored 17 of his 22 points in the second half, and Dennis Schröder had 18 points and six assists in a second strong game for both new additions to the champs. Los Angeles outrebounded Dallas 53-27 and closed out its first win of the season with a dominant fourth quarter. “We have the ability to where we can have four, maybe even five guys that can score in the 20s any given night,” James said. “As long as we defend and we’re efficient, it’s a beautiful thing to see.” Doncic had 27 points and seven assists in his first starring role in the NBA’s showcase Christmas evening game for Dallas. Josh Richardson and Trey Burke had 17 points apiece as the Mavs started 0-2 with a late fade. Dallas' three offensive rebounds were fewer than Harrell, who had five. “You can’t win a game where the second-chance points are 35-0,” Doncic said. “It’s as simple as that. We box out, we win the game."" The Lakers were aggressive and accurate from the opening tip, taking a 69-57 halftime lead while hitting 61.4% of their shots. Doncic went 3 for 10 in the first half but combined with Burke for 22 points in the third quarter to keep it close. “The more we play with each other, the more we’re going to figure things out,” Davis said. “We prided ourselves on not losing two in a row last year, so we wanted to come out and make sure we do that.” HOLIDAY CHEERS James moved into second place behind Kobe Bryant for the most points scored on Christmas, passing Oscar Robertson in the third quarter. James has 383 points in 15 games on Christmas, while Bryant had 395 in 16 holiday appearances. TIP-INS Mavericks: Kristaps Porzingis is on the Mavericks’ trip while recovering from knee surgery in October. Coach Rick Carlisle said the Latvian big man is “making progress all the time. I’m confident in saying it’s weeks, not months (before his return, but that’s all I’m going to tell you. He has a ways to go.” ... This was Dallas' only scheduled meeting with the Lakers this season. Lakers: Davis was accidentally elbowed in the face by Burke in the first quarter. He had a split lip, but stayed in. ... ESPN reported Schröder has already opened contract extension talks with LA, and the German guard confirmed he would “love to” sign a long-term deal: “It's just got to be fair on both sides.” ... Wesley Matthews, Marc Gasol and Alfonzo McKinnie all scored their first points for the Lakers after going scoreless in the opener. ... They wore powder-blue warmups over their silver-on-white Christmas uniforms with blue accents.","401266799"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo says he's upset he missed the tying free throw but hopes to learn from it moving forward. (1:29) BOSTON -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn't stop Jayson Tatum from knocking down a “tough, tough, tough” shot. Then the reigning MVP and defensive player of the year missed one of the easiest. Tatum banked in a fallaway, go-ahead 3-pointer in the final second, and Antetokounmpo missed a potential tying free throw with 0.4 seconds left, allowing the Boston Celtics to escape with a 122-121 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night in the teams' season opener. “Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be in that position,” said Tatum, who scored 30 points. “If it goes down or not, that’s what I work so hard for. You just want to be in that moment.” Jaylen Brown scored 33 points for Boston, which entered the fourth quarter leading by 17 points. The Celtics trailed 120-119 when Tatum dribbled the clock down from 8.9 seconds before lofting a high-arcing 3 over Antetokounmpo  that kissed the glass on its way down. “I think aside from the ball going in the basket, I’m not sure we could have defended Tatum much better than we did,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I thought Giannis did a great job individually, great contest. Credit to Tatum, he banked in a 3 at the end of the clock.” Antetokounmpo called it a “tough, tough, tough 3.” Tatum said the glass wasn't really part of the plan. “Once I let it go I knew it was going to hit the backboard,” he said. “But I didn’t necessarily try.” The ensuing inbounds pass was thrown at the rim and Antetokounmpo tried to tip it in, but he was fouled. He made the first foul shot, but bounced the second off the front of the rim. “Obviously, there’s a bit of a weight on your shoulder because you know if you miss, that’s it for your team,"" said Antetokounmpo, who scored 18 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter. “I’m a winner. I want to do whatever it takes for my team to win. But you learn from every situation that basketball puts you in.” Khris Middleton had 27 points and 14 rebounds and big offseason acquisition Jrue Holiday scored 25 points for Milwaukee. The Bucks had the best record in the NBA in each of the past two seasons but didn’t make it out of the Eastern Conference finals. Milwaukee led by nine points, 48-39, midway through the second quarter before Boston rolled off 10 straight points and 19 of the next 23. Boston led 101-84 after three, but Antetokounmpo outscored the Celtics 10-2 over a two-minute span midway through the fourth to cut a 10-point Celtics lead to 109-107. “We took a good hit and kept ticking,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. TOMMY POINT The Celtics observed a moment of silence for Tommy Heinsohn before the game and played a tribute video at the first break for the player, coach and broadcaster who was with the team for more than 60 years and all 17 of its NBA titles. Heinsohn, who died last month at the age of 86, won eight championships in nine years as a Celtics player from 1956-65. He won three more titles as a coach and was the fourth person inducted in the basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. The Celtics lowered eight of their championship banners courtside, picking the ones they deemed to have special meaning to Heinsohn. TIP-INS Bucks: During the game, the Bucks exercised their fourth-year team option on guard Donte DiVincenzo for the 2021-22 season. DiVincenzo had 15 points and five assists. Celtics: Newcomers Jeff Teague scored 19 points in 25 minutes, and Tristan Thompson had 12 points and eight rebounds.","401266804"
"Steph Curry goes for 20 points and 10 assists in his first regular-season game since March as Golden State falls to Brooklyn on opening night. (1:41) NEW YORK -- — Kevin Durant shook off 18 months of rust in a matter of minutes. Durant looked good as new against his old team, Kyrie Irving was even better and the Brooklyn Nets emphatically kicked off the Steve Nash era with a 125-99 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night in the NBA's season opener. Durant finished with 22 points in 25 minutes of his first official game since rupturing his Achilles tendon while playing for Golden State in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals. It's a new start for Durant, but he did the same things he's been doing for years. “I tried not to make too big a deal out of this whole thing and realize I’ve been playing this game since I was 8 years old, so just got to revert back to what I know,” Durant said. Irving led Brooklyn with 26 points and Caris LeVert scored 20 as the Nets led by as many as 38, pouring on the points the way the Phoenix Suns did when Nash was their point guard, or more recently Golden State did when Durant was their All-Star forward. The Nets made the playoffs last season but now are expected to contend for the Eastern Conference title after finally getting Durant and Irving on the court together. They used the first game of the shortened, 72-game season to prove they might be worth the hype. “I think our goals are a lot higher this year and we just want to be able to come in and dominate and do that consistently,” Irving said. Stephen Curry had 20 points and 10 assists for the Warriors, a depleted team that looks nothing like the powerhouse that won two titles in Durant's three seasons there. Durant left shortly after having surgery following his injury and was expected to sit out the entire 2019-20 season even before it was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Teammates who have worked out with him said the four-time scoring champion was back in top form and Durant quickly backed up their boasts in a mostly empty Barclays Center. He made his first three shots, one a 3-pointer and another while being fouled, and was in double figures in fewer than five minutes. He did everything but keep up with Irving, who made three 3-pointers and had 17 points in 9 1/2 minutes of the opening quarter, when the Nets led by as many as 21. Irving, himself coming back from injury after playing just 20 games last season because of shoulder problems, had Brooklyn’s last two baskets of the first half, including a deep 3-pointer with 4.1 seconds left that made it 63-45. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he was happy for Durant but upset with what he saw from his team, trying to bounce back after winning a league-low 15 games last season. “Both Kevin and Kyrie just kind of had their way in the first half,"" he said. ""So the lack of physicality and competition were the most disappointing things.” Durant then scored 10 more in Brooklyn's 36-point third quarter, ending his night for good late in the period. No. 2 pick James Wiseman started at center despite his limited preparation and had 19 points and six rebounds. But the Warriors, playing without Draymond Green because of a sore right foot, need to find more shooting around Curry with Klay Thompson set to miss a second straight season. Andrew Wiggins was 4 for 16 for his 13 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. was 3 for 14. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said Green planned an individual workout Tuesday and would hopefully do some group work Wednesday when they remained in New York to practice. ... Wiseman, at 19 years, 266 days, became the third-youngest Golden State player to start a game behind Andris Biedrins (18, 352) and Anthony Randolph (19, 179). ...

They are 1-0 for the first time since Nov. 3, 2012, their first game at Barclays Center after moving from New Jersey. ... Brooklyn re-signed G Chris Chiozza to a two-way contract Tuesday. He played in 18 games for the Nets last season. ... The Nets honored the essential workers who have helped New York fight the coronavirus, raising a banner on one end of Barclays Center.

"The Clippers are fueled by Paul George scoring 33 points on 13-of-18 shooting from the field as they go on to defeat the Lakers on opening night 116-109. (2:15) LOS ANGELES -- - After the Los Angeles Lakers got their championship rings, the Los Angeles Clippers gave a performance that showed this retooled team is determined to contend for its own jewelry several months from now. Paul George scored 26 of his 33 points in the second half, Kawhi Leonard added 26 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rallied past the Los Angeles Lakers on the NBA champions' ring ceremony night for a 116-109 victory Tuesday. George went 13 of 18 with five 3-pointers in an outstanding first game since agreeing to add four years and $190 million to his contract with the Clippers, who never trailed in the latest meeting of Southern California's two NBA powerhouses. The Clippers beat the Lakers in the season opener for the second straight year while winning coach Tyronn Lue's debut. The Clippers stayed in their locker room while the Lakers received their rings, but they emerged with purpose and determined play - from their two superstars in particular. ""Our focus was on us,"" Lue said. ""The Lakers, they deserved that ring. They had a great year, and you can't take nothing away from them. Our focus wasn't really on the Lakers. They were the best team last year, so congratulations to them again, but now we're moving on."" LeBron James scored 22 points and Anthony Davis had 18 for the Lakers just 72 days after they finished off the Miami Heat in the NBA bubble. James said he turned his ankle ""pretty good"" in the second half, leading him to play just 28 minutes. ""I'm happy today is over with and we can focus on the season, but it's just a lot to process,"" James said. ""It felt weird having a basketball game today."" The Lakers returned from the shortest offseason in league history and celebrated  the franchise's 17th title, but they couldn't keep up with George and Leonard down the stretch. Lakers coach Frank Vogel also limited James' playing time and kept Davis to 31 minutes, anticipating the long grind ahead on his veterans after a 10-week offseason. ""It's not ideal, but I do feel it's necessary to manage those guys' minutes the right way,"" Vogel said. ""Getting through this stretch healthy is a priority, and evaluating how our new guys fit is a priority when we haven't had a normal amount of time to do that. The five guys on the floor have got to be better than they were tonight."" Serge Ibaka scored 15 points in his debut for the Clippers, who hadn't played since blowing a 3-1 playoff series lead to Denver and ruining a much-anticipated conference final showdown with the waiting Lakers in the bubble. The collapse led to coach Doc Rivers' departure, and Lue moved down the bench to take over a star-studded team with several new additions. The Lakers fell behind by 22 points under the ring hangover in the first quarter, but they erased all but two points of the deficit in the second. The Clippers pulled away late in the third with George scorching a series of one-on-one defenders. He scored 11 more points in the fourth to seal it. ""We're not thinking about last year,"" Leonard said. ""It's a different team. I'm just happy that we kept playing basketball the right way. Even if we lost the lead, we turned around and kept playing our basketball. We ran our offense, and that's what we take pride in tonight. Everybody had each other's back and was staying positive."" TIP-INS Clippers: Nicolas Batum and Ibaka started for their new club. ... Former Lakers Lou Williams and Ivica Zubac scored 11 points apiece. Lakers: James believes he will be fine to play on Christmas, saying he'll get extensive treatment. He also joked about another solution: ""I'll drink some wine that will flow right to the ankle."" ... Dennis Schröder and fellow newcomer Marc Gasol were in Vogel's starting lineup. Gasol had no points and five fouls in 12 minutes. ... Wesley Matthews also went scoreless in his Lakers debut. DEBUTS Batum had three points and six assists in 28 minutes in his Clippers debut, while new $64 million swingman Luke Kennard had four points in 21 minutes off the bench. Montrezl Harrell had 17 points and 10 rebounds in a strong debut after moving down the hallway from the Clippers to the Lakers last month. Schröder also was impressive in his Lakers debut, with 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. ""Those guys are going to be big-time players for us,"" Vogel said.","401266806"

"Damantas Sabonis goes for 32 points as the Pacers win their season opener vs. the Knicks 121-107. (2:18) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Victor Oladipo took matters into his own hands after a sluggish first half Wednesday night. He drove to the basket, made shots and wound up scoring 16 of his 22 points in the final 24 minutes to lead the Indiana Pacers past the New York Knicks 121-107 on opening night. “He wanted to be assertive in that second half,"" new coach Nate Bjorkgren said after collecting his first career win. “I thought he was very aggressive, attacking the basket more, looking to shoot it more. I liked his aggressive mentality on both ends of the floor."" Domantas Sabonis finished with a career-high 32 points, along with 13 rebounds and five assists to help Indiana win its fourth opener in five years. RJ Barrett finished with 26 points and Alec Burks had 22 for New York, which lost on opening night for the fourth time in five years and the first time in coach Tom Thibodeau's tenure. And after a strong start, Thibodeau certainly expected a stronger finishing punch from his team. “The way we played in the first half is the way we need to continue to play,"" he said. “We probably played 24 minutes of good basketball and to win on the road, you have to do more than that."" It wasn't pretty and with only a few dozen people in the Bankers Life Fieldhouse stands, the energy was lacking, too. But Oladipo's opening outburst in the second half changed everything. The two-time All-Star scored the Pacers' first 11 points in the third quarter then found T.J. Warren for a breakaway layup to give the Pacers a 78-77 lead with 5:50 left in the quarter. Indiana never trailed again. The Pacers extended the margin to 83-77 after three, made it a double-digit game early in the fourth and pulled away midway through the fourth. “I’m just going to go out there and be assertive, be aggressive,"" Oladipo said. “Everything else will take care of itself."" TIP-INS Knicks: Barrett played a nearly perfect first half, going 8 of 8 from the field, 3 of 3 on 3s and 1 of 2 at the free throw line. He finished 11 of 15 from the field. ... No. 8 pick Obi Toppin had nine points on 3-of-12 shooting in his NBA debut. ... Mitchell Robinson, who broke the league's single-season field goal percentage record last season, struggled with fouls all night and was 1 of 2 from the field with three points. ... Julius Randle had 17 points and nine rebounds. ... The Knicks had 16 turnovers. Pacers: T.J. Warren, who was so impressive in the bubble, wasn't himself after returning from a foot injury.

Malcolm Brogdon had 21 points, seven rebounds and eight assists. ... Indiana had a 49-40 rebounding advantage. HURTING Knicks rookie Immanuel Quickley's debut didn't last long. The 25th overall pick in last month's draft played just 12 minutes and took only three shots before leaving with a hip pointer. He finished with five points, one rebound, one assist and one steal — and his status for Game 2 is unclear, too. “He’ll be examined (Wednesday and Thursday),"" Thibodeau said. “He had a great impact when he went into the game in the first half.

"Nikola Vucevic sends a beautiful assist to Evan Fournier who cuts backdoor to the hoop for an and-1 in the final minute of action. (0:20) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — For a third time in the past four years, the Orlando Magic opened their season on their home court with a stirring victory beat the rival Miami Heat. Clearly, though, it will take more than just a victory over the defending Eastern Conference champion Heat for the Magic to back up forward Aaron Gordon’s bold talk of the team being ""overlooked.’’ Evan Fournier hit a go-ahead 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter, converted a three-point play off another driving layup in the final minute and scored 25 points in the Magic’s 113-107 victory over Miami on Wednesday. ""It was a good win and you always want to win the first game, especially when it’s at home,’’ said Fournier, who scored nine points in the final period for Orlando. ""It’s definitely rewarding to win against a team like Miami because it’s always tough to play against them.’’ The Sunshine State rivals opened the regular season against one another for the sixth time. Oddly, the two rivals have started their seasons in Orlando four times in the past five years. The Magic are 5-1 in their six openers against their rivals from South Florida. Bam Adebayo led Miami with 25 points and 11 rebounds, Goran Dragic added 20 points, and Jimmy Butler had 19 points and seven assists. The Heat turned the ball over 22 times, leading to 24 Magic points. ""One, empty possessions. Two, we didn’t get the necessary ball movement … and thirdly, (the Magic) are a good defensive team,’’ said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra’s, whose team was playing for the first time since losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals in October. Miami led 83-79 after three periods and it was up 93-91 with 4:29 to play following Adebayo's dunk. However, Fournier soon after swung the momentum to the Magic’s side with his strong finish. Fournier, who is looking to bounce back this season after struggling in last season’s playoffs, made all three of his shots in the fourth quarter. Gordon had 20 points and seven rebounds, Terrence Ross chipped in 19 and Nikola Vucevic added 15 points and 11 rebounds. Point guard Markelle Fultz added 15 points and made two clutch free throws with 1:11 to play. Gordon is confident that the Magic can open some eyes with their play this season. ""I don’t think, outside of Orlando, people have a lot of belief in us,’’ said the forward, who made 8 of 11 shots. ""I don’t think they think that we’re going to become potential contenders or even have a playoff slot and I don’t think that’s true. I feel like we’re really ready to make that next leap.’’ TIP-INS Heat: Dragic, who played well despite struggling with a foot injury much of training camp, was upset with his team’s hustle. ""We talked and thought we did not play hard enough,’’ Dragic said. ""This is what we need to correct.’’ Magic: The Magic held a moment of silence prior to tipoff to honor franchise co-founder Jimmy Hewitt. He died last month at the age of 79. Hewitt, along with Pat Williams, helped bring the NBA in the 1989-90 season.","401267152"
"Russell Westbrook scores 21 points, while dishing 15 assists and bringing in 11 rebounds vs. the 76ers. (1:29) PHILADELPHIA -- — The 76ers have gone more than a year without losing in Philadelphia, a stretch that included a coaching change, a roster revamp, and a pandemic hiatus. The constant? Joel Embiid simply dominant down the stretch. Embiid scored 15 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 113-107 win over Washington on Wednesday night and spoil Russell Westbrook’s triple-double Wizards’ debut. The Sixers haven’t lost at home since Dec. 20, 2019. Westbrook and Bradley Beal were fantastic in spurts in the opening-night backcourt pairing that nearly handed 76ers coach Doc Rivers a loss in his Philadelphia debut. Westbrook had 21 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds to wow the Wizards after being acquired in the big deal that sent former cornerstone John Wall to the Houston Rockets. Beal, a two-time All-Star who was second in the league in scoring last season, had 31 points. “Not good enough. I’m kind of disappointed in myself,” Westbrook said. “There were plays where I could have had a better game.” Embiid, sensational in the fourth, and Shake Milton, who scored 19 points off the bench, were the go-to scorers late, and Ben Simmons sealed the win with a monster dunk in the waning moments. Simmons had 16 points — one less than Embiid scored in the fourth. “He’s the focal point. The ball is going to Embiid on every single play,” Beal said. “He’s a hassle down there.” Embiid was nearly unstoppable in the post in the fourth, getting the ball on five straight possessions at one point and turning them into buckets that wiped out a 10-point deficit. His driving layup with 1:09 left put the Sixers up 105-103, and he finished 10 of 17 from the floor. “I don’t think anybody can stop me, especially with the mentality I have this year,” Embiid said. The Sixers made their major change on the bench, hiring Rivers to replace Brett Brown and wake up a team that was swept out of the first round of the playoffs last year. Rivers has to find a way to make the Embiid-Simmons pairing work — two All-Stars who have yet to get the most of their prodigious talents and have frustrated fans with their flaws. Simmons showed an early willingness to try and fix his — making shots from beyond 15 feet. Simmons was encouraged by new teammate Dwight Howard, who won a ring last season with the Lakers, to stick around postgame and work on his shooting. Both players stayed on the court and Howard waved toward the stands — mostly security guards and team employees — to get louder during a shooting drill. Simmons was the subject of trade rumors, though new head decision maker Daryl Morey said the guard was not on the trading block. “Dwight’s been pushing me to get better. He wants me to be great,” Simmons said. “I really appreciate that. It makes you want to work.” TIP-INS Wizards: Israeli teen Deni Avdija scored seven points in his NBA debut for the Wizards. The 19-year-old was the ninth overall pick in the draft and had played for the Tel Aviv Maccabi club in Israel’s Premier League. “I know he’s only 19 years old but he plays with a passion, plays with a determination that I like,” coach Scott Brooks said. ... Beal and Westbrook each had six turnovers and Washington had 20 overall. 76ers: The 76ers bench largely outplayed the starters. Howard had 10 rebounds, Furkan Korkmaz scored 11 points and first-round pick Tyrese Maxey was a burst of energy early and had six points. SIR CHARLES PREDICTS TNT analyst Charles Barkley played with Brooks and roomed with him, too, when they played for the 76ers. Barkley put some pressure on his old teammate when he predicted the Wizards would make the playoffs. “I’ll tell you what, he’s guaranteed a lot and very rarely it comes through,” Brooks said. “My job is to take care of my former roommate and pay him back. ... Hopefully, we can have a good year and make the playoffs. I like our chances.” Brooks is entering the final season of his five-year, $35 million contract. THAT’S ENTERTAINMENT The 76ers had drummers, the cheer team held signs that read “Make Some Noise,” a DJ blasted music and the mascot Franklin roasted the Wizards with humorous signs to liven up an empty Wells Fargo Center.","401267173"
"Zion Williamson climbs the ladder and gets a big block on OG Anunoby. (0:23) TAMPA, Fla. -- — The Toronto Raptors had their home floor shipped 1,300 miles when they relocated to Tampa for at least the start of the NBA season. Yet it was the New Orleans Pelicans who looked at home at Amalie Arena in the season opener for both teams. JJ Redick converted a four-point play with just over a minute remaining and finished with 23 points, and Brandon Ingram led all scorers with 24 points as the Pelicans rallied from an 11-point deficit and beat the Raptors 113-99 on Wednesday night. Zion Williamson had a big second half for the Pelicans and finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams scored 18 and 16 points, respectively, in their first games with the Pelicans, who delivered new coach Stan Van Gundy a victory in his New Orleans debut. “I’d say that we fought very hard in a game that was very, very frustrating,” Van Gundy said. “We were turning the ball over, we were in foul trouble, not a lot was going right for us. We hung in there and kept fighting and then made enough plays and enough shots to pull away.” Pascal Siakam led the Raptors with 20 points. Kyle Lowry finished with 18 points and 10 assists. Because of the current Canadian restrictions on cross-border travel due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Raptors are scheduled to play their first 17 “home” games at Tampa’s Amalie Arena. The second half of the NBA’s schedule will be released later. Lowry hit four 3-pointers in the second quarter, and when Siakam made consecutive 3-pointers, the Raptors opened their largest lead of the game at 11 points. Redick hit a couple 3s late in the second period, but the Pelicans went into the break trailing 57-50. Ingram spoke on the importance of Redick to the Pelicans. “He’s good to have around from a professionalism standpoint, so we like to have him around,” Ingram said. “We love that he can shoot the basketball and when he’s open he needs the basketball.” Early in the second half, Lonzo Ball and Bledsoe hit 3-pointers in a 9-0 run. Then, Ball and Ingram did all the scoring for the Pelicans on a 10-2 run that finished the third quarter and gave the Pelicans an 88-79 lead. They scored 38 points in the period. <U+2033>(The third quarter) ... zapped our energy pretty big time,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “We did seem to lose a little energy and maybe ran out of a little gas, too.” About 3,800 people attended the game, and Siakam said fans in the stands makes a difference. “I don’t know if it’s all Raptors fans or what the case might be, but I thought it was cool, just having people around it,” Siakam said. “Obviously we’re blessed that we have some people, some type of energy in the crowd to make the atmosphere a little better.” TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson, who averaged only 27.8 minutes over 24 games in an injury-filled rookie season, went to the bench with three fouls with 8:10 left in the first half. He did play 30 minutes. ... New Orleans shot 52.5% in the game and hada 45-35 rebound advantage. Raptors: The loss ended Toronto’s seven-game win streak in season openers. ... It was Lowry’s ninth straight opening-day start for the Raptors. ... The Raptors have seven undrafted players on their season-opening roster.","401267174"
"Trae Young throws an alley-oop from half court to John Collins who goes up to throw down a one-handed dunk to cap the fast break for the Hawks. (0:19) CHICAGO -- — Trae Young was tough to stop in his first two NBA seasons. Surrounded by more talent than ever before, he could become a nightmare for the league in his third year. Young scored 37 points and the revamped Atlanta Hawks pounded Chicago 124-104 on Wednesday night, spoiling Billy Donovan's debut as Bulls coach. “Just being able to go out there and put on a show in the first game was really good,” Young said. “Not every night obviously is going to be like this, but it's really good to have an opening game like this.” Atlanta shot 54% (43 for 80) from the field and had seven players score in double figures. Cam Reddish had 15 points and John Collins finished with 14. “All of our guys played well. All of our guys played together,” coach Lloyd Pierce said. Looking for their first playoff berth since 2017, the Hawks signed Bogdan Bogdanovic, Danilo Gallinari, Rajon Rondo and Kris Dunn during free agency. Rondo and Dunn were held out on opening night, but Bogdanovic had 15 points and seven rebounds, and Gallinari scored 13. While the newcomers could give Atlanta a big lift, the dynamic Young remains the engine that drives the Hawks. He seemingly scored at will against the Bulls, going 10 for 12 from the field, 5 for 6 from 3-point range and 12 for 14 at the line. He also had seven assists and six rebounds in just 26 minutes. “The way we spaced, it opened up a lot of driving lanes and gaps to the rim for either shots at the rim or if they helped, we had shooters open,” Young said. Chicago cleaned out its front office and fired coach Jim Boylen after it went 22-43 last year during its third consecutive losing season. Donovan was hired in September, and it looks as if he has quite the job ahead of him. Zach LaVine scored 22 points and Lauri Markkanen had 21 points and seven rebounds in a solid start to an important season for the 23-year-old forward. But the Bulls struggled defensively and were careless with the ball at times, finishing with 17 turnovers. “We did not help each other well enough defensively,” Donovan said. Patrick Williams, the No. 4 overall pick in this year's draft, had 16 points for Chicago in his NBA debut. The 19-year-old Williams became the youngest player in Bulls history to start their first game of the season. Young led the way as Atlanta grabbed control in the first half. He found Collins for an alley-oop jam that made it 66-46 with 4:49 left. He had 27 points on 7-for-9 shooting at the break, helping the Hawks to an 83-59 halftime lead. “We just didn't come to play as a team,” Bulls center Wendell Carter Jr. said. TIP-INS Hawks: Dunn (right knee) missed the game against his former team. Dunn played for the Bulls for the past three seasons before signing a $10 million, two-year contract with the Hawks in free agency. “He's just at a point where he's trying to get right,” Pierce said. “He's been doing some non-contact activity.” ... C Clint Capela (left Achilles soreness) and Rondo (health and safety protocols) also were held out. Asked if it could be a lingering issue with Capela, Pierce said: “No, I just thought he was sore.” Bulls: F Thaddeus Young missed the opener because of an infection in his lower left leg. ... Donovan didn't reveal his starters until right before his first game. He went with Williams, Markkanen, LaVine, Carter, and Coby White, but he said staying flexible is important this year because of COVID-19 protocols. “I think we've got to do a good job, players and coaches, of making sure we're all staying ready,"" he said. ROOKIES While Williams started in his NBA debut, Atlanta rookie Onyeka Okongwu was sidelined by a foot injury. Okongwu, a 6-foot-9 center from Southern California who was selected by the Hawks with the No. 6 pick in the draft, will be re-evaluated on Monday, the day of Atlanta’s home opener against Detroit.","401267175"
"Ja Morant stuns the Spurs with an impressive dunk after throwing the ball off the glass to himself for a two-handed slam. (0:29) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — DeMar DeRozan had 28 points and nine assists, Dejounte Murray added 21 points as the San Antonio Spurs used a balanced attack to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies 131-119 on Wednesday night, overcoming a huge game by Ja Morant. Morant -- the reigning rookie of the year -- had 34 of his career-high 44 points in the second half. While that helped carry the Grizzlies offensively, it wasn’t enough to put a deep dent in San Antonio’s double-digit lead through much of the second half. “I’m not happy at all,” Morant said when asked about the career-high, adding: “We came up short. So, learning from this game and prepare for the next.” While the game tipped off the Grizzlies 20th season in Memphis, things were toned down from the normal baptism of a new campaign. FedExForum was void of any fans, leaving any crowd noise to recorded reactions. “I thought our guys, our young guys competed hard, really showed themselves well for the first game we played together,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. He later added that Murray’s defense “did a good job making Morant work.” “At the end, I think we were probably a little bit tired. But Morant just took it in his own hands and decided to attack the rim. I don’t think we got back really well the last six, seven minutes of the game. But, fortunately, we were able to continue scoring.” LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points for San Antonio, while Lonnie Walker IV and Keldon Johnson had 16 each, part of seven Spurs finishing in double figures. “I think we got a little sloppy toward the end,” Murray said. “But like I said, we fought, we played together, and we made it happen and we came out with a win.” Dillon Brooks scored 16 for the Grizzlies, while Jonas Valanciunas added 15 points and 13 rebounds. The Spurs, who fell behind early as Memphis was connecting on 3-pointers, clamped down on defense in the second quarter. The stingy defense and much better shooting by the Spurs helped San Antonio to a 66-53 lead at the break. “They really picked up their pressure in the second quarter, which I think really think impacted both sides of the ball,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. TIP-INS Spurs: Fourth-year G Derrick White was out recovering from left toe surgery. …Wore their City Edition jerseys with the fiesta colors – teal, pink and orange – across the chest and down the side of the shorts. … G Patty Mills connected on a 3-pointer in the second quarter, moving him ahead of Allen Iverson for 99th on the all-time made 3-pointer list with 1,060. Grizzlies: Are 9-17 in home openers, and had won six of their last eight entering the game. …Memphis remained without F Jaren Jackson Jr. (left knee meniscus surgery) and swingman Justise Winslow (left hip displacement). … Valanciunas reached 1,000 career rebounds in the third quarter. DANCIN’ POP: Spurs swingman Lonnie Walker IV apparently is trying to help coach Gregg Popovich into music, teaching the San Antonio coach about some of the better rap artist. “The only ones that I listen to are the ones you can dance to,” Popovich said. “If you can’t dance to it, then it’s not good.”","401267177"
"Karl-Anthony Towns describes the struggle he has been going through as he recovers emotionally from the death of his mother due to COVID-19. (1:32) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Minnesota's season-opening victory over Detroit was winding down, and Karl-Anthony Towns was urged by teammate D'Angelo Russell to grab the game ball as a keepsake. For mom, in memory. Towns had 22 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, leading the Timberwolves past the Pistons 111-101 on Wednesday night after a pregame moment of silence and moving tribute video for the All-Star center's mother. Jacqueline Cruz-Towns died of complications from COVID-19 in April. “When you go through what I’ve been through, you just find a different source of strength. I don’t know how to explain it. I made a promise to these guys to be here for them,” Towns said. Malik Beasley scored 23 points, Russell pitched in 18 points, and Anthony Edwards — the first overall draft pick last month — added 15 points in his debut as the Timberwolves overcame a deficit that often reached double digits and was still 12 points midway through the third quarter. In a promising sign for this long-languishing franchise, they leaned on their defense to come back. “We grew up, man,” Towns said. Towns had to do a lot of that off the court this spring and summer, while the NBA paused for the pandemic. “You may see me smiling and stuff, but that Karl died on April 13th,"" Towns said. ""He’s never coming back. I don’t remember that man. I don’t know that man. You’re talking to the physical me, but my soul has been killed off a long time ago,” Towns said. Towns, who made Minnesota’s first basket after an 0-for-7 start by the team, gave the Timberwolves their first lead of the game at 98-97 on a 3-pointer with 3:38 remaining. Russell hit one with 2:05 left for a 103-101 edge, Towns rebounded a missed deep shot on the other end by Derrick Rose, and Beasley buried one with 1:28 to go to send the Wolves on their way. Josh Jackson (19 points) and Rose (15 points) provided plenty of production off the bench, but the Pistons sputtered down the stretch and were outscored 31-16 in the fourth quarter. Rookie Killian Hayes, one of the team's three first-round draft picks, had three turnovers in the fourth quarter. “That’s what this is for, for him to learn from and get better in those situations,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Blake Griffin, the six-time All-Star, had 15 points and seven rebounds after his 2019-20 season was limited to 18 games by another left knee injury. The first overall pick in the 2009 draft, one of the few prominent players left after the overhaul commissioned by new general manager Troy Weaver, took only one shot in the fourth quarter. Jackson was the standout of a disappointing night. The rest of the Pistons shot 5 for 28 from 3-point range. “That’s part of my role on this team, to come out and spread the floor,” Jackson said. TIP-INS Pistons: Mason Plumlee pitched in 14 points, eight rebounds and six assists. He went 7 for 8 from the floor. Timberwolves: Towns and Jarrett Culver (10 points, 10 rebounds) became the first Minnesota pair to record point-rebound double-doubles in a season opener since Kevin Garnett and Rasho Nesterovic in 2002.","401267178"

Harrison Barnes stole the ball from Jokic with 2.6 seconds left and Buddy Hield tipped in his miss at the buzzer, sending the Sacramento Kings storming off the court with a stunning 124-122 win over the Denver Nuggets in overtime Wednesday night. Jokic recorded a triple-double with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists, but he had a crucial offensive foul with 2.6 seconds left in regulation that denied Denver a chance to win it in regulation and he watched helplessly as Barnes stole the ball in the chaotic closing moments of overtime. Hield led Sacramento with 22 points and Barnes and De’Aaron Fox each added 21 for the Kings, who snapped a six-game skid in Denver, where they had last won on Jan. 3, 2017. Fox also had a key block of Will Barton’s layup with 10.6 seconds remaining in overtime and Barnes grabbed the long rebound and raced downcourt to for a layup that tied it at 122 with 6.5 seconds left. Denver called timeout, but Barnes punched the ball away from Jokic, then raced for a 4-foot dunk that Barton blocked. Hield tipped it in just before the buzzer, then raced off the court and through the tunnel at the newly renamed Ball Arena. Michael Porter Jr. scored 24 points for Denver despite early foul trouble, but playoff star Jamal Murray was held to five points and was 1-for-9 shooting before fouling out late in regulation. “I’d be lying if I told you our defense had a lot to do with that,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “When you’re as good as Jamal Murray and you have a shooting night like that, that’s more him having an off-night. Now, I give our guys credit for competing and making it hard for him. But he sees that every night. “I actually feel bad for whoever has to guard him next time out. I’m assuming he’ll probably have a pretty good game. But our guys did a heck of a job competing.” Before the game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone was asked if Murray could match his playoff prowess in the new season, and he used the opportunity to talk about how the team’s first trip to the Western Conference Finals in a decade last summer was already old news. “As great as last season was -- I’m going to keep saying this -- that season is over,” Malone said. “That was a different team. Yes, we have our core back, but we have seven new players. As great as it was to win our division, to get to the Western Conference Finals, to comeback from two 3-1 deficits; starting tonight, who cares? That’s over.” Murray emerged as a bona fide star in the bubbled playoffs in Florida, but Malone said Murray, Jokic and everyone else has to forget about that run now. “We can’t rely on that,” Malone said. “That is ancient history in my eyes. Now, Jamal has a challenge of being that player for 72 games. He did it at a high level for 19 games in the playoffs. Now, this is the beginning of the 2020-2021 season, can Jamal Murray bring it every night and help this team reach even greater heights? “Our goal has still been, we haven’t obtained our goal yet, and that is to win a championship. Jamal is going to be a big part of that.” After the game, Malone pointed to the Kings' 36-24 third quarter as the key to Denver's disappointment, and Jokic concurred, saying, “We relaxed. We played a really good first half. They came out of (halftime) really aggressive with a lot of energy and picked up the tempo of the game. We didn’t match it.” TIP-INS Kings: Corey Joseph had 12 points in 12 minutes off the bench in the first half. ... Sacramento didn't lead at all in the first half, and there was only one tie before halftime, at 7-7. Nuggets: Murray missed all five of his 3-pointers but made all seven of his free throws. ... The Nuggets were outrebounded 53-45 although no Kings reached double digits off the glass (four Sacramento players had nine boards).","401267179"
"Donovan Mitchell feeds it inside to Rudy Gobert and he throws down a dunk on Jusuf Nurkic. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Rudy Gobert had 20 points and 17 rebounds in a dominant season-opening performance, leading the Utah Jazz to a 120-100 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. Gobert controlled the inside and got plenty of support from the outside as Utah shot 19 of 50 from the 3-point line. “It’s fun when we play the way we played tonight,” Gobert said. Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell and Bojan Bogdanovic all made four 3-pointers and Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson knocked down three apiece. Mitchell also scored 20 points. Damian Lillard was scoreless in the first half and finished with only nine points and seven assists for Portland. “They came out from the jump and they were blitzing and trapping. I wasn’t really expecting that,” Lillard said. “But I just didn’t play a good offensive game.” Utah started quickly from outside and pushed its lead to 52-33 with 6:29 left in the first half. The Jazz led by as much as 23 before taking a 64-44 lead at halftime. Lillard was held scoreless in a half for the first time in six seasons. Lillard broke the drought with a layup early in the third quarter. Perhaps no play summed up the night for Portland better than a 3-on-1 break that left Lillard wide open with 31 seconds left, before Lillard took a hesitation dribble and missed the 3-pointer with nobody around him. The frustration extended to his backcourt mate CJ McCollum, who picked up a late technical foul arguing a call in the fourth quarter. McCollum led the Blazers with 23 points. “I don’t think it was for a lack of effort. I think we played hard, we just didn’t play well on both sides of the ball,” McCollum said. Utah’s held the Blazers to barely 40% shooting and had a 59-40 rebounding advantage. It wasn’t just Gobert, but the Jazz had four other players who grabbed at least six rebounds, including Clarkson with seven boards off the bench. TIP-INS Jazz: Bogdanovic played for the first time since March 9. He elected to have wrist surgery in May during the NBA’s hiatus and did not join the team in the NBA bubble. Bogdanovic, who averaged 20 points last season, finished with 15. Blazers: Wednesday was the first game for Portland newcomers Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. Both players are starters for the Blazers. Jones Jr. had a good night shooting the ball, hitting 3 of 5 3-pointers. Covington was 0 for 3 from the field and scoring only one point.","401267180"
"Late in the fourth quarter, Grayson Allen and Trae Young's feet get tangled up causing Young to stumble on the play. (0:25) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Trae Young scored eight straight points down the stretch and finished with 36 points as the Atlanta Hawks beat the Memphis Grizzlies 122-112 Saturday night. Kevin Huerter added 21 points for the Hawks, who won their second straight. De’Andre Hunter finished with 15 points and rookie Nathan Knight added 14 points, going 4 of 5 from the field and 2-for-3 shooting from 3-point range. Ja Morant led Memphis with 28 points and seven assists, and Kyle Anderson finished with 20 points and 14 rebounds. Dillon Brooks added 19 points before fouling out in the closing seconds. Huerter said the goal was to stop the Grizzlies’ transition game and keep them out of the paint, where they are one of the best teams in the league. “For the most part, I think we did a pretty good job at that. We tried to turn a lot of them into shooters,” Huerter said, later adding: “Trying to keep them out of the paint, and we did our thing offensively.” The game was a showdown between two of the league’s top young point guards in Young and Morant, both of whom had big season-openers. Young had 37 points in the Hawks’ 124-104 win at Chicago, while Morant scored a career-high 44 in a home loss to San Antonio. Young, who was limited to 12 points in the first half, scored 10 points in the final 2:40 against the Grizzlies, starting with the eight straight to keep Memphis from overtaking Atlanta. “I think shots just went down,” Young said of the second half. “I was getting some really good looks in that first half. Shots just weren’t going in. For all of us. … I think we got the rust off (in the first half) and played really well as far as scoring throughout the rest of the game.” The young guards carried their teams through the first half, with the Hawks also getting an early burst from Huerter, who had 13 points at the break, hitting all five of his shots. The Hawks held a 58-56 lead at the half. “We’re both young talents trying to be the face of the league,” Morant said. “We’ve played against each other many times. ... The sky’s the limit for (Young).” TIP-INS Hawks: Split a pair of preseason games against the Grizzlies in Memphis. …Starting frontline player Danilo Gallinari did not play due to a left foot contusion. … Knight, who signed a two-way contract with the Hawks after a four-year career at William &amp; Mary, scored his first NBA points in the first quarter. Grizzlies: Reserve G De’Anthony Melton was a late scratch Saturday morning due to health and safety protocols. “In terms of a return date, I’m new to this process,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, adding: “We don’t have a firm timeline yet. It’s to be determined.” ... Kyle Anderson reached 2,000 career points in the first quarter. … Morant reached 500 assists in the second quarter. INJURY KNOWLEDGE: When asked about the availability of certain Hawks injured players, coach Lloyd Pierce candidly said he can only coach the ones available. And that’s how he approaches it. “I never pretend to know about injuries,” the Hawks coach said. “I’ve never sustained an injury in my life, so I don’t pretend to know what an ACL or and MCL or anything else or foot or ankle. I don’t know anything about it, so I don’t try to pretend to know.”","401267181"
"LaMelo Ball makes two 3-pointers in the first quarter of the Hornets' game vs. the Thunder, the first of his career. (0:26) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — After watching his team surrender a 13-point lead in the final two minutes, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said he needed to clear his head. He did, and then he went to work. Gilgeous-Alexander knocked down a tiebreaking jumper with 1.4 seconds left and finished with 24 points, helping the Oklahoma City Thunder hold off a furious rally by the Charlotte Hornets to win their season opener 109-107 Saturday night. Taking the last shot is a role the third-year player said he's become comfortable with. “The greats do it,” he said. “It’s a role I'm blessed to have. But I work extremely hard and I want to take full advantage of it.” The Thunder led 102-89 with 1:50 to go, but Miles Bridges spurred Charlotte with 11 of his 14 points in the final 1:06 — including a trio of 3s in the last 25 seconds. His final 3 tied it at 107 with 10.3 seconds left. Gilgeous-Alexander then took the inbound pass, brought the ball up the floor and pulled up from 23 feet to drain a contested jumper over Caleb Martin from the top of the key. “He understood how much time he had and got to his spot,"" said Mark Daigneault, who won in his debut as Oklahoma City's coach. George Hill was 8 of 9 from the field and finished with 21 points, and Darius Bazley and Luguentz Dort each had 15 points for the Thunder after their first scheduled game against the Rockets was postponed earlier in the week. “When coach drew it up, he told Shai to go at six, I was like, he’s hitting the shot,” Bazley said. Hill said he liked what he saw from the new-look Thunder. “This season is a going to have a lot of ups and downs, some wins and losses, but the more we can stay together and be resilient, we will be fine,"" Hill said. Terry Rozier, who had 42 points on 10 3-pointers in Charlotte’s loss to the Cavaliers to open the season, had 19 points to lead the Hornets, but his desperation heave at the buzzer fell short. P.J. Washington added 18 points and rookie LaMelo Ball scored 13 points off the bench. Ball was held scoreless in the NBA regular season debut against the Cavaliers but scored nine in the first quarter Saturday, including two 3s. He later got a floater to fall from 13 feet and added a dunk off a steal, finishing the first half 5 of 6 from the floor for 13 points to give the Hornets a 59-57 lead at the break. However, he did not score in the second half, missing all four shots from the field. “I thought LaMelo played extremely well tonight,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “There may be more minutes for him. Tonight was a good step for him.” TIP-INS Thunder: Outrebound the Hornets 54-47 behind 13 boards from Al Horford. Hornets: Charlotte shot 6 of 31 from the field in the third quarter after shooting 50% in the first half. ... Bismack Biyombo started at center for Cody Zeller, who is out at least four weeks after breaking a bone in his left hand in the team's season-opening loss at Cleveland. CLOSING THE DEAL The Thunder struggled with putting the game away in the final 2 minutes, missing free throws and turning the ball over. Daigneault said that will be an area the team must improve upon. “We could have handled it better,” Daigneault said. “Hopefully we learn from it and handle it better next time.” As for his own performance in his coaching debut, Daigneault said he gave himself a “C-plus.""","401267182"
"Andre Drummond blocks the floater then corrals the ball for an outlet pass to Collin Sexton in transition who drills a 3-pointer on the other end. (0:22) DETROIT -- — The Cleveland Cavaliers took full advantage of Detroit's inability to close out games. Collin Sexton scored 32 points and three of his teammates had at least 21 points, helping Cleveland  beat Detroit  128-119 in two overtimes Saturday night. “Multiple opportunities where we could’ve given in, multiple opportunities that we could've lost the fight,"" Pacers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Every player, to a man, decided that was not going to happen. We will not quit and that’s a testament to those guys and building our identity."" While the Cavs improved to 2-0, the rebuilding Pistons dropped to 0-2 after also struggling down the stretch in their season-opening loss at Minnesota. “The positive is we put ourselves in a position to win two straight games,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. Cleveland center Andre Drummond had 23 points, 16 rebounds, five assists, four steals and three blocks against his former team. “A lot of memories just rushed into my head,"" said Drummond, who was drafted No. 9 overall by Detroit in 2012 and traded to the Cavs last season. Darius Garland added 21 points and a career-high 12 assists, setting the tone for a young backcourt with Sexton that combined to score 49 points in the season-opening win over Charlotte. “Our two young guards carried us and put us in a position to win,"" Bickerstaff said. Cleveland reserve Cedi Osman had 22 points, Kevin Love scored 15 points after missing the opener with a calf injury and JaVale McGee had 11 points off the bench. Jerami Grant had 14 of his 28 points in the third quarter, when the Pistons took control before blowing it, and Blake Griffin finished with 26 points. Detroit's Derrick Rose had 13 points, missing 11 of 15 shots, and had some costly turnovers. Cleveland led 59-53 at halftime with three scorers — Sexton, Osman and Garland — already in double figures. Griffin had 18 points at halftime, scoring all his points on 3-pointers with just two misses beyond the arc. Detroit closed the third with a 14-0 run, capped by Grant’s 3-pointer from the team’s logo at midcourt, after the Cavs led by 11 earlier in the quarter. The Pistons were ahead 101-93 with three-plus minutes left in regulation and allowed the Cavs to score the final eight points — five on Drummond's free throws — in the quarter to extend the game. Rose helped the Pistons take a nine-point lead in overtime. He later lost opportunities to seal the victory with an unforced turnover while being guarded by Drummond with 13 seconds left and by losing the ball by dribbling it off Drummond's foot to give it back to the Cavs with 1.2 seconds left. “I’ll take Derrick Rose going to the basket,"" Casey insisted.

"Russell Westbrook goes full throttle towards the basket and finishes layup in the lane. (0:16) WASHINGTON -- — The Orlando Magic beat Washington 130-120 on Saturday night, overcoming another triple-double by Russell Westbrook in his home debut for the Wizards. Westbrook had 15 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists to become the fourth player in NBA history to record a triple-double in his team’s first two games. Magic Johnson (twice), Jerry Lucas, and Oscar Robertson previously accomplished the feat. Westbrook is the first player to do it with a new team after being acquired from Houston in the off-season for John Wall. “This one is on me,” Westbrook said after the Wizards dropped to 0-2. “For us we didn’t put ourselves in position to win the game, especially myself. Missing easy shots — it wasn't nothing that they did.” Terrence Ross scored 25 points to lead Orlando. Nikola Vucevic had 22 points and 17 rebounds, and Markelle Fultz added 21 points to help the Magic win its second straight to start the season. “I think it was a team effort,” Fultz said about trying to contain Westbrook. “He’s a great player. He gets to the rim. He creates for others. He’s on the glass.” Bradley Beal had 39 points for the Wizards, while Thomas Bryant had 19. Westbrook, who averaged a triple-double three straight seasons from 2016-17 to 2018-19 with Oklahoma City, had just two points at the half and finished shooting 6 for 19 from the field. “I feel fine,” Westbrook said when asked how he felt physically. “I just hate losing.” Despite the triple-double from Westbrook and big night from Beal – who had 11 points in the fourth – the Magic were in control for most of the game. Washington’s final lead came at 101-100 on a dunk by Robin Lopez with 8:46 left. Orlando then used a 13-2 run in which five different players scored to go up 113-103 and seal the game. “I think they’re a bear to guard,” Clifford said about the new look Wizards. “They play at a pace that makes it difficult to stay in touch with them.” Washington has dropped five straight to Orlando. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando’s reserves outscored their Wizards counterparts 53-32. ... Clifford said pregame that James Ennis (hamstring strain) remained in Orlando to continue his rehab schedule. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks said pregame that he wasn’t sure if Westbrook would play in the second half of back-to-backs but is hopeful Davis Bertans play between 18 to 20 minutes. Bertans had nine points in 20 minutes. ... HONORING WES Washington honored late Hall of Famer Wes Unseld before the game with a moment of silence and video tribute from Beal. The Wizards will wear the number 41 on their jerseys this season. Unseld died on June 20 at the age of 74.

"Ben Simmons cleans up on the offensive board with a putback dunk vs. the Knicks. (0:17) NEW YORK -- — The Philadelphia 76ers moved the ball around so well Ben Simmons felt like they were the Harlem Globetrotters. He and Embiid keep turning the New York Knicks into their Washington Generals. Embiid had 27 points and 10 rebounds while remaining unbeaten against the Knicks, leading the 76ers to a 109-89 victory Saturday night. Simmons had 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists while also leading the defensive effort that forced New York's RJ Barrett into a miserable shooting performance. The Sixers beat the Knicks for the 13th straight time since early in the 2017-18 season, the first with Embiid and Simmons playing together. They did it by breaking open a close game in the third quarter, when they had seven assists on their 11 baskets. “Team basketball wins games and championships,” Simmons said. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry each scored 17 points as Philadelphia improved to 2-0 and got off to a good start in turning around its road woes after finishing with a 12-26 road record last season. Having Curry and Danny Green aboard should help with their ability to hit from deep. “If you want to double, I dare you because we’re going to knock down those shots,” Embiid said. New coach Doc Rivers earned his 945th victory, moving ahead of Bill Fitch into sole possession of 10th place on the career list. “It’s a great feeling,” said Rivers, in his 22nd season. “I don’t count and it’s not why I coach but it’s an honor.” Julius Randle scored 25 points and Alec Burks added 22 for the Knicks, who fell to 0-2 under Tom Thibodeau. Barrett, after a 26-point season opener, shot 2 for 15 and had 10 points. “Our responsibility is to improve each and every day. Come in, put everything you have into it,” Thibodeau said. “The games reveal exactly where we are and obviously it’s showing us that we have a lot of work to do.” The Knicks were without both their first-round rookies. Obi Toppin is sidelined by a strained right calf and Immanuel Quickley was still sore after sustaining a hip pointer in their season opener. The Sixers' lead was just three a minute and a half into the third quarter before six straight points made it 68-59 on Curry's 3-pointer. Randle made a free throw, but two baskets by Embiid and 3-pointers by Curry and Green made it a 16-3 run and extended the lead to 78-62 midway through the period. The Knicks cut it to nine midway through the fourth, but Embiid nailed a 3-pointer before a nice flurry by Simmons pushed it to 104-85 TIP-INS 76ers: With Philadelphia completing its first back-to-back of the season Sunday at Cleveland, Rivers wouldn't say if Embiid would be rested. ... Philadelphia's last loss to New York was April 12, 2017, long after Embiid's rookie season had ended early because of injury. Knicks: Toppin, the No. 8 pick and last season's college player of the year, had an MRI on Saturday. The Knicks said he will be re-evaluated in a week to 10 days. ... New York also remained without G Austin Rivers (groin), leaving him unable to play against his father's team. WARDROBE MALFUNCTION The Knicks debuted their City Edition jerseys and one needed a quick alteration. Reggie Bullock's jersey had his No. 25 on the front but No. 23 on the back. Mitchell Robinson is No. 23, so Bullock had to change his jersey to the correct one after it was noticed.","401267185"
"Victor Oladipo gets bumped as he's shooting a 3-pointer and still buries it. (0:18) CHICAGO -- — Domantas Sobonis had 22 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, and the Indiana Pacers used big scoring runs in the second and third quarters to cruise to a 125-106 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night. T.J. Warren scored 23 points and Victor Oladipo added 22 as Indiana beat its Central Division rivals for a 10th straight time, including five straight at the United Center. Sabonis, who had a career-high 32 points in the season-opening win against New York, finished 8 for 11 from the field before fouling out with just over five minutes remaining. “My teammates really helped me,” Sabonis said. “All game long they were reminding me where to be and helping me keep my energy up. In these games, with no fans out there, that's really important.” Zach LaVine scored 17 points and Lauri Markkanen had 16 points and nine rebounds for Chicago, which dropped its second straight to start the season. After getting off to a horrid start in the season-opening loss to Atlanta, the Bulls started fairly well on Saturday, building a 40-34 advantage early in the second quarter. But the game quickly turned as Indiana ran off 21 straight points to grab a 55-40 lead. Chicago went scoreless for five minutes and fell apart at both ends. The Bulls went 0-for-8 from the field with six turnovers during the drought — with three of the turnovers coming in the backcourt against Indiana's full-court trap. Defensively, they broke down repeatedly and allowed easy baskets. “Whatever the run was in the second quarter, we have to be able to stop it sooner than that,” Chicago coach Billy Donovan said. “They don't handle it — they don't handle it at all. They internalize it and try to do it themselves. They have to do it together. “The bottom line is this is pro basketball and you have to be able to handle it.” LaVine agreed with his coach's assessment. “We have to fight,"" he said. ""We can't let those lapses go that long.” The Pacers had a 66-56 halftime lead and started the third quarter with 18 straight points for an 84-56 edge to essentially put the game away. Chicago missed its first seven shots of the quarter and didn't score until a Markkanen layup with 7:12 left. “In the third quarter, we knew we had to come out and change things,” Sabonis said. The Bulls rallied, trimming the deficit to 114-103 with just under four minutes to play, but Warren converted a layup and Oladipo added a 3-pointer to build the lead up to 119-103. TIP-INS Pacers: C Goga Bitadze (right ankle sprain), F Brian Bowen II (right groin) and G Jeremy Lamb (left knee) each missed a second straight game.

"DeMar DeRozan gets the steal off the inbounds and throws it up to Keldon Johnson who hammers it home with two hands. (0:18) SAN ANTONIO -- — San Antonio is emphasizing a youth movement this season. The team's veterans are still capable of pulling out a victory. DeMar DeRozan had 27 points and the Spurs rallied in the final minute to beat the Toronto Raptors 119-114 on Saturday night. San Antonio’s Dejounte Murray added 11 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first career triple-double. Murray became just the 14th player in franchise history to accomplish the feat. DeRozan’s 3-pointer with a minute remaining pulled the Spurs within 114-113. The 12-year veteran was 3 for 4 on 3-pointers as he joined the list of top 100 scorers in league history. “DeMar, that’s part of his game this season, to shoot more 3s,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “He’s more confident with it and it shows.” The Spurs took a 115-114 lead on LaMarcus Aldridge’s fadeaway put-back with 29.9 seconds remaining. In his 15th season, Aldridge outfought a host of Raptors and even Murray for the rebound after San Antonio missed two previous shots. “It was impressive,” Murray said of Aldridge’s effort. Toronto’s Kyle Lowry missed a pull-up 19-footer with 22.3 seconds left, and 34-year-old Rudy Gay made two free throws at the other end. Fred VanVleet had 27 points and Chris Boucher added 22 points for the Raptors in their first road game. Toronto had six players score in double figures, including all five starters. Patty Mills added 21 points, Lonnie Walker IV had 14 and Aldridge and Keldon Johnson each had 12 for San Antonio. The Spurs had 36 assists to achieve a balanced scoring. “It was all over the place,” DeRozan said of the team’s pace. “That’s how we need to play. When we move the ball the way we did tonight, you’re going to have more outcomes like tonight.” San Antonio was playing its first home game since March 10 prior to the league imposing a four-month layoff due to the pandemic. The Spurs played a standard message outlining league rules for fans in attendance even as the AT&amp;T Center was essentially empty. There were a few family members scattered in the lower bowl, but their support was drowned out by recorded cheers. Popovich expects more 3-point shooting this season, and the Spurs responded by going 14 for 34 after attempting 25 in their season opener against the Memphis Grizzlies. The Spurs had four 3-pointers in the second quarter to match their output in the opening period, but quickening their pace enabled them to add three dunks in the second. TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry had 16 points and 10 rebounds for his second double-double in two games. He is averaging 17 points and 10 assists for Toronto. ... Aron Baynes made his San Antonio debut as a member of the Raptors. In his ninth season, Baynes spent his first three seasons in the NBA with the Spurs before moving on to Detroit, Boston, Phoenix and Toronto. Spurs: Popovich said Derrick White is progressing and “should return soon” after not playing in the preseason and missing the team’s opener following left toe surgery. The team’s starting point guard was running, cutting and shooting 3-pointers prior to the game with no visible signs of discomfort. ... The last two Spurs triple-doubles both came at home against the Raptors. Prior to Murray’s triple-double on Saturday, DeRozan had the team’s previous on Jan. 3, 2019.","401267187"
"Timberwolves rookie Anthony Edwards takes coast-to-coast straight at Rudy Gobert for a turn away jumper. (0:27) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Tough defense is becoming a crucial part of Minnesota’s basketball identity. That was evidenced by what the Timberwolves did in the closing seconds of their 116-111 victory over Utah on Saturday night. The Jazz had a chance to set up a tying 3-pointer and force overtime with 4.2 seconds left. Minnesota did not even let it get to that point. The Timberwolves forced Bojan Bogdanovic to commit a five-second violation on an inbounds pass. Utah got the turnover and Minnesota got the win. “We played a tough game today,” center Karl-Anthony Towns said. “We gutted this one out. Played great defense all around.” D’Angelo Russell had 25 points and six assists to lead the Timberwolves. Towns added 16 points and 12 rebounds. Minnesota had five players score in double figures. Jordan Clarkson scored 23 points and Donovan Mitchell added 21 to lead the Jazz. Mike Conley added 20 points and Rudy Gobert chipped in 18 points and 17 rebounds. Utah trailed over the final three quarters. The Jazz rallied from a double-digit deficit and closed within 107-103 with 2:27 left on back-to-back 3-pointers from Mitchell. Russell hit a jumper and Josh Okogie cut to the basket for a dunk on Minnesota’s next two possessions to keep Utah from erasing the Timberwolves’ lead. Utah made it a one-possession game on Gobert’s putback dunk with 5.9 seconds left. Russell made only 1 of 2 free throws, giving the Jazz a chance to set up a tying 3-pointer that never materialized. “They were the more aggressive team, and they took us out of our actions,” Mitchell said. “We couldn’t use their aggression against them.” Anthony Edwards tallied nine of his 18 points in the first quarter. “He’s going to continue take steps because he has a growth mindset,” Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. “I thought he made plays within the offense too. You don’t see that a lot from a teenager.” The Jazz cut the deficit to a single possession near the midway point of the second quarter, pulling within 44-41 on a floater from Clarkson. Minnesota stamped out the rally with a 10-2 run, punctuated by a banked floater from Beasley, and extended its lead to 54-43. Utah struggled with defending the perimeter and could not adapt enough on offense to handle consistent pressure from the Timberwolves. Minnesota shot 55% from 3-point range in the first half. The Timberwolves made 11 3-pointers before halftime. On the other end, they forced 12 Jazz turnovers and turned those into 17 points. “Minnesota was the more aggressive team in the first half,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “They ran, they defended, and we didn’t do either of those things.” Not much changed for either team in the third quarter. Minnesota led by as many as 17 points in the quarter, going up 86-69 on a Naz Reid 3-pointer. TIP INS Timberwolves: Towns blocked four shots, his highest number of blocks in a game since the 2018-19 season. … Jarrett Culver went 3 of 3 from 3-point range and finished with 14 points. … Minnesota scored 26 points off 18 Utah turnovers. Jazz: Conley scored Utah’s first nine points of the third quarter. … Mitchell and Bogdanovic were a combined 9-of-39 shooting from the field. … Royce O’Neale finished with 13 rebounds. … The Jazz had a moment of silence before tipoff for Utah running back Ty Jordan, who died from an accidental gunshot wound on Friday night. BRINGING BACK THE FANS 1,500 fans piled into Vivint Smart Home Arena to watch the Jazz play their home opener. Utah is one of the few NBA teams to play games in front of fans this season. Fans were limited to seats in the lower bowl and none sat courtside near either team. The Jazz enjoyed playing before actual fans again. “It was a breath of fresh air for all of us,” Conley said. “It sounded like a lot more people than were there. Loved having the fans and our families there."" The Timberwolves also embraced seeing socially distanced faces in the crowd. “It was a dope experience,” Edwards said. GUTTING IT OUT Towns left late in the fourth quarter after falling on his left wrist. He returned to action for the final 57.7 seconds. The wrist was sore after the fall, but the Minnesota center decided to finish things out and play through the pain down the stretch. “I didn’t just want to quit the game and go get X-rays,” Towns said. “I wanted to be there in case my team needed me.” Towns fractured the same wrist in February before the NBA All-Star break.","401267188"
"James Harden sinks a filthy step-back 3-pointer to put the Rockets up 126-125, but he is outdone by CJ McCollum, who drops a game-winning 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds remaining in overtime. (1:34) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — CJ McCollum scored 44 points, including a 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds left that gave the Portland Trail Blazers a 128-126 win over the Houston Rockets on Saturday night. Damian Lillard had 32 points and nine assists to help Portland get its first win. McCollum also had eight assists. McCollum finished 17 for 30 from the field, including 9 for 16 on 3s. Lillard was 5 for 13 from beyond the arc. “I think besides Steph (Curry) and Klay Thompson, we’re the only backcourt in the league that empowers the other,” McCollum said of his partnership with Lillard. “I don’t try to take over the game from him. We work together.” James Harden finished with 44 points and 17 assists for Houston, and Christian Wood added 31 points and 13 rebounds. Harden also had a game-ending turnover on the final possession of overtime. Lillard’s layup pushed the Blazers ahead 125-123 with 30 seconds left in overtime, but Harden made a 3 to push the Rockets ahead with 15.3 seconds left. Then with 6.3 seconds left, the ball found McCollum again and the Blazers’ guard hit another long range shot putting Portland ahead 128-126. “We tried to do everything that it takes as a team to stop whoever has the hot hand,” Harden said of the Blazers'guards. “They both started off slow and then the rest of the game the caught fire.” McCollum’s jumper with 2:03 left in overtime pushed Portland’s lead to 123-118, forcing a Rockets timeout. After Wood cut the Blazers lead to 123-120 with a layup, Harden tied the game again at 123 with 38.6 seconds left. A layup by Wood with less than a minute left in regulation tied the score at 111. Then Lillard put the Blazers ahead at 113-111 with 52 seconds left. Harden responded with a basket of his own to tie it again at 113 with 38.9 seconds left. After a missed 3-pointer by Lillard, Houston’s PJ Tucker was called for a loose ball foul on the rebound with 32 seconds left. Houston’s challenge of the call was unsuccessful, but they were rewarded after Jusuf Nurkic missed both free-throws. Both teams exchanged empty possessions and the game went into overtime. After Portland jumped out to an early lead, Harden’s impact on the game was much more noticeable. Harden had eight assists, to go along with six points, in the first quarter alone. “I feel like my conditioning could be better obviously,” Harden said. “But I think we let it get away from us. I didn’t surprise myself at all. I know what I’m capable of.” For Portland, Lillard made good on his promise to be more aggressive after scoring only nine points in the opener, getting 21 in the first half. But despite the better start and a more aggressive Lillard, things once again went sideways for the Blazers in the second quarter. The Rockets pushed their lead to 40-30 with 8:16 left, all with Harden watching from the bench, forcing a Blazers timeout. Houston pushed its lead to 16 in the first half. Harden, who had a double-double of 17 points and 10 assists by halftime, also looked like he already had great chemistry with free agent acquisition Wood, who had 15 points in the first half, as Houston led 68-58 at the break. Houston’s grip on the game loosened in the third quarter as Portland’s defense started to string some stops together and McCollum got hot. McCollum had four 3s in the third, with three coming in a span of less than 90 seconds on his way to 14 points in the quarter. With the improved defense and McCollum’s play, the Rockets’ lead was cut to 85-84. Houston scored only 17 points in the third quarter. “We were more aggressive, we rotated a lot better,” McCollum said of Portland’s improved defense. “We’re learning, we’re learning on the fly. We have to adjust on the fly and take advantage of our time. Hopefully we will have more quarters like the third quarter tonight.” Houston has 16 players on its roster and entered Saturday with nine eligible, one more than the league minimum. The Rockets’ scheduled opener Wednesday was postponed because nine players were unavailable, including Harden after he was found to have violated league health and safety protocols. His four-day quarantine ended Friday. “It’s been difficult,’ first-year coach Stephen Silas said.” We didn’t have a shoot around on the gameday on Wednesday. “Then we didn’t play, then we didn’t have a practice that day and then we had a shootaround today. My preparation as far as film study has been fine but getting us on the same page has been a bit of a challenge.” The Rockets were still without John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Gordon and Mason Jones on Saturday, all listed as out by the Rockets with “health and safety protocols” as the reason. Those four players, if they return negative tests, will see seven-day quarantines end Wednesday and could play as early as Houston’s home game Thursday against Sacramento. Ben McLemore and Kenyon Martin Jr. are away from the team and self-isolating, the Rockets said, and Chris Clemons is lost for the season with an Achilles injury. “We have a chance,” Harden said of the Rockets, with the hope they will have a more complete unit next week. “We just have to get things clicking faster than later. We all know the West is a very strong conference, there’s no nights off. We have to be prepared each and every game.” TIP INS Blazers: Rodney Hood scored his first points since returning from a torn Achilles he suffered over a year ago. Hood was scoreless in his first game back on Thursday, but got going with a 3-pointer in the first quarter. Hood averaged 11 points per game and shot 49% from the 3-point line in 21 games with Portland last season. Hood was also a key member of the Blazers team that went to the Western Conference Finals in 2019. Hood Rockets: With only nine active players and Harden being a late arrival to training camp, Silas was asked about what kind of workload the former MVP would have. “James will play in the 30s for sure,” Silas anticipated. “I’ll be talking to him constantly through the game. We have to look at this long-term we can’t forsake the future and having him go out play 41, 42, 43 minutes but we are going to try and win the game.” As for the four players currently in quarantine, Silas said he expects to have them back for the team’s practice scheduled for Wednesday.","401267189"
"Chris Paul nails a 3-pointer before the halftime buzzer sounds for the Suns vs. the Kings. (0:23) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — De’Aaron Fox had 24 points and seven assists, Richaun Holmes and Buddy Hield combined for five free throws in the final two minutes and the Sacramento Kings held off the Phoenix Suns 106-103 on Saturday night. Marvin Bagley III added 13 points and 11 rebounds, Harrison Barnes had 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Hield finished with 14 points for Sacramento. Devin Booker scored 26 points for Phoenix. Chris Paul had 22 points and 12 assists. “We found a way to grind out a win,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “There’s lots of games throughout an NBA season that are going to require that type of mentality. Give our guys a lot of credit for the effort they played with.” Three nights after beating Denver on a last-second tip-in by Hield in overtime, the Kings had to sweat out another close one. Sacramento led 99-97 before Holmes scored on a three-point play with 1:43 remaining. Paul responded with a short jumper and free throw before Holmes made a pair from the stripe. After Booker missed a jumper with 4.7 seconds left, Hield made two free throws. Paul then made a 3-pointer at the buzzer. “I don’t know if relieved is the right word.” Barnes said. “We were just trying to maintain the edge that we had in that second half of that Denver game that really allowed us to kind of get over the hump and get that win. We were going to try to bring that into this game.” The loss ended the Suns’ nine-game winning streak dating to last season when Phoenix won its final eight games in the NBA bubble. Suns coach Monty Williams was troubled by his team’s perimeter shooting and noted that Phoenix has to regroup quickly with another game in Sacramento on Sunday. “It’s going to be a matter of will,” Williams said. “Both of us know each other. We have the fresh memory of tonight’s game. Coming out tomorrow, it’s going to be which team imposes its will on the other. We have to rise to the challenge.” The Kings got off to an 11-0 start and led most of the first half. Barnes sparked the fast start with a low bucket, a steal and a dunk. The Suns closed within 58-54 at halftime after Paul’s 3-pointer at the buzzer was waved off. The play was reviewed and overturned. TWO DOWN, 70 TO GO Sacramento is off to a 2-0 start for the first time since beating Cleveland and Philadelphia to open the 2003-04 season under then-coach Rick Adelman. The Kings last made the playoffs in 2005-06, the longest active drought in the NBA. “It’s nice but it’s mainly nice because it continues to support the journey we’re on and support the work that’s being put in by our players,” Walton said. “We’ll take it.’’ MISFIRING SUNS Phoenix shot 41.8% from the floor and was especially cold beyond the arc, going 11 of 44 on 3-pointers. Sacramento wasn’t much better at 5 for 23. “We have enough shooters to really knock those in at a higher clip,” said Jae Crowder, who had three 3s. “Looking at (the Kings) they made five 3s and beat us pretty good.” TIP-INS Suns: Booker had 11 points in the third quarter … Phoenix missed 16 of its first 3-point attempts. ... Phoenix last won 10 straight in 2010. Kings: Bagley has had a double-double in each of Sacramento’s first two games this season. The second overall pick in 2018, Bagley had only three during an injury-plagued season a year ago.","401267190"
"Luka Doncic drives down the lane and puts up the tough layup that hits the top of the backboard and falls in. (0:18) LOS ANGELES -- — Luka Doncic scored 24 points and the Dallas Mavericks led by a NBA-record 50 points at halftime in a 124-73 rout of the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday to earn their first win of the season. Josh Richardson added 21 points and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 18 points for the Mavs, who kept up their dominance in the second half, too. “There’s no huge secret,” Richardson said. “We just got up and played well. We played with a sense of urgency.” The Clippers trailed 77-27 at halftime, with their 50-point deficit being the largest at the break in the shot-clock era, which began in 1954-55. Paul George led the Kawhi Leonard-less Clippers with 15 points before sitting out the second half. Serge Ibaka added 13 points and nine rebounds over three quarters of the team's first loss. The Clippers began with victories over the defending NBA champion Lakers and Denver. “It's not that big of a deal,” George said. “Yes, we got our butts kicked today, but it's one game.” Los Angeles got outrebounded 32-16, had just three assists, and missed 18 of 19 3-pointers in the first half. George was the only Clipper in double figures with 13 after missing all six of his 3-point attempts. “It was a tough game, coming from Christmas. I enjoyed my Christmas Day yesterday, today just popped up on me a little too fast,” George said. “I take full responsibility. It'll be a different situation next game. We will be ready.” Doncic had 18 points, seven rebounds and four assists in the first half. He scored as many points (13) as the Clippers in the first quarter. The Mavs scored nearly every time down the court while forcing the Clippers into 9 of 37 field-goal shooting. “Everything was clicking on all cylinders,” said Hardaway Jr., adding that the team didn't realize how big the lead was until they were in the locker room at halftime. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle emphasized staying consistent in the second half. “The challenge is to maintain that level of competitiveness,” he said. “Our guys established a standard for collective toughness and will that we need to find a way to maintain.” The Clippers opened the third quarter on a 10-0 run — their biggest spurt of the game — to get within 40 points. The Mavs got right back to putting the hammer down. They connected on four consecutive 3-pointers — three by Hardaway Jr. — to restore their lead to 50. They were ahead 104-57 going into the fourth. Doncic just missed a triple-double, finishing with nine rebounds and eight assists. He has scored 83 points in his first three games of the season, the first two of which were losses. “We showed who we are. People judge us like first two games of season, it’s a long season,” Doncic said. “We got to keep going like that. We got to play defense.” The fourth quarter belonged to the teams' reserves, although the Clippers kept Luke Kennard, who started in place of Leonard, in the rotation for a bit. The Mavs' bench was on its feet and whipping towels in the air to celebrate Josh Green's one-handed fastbreak dunk that extended their lead to 53 points. Former Clipper Boban Marjanovic polished off a 12-0 run with a jumper that pushed the Mavs' lead to 120-63, their largest of the game. “We weren’t letting each other look up at the score,"" Mavs forward James Johnson said. The Mavs shot 49% from the field, made 14 3-pointers and outrebounded the Clippers 54-36 in the game. Los Angeles had 13 assists after notching 32 against Denver on Christmas. The Clippers shot 26 of 76 from the floor and made just 4 of 33 3-pointers. “You throw it away,” first-year Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “Our guys didn’t have a lot of pop on either end of the floor.” Leonard sat out after needing eight stitches in his mouth after accidentally getting elbowed by the 7-foot Ibaka going for a rebound in Friday’s win at Denver. He watched the debacle from the bench. TIP-INS Mavericks: They won for the first time in three road games to start the season. Eleven of their first 16 games are being played away from home. ...

"Kyrie Irving evades the defense to score a bucket with his left hand. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Gordon Hayward gave Hornets fans a little taste of why owner Michael Jordan felt strongly about luring him to Charlotte with a four-year, $120 million contract last month. Hayward, acquired in a sign-and-trade with Boston, had 28 points, seven assists and six rebounds, and Charlotte handed the Brooklyn Nets their first loss of the season, 106-104 on Sunday night. Hayward did a little bit of everything, making 12 of 20 shots while setting up his team with good scoring opportunities and helping the Hornets out of some potentially bad possessions with solid plays before the shot clock expired. “He brings us calm and poise out there,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. “He settles us when we need a good possession, an efficient possession. He is able to create that.” The 6-foot-7 small forward said he's just starting to get comfortable with his new teammates after a limited training camp and missing two preseason games with a broken finger. “We are constantly building that chemistry,” Hayward said. “We didn’t have as much time as we wanted to get to know each other. We are starting to figure each other out. When I do, that will ultimately help me be a better playmaker.” Terry Rozier added 19 points, including two clutch free throws, and P.J. Washington finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Hornets, who limited the Nets to 42.7% shooting from the floor. Kevin Durant led the Nets with 29 points, and Kyrie Irving chipped in with 25 points. After winning their first two games by 26 and 28 points, Brooklyn as finally in a close game in the fourth quarter, which Durant said he enjoyed. He also said the Nets need to learn they'll get everyone’s best game every night because they're considered a favorite in the East. “It’s good to have that target on your backs — and it will bring out the best in all of us,” Durant said. They certainly got Charlotte’s best game. “We have to treat every team like its Brooklyn,” Hayward said. “We had this sense of urgency.” The Hornets appeared to break open the game early in the fourth quarter behind seven quick points from Hayward. But the 16-point lead nearly evaporated as Durant and Irving began to play with a sense of urgency and helped cut the lead to 101-99 with less than two minutes to play. But with a chance to tie or take the lead, Irving's driving layup was blocked and Devonte Graham knocked down a corner 3 at the other end to give Charlotte a cushion. A short while later Durant missed an open pull-up jumper with 7.4 seconds left with the Nets trailing by two. Rozier made two free throws to make it a two-possession game and seal the win. “It looked good when it was leaving my hands,"" Durant said. ""Maybe I could have shot the 3 (instead). I’m sure we will get that shot later in the season and hopefully I can capitalize.” TIP INS Nets: Spencer Dinwiddle left the game in the third quarter with a right knee strain and did not return. It's unclear if he will play Monday night. ... Brooklyn was outrebounded 54-46. Hornets: Washington appeared to roll his ankle with 5.3 seconds remaining and left the game. Borrego said the power forward sprained his ankle, but isn't sure the extent of the injury.

"Robin Lopez saves a pass from going out of bounds and throws up a wild hook shot that miraculously goes in. (0:24) WASHINGTON -- — Timing can be everything and right now the Orlando Magic have been the better team in the all important fourth quarter to start the season. Markelle Fultz and Terrence Ross each scored 26 points as the Orlando Magic mounted a big fourth quarter comeback and beat the Washington Wizards 120-113 on Sunday night to start a season 3-0 for the first time since 2009-10. Nikola Vucevic scored in the post to give Orlando the lead for good at 114-113 with 25.1 seconds left as the Magic scored the final 10 points of the game in defeating the Wizards for the sixth straight time. “We’ve played three good fourth quarters,” said Magic coach Steve Clifford. “We could easily be 0-3 right now. All three games that we’ve played, the deciding quarter’s been the fourth quarter. How you win can build confidence….I think it’s good to win this way.” Vucevic finished with 15 points and eight rebounds while Evan Fournier added 19 as the Magic outscored the Wizards 43-19 in the fourth quarter making it the third largest fourth quarter comeback in team history. Bradley Beal had 29 points and seven assists but was just 10 for 29 from the field while Russell Westbrook was held out for rest as Washington dropped to 0-3 for the first time since 2016-17. “It’s not where we wanted to be but it’s where we are,” said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. “We’ve got to get the first win first before we get anything else.” While it will become more commonplace throughout this unique season, Washington and Orlando became the first teams to play a back-to-back in the same venue since Jan. 24-25, 1988 when Washington hosted Philadelphia. “Any time you can get a win on the road, it’s big,” said Fultz, who played his high school basketball in the DC area. “To be able to go 2-0 here is a huge. I think it’s a big confidence booster for us to show us what we can do. I still think we’ve got to start out a little better.” Brooks rested Westbrook in the second game of a back-to-back.

Beal, who had averaged 35.5 points per game in the previous four meetings with Orlando, missed two shots in the final 19 seconds… NO OFF DAYS While technically out on rest, Westbrook was not taking it easy at all. The two-time scoring champ and nine-time all-star stood for most of the game while shouting encouragement to his new teammates and letting the referees know he was still in the building. Westbrook often greeted the players with high-fives and chest bumps during time-outs. FOOTBALL SUNDAY Vucevic was called for two fouls in the first quarter, both while guarding Bradley Beal. After the second foul, Vucevic appeared frustrated and mimicked a punting motion while holding the ball. Orlando was issued a delay of game warning.","401267193"

(0:20) NEW ORLEANS -- — Brandon Ingram had 28 points and 11 rebounds and the New Orleans Pelicans held on for a 98-95 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday night. The Spurs had a chance to tie after Steven Adams, whose put-back dunk had given New Orleans a 97-91 lead with two minutes left, missed a pair of free throws with 11 seconds remaining. But Eric Bledsoe blocked DeMar DeRozan's 3-point attempt from behind in the final seconds to preserve a victory that New Orleans first-year coach Stan Van Gundy found gratifying on a night when his team overcame relatively poor shooting. “As a coach, these are my favorite kinds of wins,” Van Gundy said. ""Not that I want to shoot like that every night, but to shoot 38% — and 20% from 3 — and be able to get a win against a good team, to me, is a great way to win. “The first step is we got to get to where we don’t beat ourselves, and I'm talking specifically about turnovers and fouls,"" Van Gundy added. The Pelicans had just eight turnovers to the Spurs' 15, outscored San Antonio 21-8 at the foul line and had 12 offensive rebounds to the Spurs' four. Zion Williamson had 18 points — highlighted by five dunks — to go with 11 rebounds and five steals for the Pelicans. Lonzo Ball had 16 points and five steals, and Josh Hart had 12 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Williamson missed 15 of 22 shots but still managed his third double-double in three games — and a career-high in steals. “That’s a big part of building a wining culture,"" Williamson said. ""When one thing isn’t working for you, don’t let it affect the other parts of your game, like defense and rebounding.” Rudy Gay scored 22 points and Lonnie Walker IV had 16 for the Spurs, who lost for the first time after winning their first two regular season games. “I wish I could have knocked down a couple open 3s and kind of helped us a little bit more,” Gay said. “But the last play, obviously, they sniffed it out. We couldn’t get what we wanted out of it.” Keldon Johnson had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Dejounte Murray had 13 points, but also turned the ball over six times. New Orleans led by 15 in the third quarter when JJ Redick hit a pull-up jumper while being fouled by Gay and completed the 3-point play to make it 79-64. The Spurs then suddenly seized momentum with a 21-3 run that put them back in front, 85-82, early in the fourth quarter.

Osman scored 14 points off the bench and Larry Nance Jr. had 13 points and five assists. “I still don’t think we’ve put our best four quarters together yet, but that’s our goal,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Playing agenda-less basketball, that’s what the guys have bought into.” Drummond, who has three double-doubles, netted 15 points and 10 rebounds in the first half as Cleveland carried a 64-50 advantage into the break. The Cavaliers forced 22 turnovers, six by Simmons, and turned them into 35 points. “I thought our spacing was bad,” Rivers said. “I want Ben to attack the basket, but I also want him to make plays and have a good balance. We won two games, but we just didn’t play well tonight.” Both teams completed their first back-to-back set of the season. Cleveland beat Detroit 128-119 in double overtime Saturday, while Philadelphia won 109-89 in New York. “It was a good back-to-back win because I am exhausted,” Drummond said, laughing. WAITING GAME Cavaliers G Kevin Porter Jr. (personal reasons) has yet to dress for a game as the front office mulls whether to discipline him for an offseason arrest. The second-year pro was expected to serve as Cleveland’s sixth man. “We’re still having those conversations, still working through the plan, organizationally,” Bickerstaff said.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo tips away the pass and runs the floor for the huge one-handed dunk. (0:18) NEW YORK -- — Tom Thibodeau's first victory as Knicks coach came surprisingly easy against a top opponent, as New York routed the Milwaukee Bucks 130-110 on Sunday night. Julius Randle had 29 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists, Elfrid Payton scored 27 points in his best game as a Knick, and New York led by as much as 28 against the team that had the best record in the NBA the previous two seasons. The Knicks were among the NBA's worst during that time but are hoping for a turnaround under Thibodeau, the former Coach of the Year who engineered comebacks in Chicago and Minnesota. “As long as we’re putting the work into it, we’ll get better,” Thibodeau said. The Knicks opened his tenure by hanging with Indiana and Philadelphia for a half before those teams pulled away in the final two quarters. This time, they used a 16-2 run late in the first half to open a 61-43 lead, then got 12 points apiece from Randle and Payton in the third to make it a 21-point lead heading to the fourth. The Knicks opened the final period with seven straight points for a 103-75 bulge. “We put good halves together against Indiana and last night,” Randle said. “We've just got to put the second half, full game together and that’s what we did tonight.” Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 13 rebounds for the Bucks, who were coming off a 39-point trouncing of Golden State on Christmas and looking to build momentum before playing two straight games in Miami against the team that eliminated them in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Teams are sometimes being scheduled for consecutive road games in one city this season as a way to reduce traveling during the coronavirus pandemic. But after going 20 for 37 on 3-pointers Friday, the Bucks were 7 for 38 (18%) behind the arc against the Knicks. They also allowed the Knicks to shoot 54% from the field and 59% from 3-point range. “They had a great night shooting and we've probably got be a lot better defensively,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Alec Burks scored 18 points and RJ Barrett bounced back from a poor performance against Philadelphia with 17 as the Knicks had plenty of offense even without injured rookies Obi Toppin (calf) and Immanuel Quickley (hip) for the second straight game. Frank Ntilikina had 12 points on 4-for-4 shooting from 3-point range, making New York's point guards 7 for 7 behind the arc. Payton made all three of his attempts as part of a 12-for-16 night overall. “I think we all know we have to be better,” Bucks reserve Bobby Portis said. TIP-INS Bucks: Khris Middleton scored 22 points. ... Jrue Holiday, who had 64% of his shots in his first two games with the Bucks, shot 4 for 10 for eight points. ... Portis, who played for the Knicks last season, had 17 points. Knicks: Thibodeau said G Austin Rivers, who hasn't played this season because of a sore right groin, has made progress and would go through the contact portion of practice for the first time on Monday. ... Thibodeau said he expected Quickley to be able to jump right back in when he was cleared, but thought Toppin would need more time because of the nature of his injury prevents him from doing much while he's out. PAYTON'S POINTS Payton's best game last season, his first in New York, was 20 points. He opened 2020-21 by going 3 for 13 in two games.","401267196"
"Malcolm Brogdon pokes the ball away from Marcus Smart and takes it the other way for an easy slam dunk. (0:21) INDIANAPOLIS -- — With Indiana down one in the final seconds Sunday, coach Nate Bjorkgren asked Domantis Sabontis to bail out the Pacers. The All-Star forward delivered. He put the ball on the floor, drove hard toward the basket, muscled in the go-ahead layup and drew a foul with 8.4 seconds to play. Sure he missed the free throw, but Indiana’s defense forced an errant 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left and held on for a 108-107 victory over Boston. “Coach is a genius. He has a different play for everything,” Sabonis said. “He trusts every single one of us and that makes it easier for the players. We all trust him and just try to execute as best we can.” So far, Sabonis has thrived in Bjorkgren's new system. He followed Saturday's triple-double, with 19 points, 10 rebounds and five assists — his third double-double in three games and No. 100 in his career. And Sabonis had plenty of help, too. Malcolm Brogdon scored a season-high 25 points and T.J. Warren added 17 as the Pacers improved to 3-0 for the first time since 2013-14, sweeping their first back-to-back of the season — barely. “Yes, it was designed that way,” Bjorkgren said after drawing up the play for Sabonis during Indiana's final timeout. “But I thought the other four guys really moved and shifted the defense, too, and that helped open it up for Domas.” The Celtics spent most of the second half playing catch up before finally taking a 107-106 lead when Robert Williams III stole an inbound pass and found Marcus Smart for a breakaway layup with 11.8 seconds to go. After a missed free throw Sabonis, Boston called timeout to set up a play and Jayson Tatum's long 3 was off the mark. Tatum finished with 25 points and Jaylen Brown had 18 as the Celtics lost their second straight. “We definitely beat ourselves tonight and there was still an opportunity to win the game,"" Brown said. “We gave it up at the end. We’ve got to come back and be better, be more physical and more solid on defense.” TIP-INS Celtics: Tatum also had 11 rebounds and five assists. ... Payton Pritchard added 13 points off the bench. ... Smart finished with 11 points and six assists. .... Robert Williams III had 12 points. ... Boston had 18 turnovers and got outrebounded 37-34. Pacers: Brogdon had five rebounds and five assists. ... T.J. Warren had 17 points and Doug McDermott added 16 off the bench. ... McDermott has had three straight double-figure games and went 3 of 7 on 3s. ... Myles Turner had 10 points, seven rebounds and five blocks and now has 17 blocks in three games. ... Indiana had 23 assists on 45 baskets. ... It's only the seventh time in the Pacers NBA history they've started 3-0. OLADIPO OUT The Pacers deactivated two-time All-Star guard Victor Oladipo on the second game of a back-to-back. Officially, the reason given was injury management — a reference to the ruptured quad tendon in his right knee, an injury he suffered in January 2019. Unofficially, this was something Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Prtichard wanted when he was searching for a new coach this fall. Coach Nate Bjorkgren responded by mixing and matching his rotations. HE SAID IT “I think that final play was tough,"" Brown said. “It was not all of his (Williams') fault. When Sabonis gets going with his left hand, he’s tough. He got one tonight on us.""","401267197"
"Stephen Curry dishes to James Wiseman for a powerful slam. (0:18) CHICAGO -- — Although Stephen Curry is one of the best finishers in NBA history, he was more of a decoy late on Sunday night. Damion Lee hit a 3-pointer with 1.7 seconds remaining and Curry scored 36 points, sending Golden State to a 129-128 victory over the Chicago Bulls for the Warriors' first win of the season. With the Chicago defense focused on the sharp-shooting Curry, Lee inbounded the ball to Kevon Looney with 5 seconds left and then ran over to receive a handoff with Curry drawing a crowd on the left wing. Lee fired from a few feet beyond the top of the 3-point arc for the game-winner. Lee was the third option on the play behind Curry and Andrew Wiggins. “It just shows how much the coaching staff and my teammates believe in me,” Lee said. “I'm going to enjoy it. The main thing is we got the win.” Lee finished with 12 points on 4-for-5 shooting on 3s. Curry was 11 for 25 from the field, including 5 of 15 on 3-pointers — a day after making 105 straight 3s to finish practice at the Bulls’ facility. “(Lee) handled it great,” Curry said of the final play. “Him and Loon had a great connection. He was ready to shot. He made a lot of big shots tonight and that was the biggest one to keep us from an 0-3 hole.” Zach LaVine had 33 points and appeared to hit the game-winner for winless Chicago with a 10-foot pullup with 5 seconds to play. LaVine, though, thought he left too much time on the clock. “I think I shot it a little too early,” he said. “I wish I had shot the ball with two or three seconds on the clock. Even if I miss, we still have overtime.” Wendell Carter Jr. had 22 points and 13 rebounds, and Lauri Markkanen added 22 for the Bulls (0-3). Chicago committed 24 turnovers. Markkanen sat out the final few minutes with a calf contusion. With his first 3 late in the first quarter, Curry became the third NBA player to amass 2,500 career made 3-pointers. Ray Allen (2,973) and Reggie Miller (2,560) are the others. Sunday's game was Curry's 702nd in the NBA. Allen played in 1,300 games and Miller 1,389. Late in the third quarter, Curry set a Warriors record for most consecutive made free throws with his 61st dating to last season. He finished 9 for 9 for the game to run his streak to 64. Rick Barry, who shot underhand from the line, held the previous record with 60 straight in 1976. Golden State led 60-56 at halftime, but Chicago started quickly in the third and grabbed an 83-73 advantage with 4 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. The Bulls led 97-93 entering the fourth. With the score tied at 100, the Bulls went on a 10-2 spurt for a 110-102 lead with under eight minutes to play. LaVine scored the final seven points, capping the run with a dunk. The Bulls maintained the multi-possession margin until Curry hit a 3 with 2:02 left to pull Golden State to 123-121. Otto Porter Jr. then made a 3 for the Bulls with 54 seconds to go, but Curry answered with a three-point play. After a miss by LaVine, Looney tied it on a putback with 16.9 seconds remaining, setting the stage for the dramatic finish. TIP-INS Warriors: F Draymond Green (right foot) missed his third straight game, but scrimmaged on Saturday and is close to returning. “Draymond got through the scrimmage really well,” coach Steve Kerr said. “We felt from a conditioning standpoint, it made sense to give him the next two games off and give him another four, five days of conditioning.” Bulls: F Thaddeus Young (lower left leg infection) missed his third consecutive game. CHRISS INJURED Golden State C Marquese Chriss suffered a fibular fracture and ankle injury to his right leg during a scrimmage at practice on Saturday. He is out indefinitely and will undergo surgery later this week. The 23-year-old averaged 6.5 points and 6.5 rebounds in the Warriors' first two games. “He went up for a lob and landed awkwardly,” Kerr said. “We don’t know how long he’ll be out. We’ll know more after surgery.”","401267198"
"Buddy Hield drives to the basket and pulls up for a fadeaway bucket. (0:16) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Mikal Bridges scored 22 points, Cameron Johnson had 21 in 21 minutes and the Phoenix Suns pulled away with two big second-half runs to beat the Sacramento Kings 116-100 on Sunday night. Devin Booker added 20 points, five rebounds and five assists, and Deandre Ayton had 11 points and 15 rebounds for the Suns, a night after a 106-103 loss in the opener of the two-game set in Sacramento. That loss snapped the Suns’ winning streak at nine. Booker talked about the importance of Phoenix getting back on track. “We talked about trusting the system. We have a lot of new players out there trying to figure each other out but always with the right intention,” said Booker, a first-time All-Star a year ago. “We’re getting better. Tonight was a step forward in that on both ends. We just have to continue to grow.” Buddy Hield scored 17 points for Sacramento. First-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton added 15 points and six assists. Tied at 73 with 4:45 left in the third quarter, the Suns closed the period with a 17-5 run. Phoenix extended its lead to 107-88 on Booker’s fast-break layup during an 18-5 run in the fourth. Bridges was 9 of 15 from the field, going 4 of 8 from long range. Johnson was 7 of 9, hitting 3 of 4 3-pointers. He made all four of his free throws “When teams throw junk defenses at me and they’re blitzing a lot, we have guys that can make them pay,” Booker said. “That’s why we have the team that we do. Not surprising to me. We knew from the night before that we had a lot of open looks that we didn’t make and me myself needed to take care of the ball better. We’ll figure it out.” Kings coach Luke Walton said his team made too many mistakes. “It’s a good learning experience,” Walton said. “They’ve got guys over there, Chris Paul leading the group and an All-Star in Booker, they’ve got pride. They lost the first night, we knew it was going to be even tougher tonight. We just had some real mental breakdowns and when we did they were ready to pounce on it.” Paul had eight points and 12 assists. The Phoenix newcomer spent much of the fourth quarter cheering on his teammates while casually perched on a barrier between the bench and the court. Ayton helped the Suns to a 44-39 edge in rebounds. TIP-INS Suns: The last time Phoenix played the same team in the same city on consecutive days during the regular season was Nov. 2-3, 1990, when it opened the season with two games against the Utah Jazz in the Tokyo Dome. Kings: The Kings were attempting to go 3-0 for the first time since 2002-03. … Owner Vivek Ranadive sat near midcourt, socially distanced from five others in the organization who also watched from courtside.","401267199"
"Kyle Kuzma drives baseline and makes a fancy pass to Montrezl Harrell for an easy two-handed flush in the lane. (0:15) LOS ANGELES -- — Kyle Kuzma scored 20 points in the first half while starting in Anthony Davis' place, and LeBron James added 18 points in the Los Angeles Lakers' 127-91 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night. Star big men Davis and Karl-Anthony Towns sat out. Davis has a bruised calf that isn't expected to be a long-term problem, while Minnesota's Towns has a more serious dislocated left wrist. Kuzma had a phenomenal opening half in his first start since agreeing to a three-year, $40 million contract extension with the NBA champions. He hit three consecutive 3-pointers to open the scoring in a wire-to-wire win for Los Angeles, which led by 20 in the first quarter and 36 in the third. Lakers coach Frank Vogel believes Kuzma's overall game evolved last season when he moved into a supporting role with Davis' arrival. “It’s not really about scoring,” Kuzma said. “I just try to impact the game and take shots when I have them, and that’s made me a better player. ... I just try to seize the moment. In a season like this, playing back-to-backs, the coach and the organization being conservative with LeBron and AD allows me to have those nights when I can show what I work on every day.” Marc Gasol had 12 points, eight assists and seven rebounds in just 21 minutes for the Lakers, who spaced the floor and moved the ball superbly with 32 assists. “Marc sees the game very similar to how I see it,” James said. “We’ve got guys that can make the right play, make the right pass. You saw some unbelievable passes tonight from Kuz, from (Alex Caruso). The list goes on and on. Nobody should ever feel pressured to take a bad shot because we can always move the ball.” No. 1 pick Anthony Edwards had 15 points on 6-of-21 shooting in the Timberwolves' first loss of the season. Minnesota missed its first 12 3-point attempts while falling behind by 23 early in the second quarter. “I thought we didn't play our brand of basketball at all,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “There were a lot of things I didn’t like tonight, so we’ll dive into the film. We’ve got a good locker room there. We’ve got guys who want to do the right thing. They feel the same way, I’m sure.” TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jaden McDaniels scored his first NBA points on a pair of 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. ... Josh Okogie went to the locker room in the second quarter. The team said it was cramping. ... Towns was examined Sunday in Los Angeles. He won't require surgery, but will be evaluated weekly. Lakers: James rolled his left ankle in the first half for the second time in a week, but stayed in the game. He is questionable for Monday. ... Caruso strained a hand muscle.

"Trae Young lobs the ball to Clint Capela, who finishes the alley-oop with authority. (0:18) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 29 points, Bogdan Bogdanovic added 17 and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Detroit Pistons 128-120 in their home opener Monday night. John Collins finished with 15 points for the Hawks, who are 3-0 for the first time since 2016-17 and hit 20 3-pointers while shooting 47.6% beyond the arc. Young’s 3 from the right wing put Atlanta up 122-112 with 1:47 remaining before Jerami Grant’s 3 trimmed the lead to five with 1:05 left. Collins hit two free throws and Young sealed it with four free throws in the final minute. “Being 3-0 is great for us and for me it’s all about taking it one game at a time,"" Young said. “We're going up to Brooklyn to play a really good team and we need to bring the same energy and effort. I’m super excited about this team. Just need to get everyone healthy and it’ll be fun."" The Pistons dropped to 0-3. They were without star forward Blake Griffin and reserve guard Derrick Rose, who were given the night off to rest. Coach Dwane Casey started Josh Jackson, who scored 27 points in Griffin’s spot. Grant had 27 points, and Delon Wright chipped in 18 off the bench. “He’s shooting the ball well,"" Casey said of Jackson. “The ball seems to find him in certain situations. I love the way he's been a bright surprise for us. He’s that diamond in the rough you have to find everyone once and a while."" Wright made two free throws to pull the Pistons within five at the 3:15 mark of the third, but the Hawks went on a 29-16 run that culminated with Cam Reddish’s alley-oop dunk, Bogdanovic’s runner and Rajon Rondo’s jumper, making it 115-91 with 7:43 remaining. Detroit made another move, pulling within 115-106 on two free throws by Grant at the 4:16 mark, but Collins answered with an alley-oop dunk and Young hit two foul shots to put Atlanta up 119-108 with 2:43 to go. The Hawks made 16 of their first 25 shots before the Pistons went on a 13-2 run to pull within two in the second quarter, but Atlanta got hot again. Young scored on an acrobatic runner off the glass and converted the three-point play to make it 46-41 at the 7:04 mark of the second. Bogdanovic followed with a 3 from the right wing, De’Andre Hunter hit a 3 from the left wing, Young knocked down three free throws and Bruno Fernando hit a putback to make it 62-49. The Hawks took their first double-digit lead on Solomon Hill’s 3 at the 3:29 mark of the first. “We definitely can score,"" Hill said. “I think our offensive efficiency needs to be cleaned up.

"The Grizzlies' Ja Morant lands on a Nets player's foot after trying to block a shot and leaves the game in a wheelchair. (0:31) NEW YORK -- — Ja Morant could barely stand, needing a wheelchair to take him from the court area after spraining his left ankle. Having already lost their first two games, now the Memphis Grizzlies had lost the NBA Rookie of the Year and their best player. “A moment like that can really test you, but our guys just kept on fighting,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins. And Morant was there to watch them. The Grizzlies earned their first victory of the season, outlasting the short-handed Brooklyn Nets 116-111 in overtime Monday night. Morant was hurt late in the first half when he leaped to block a shot by Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and landed on the Nets forward's foot. Morant immediately hopped off the floor, then laid on the floor in pain before being wheeled to the back of the arena. He rejoined his teammates on the bench in the second half with his foot in a walking boot, offering energy and support to carry them through a tense finish. “He's a team player. He loves his squad,” teammate Dillon Brooks said. Morant watched Brandon Clarke score the go-ahead basket on a follow shot with 41 seconds left in overtime before the Grizzlies put it away with free throws. Morant averaged 36 points in the two losses, scoring a career-high 44 in the season opener, but the Grizzlies found enough offense without him Monday. “Unbelievable display of resiliency by our group,” Jenkins said. Kyle Anderson scored a career-high 28 points and Brooks added 24 for the Grizzlies. Clarke had 16 points and Jonas Valanciunas finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds. “We kind of knew that this was a game that we had to win no matter what,” Clarke said. Caris LeVert had 28 points and 11 assists for the Nets, who rested Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving while losing for the second straight night. Brooklyn is also without Spencer Dinwiddie, who will have surgery to repair a partially torn right ACL sustained Sunday. With both stars returning this season from injury, the Nets decided Sunday night they would rest Durant after he played a season-high 36 minutes in a loss to Charlotte. They listed him on the injury report Monday morning. Irving was added a few hours later. The players forced to take on bigger roles perhaps ran out of gas in overtime, when the Nets managed five points from LeVert but nothing more, shooting 2 for 10. “Early in the season I think guys are still acclimating to back-to-backs, let alone an overtime back-to-back,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. Neither team was ahead by more than seven in the second half, when there were 16 lead changes, so it wasn’t a surprise when they needed five more minutes after LeVert missed a 3-pointer on the last possession of regulation. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis started a three-game road trip. ... Anderson's previous career high came in the last game, when he had 20 points against Atlanta. Nets: Luwawu-Cabarrot scored 21 points, but only two after halftime. ... The Nets opened a six-game homestand, their longest since playing six straight games at Barclays Center during the 2015-16 season. SPENCER'S SURGERY The Nets said Dinwiddie would have surgery scheduled for next week and further updates would be provided afterward. In an Instagram post, Dinwiddie recalled returning from a more severe knee injury in college seven months later. “Next question: Will I miss the road to a (at)brooklynnets 2021 championship? My response: As we’ve seen before. Crazier things have happened,” he wrote. BACK IN BROOKLYN The Grizzlies were the last visiting team to win in Brooklyn — nine months ago. They crushed the Nets 118-79 on March 4, a week before the season was suspended because of the coronavirus.","401267202"
"Donovan Mitchell attacks the basket and banks in a tough shot as the Jazz hang on to defeat the Thunder 110-109. (0:33) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Donovan Mitchell hit a go-ahead layup with 7 seconds left and finished with 20 points, lifting the Utah Jazz over the Oklahoma City Thunder 110-109 on Monday night. Bogan Bogdanovich scored 23 points and Mike Conley added 20 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for the Jazz, who ended a 17-game losing streak in regular season road games against the Thunder, including games in the NBA's Orlando bubble last season. Utah’s last win in Oklahoma City came on Oct. 31, 2010. “We tightened it up down the stretch,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “You have to get stops to win. They played hard. I don’t feel like we played our best, but that’s the challenge, to figure out how to win when you don’t have your best game. We hope we can take this and build on it and keep getting better.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who hit a game-winning shot in the Thunder’s season-opening win in Charlotte, missed a driving layup in heavy traffic at the buzzer. He had 23 points and seven assists, while Luguentz Dort led the Thunder with a career-high 26 points. “We had a shot there at the end, which is all you can ask for,” said the Thunder’s Al Horford, who scored 11 points. “There was a lot of positive. It was just too bad we couldn’t finish the game.” An 8-0 run by Oklahoma City to start the fourth quarter put the Thunder up 95-86, and they led 100-93 after a drive by Darius Bazley with 7:32 left. Utah answered with 11 straight points — the final six by Mitchell — to go ahead 102-100 with 5:10 left. Dort’s 3-pointer with 1:05 left gave Oklahoma City a 109-108 lead. Both teams traded empty possessions before Mitchell’s game-winning basket. Mitchell scored the Jazz’s final 12 points. As the game progressed, “I thought Donovan did a better of job of trying to set up and get help, using screens and pick and roll and kind of take what they give you,” Snyder said. “That’s the idea, to get better as the game goes on.” The Thunder hit their first five shots — including four 3-pointers — to go ahead 17-5 and held that lead for most of the first half, taking a 52-49 advantage into halftime. Mitchell and Bogdanovic were a combined 4 of 19 from the field in the half. After eight lead changes in the third quarter, Oklahoma City led 87-84. Utah was Oklahoma City’s scheduled opponent on March 11, when the Jazz’s Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. The game was postponed moments before tipoff and the NBA season was temporarily shut down.

""This is a growing, learning experience for all of us and we have to get better, on the defensive end especially,"" Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. ""When you have nine guys, and you are kind of doing things on the fly because you don’t have practice time, it can get ugly against a good team and that’s what happened tonight.” Harden put on a show in the second quarter, scoring 21 points and connecting on three 3-pointers, but the Rockets still trailed 70-60 at halftime. Jokic and Murray combined for 36 points in the first half to help spark the Nuggets’ offense, which had struggled during an 0-2 start. Houston pulled to 87-79 on a dunk by Jae’Sean Tate with 5:33 left in the third but the Nuggets closed the period with a 19-4 run and maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the way. Paul Millsap touched off the flurry with a 3-pointer off a feed from Jokic, whose 18 assists represented a career best. “He’s a great player, a great talent,” said Millsap, who finished with 19 points. “You always know when you’re open, he’s going to hit you.” Jokic said he learned to read the floor for passing lanes early on. “I just play like that, trying to find the open guy,” he explained. “My coaches gave me the freedom to do that.” TIP-INS Rockets: On a pregame Zoom call, Silas said he was hopeful most if not all the players either quarantining or self-isolating would be able to emerge from the health protocols and rejoin the team by mid-week. “Wednesday’s practice is an important practice, getting these guys back in and getting the group on the same page,” Silas said. Nuggets: F JaMychal Green, who left the Los Angeles Clippers to join the Nuggets in free agency during the offseason, remains sidelined by a left calf strain. He missed a third straight game but is getting closer to making his Denver debut, resuming practice in a limited fashion.","401267204"
"LeBron James comes up the steal and slams home a one-handed jam against the Trail Blazers. (0:20) LOS ANGELES -- — Damian Lillard scored 21 of his 31 points in the second half, and CJ McCollum had 20 points and 11 assists in the Portland Trail Blazers' 115-107 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night. “Hopefully we can build on it,” Portland coach Terry Stotts said. “We realize that we can be a good team. We just beat the defending champs, and they’re a great team."" Gary Trent Jr. matched his career high with seven 3-pointers while scoring 28 points in the Blazers' second straight win over the Lakers at Staples Center. “It makes us just a little bit more confident to be coming on the road and continuing to grow, continuing to build on our effort,” Lillard said. “We’re just getting more comfortable with each other, and we’re bringing our energy.” LeBron James had 29 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the NBA champions, who finished 2-2 on their season-opening homestand. Dennis Schröder added 24 points, but the Lakers' streak of 59 straight victories when taking a lead into the fourth quarter was snapped. Trent went 10 of 14 from the field while finishing two points off his career high in an impressive response after playing less than six minutes in Portland's win over Houston last Saturday. “I would assume any young player who was coming off the kind of season he had last season would expect to be in the rotation for more than six minutes,” Lillard said. “When that happened, I was like, ‘Let’s see how he responds.’ I think it says a lot about him that he came out and had this type of performance. It speaks to how tough he is mentally and how locked in he is to this season.” Los Angeles kept it close with strong games from James and Schröder, who clearly relishes his matchups with Lillard. But their teammates largely struggled on the second night of a back-to-back. “We were kind of stuck in mud a little bit,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I don’t know (why). We just had trouble sustaining that intensity.” The Lakers made a 15-0 run early in the second half and took a one-point lead into the fourth, but Lillard and McCollum traded big shots down the stretch. Portland finished on a 12-6 surge. TIP-INS Blazers: Carmelo Anthony and Nassir Little missed the game under the NBA's health protocols. ... Zach Collins sat out with a left ankle injury. Lakers: Alex Caruso missed the game under the NBA's health protocols. ... Los Angeles got just 23 bench points, led by Montrezl Harrell's nine. AD QUIET Anthony Davis had 13 points and 10 rebounds in a tentative return from a one-game absence due to a bruised calf. He managed just two points in 17 minutes in the first half, and went 1 for 4 in the second half. “We just weren’t moving the ball that well,” Vogel said. “I’ve got to make sure I get (Davis) the ball in opportunities where he can be aggressive.”","401267205"
"Julius Randle posts a triple-double of 28 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in the Knicks second straight win. (2:13) CLEVELAND -- — Julius Randle had 28 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists for his first triple-double in two years, leading the New York Knicks to a 95-86 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night. Randle, who scored 18 in the first half as New York built a 16-point lead, completed his seventh career triple-double with an assist on Elfrid Payton’s 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. It was the power forward’s first triple-double since Nov. 19, 2018, with New Orleans. “I just tried to take what the defense gave me while playing the game the right way,” Randle said. “We’ve got great spacing and when the defense collapses, I know I can make the right play. When you get wide-open shots, it makes it easier for everybody.” Reggie Bullock scored 17 points and Payton had 14 points, eight boards and seven assists for the Knicks (2-2), who won their second in a row and earned their first road victory of the season. New York made 14 of 25 3-pointers, increasing its NBA-best percentage to .459, with Randle making all four of his tries. The Knicks never allowed Cleveland to get closer than seven points in the fourth. “Julius came into camp in great shape, which is the biggest thing,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “He’s playing really well and he now knows his teammates’ strengths, which makes everyone better.” Andre Drummond notched his fourth double-double for the Cavaliers (3-1) with 18 points, 17 rebounds and a season-high six blocked shots. Cleveland started the season 3-0 for the first time since winning six in a row to begin 2016-17. The Cavaliers, who finished with the second-worst record in the NBA at 19-46 last season, missed their first 10 3-pointers and finished 7 of 32. Collin Sexton scored 20 points and Darius Garland had 17, but the starting guards were 12 of 35 from the field. “There were moments when guys tried to take it on themselves, individually,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “I felt like we were desperate and tried to make the home run play, instead of just playing good defense.” Randle had 18 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the first half, powering New York to a 53-46 advantage. Bullock made four of the Knicks’ 10 3-pointers, including a 31-footer at the buzzer in the second quarter. New York built a 29-15 lead in the first when Randle made all five of his shots in racking up 14 points, six boards and five assists. “I think we’ve got the right people in place from top to bottom in this organization now,” Randle said. “They challenged me going into the offseason and I challenged myself, as well, to come back a better player.” Larry Nance Jr. added nine points for the Cavaliers, who will be without Kevin Love (right calf strain) for at least three weeks. The five-time All-Star aggravated the lingering injury Sunday against Philadelphia. WHERE IS THE LOVE Love, who sat out the opener with the same calf strain, will not be re-evaluated until late January. He has missed 116 regular-season games since helping the Cavaliers win the 2016 NBA championship. “Predicting injuries is hard to do, but I feel bad for Kevin,” Bickerstaff said. “He’s been working his tail off, trying to get right for this season.” TIP-INS Knicks: G Alec Burks (left ankle sprain) did not play after being injured Sunday against Milwaukee. Thibodeau said Burks is day-to-day … G Dennis Smith Jr. (left quadriceps) could rejoin the team during its ongoing four-game trip. … Rookie F Obi Toppin (right calf) and G Immanuel Quickley (left hip) were inactive, along with G Austin Rivers (groin) and F Omari Spellman (right knee).

"Kelly Oubre Jr. dials in a 3-pointer for the first time this season and the Warriors' bench is beside itself. (0:26) DETROIT -- — Stephen Curry scored 31 points and Andrew Wiggins added 27 to lift the Golden State Warriors to a 116-106 victory over the winless Detroit Pistons on Tuesday night. The injury-plagued Warriors have won two in a row after dropping their first two games by a combined 65 points. The decisive stretch Tuesday came with Curry on the bench. Rookie big man James Wiseman had a dunk and Wiggins followed with a 3-pointer to cap a 12-0 run that put Golden State up 98-89 in the fourth quarter. “Just a great feeling to turn what was a mess of a road trip into a really good one,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Jerami Grant led the Pistons with 27 points. The Warriors are without stars Klay Thompson (right Achilles tendon) and Draymond Green (right foot), but now Detroit has injury problems of its own. Blake Griffin ended up in the concussion protocol and did not play in the second half, and rookie guard Killian Hayes left with a sprained right ankle. The Pistons led 89-86 in the fourth before a 3-pointer by Wiggins tied it. Wiseman's dunk came after the 7-footer blocked a shot at the other end and dribbled most of the length of the court. That put the Warriors up by six and sent several Golden State players spilling from the bench area in excitement. Curry tossed a towel in the air after Wiggins' 3 moments later. The Pistons, who led by as many as 12 points in the first half, were up 51-48 after two quarters. Golden State went on a 17-3 run early in the third, but Detroit stayed close well into the fourth. Wiggins scored 17 points in the final quarter, and three of his five 3-pointers came in the fourth. “He was phenomenal,"" Kerr said. ""He just took over the game, knocking down 3s, getting to the rim, getting to the foul line. Andrew was fantastic, just that whole fourth quarter.” Wiggins has shot better the past two games after going 10 of 34 from the field to open the season against Brooklyn and Milwaukee. “Just keep shooting, it’s going to fall,"" he said. ""You’ve just got to believe in yourself.” TIP-INS Warriors: Announced after the game they exercised the third-year contract option for next season on G Jordan Poole. ... Golden State improved to 9-22 in regular-season games without both Green and Thompson in the lineup since 2012-13. Pistons: Griffin did not play in Monday night's loss at Atlanta because of left knee issues. He finished with eight points Tuesday. Derrick Rose, who did not play either on Monday, had 15 points against the Warriors. TOUGH START The Pistons have lost all four of their games, although none by more than 10 points. “We’re playing excellent basketball through stretches, but now that next step is to continue to close the deal,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""Some good things, but again, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.”","401267207"
"Malcolm Brogdon throws a slick bounce pass to a cutting Victor Oladipo, who elevates to the rim to flush a reverse dunk for the Pacers. (0:17) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens suspected history was repeating itself for the second time in three nights in his hometown. His team was “knocked all over the place” by the physical Indiana Pacers in a one-sided third quarter. But much to the satisfaction of Stevens, who played high school basketball in the Indianapolis suburb of Zionsville and coached Butler University to back-to-back NCAA championship games, his Celtics regrouped in a hurry to erase a 17-point deficit for a 116-111 road win on Tuesday. “We’re not where we want to be,” Stevens said, “but sometimes you’ve got to find a way to win. We’ve got a long way to go to get to as good as we need to be.” What changed? More defensive aggression, for starters. And Jayson Tatum stepped up with 14 of his 27 points in the final quarter, when the Celtics had a 33-18 advantage. “We knew we had to pick up the intensity,” Tatum said. “And we knew we had to get some defensive stops. We got on a roll and kept on going.” Tatum atoned for missing a 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds remaining that could have provided the Celtics with a win over the Pacers two nights ago on the same floor. In that game, the Pacers also had a huge third quarter before the Celtics rallied to take the lead. However, the Pacers won 108-107 on Domantas Sabonis’ layup with 8.4 seconds remaining. “We felt like we let the last game get away,” Jaylen Brown said. “We didn't want this one to get away, too.” Victor Oladipo, who sat out the previous game after scoring 22 points in each of his other starts, had 20 of his 24 through three quarters for the Pacers. T.J. Warren scored 15 of his 17 points in the third quarter. “Every game isn't going to be perfect,” Oladipo said. “We're still trying to figure things out. But the ceiling for this team is very scary. We can be a very good team.” The Celtics had four scorers with nine or more points for a 58-57 halftime lead. TIP-INS Celtics: Reserve guard Jeff Teague sank a 3-pointer in the second quarter to snap a streak of 15 consecutive missed shots dating back to the season opener. The Indianapolis native played one season for his hometown Pacers in 2016-17. Pacers: The last time this team started 4-0 was in 2013-14, when Indiana opened 9-0. ... Sabonis was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for Week 1 after he averaged 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and seven assists in three victories. THEY SAID IT “He won’t be back any time soon, certainly, you know we’re hopeful to get him back as soon as possible, but we want to make sure when we do it’s for good,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of the timetable for Kemba Walker to make his season debut as he recovers from a knee injury that required a stem cell injection in October.","401267208"
"Seth Curry knocks down a 3-pointer in crunch time as the 76ers hang on to defeat the Raptors 100-93. (0:18) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid had all of Philadelphia holding its breath when he grabbed the back of his right leg and needed a trip to the locker room. Coach Doc Rivers did not check on the 76ers big man because usually the health update is “bad news.” The bad news did, indeed, come — for Toronto once Embiid returned to the game. Embiid shook off the injury scare to score 29 points, grab 16 rebounds and lead Philadelphia past the winless Toronto Raptors 100-93 on Tuesday night. “He was terrific, dominant,” Rivers said. Embiid, who missed Sunday’s loss against Cleveland with back stiffness, walked gingerly to the locker room early in the third quarter with the leg injury. Team president Daryl Morey and general manager Elton Brand hopped up from their courtside seats and immediately hit the locker room to check on their All-Star center. Rivers, in his first season as coach, remained outwardly calm as he waited out Embiid. Embiid checked back into the game several minutes later with the Sixers down 11. He sank 14 of 16 free throws — as many makes as Toronto shot (12 of 14) to keep the Sixers in this one. Embiid dismissed the injury and smiled as he said “everything's fine” without elaboration. “I just did my job,” Embiid said. Tobias Harris had 26 points and 11 rebounds to help Embiid on a night the Sixers shot only 38% from the floor. Kyle Lowry scored 24 points for the Raptors. Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby each had 20. “We’ve got to stretch out our good moments,” coach Nick Nurse said. “We’ve played some great moments in all the games.” Lowry, the Philly native and former Villanova standout, had said the Raptors “gotta figure this out” after an 0-2 start, and a 14-point lead in the second half should have been enough to solve their early woes. Instead, they lost the lead in one of the weirdest ways possible. Aron Baynes appeared to hit a pump-fake 3 with the shot clock about to expire for a 90-87 lead. Embiid missed a free throw when officials stopped the game and ruled the shot clock had, in fact, expired and Baynes’ points were wiped off the board. Embiid made a second free throw and the Sixers suddenly led by one. Seth Curry swished a 3 from the top of the arc that pushed the 76ers’ lead to 96-91 and helped them move to 3-1. “We didn’t play well for long stretches of the game but we stuck it out,” Curry said. Ben Simmons, who had 11 points and 13 rebounds, joked before the restart last season that he hoped boos would get piped into the bubble if the Sixers played poorly to truly reflect the Philly atmosphere. Simmons and the Sixers would have been booed off the court had fans been allowed to watch a disaster of the first half. Simmons and Embiid were awful from the floor, a combined 2 of 11 start that let Toronto grab an 11-point lead. Embiid had made all nine free throws to at least keep Philly competitive. The Sixers are loaded with one-dimensional players who struggle to get their own bucket. In year three, Simmons continues to infuriate the faithful with his massive talent overshadowed by his desire to shoot beyond 15 feet. Simmons has been floated in trade rumors — Morey has said Simmons is off the table — but another dominant shooter would surely help the 76ers. “We can't do it without our teammates,” Embiid said. “Everybody that plays, we all come in with the same purpose, we all have the same goal.” TIP-INS Raptors: Nurse said the hardest part of adjusting to life in Tampa, Florida, is finding “where the snacks are” inside the arena. But so far, so good for the Toronto-turned-Tampa Raptors. “There’s a lot of bright side,” Nurse said. “Everybody loves the weather. That seems to put a smile on everyone’s faces around the organization.” ... C Chris Boucher scored 22 points, had 10 rebounds and seven blocked shots Saturday against San Antonio. He played 5 minutes against the Sixers. 76ers: Shake Milton missed five of his six 3-point attempts. ... Curry finished with 17 points. ... The bench had just 10 points.","401267209"
"Zach LaVine gets bumped then knocks down a nice fadeaway jumper. (0:25) WASHINGTON -- — Zach LaVine scored 23 points, including nine straight in the third quarter, and Coby White added 18 to lead the Chicago Bulls to their first victory of the season, 115-107 over the winless Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. Chicago improved to 1-4 while Washington fell to 0-4, its worst start since beginning the 2012-13 season with 12 straight losses. Russell Westbrook, who sat out Sunday’s game, had his third straight triple-double with 21 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists for Washington. Bradley Beal scored 29 points and Davis Bertans added 20 for the Wizards, who shot just 10 for 37 (27%) from 3-point range. They missed 10 of 11 in the second quarter, when Chicago took the lead. “The only way we can get out of this as a team is if we stick together,” Bertans said. “Being negative about the four losses isn’t going to help us come back and win games."" Chicago players presented a game ball to coach Billy Donovan, who earned his first victory with the Bulls. He coached Oklahoma City for the previous five seasons. “I thought it was important that we showed those two guys a crowd,” Donovan said about Beal and Westbrook. “Especially Russell in transition, if he sees creases and seams he takes advantage of it.” The Bulls had seven players in double figures. Otto Porter scored 16 points, Garrett Temple and Patrick Williams had 12 apiece, and Tomas Satoransky and Wendell Carter each added 10. FAMILIAR FACES Donovan coached Beal at Florida and Westbrook with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Donovan said Beal was a pre-med major during his one year in college, and wavered before deciding to leave school after a single season. “He obviously made the right decision,” Donovan said. In his four years coaching Westbrook, Donovan said he was never disappointed. “When you have your best player when you walk in there as a coach, and you’re never worried about whether this guy is going to show up and compete, it’s an incredible luxury,” Donovan explained. Washington coach Scott Brooks preceded Donovan as coach of the Thunder, and said Westbrook is teaching important lessons with the Wizards. “We haven’t won a game,” Brooks said. “But he’s teaching these young players how important our job is and that’s priceless."" TIP-INS Bulls: F Thaddeus Young, who missed the first three games of the season with an infection of his lower left leg, said after Tuesday’s shootaround he was ready to play. But he sat out again. ... The Bulls avoided their first 0-4 start since 2007-08. … F Lauri Makkenen reinjured his left calf and played just 19 minutes. “I wanted to be available and be there for my teammates, but it’s frustrating,” he said.

"Brook Lopez heads to the line for a 4-point play after getting fouled on the triple. (0:18) MIAMI -- — On Sunday, the Milwaukee Bucks endured their worst 3-point effort in just over a year. On Tuesday, they set the NBA record for 3's in a game. Go figure. The Bucks made a record 29 3-pointers in their 144-97 romp past the reigning Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat on Tuesday night. They shot 29 for 51 from deep, two nights after going 7 for 38 in a loss to New York. “Some nights, the basketball gods are with you a little bit,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “It's probably one of those nights.” Milwaukee used 13 players and 12 made at least one 3-pointer — the only exception being two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. Khris Middleton had four 3's and scored 25 points, Jrue Holiday made six 3's in his 24-point night and Donte DiVincenzo was 5-for-6 from deep to finish with 17 points. Antetokounmpo had only nine points. But his brother, Thanasis Antetokounmpo — who was 0 for 11 from 3-point range in his career entering the night — got into the act and made one from deep. “I knew we were shooting well,” said Bucks center Brook Lopez, who made three 3's. “I didn't know we were anything close to that.” The record-breaker was made by Sam Merrill, who got the 28th 3-pointer with 6:07 remaining, giving the Bucks a 131-86 lead. The previous record for 3’s in a game was 27, set by the Houston Rockets against the Phoenix Suns on April 7, 2019. Milwaukee’s previous most was 22, against Sacramento on Nov. 4, 2018. The most previously allowed in a game by Miami was 24, on Feb. 5 against the Los Angeles Clippers. Milwaukee was up 10-0 after 78 seconds, 21-3 after about four minutes, and the tone was set in the first meeting between the teams since last season's playoffs, when the Heat eliminated the Bucks in five games. “It looked like they have been thinking about this game for 80 days,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Milwaukee led 46-26 after one quarter, 83-51 at the half. Tyler Herro scored 23 points for the Heat. Miami’s Jimmy Butler missed the game with a sprained right ankle; it's unknown if he'll play Wednesday when the Heat and Bucks meet again. “Tomorrow, we're going to have to come out with a lot more energy or we're going to get embarrassed again,” Herro said. It was the biggest road win in Bucks history, topping the 39-point margin at New York on April 10, 1987. The 47-point margin matched the second-worst loss in Heat history; they lost 138-91 to Pat Riley and the Los Angeles Lakers in the eighth game of Miami’s first season. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee had 16 3’s by halftime, the most of any half in team history. ... The Bucks’ last three games have all been decided long before the final buzzer, with them beating Golden State by 39 on Christmas, then losing by 20 in New York on Sunday and leading by as many as 51 on Tuesday. Heat: The worst Heat loss was 148-80 against Cleveland in 1991. ... Tuesday's 32-point halftime deficit was second worst in team history, topped by a 33-point hole on March 8, 1989 when Riley and the Lakers led 76-43 at the break. ... Herro had 20 points by halftime, the first time he’s done that in his career. WELCOME BACK The Heat had about 100 fans at the game, all family and friends of players and employees. “I think it is a boost for the family, just to be able to have some normalcy and have a real opportunity to support their loved ones,” said Spoelstra, whose wife Nikki attended. STREAK ENDS Giannis Antetokounmpo’s streak of 108 consecutive regular-season games — and 132 overall — with at least 10 points ended. It was the first time since Feb. 13, 2017 that he played, scored less than 10 points and the Bucks won anyway.","401267211"

Orlando, 4-0 for the first time in the franchise’s 31-season history, is one of only two remaining unbeaten teams in the NBA, along with Atlanta. The Magic started 3-0 only three previous times before this season. “We’re happy where we are, to start the season 4-0, but we also at the same time are aware that there are so many things we can do better, especially on the defensive end,” Vucevic said. “The positive is knowing that we were able to win, so now we can work on those things and get better and take a step forward.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 23 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for Oklahoma City, which lost its second home game in two nights after winning its opener at Charlotte. The Thunder had won their last five games (and 15 of their last 18) against the Magic and now are 10-3 at home all-time against Orlando. Dwayne Bacon went 9 of 10 from the field and scored 18 points to go with eight rebounds for Orlando, which surpassed the 110-point mark for the fourth straight game. After the Thunder tied the score at 87-87 early in the fourth, Bacon scored six points in a 10-4 spurt that gave Orlando the lead for good. Oklahoma City made only 4 of 13 free throws in the fourth, thwarting the Thunder’s hopes to rally. Isaiah Roby, who hadn’t scored a point in a NBA game before Tuesday, had 19 points and seven rebounds for Oklahoma City, while Luguentz Dort added 15 and Mike Muscala had 14. “I thought we scrapped pretty hard tonight,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “I thought our competitiveness and engagement, in the first three quarters especially, was pretty good. There were a couple of times where the game could have gotten away from us and we made a play or made a stop. Obviously, (we) just didn’t get enough in the fourth, or throughout the game.” Orlando led 36-27 early in the second quarter before a 12-2 run — fueled by nine points from Hamidou Diallo — put the Thunder back ahead 39-38. The Magic again pushed its lead out, this time to 53-43, but Oklahoma City pulled within 60-56 by halftime. The Thunder briefly pulled even at 80-80 on a 3-pointer by Gilgeous-Alexander but Orlando led 87-85 entering the fourth quarter.

He now has 4,083 with the Magic, passing Nick Anderson (4,075) in that statistical category … Aaron Gordon started but coach Steve Clifford said Gordon remains on a minutes restriction as the player recovers from a hamstring injury he suffered last season. He scored 12 points in 22 minutes. Thunder: Center Al Horford didn’t play, resting on the second day of a back-to-back, while veteran guard George Hill missed the game with neck spasms … Roby and Justin Jackson both started for the first time this season for Oklahoma City. It was Roby’s first career start and he scored nine first-quarter points … The shooting woes continued for first-round draft pick Aleksej Pokusevski, who went 1 of 8 from the field, although he did score his first career points in the third quarter of his third NBA game. QUOTABLE: Clifford, on Vucevic setting the franchise’s record for field goals: “He’s such a professional and such a committed, conscientious player. … He gives me a lot of credit for him playing well since I got here. There’s no guy here that I’ve done less to help than him. The way he works, the amount of time he puts in, two years ago he was an All-Star and last year he was our best player. He is in a great place right now and he’s ready to have a terrific, terrific year.”","401267212"
"Devin Booker comes up with the steal and Chris Paul finishes on the other end for an easy 2. (0:21) PHOENIX -- — Chris Paul played OK. Devin Booker had one of his least productive games in recent memory. The Suns' best two players didn't really do much in an intriguing matchup between two of the league's rising teams. And Phoenix still won by 25 points. Jae Crowder scored a season-high 21 points, Cameron Johnson added 18 and the Suns showed off their newfound depth by rolling to a 111-86 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night. “It’s a team game, it’s not 1 v 1,"" Suns forward Mikal Bridges said. ""It’s five guys. We’re getting better every day.” The Suns broke the game open by outscoring the Pelicans 35-15 in the second quarter to take a 66-44 advantage into the break. Second-year coach Monty Williams said his team's stellar defense sparked the avalanche of points that buried New Orleans by halftime. “They missed shots tonight once we started playing with force on the defensive end,” Williams said. Phoenix turned its high-energy defense into a high-scoring offense. Even when the Suns weren't getting good looks the shots were falling. Crowder — in his first year with the Suns after helping the Heat to the NBA Finals last season — rattled home his fifth 3-pointer as the shot clock expired midway through the third quarter to push the Suns ahead 79-47. A frustrated coach Stan Van Gundy quickly called timeout for the Pelicans but the damage was already done. “The middle two quarters, I don’t even know what to tell you,” Van Gundy said. “There was nothing. Nothing good, it wasn’t one thing. We couldn’t contain them on the dribble, we couldn’t handle the ball, their pressure really got us, the pace got us. They had a much higher energy level.” Six Suns scored in double figures as they improved their record to 3-1. Deandre Ayton had 13 points and 12 rebounds, Bridges and Cameron Payne also added 13 points and Dario Saric scored 10. “If you can win a game like that and only play Booker and Chris no more than 25 minutes, it gives the other guys confidence,” Williams said. “But we know who are two best players are. There’s no mistaking that.” New Orleans fell to 2-2 this season. Zion Williamson led the Pelicans with 20 points and 9 of 13 shooting from the field. Brandon Ingram had 13 points and Steven Adams added 11. New Orleans shot just 3 of 24 from 3-point range. Phoenix made 19 3s. Johnson was credited with two points after Williamson was called for goal-tending at the third quarter buzzer, which put the Suns ahead 100-61. Both teams played mostly reserves in the fourth quarter. Phoenix earned its big halftime lead despite the backcourt of Paul and Booker combining for just seven points. Paul finished with nine points and nine assists while Booker had eight points. Crowder made all three of his 3-point attempts in the first half and led the Suns with 15 points. Bridges and Ayton both had 11. The Pelicans shot nearly 53 percent from the field in the first half but were just 1 of 11 on 3s. The Suns made nine 3s before the break. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson shot 6 of 7 from the field in the first half and had 14 points. Suns: Forward Dario Saric played in his first game this season. He missed the first three with right quad soreness. ... Rookie forward Jalen Smith missed the game because of a sprained left ankle. ... The Suns debuted their new uniforms that show ‘The Valley’ on the front and feature a bright desert sunset over a skyline on a black jersey. “I’m not going to lie, I wish we could wear these jerseys the whole season,” Ayton said.","401267213"
"Jarrett Culver spins to the basket for a layup, but Ivica Zubac meets him at the top and completely shuts down the shot attempt with a rejection. (0:16) LOS ANGELES -- — Lou Williams led seven Clippers in double figures with 20 points and Los Angeles routed the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-101 on Tuesday night in a game missing stars for both teams. The Clippers bounced back from a 51-point shellacking against Dallas two days earlier despite playing without Kawhi Leonard for the second straight game because of a mouth laceration. Minnesota big man Karl-Anthony Towns sat out with a dislocated left wrist. “It feels good to get a win after that atrocious loss,” said Reggie Jackson, who finished with 11 points. “We knew that wasn’t necessarily who we are.” Paul George added 18 points, Serge Ibaka had 16 points and eight rebounds, and Luke Kennard scored 15 for the Clippers. D'Angelo Russell led the Timberwolves with 22 points. Malik Beasley added 19 and Ricky Rubio had 17. Jarrett Culver equaled his career high with 10 rebounds. “We started the game the right way, but when things aren’t going our way, everybody plays selfish,"" Rubio said. ""We've got to learn.” The Timberwolves were coming off a 36-point loss to the Lakers on Sunday. “We didn’t learn nothing from the game against the Lakers,” Rubio said. “We came with the same mindset of just, go out there and hoop. That can’t continue. We are way worse than 2-2 right now.” The Clippers led by 20 at halftime and 31 in the third quarter on Williams' three-point play. That's when they made six 3-pointers, including four in a row, with George hitting two of his three in that stretch. Williams' points came off the bench to go with 12 by Ivica Zubac, helping the Clippers' backups outscore Minnesota's reserves 56-32. “Zubac was making their team kind of pay for being a smaller team,” Jackson said. “He made it easy on us.” The Wolves were quicker out of the gate, opening a nine-point lead to start the game. The teams were tied once in the second quarter, just before the Clippers' 31-11 run, including 12 in a row, that extended their lead to 70-50 at the break. “They couldn’t stop us after that,” Zubac said. “Guys were just more aggressive. Our coaching staff made a point that in the game against Dallas we had the least paint drives. Our focus was to put the ball on the floor and get into the paint.” All 12 Clippers players scored in the game. They shot 56% from the field and had a season-high 32 assists, equaling their total against Denver on Christmas. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Also missing the game were G Jaylen Nowell (left ankle) and G Josh Okogie (left hamstring strain). Clippers: Los Angeles coach Tyronn Lue said he isn't sure when Leonard will get the eight stitches out of his mouth that were needed after he accidentally got elbowed by Ibaka going for a rebound last Friday at Denver. ... The team is using prerecorded video performances of the national anthem and reruns of rap performances from previous seasons at halftime. CROATIA EARTHQUAKE Zubac grew up just east of the Croatian border and is a citizen of the country where a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck southwest of the capital of Zagreb on Tuesday. Buildings were destroyed and at least seven people were killed. “I feel like I represent the whole country, coming from a small place. People are very proud from Croatia,"" Zubac said. “It’s tough times over there. That city that was hit (Petrinja) the most was ran over during the war and the place was still in bad condition, a lot of old buildings and houses.” Zubac said he spoke to people he knows in Croatia and they weren't seriously affected by the quake.","401267214"
"Nikola Jokic scores 26 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds to notch his 44th triple-double, a Denver franchise record. (1:22) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Tyrese Haliburton scored eight of his 13 points in the fourth quarter as the Sacramento Kings pulled away to beat Denver 125-115 on Tuesday, spoiling a record-setting night for Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic. The 12th pick in this year’s draft, Haliburton made several sleek plays and gave the Kings a needed lift down the stretch. Sacramento’s rookie guard hit two of his three 3-pointers in the final 9½ minutes and added a steal and fast-break layup during an 11-0 run that put the Kings ahead 120-108. “Tyrese continues to impress,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “He hit some big shots. He had some big-time playmaking for us. He was a plus-20 on the night. He’s one of those players, you feel confident when the ball’s in his hand.” Haliburton played the entire fourth quarter, when he also had five of his six assists. “I was just proud of our team being a young team playing against a team like that with experience,” Haliburton said. “We could easily have folded after a bad third quarter like that. We got a little complacent. We thought we were really going to open it up in the second half.” De’Aaron Fox had 24 points and 10 assists for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes scored 20 and Buddy Hield added 12 points and seven rebounds. Jokic had 26 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds to set a Nuggets record with his 44th career triple-double. The NBA leader in assists going into the game, Jokic broke the previous mark he shared with Fat Lever while logging 38 minutes. As good as Jokic was offensively, he also was charged with 10 of Denver’s 20 turnovers. Essentially, the Denver 7-footer had a quadruple-double. “Twenty turnovers on the road for 37 points,” Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. “Nikola had 10. Unacceptable. He can’t have 10 turnovers in a game.” Jokic thought the Nuggets' offense got too stagnant. “We kind of made ourselves easy to guard,” he said. “Collectively we need to move our bodies better, then move the ball. We helped them a lot, just standing and not moving around.” Monte Morris had a career-high 24 points starting in place of Jamal Murray for Denver. Michael Porter Jr. finished with 30 points and 10 rebounds. Murray was held out of the game one day after the Nuggets guard bruised his head when he collided with Jae’Sean Tate of the Rockets in the third quarter. Murray held his hand to his head for a couple of minutes but got up and walked under his own power to the locker room for further examination. He was back on the bench midway through the fourth but did not re-enter. The Kings beat the Nuggets in Denver on Buddy Hield’s buzzer-beating tip-in in overtime in the season opener for both teams last Wednesday. QUOTABLE “I would say good teams don’t beat themselves, but that would be giving (us) a compliment we don’t deserve.” — Malone on the Nuggets. TIP-INS Nuggets: Porter had three 3s in the third quarter. … The game marked the 1,000th of Paul Millsap’s 14-year career. Millsap previously played for Utah and Atlanta. … Malone was whistled for a technical in the first quarter moments after Jokic’s dunk put Denver up 18-16. Kings: Hield has made at least one 3-pointer in 70 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NBA. … Harrison Barnes dished out a career-high eight assists. … The Kings were charged with a technical after Fox yelled at officials from the bench in the third quarter.","401267215"
"Jaylen Brown scores a career-high 42 points in just 29 minutes of work as the Celtics down the Grizzlies 126-107. (1:55) BOSTON -- — Jaylen Brown had a career-high 42 points before sitting out the fourth quarter on Wednesday night, when the Boston Celtics coasted to their 10th straight victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, 126-107. “He’s just really improved. Worked hard to improve,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of the fourth-year forward, who has also been one of the leaders of the team's social justice efforts. ""Got a lot on his plate. He wants to have a lot on his plate, and that’s good.” Jayson Tatum scored 16 points and Marcus Smart had 14 before they, too, sat out the fourth quarter of the blowout. Robert Williams III had 10 rebounds for Boston, which hasn't lost to Memphis since 2016. Brown matched his career best of 34 points with three minutes left in the third. His seven 3-pointers made (on 10 attempts) tied a career high. “Since I’ve been here I’ve seen Jaylen grow every year,” forward Daniel Theis said. “He got a hot hand, hit five or six shots in a row, so we kept looking for him.” Hours after announcing they will be without leading scorer and reigning Rookie of the Year Ja Morant for three to five weeks because of a sprained ankle, the Grizzlies lost guard Grayson Allen in the first half to an ankle sprain. Jonas Valanciunas had 20 points and 11 rebounds for Memphis, and Gorgui Dieng scored 17 points. ""When we’re down players, especially when we’re down Ja, everybody has to bring their A-game or it’s not going to be good for us,"" Dieng said. “Hopefully we can hold it down until those guys get back.” Memphis opened a 4-0 lead before giving up the next 12 points of the game. The Celtics led 31-19 after one quarter and had a 17-0 run in the second — two 3-pointers from Tatum and three 3s and a putback layup from Brown — to open a 57-30 lead.

He started the game and scored 16 points in 23 minutes. ... Brown was 10 for 15 in the first half, including 7 of 10 from 3-point range. ...

"Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant find their momentum in the second half, combing for 58 points as the Nets top the Hawks 145-141. (1:52) NEW YORK -- — In a game that was almost all about offense, Kyrie Irving just couldn't get into the act. Then in the fourth quarter, he shot the Hawks down from the unbeaten list. Irving shook off three rough quarters to score 17 of his 25 points in the fourth, Kevin Durant had 33 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and the Brooklyn Nets handed Atlanta its first loss with a 145-141 victory on Wednesday night. The opener of a two-game series was the third game in Nets franchise history where both teams had 100 points through three quarters. But Irving was just 3 for 16 from the field and getting badly outplayed by point guard counterpart Trae Young. Then he made three 3-pointers in the final period after missing all seven through three as the Nets rallied to win after dropping two straight following their 2-0 start. Irving and Durant combined for Brooklyn's final 20 points over the final 5 1/2 minutes of a game that left everyone spent. “Yeah, I definitely need a beer,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. Young had 30 points, 11 assists and six rebounds, and John Collins had 30 points and 10 rebounds. But it wasn't enough for the Hawks, who had won their first three for the first time since 2016. The Hawks were down one after Collins made two free throws with 45 seconds left, but Irving knocked down a jumper, then found Durant for a dunk that made it 141-136 with 15 seconds to go. “This is what finishing is about, execution on both sides of the basketball,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Bogdan Bogdanovic made six 3-pointers and scored 22 points and Cam Reddish had 20 for the Hawks, who led for most of the first three quarters but never by too much because the Nets — except Irving — were just as hot. Atlanta, which came into the game second in the league with 124.7 points per game, had 68 by halftime, when Irving was 1 for 10, but only led by one. “The good thing about that is even though we didn’t shoot the ball well, us two, we were still only down one point,” Durant said of he and Irving. Brooklyn put seven players in double figures, with Joe Harris adding 23 points. TIP-INS Hawks: Danilo Gallinari, who missed the last two games with a bruised left foot, came off the bench in this one but played only five minutes before leaving with a sprained right ankle. ... Pierce wasn't sure how the Hawks planned to spend New Year's Eve in New York. “We’re definitely not going anywhere. But depending on what’s allowed, we’ll have a team dinner, maybe some champagne or something in the hotel, but it won’t be anything extensive,” he said. “We’re in New York, it’s a business trip, middle of a pandemic, I think we’ll be smart and do what we continually need to do.” Nets: Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot started in place of the injured Spencer Dinwiddie and had three points. He made his first start Monday against Memphis and scored 21 points. ... Nash said F/C Nicolas Claxton, sidelined by a right knee injury, is improving, but he thought still weeks away from being ready to return. TEAMMATES TOGETHER Nash hosted Pierce on his college visit to Santa Clara, where they played together for two years and become close friends. Pierce said some of their teammates had a group text going in advance of the game and noted the slim odds of two guys from a mid-major college coaching in the NBA against each other. Nash said he was proud of all Pierce's accomplishments, praising his work on voting and civil rights initiatives in Georgia. “He’s inspired me and to get a chance to coach against him is really special,” Nash said.","401267217"

Terry Rozier, who scored 18 points, hit a pair of 3-pointers early in a 14-0 run to start the second half, giving the Hornets a 25-point lead coming off their first win — over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets — after an 0-2 start. Charlotte silenced Luka Doncic and the Mavericks, who are still without European sidekick Kristaps Porzingis as the 7-foot-3 Latvian recovers from knee surgery. Still, Dallas was coming off its first victory after dropping the first two games as well, a 51-point blowout at the Los Angeles Clippers that included an NBA-record halftime lead of 50 points (77-27). “For us it’s just about building and growing,” Charlotte coach James Borrego said. “We didn’t have the best training camp. There’s a lot of factors there, but I believe now we have found our footing.” The Hornets were up 68-57 at the break and outscored Dallas 30-12 in the third quarter. Doncic was limited to 12 points for the game and sat the fourth with the game out of reach while Tim Hardaway Jr. led Dallas with 18 points. “Their game plan was to come out as aggressively and as physically as they could and try to take any rhythm out of our game,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “They succeeded on some levels. It’s clear Luka doesn’t have his rhythm yet.” Charlotte went 5 of 10 from 3-point range in the third while the Mavericks missed their first nine after the break from long range, including three in one possession, and finished the quarter 1 of 15 from beyond the arc. Dallas was 11 of 41 for the game. Ball, the third overall pick in the draft, finished 7 of 10 from the field, including 4 of 5 from deep and made all four free throws to easily beat the high from his first three games of 13 points. The 19-year-old had eight rebounds and five assists. “He's growing up right before our eyes,” Bridges said. “As long as he's playing his game and having fun, we just want to focus on the defensive end.” Devonte Graham's 3 gave the Hornets their first 25-point lead, and Jalen McDaniels made it 90-60 midway through the third with an alley-oop layup.

"Becky Hammon addresses what it means to become the first woman to act as head coach in the NBA, taking over when Gregg Popovich was ejected, and how the players respond to her. (0:56) SAN ANTONIO -- — Becky Hammon would have preferred a victory over history after becoming the first woman to coach an NBA team. The assistant coach took over the San Antonio Spurs in the second quarter after coach Gregg Popovich was ejected in a 121-107 loss to LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night. “I try not to think of the huge picture and huge aspect of it because it can be overwhelming,” Hammon said. “I really have had no time to reflect. I have not had time to look at my phone. So, I don’t know what’s going on outside the AT&amp;T Center.” Hammon and the Spurs already had a lot to contend with against the defending league champion Lakers. James celebrated his 36th birthday with 26 points, eight assists and five rebounds in the Lakers’ third double-digit victory. The teams will complete the two-game set Friday night. “(I was) trying to get the guys in the right spots,” Hammon said. “Trying to get them motivated. Obviously, it’s a learning situation for all of us, but I would have loved to have walked out there with a win with the guys.” Popovich was ejected by official Tony Brown with 3:56 remaining in the second quarter. Popovich screamed at Brown and entered the court following a non-call on DeMar DeRozan’s attempted layup and a subsequent attempted rebound by Drew Eubanks. As he exited the court to applause from several of the team’s family members in attendance, Popovich pointed a finger at Hammon and had a succinct message. “You got ‘em,” Hammon said. “See? He doesn’t treat us any differently than he does you guys.” Said LeBron James: “Obviously she’s been paying her dues over the last few years and Coach Pop has given her the opportunity. ... It’s a beautiful thing just to hear her barking out calls, barking out sets. She’s very passionate about the game. Congrats to her and congrats for our league.” Hammon took over the team’s huddles during timeouts and walked the sideline following Popovich’s ejection. Hammon was the first full-time female assistant coach in league history. “Well deserved,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I’ve talked to her before and she really knows her stuff and obviously she’s here for a reason. She’s equipped, intelligent (and the) guys have great respect for her. She’s going to be a great coach one day.” A three-time All-American at Colorado State, Hammon played for the New York Liberty and San Antonio Stars in the WNBA as well as overseas before retiring to join Popovich’s staff in 2014. “Even in timeouts with Pop as head coach, she is quick on her feet,” DeRozan said. “She tells us about defensive assignments, offensive sets we should run. Seeing her in the forefront, it would have definitely been cool to have won for her.” The Lakers contributed to Popovich’s frustration and the Spurs’ fortunes didn’t get much better after the veteran coach exited. Dennis Schroder had 21 points, Anthony Davis had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Lakers. Wesley Matthews was 6 for 6 on 3-pointers in scoring 18 points off the bench. The Spurs opened with a 9-2 run, including an uncontested drive through the lane by Keldon Johnson for a two-handed slam. The Lakers responded with an 11-0 run that promoted a timeout by Popovich. The Lakers took their first double-digit lead at 35-25 on Kyle Kuzma’s 3-pointer with 1:14 remaining in the first quarter. Dejounte Murray had a career-high 29 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. “At the end of the day, it don’t mean nothing, we lost,” Murray said. DeRozan added 23 for the Spurs, who lost their second straight after opening the season with two consecutive wins.

It was the Clippers’ second straight blowout win to close out the year. They beat Minnesota by 23 points a night earlier after bouncing back from an ugly 51-point defeat against Dallas last weekend. Leonard wore a clear plastic mask held in place by two white straps around his head to protect his mouth, where he had eight stitches after getting elbowed by teammate Serge Ibaka a week ago. He started slowly, scoring 12 points in the first half, when the Clippers shot 58% from the floor. Leonard and George came out firing to start the second half.

"Thon Maker gets around 2 defenders and goes up and under for the layup. (0:18) INDIANAPOLIS -- — All-Star center Domantas Sabonis is piling up some big numbers. Reserve forward Doug McDermott is getting on the act, too. Sabonis led the Pacers with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and McDermott provided a spark with 18 points and nine rebounds off the bench in a 119-99 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday. It's the fourth time in five games that McDermott has scored in double digits. He hit three 3-pointers as the Pacers were 16 of 35 from long range. Because opponents are wary of his 3-point shooting and have adjusted defending him accordingly, that's provided more opportunities to drive to the rim. “Coming into the year, I wanted to be as aggressive as possible,” McDermott said. “I'm going to keep doing my thing and hopefully we can keep this thing rolling.” All-Star guard Victor Oladipo hit four 3-pointers. “Even though 2020 has been tough, find your triumph,” Oladipo said. “At the end of the day, we're all blessed to see 2021.” Sabonis, the 6-foot-11 center who usually does most of his work inside, made both of his 3-point tries and shot 10 of 14 overall. The NBA's first Eastern Conference Player of the Week also had 11 rebounds. Two days after blowing a 17-point, third-quarter lead in a home loss to Boston, the Pacers pulled away again after halftime to take a 20-point advantage into the fourth quarter. Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren pointed to defense. “They came out of the locker room ready to defend,” Bjorkgren said about the 31-17 third quarter. Indiana, playing seven of its first nine at home, improved to 4-1. Shooting guard Collin Sexton led the Cavaliers with 28 points, and point guard Darius Garland added 21. Cleveland was 12 of 23 on 3-pointers in the first of six straight road games. The Cavs are 3-2. Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff had an extended postgame meeting to express his displeasure in how tentative his team played at times. “Things are easy when they're good,” Bickerstaff said. “Things become more difficult when it's hard. That was the message to our guys. We have to do things decisively. You just can't be hesitant.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: Sexton has scored at least 20 points in 10 consecutive games, dating to last season. Pacers: T.J. Warren missed the game with a sore foot and the Pacers announced he will have surgery to repair a small left navicular stress fracture. The team said he will be out indefinitely and updates will be provided as warranted. “They’re figuring it out,” Bjorkgren said. “T.J. wants to play so bad. He wants to be out there. That’s the kind of guy he is. That’s why I love him. ... They’re going to keep monitoring it.” ...

"Rui Hachimura overthrows his pass and it ends up stolen by Chicago as the Bulls edge the Wizards 133-130. (0:18) WASHINGTON -- — Otto Porter scored 28 points, Zach LaVine added 22 and the Chicago Bulls, playing without four players who were in the NBA health and safety protocol, beat the winless Washington Wizards 133-130 on Thursday. The Bulls played without Lauri Markkanen, their second-leading scorer and top rebounder, as well as forward Chandler Hutchison and guards Ryan Arcidiacano and Tomas Satoransky. Russell Westbrook had his fourth straight triple-double in his four games with Washington, finishing with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Thomas Bryant and Bradley Beal each had 28 points for Washington (0-5). “There’s a lot of season left,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. “That first win is always going to be tough.” The Bulls, who lost their first three games and beat the Wizards twice in three days, took the lead on Coby White’s two free throws with 1:01 to play. Chicago had taken an 11-point lead in the third quarter, but couldn’t hold it. “Our defense wasn’t very good. We fouled way too much,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “Their speed and their pace is way better than ours, and we have got to change that for ourselves right now.” Chicago had seven players in double figures for the second straight game. White and Wendell Carter had 16, Daniel Gafford and Thaddeus Young added 15 and Patrick Williams had 10. “I hate that we lost the guys that we lost today,” Gafford said. “It’s a big opportunity because we had to step up, and we had to show that we were ready to play, especially in a game like this because they have two elite guards in Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. “We had to come out. We had to lock in.” Beal is upset with Washington’s start. “We don’t do moral victories,” he said. “I have to do better on the floor. I have to close the game out.” TIP-INS Bulls: Donovan said the missing players won’t be back for Friday’s game at Milwaukee. “My guess is yes, it’s going to go on here for a period of time,” he said before the game. “How long, I’m really unsure of that. I think daily testing helps bring some clarity where guys are at. I don’t know how long it will be, but I think it will be some time.” Wizards: Westbrook will sit out Friday’s game at Minnesota, the second half of a back-to-back. He also missed Sunday’s game, also the second half of a back-to-back…. F Rui Hachimura was activated after missing the season’s first four games with an eye injury. He started and played 25 minutes, scoring 17 points. “It’s been tough,” Hachimura said of being idle. “They didn’t beat us. We beat ourselves. We still have (67) games left.” NO HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE The Wizards haven’t won despite playing four of their five games at home. Brooks said that he doesn’t think there’s much of an advantage to playing at home in the fanless environment. “You get to stay home,” Brooks said. “You get to use your practice facility. At the arena, it’s all the same. What makes it challenging, you always have a boost with your home fans.” TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES Five technical fouls were assessed. Four were called against the Wizards’ Beal, Bryant, Westbrook and Davis Bertans. Gafford picked up Chicago's.","401267223"
"Ben Simmons drills a corner 3-pointer and his 76ers teammates show their excitement. (0:18) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Joel Embiid had 21 points and nine rebounds in three quarters and the Philadelphia 76ers handed the Orlando Magic their first loss with a 116-92 victory Thursday night. Off to a 4-0 start for the first time in franchise history, the Magic never had much of a shot at a fifth win because of the surprising outside shooting of the 76ers, who even got a 3-pointer from Ben Simmons. Philadelphia, which entered the game 27th in the NBA in 3-point accuracy, made eight of its first 12 attempts from beyond the arc and built a first-half lead as large as 37 points. Seth Curry added 21 points and five 3-pointers, and Tobias Harris chipped in 20 points, nine rebounds and three 3-pointers for Philadelphia (4-1), which had 38 first-quarter points and 75 by halftime. ""Tonight, we did a good job of moving that ball around and mixing it up with 3-point shots off the double teams and driving the basketball,’’ said Curry, who made seven of 12 shots and five of seven 3-point shots. The Sixers made a season-high 15 3-pointers. Simmons, who sank just the third 3-pointer of his career in the first quarter, finished with nine points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. ""We know we have a lot of potential and ways to grow, but to be 4-1 already is good,’’ Curry said. The Magic (4-1) were the NBA’s last undefeated team. Nikola Vucevic finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Magic, while rookie guard Cole Anthony scored 16 points off the bench. ""We’re not putting enough into guarding the ball and helping. We’re not,’’ Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Things that we’ve been very good at for two years we’re not doing, and that’s the hard things.’’ Orlando was without reserve guard Terrence Ross — its leading scorer at 21 points per game — because of a right hamstring irritation. The Magic also lost starting guard Evan Fournier eight minutes into the game because of back spasms. He had three points and two assists and watched the lopsided second half from the bench. Already up 38-22 after one quarter, the Sixers made 14 of 22 shots and four of seven 3-pointers in the second period to build their lead to as large as 72-35 late in the opening half. Harris and Curry each hit three 3-pointers in the early going, while Matisse Thybulle sank two shots from beyond the arc in the first half. TIP-INS 76ers: Dwight Howard, who starred in Orlando from 2004-12, was booed when he first checked into the game and fans derisively cheered when he picked up his first foul nine seconds later. Howard drilled Philadelphia’s 14th 3-pointer of the game — and the 10th of his 17-year NBA career — in the fourth quarter. Howard had seven points and five rebounds in 14 minutes. … Thursday’s game was Philadelphia’s second of the season with fans in attendance. Sixers coach Doc Rivers said he was ""surprised’’ at the number of ""mask-less’’ citizens walking around downtown Orlando a day earlier. Asked if he felt safe, Rivers said, ""I do in the arena. You go from state to state, but you still have the same NBA protocols and that’s really important.’’ Magic: James Ennis III, who the Magic acquired last February in a trade with Philadelphia, went through drills on Thursday and Clifford said the forward is close to returning.","401267224"
"James Harden throws an alley-oop pass that Christian Wood and Danuel House throw down together. (0:25) HOUSTON -- — John Wall had 22 points and nine assists in his first game since 2018, James Harden had a big finish to score 33 points and the Houston Rockets beat the Sacramento Kings 122-119 on Thursday night. Late in the fourth, Wall found Harden in transition for a deep 3-pointer that gave Houston a one-point lead. The two celebrated with a high-five at midcourt. “It was cool,” said Wall, who cited the 735 days since his last game in postgame interviews. “It was great to get our first win. My job is to help James as much as possible and to try and make it easier for him.” Sacramento cut Houston’s lead to 118-117 with 22.4 seconds remaining on Tyrese Haliburton’s 3-pointer, but Harden answered with two free throws. Sacramento missed two close 3s in the final seconds. Harden also had eight assists and six rebounds in the first of a two-game set with the Kings. They will meet again Saturday in Houston. “We’ve just got to keep building now,” Harden said. “It’s very difficult to beat the same team two times in a row so we know how important it is to be locked in and stay focused.” The Rockets were playing their first game with Wall, DeMarcus Cousins and Eric Gordon, who missed the first two games due to COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Houston’s scheduled opener on Dec. 23 against Oklahoma City after COVID-19 quarantine protocols depleted the roster below the eight players required by the NBA to play a game. “We were kind of in and out of the game throughout the game,” said Rockets coach Stephen Silas, given the game ball by Wall after his first career win as head coach. “We had our highs and our lows but were keeping our composure and fighting back and dealing with adversity -- all of those things, we did tonight.” Wall, acquired from Washington for Russell Westbrook, scored his first points since Dec. 26, 2018, on a thunderous left-handed dunk in transition. Wall looked explosive on several drives to the basket and dunks in his first game back from a ruptured Achilles tendon. Cousins came off the bench and quickly drained a 3-pointer for his first basket since June 13, 2019. In 14 minutes, Cousins had eight points and three assists in his Rockets debut. Christian Wood had 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Gordon added 17 points. Harrison Barnes led the Kings with 24 points, De’Aaron Fox and Richaun Holmes each had 22, and Buddy Hield added 19. DOUBLE STUFFED Early in the third quarter, Harden threw an alley-oop in transition that appeared to be dunked through the basket simultaneously by both Wood and Danuel House Jr. The points were attributed to Wood. “He thought the points should’ve went to him,” Wood said. “If they could give them to both of us, I would’ve been happy with that, too.” TIP-INS Kings: SG DaQuan Jeffries suffered a Grade 3 left ankle sprain during 4-on-4 play Tuesday and will miss at least six weeks, the Kings said Wednesday. . PF Jabari Parker (back stiffness) remained sidelined and has yet to make his season debut. Rockets: Houston was hosting its first regular-season home game since March 10, before COVID-19 derailed last season. There were masked fans in attendance, but far below 25% capacity and only about a dozen fans sitting courtside. ...

"Brandon Ingram is ejected in the third quarter for a flagrant 2 foul while attempting a block on Isaiah Roby. (0:51) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Brandon Ingram had 20 points and seven rebounds before being ejected in the third quarter and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 113-80 on Thursday night. Eric Bledsoe added 17 points and Lonzo Ball had 16 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for New Orleans, which lost all four of its games last season to the Thunder. But in their first meeting this season, the Pelicans built an 11-point halftime lead and never were seriously threatened after that. “Early in the year, we’re trying to get better,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We’ve been struggling offensively so it was good to see the ball go in the basket. It was good to score some points. I thought our defense was pretty good overall. It was just a good night and we need to keep moving forward. The games come fast and furious here.” Oklahoma City, which lost its third straight game — all at home — after winning its season opener at Charlotte, had won 10 of its 12 previous games on New Year’s Eve. Al Horford led the Thunder with 17 points and six rebounds. The Pelicans led 77-67 with 3 minutes left in the third quarter when Bledsoe’s arm caught Isaiah Roby across the face as Roby looked for a layup on a fast break. Officials ruled it a flagrant foul and ejected Ingram, but Roby missed both free throws and Oklahoma City came no closer than seven points the rest of the quarter. The Pelicans extended their lead to 85-73 entering the fourth quarter and continued pulling away, eventually leading by as many as 33 points while matching their season high in scoring. Steven Adams, in his first game against the Thunder after being traded during the offseason, had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Josh Hart added 12 points and 11 rebounds. TIP-INS: Pelicans: New Orleans posted a 58-40 rebounding advantage … Ingram entered the game averaging 10.3 points this season during the third quarter and had eight against the Thunder before his ejection … JJ Redick and Oklahoma City’s Hamidou Diallo each were slapped with a technical foul in the third quarter after jawing at each other. Thunder: George Hill returned to the starting lineup after missing Tuesday’s loss to Orlando due to neck spasms … The Thunder matched their season high with 15 3-pointers (in 48 attempts). QUOTEABLE: Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, on his team’s high volume of 3-point attempts: “(The Pelicans) are really aggressive with their on-ball defense and on help defense, and that leaves the perimeter open. I keep telling the team we’ve got to take what the defense gives us. If you have open 3s, you’ve got to take them. You’d like to have a bit more balance, and I thought there were times we tried to do too much with the ball, but overall we took good shots.” ADAMS RETURNS Adams spent seven seasons in Oklahoma City, where the New Zealand native became a fan favorite. The Thunder posted a tribute video to Adams on social media before the game and during pregame introductions, they turned up the fake crowd noise in the arena to simulate extra applause for Adams.","401267227"
"Donovan Mitchell sets up Rudy Gobert for a Jazz alley-oop vs. the Suns. (0:18) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Phoenix Suns are becoming a dangerous team on both ends of the court. The Suns beat Utah 106-95 on Thursday night for their first 4-1 start since 2009, turning up the pressure on both offense and defense. Phoenix held Utah to 41.7% shooting from the field and forced 13 turnovers. Offensively, the Suns shot a sizzling 51.5% from 3-point range and made 17 3-pointers overall. Phoenix never trailed over the final three quarters. “We played balanced the whole game,” guard Devin Booker said. Booker had 25 points and seven assists. Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder added 16 points apiece for the Suns. Phoenix had six players score in double figures. Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 14 rebounds, and Mike Conley chipped in 16 points. The Jazz are 0-2 at home to start the 2020-21 season. “Teams have been coming out being aggressive and it’s taking us too long to react,” Gobert said. “We have all the weapons to counteract that, but tonight it took us too long to adjust again.” Cold shooting from the Jazz allowed the Suns to surge ahead in the second quarter. Utah missed 13 shots in the quarter and shot just 39.5% from the field overall before halftime. Phoenix used a 7-0 run capped by Chris Paul’s fadeaway jumper to seize a 30-24 lead. The Suns extended their lead to 48-33 late in the second quarter behind a flurry of baskets from Cameron Payne. “We executed, especially in the first half, defensively how we wanted to guard,” Booker said. Utah whittled a 13-point deficit down to three points early in the third quarter. Conley sparked a 16-6 run with back-to-back pullup 3-pointers. Gobert punctuated it with a running dunk that cut the Suns’ lead to 59-56. Bridges kept the Jazz at arm’s length with his outside shooting. He hit back-to-back 3-pointers to end Utah’s run and sank another two minutes later to boost Phoenix’s lead to 70-62. Phoenix scored on three straight possessions to end the quarter and kick-start a 16-2 run. Johnson made three baskets during the run, culminating in a jumper that put the Suns up 91-70 early in the fourth quarter. “That’s where we hang our hat is on the defensive end,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “We feel like we’re trending in the right direction.” Utah cut a 21-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 98-93 on Conley’s 3-pointer with 2:07 left. Mitchell and Conley combined to score on five straight possessions to get the Jazz back into the game, but Utah could draw no closer. “The biggest thing is just playing through it,” Mitchell said. “Teams are going to be aggressive. We played hard but we didn’t play smart.” TIP INS Suns: Deandre Ayton finished with a team-high nine rebounds. … Paul led the Suns with eight assists. ... Phoenix scored 34 bench points over the final three quarters after the second unit went scoreless in the first quarter. Jazz: Jordan Clarkson got whistled for a technical foul in the second quarter after dribbling into a referee and shoving him following a turnover. … Bojan Bogdanovic went 0-of-5 from the field. … Utah scored 18 points off 15 turnovers. LOSING STEAM Utah has trailed over the final three quarters in both of its home losses. The Jazz have rallied from double-digit deficits in the fourth quarter on each occasion, only to fall short in the closing minutes. It’s quickly becoming a frustrating trend for Utah, which is allowing teams to take it out of its offense early. “If we are not playing to our strengths, it is going to be difficult for us,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. BRIDGES BUILDING Potent outside shooting is quickly becoming a trademark for Bridges. The third-year forward made four 3-pointers. It is the third time in five games he has made at least four 3-pointers. Bridges is averaging 15.6 points while shooting 50% from 3-point range. “He’s a guy where we value everything he does,” Williams said. “His intentions are great. It’s good to see his work paying off.”","401267228"
"Bismack Biyombo attempts an unsuccessful 3-pointer that leaves Hornets broadcaster Eric Collins in complete shock. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Dillon Brooks scored 21 points and the undermanned Memphis Grizzlies beat the Charlotte Hornets 108-93 on Friday night. Memphis, which had seven players ruled out for various health reasons and dressed just nine, closed out a three-game road trip 2-1. “Being down a few guys, it’s the next-man-up mentality,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. Kyle Anderson finished with 18 points and a career-best 11 rebounds, and Brandon Clarke 15 scored for Memphis. “Either way, I’m going to play hard off the bench or if I start,” Clarke said. “I’m able to do either one of them, and it’s fun.” Jonas Valanciunas had 14 points and 10 rebounds, Gogul Dieng scored 14, and Desmond Bane 10 for the Grizzlies. Tyus Jones led all players with 12 assists. “I think they’re overall aggressive and they were the aggressive team,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “In (a win on Wednesday at) Dallas, we were the aggressive team. Tonight, Memphis was the more aggressive team. Give them credit.” Bane was 2 of 7 from long distance and extended his streak of games with multiple 3-pointers to five, second-most in NBA history. Bismack Biyombo led Charlotte with 16 points and 12 rebounds, and LaMelo Ball had 15 points and a team-best six assists. The Hornets got 14 points each from Gordon Hayward and Caleb Martin. P.J. Washington finished with 10 points. “A lot of it is on the offensive end,” Borrego said of the Hornets’ struggle to score Friday. “We can’t find a rhythm offensively. We can’t get good looks or we’re turning it over. So, it’s something that we’ve got to address. There are some areas that we’ve got to refocus on and there’s not a lot of practice time here. So, we’re just going to have to do it through game reps and we’ve got another shot tomorrow night (in Philadelphia).” Charlotte was slowed by 9-of-31 shooting from 3-point range, shot just 40.7% from the floor and trailed by as many as 24 points. “That’s how you create your juice and your energy, night in and night out,” Jenkins said of the defensive effort against Charlotte, which was held to eight points in transition. “To hold a team that can score at a high level under 30 points in all four quarters. … I thought was huge.” MELO MAKING CASE FOR STARTING ROLE After a pair of impressive games, LaMelo Ball looks as if he could be a nice addition to the starting lineup for Charlotte. Coach James Borrego said he’s continuing to evaluate the team’s lineup. “I’m looking at everything right now in evaluation,” Borrego said. “We’re only five games in now. … I’ve got to continue to look and look at it hard.” Before his 15-point, six assist performance against Memphis, Ball registered 22 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in a win against Dallas. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Forward Grayson Allen, who played at Duke, missed the game with a left ankle sprain. He was one of seven Memphis players listed as out for the game. … The Grizzlies have not started the same lineup in any of their five games. … Valanciunas has posted a double-double in all five games this season. Hornets: Biyombo reached 4,000 career rebounds with seven in the first half. … Charlotte will play consecutive games in Philadelphia on Saturday and Monday to start a four-game road trip that includes stops in Atlanta and New Orleans.","401267229"

Rookie Saddiq Bey added 17 points and seven rebounds for the Pistons, who had lost four straight to start the season. Blake Griffin (concussion protocol) did not play, but Mason Plumlee filled in with 17 rebounds and eight points. “I've been a fan of Saddiq's since he was at Villanova, so I knew we had an asset when we drafted him,” Rose said. “Teams are giving him open looks and he's a shooter. When I'm on the floor with him, I'm always watching to see when I can get him the ball.” Jayson Tatum had 28 points for the Celtics. Jaylen Brown scored 25, but missed a tying 3-pointer in the final seconds. Boston didn't score in the final 4:15, missing its final 10 shots. “I thought we had a lot of open looks down the stretch, but we couldn't get anything to go down,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “But that's also a very long, hard-working, well-coached team. They aren't going to be easy to score on.” The Pistons led by as many as 21 points in the first half and had a 55-40 advantage going into the third quarter, but the Celtics' defense got them back into the game. Boston had nine points off turnovers in the quarter to cut the deficit to 79-73. “I don't know what happened at the start of the game,” Stevens said. “We just weren't running.” Bey, though, scored 12 points in the quarter to keep the Pistons ahead. “We don't know what we've got from Saddiq, because he's not a finished product, but he had another big game for us,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Brown scored the first seven points of the fourth to give Boston its first lead, and Tatum's 3-pointer made it 93-88 with 4:15 to play. The Celtics missed their next seven shots and Rose's layup put the Pistons ahead 94-93 with 1:20 left. “I was so proud of our guys because they finished that game with so much defensive energy,” Casey said. “You aren't going to shut down guys like Tatum and Brown every night, but we can make it hard for them every time.” Bey's free throw made it 95-93 with 25.5 seconds left, and Marcus Smart missed a tying shot with 5.6 seconds remaining. Plumlee missed the first of two free throws, giving the Celtics a last chance to tie the game, but Brown missed from the right wing.

ROOKIE'S IMPACT Pistons rookie Isaiah Stewart had three offensive rebounds in 18 minutes against Boston, giving him 12 in his first three games. “It's amazing what he has been able to do without playing big minutes,” Plumlee said. “He's always working to get to the glass, which is huge for us.”","401267230"
"Luka Doncic hits a crossover to get into the lane before using a Hakeem Olajuwon style ""Dream Shake"" move to make an easy lay-in. (0:30) DALLAS -- — Luka Doncic had season highs of 27 points and 14 rebounds for his first double-double of the season to lead the Dallas Mavericks past the Miami Heat 93-83 on Friday night. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 18 points as the Mavericks rebounded from a 118-99 loss at home to Charlotte on Wednesday during which they trailed by 30 points in the second half. Bam Adebayo scored 19 points and Avery Bradley 15 for Miami. The Mavericks scored the final nine points of the second quarter to lead 46-31 at halftime. They padded their lead with a 10-2 run to open the third quarter and led by as many as 24 before a late Heat surge. When Doncic hit a step-back 3-pointer late in the first half, it ended a personal 12-shot drought from long range. He finished 3 for 9 behind the arc and added seven assists. The 21-year-old two-time All-Star with 29 career triple-doubles recently acknowledged he's out of shape early this season. “Luka’s going to get there,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “He’s busting his tail. He’s working hard. You saw him working out after the game (Wednesday). Everything for him now is trending in a good direction conditioning-wise.” Heat All-Star Jimmy Butler scored two points, both on free throws, and shot 0 for 6 from the floor over 27 minutes in his first appearance since playing only the first half on Christmas against New Orleans because of a sprained right ankle. Miami missed all 12 of its 3-point attempts in the first half and finished 7 for 33 behind the arc. TIP-INS Heat: Miami has used different starting lineups in all five games this season. … G Gabe Vincent, who played 15 minutes in his season debut Wednesday, was inactive with a right knee injury.

WE'RE NOT IN FLORIDA ANYMORE The Heat played their previous 35 games in the Sunshine State — 29 playoff games in the Orlando bubble, preseason games at home and in Tampa, four games this season at home and in Orlando – since playing at Washington on March 8. Because of pandemic protocols, coach Erik Spoelstra reported no highlights in coming to Dallas. “You get on a plane, you land, you take a bus, go to your hotel, order room service and that’s it,” Spoelstra said. “It’s a little bit different than our NBA experience in a typical year. That’s just the deal, and we’re grateful that we have an opportunity to continue to play.” SECOND EFFORT NEEDS WORK The Heat and Mavericks went into the game bringing up the rear in the NBA in second-chance points, averaging 7.8 and 7.5 respectively. And they couldn’t match those figures Friday. Dallas converted four offensive rebounds into seven points, Miami five offensive boards into four points.","401267231"

As does Brooklyn, which left first year coach Steve Nash lamenting both its offensive and defensive performance. “Our defense can be a lot better,” Nash said. “We have to get better offensively.” Even though Kevin Durant scored 28 points and Kyrie Irving had 18 points and 11 rebounds, the Nets have lost three of four. The Nets came back to beat the Hawks on Wednesday night in a 145-141 thriller. The Hawks ensured Brooklyn would not rally this time. Atlanta led 61-52 at halftime and extended the advantage to 89-73 at the end of the third quarter. The Hawks pushed the lead to 100-80 early in the fourth quarter. “Our attention to detail,” defensively pleased Collins. Atlanta held Brooklyn to 40.7% shooting from the field (35 for 86) and 18.9% (7 for 37) from 3-point range. “This really helps our growth to see the mistakes we made (in the last game) and play the same team, which is going to do similar things, and really learn from it,"" he said. ""I feel that was it. We locked into the small things.” That helped facilitate their offensive attack. The Hawks finished with 46.2% shooting from the field (43 for 93) and knocked down 41% of their 3s (16 for 39). “We were scrambling,” said Joe Harris, who scored 12 points for the Nets. “We know what we have to clean up.” Added Jeff Green: “We got away from our principles. ... We allowed the offense to dictate the defense.” TIP-INS Nets: Nash is concerned with his team's rebounding early in the season. The Nets are seventh in the league with 37.2 rebounds per game, but rank 13th in offensive rebounding at 10 per game. Reserve Jarrett Allen is Brooklyn's top rebounder, entering Friday with an average of 12 per game. “Gang rebounding has got to be habitual for us,” Nash said. “We’re going to struggle there until we’re really good at gang rebounding in my opinion.” Hawks: Pierce was pleased with his team's offensive efficiency despite Wednesday night's loss. “I think 92 of 99 shots last game were either in the paint or 3(s), so that’s tremendous. If we can continue to keep our turnovers low and if we can continue to play ball movement and body movement, I think we’ll stay with high-efficient shots,” Pierce said.","401267232"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo gets a rebound and takes it all the way down the floor, makes a move and powers home a thunderous slam. (0:24) MILWAUKEE -- — The Milwaukee Bucks believe their offseason roster overhaul made them a better 3-point shooting team. Their recent efficiency from beyond the arc bears that out. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 29 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists and the Milwaukee Bucks used torrid shooting to blast the Chicago Bulls 126-96 on Friday. Milwaukee shot 22 of 45 on 3-point attempts. This came three nights after the Bucks made an NBA-record 29 3-pointers on 51 attempts in a 144-97 rout of the Miami Heat. “The guys that we have, they're ready,” Antetokounmpo said. “They're ready to shoot the ball right now. I told them to stay ready because that ball is coming.” Antetokounmpo was two assists from a second straight triple-double. The reigning two-time MVP had 26 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists Wednesday in a 119-108 loss at Miami. He only went 1 of 5 from 3-point range Friday but set up many of his teammates for open shots. “We feel like we’ve added a little more shooting depth, more guys who can make shots,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “I just feel like Giannis is really doing a great job of kind of being a facilitator, a point guard, finding shooters and finding opportunities.” Three of the players the Bucks added were Jrue Holiday, Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis. That trio went a combined 9 of 14 from 3-point range Friday. Forbes had 18 points in 22 minutes and was the Bucks' second-leading scorer. “It took some time to get acclimated,” the former San Antonio Spurs guard said. “New system. New players. New coach. I think it took a lot just to kind of find my groove and where I fit in on this team. They've got confidence in me, and playing with guys like Giannis and Khris (Middleton), it makes my job easy.” The Bucks shot just 7 of 38 on 3-point attempts in a 130-110 loss at New York  on Sunday, but they’ve gone 67 of 137 in three games since. Their latest 3-point outburst helped the Bucks beat the Bulls for an 11th straight time. “We really felt like we needed to try to jam the lane up a little bit, try to keep the ball out of the paint, certainly try to take away (Antetokounmpo’s) driving angles to the rim,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “Tall order to do. We gave up a lot of 3’s because of that.” Zach LaVine scored 16 points and Denzel Valentine had 14 for the Bulls. Wendell Carter Jr. and Coby White each added 12. Middleton had 14 for the Bucks. Bobby Portis provided 13 points and 12 rebounds. Donte DiVincenzo, Pat Connaughton and Holiday added 11 points each. TIP-INS Bulls: Valentine went to the locker room midway through the fourth quarter after the right elbow of Bucks forward Thanasis Antetokounmpo hit the left side of Valentine's face as they were battling for a rebound. ... This trip to Milwaukee concluded a three-game road swing for the Bucks, who had won back-to-back games at Washington on Tuesday and Thursday. They briefly come home to face Dallas on Sunday before playing four straight road games. Bucks: The Bucks played a third straight game without reserve forward Torrey Craig, who underwent surgery Thursday after fracturing his nose Sunday in a loss to the New York Knicks. Budenholzer said he doesn’t expect Craig to be available during this five-game home stand. “I don’t know that we’ve really set a timeline,” Budenholzer said. “I think we’re just kind of seeing how he comes out of the procedure that he’s had. But my guess is it’s longer than that."" SHORT-HANDED BULLS Chicago played its second straight game without forwards Lauri Markkanen and Chandler Hutchison as well as guards Ryan Arcidiacono and Tomas Satoransky as part of the NBA’s health and safety protocols related to COVID-19. Markkanen is the Bulls’ second-leading scorer (17.3) and top rebounder (6.8). Donovan said before the game that Hutchison had tested positive and was still in Washington, where the Bulls played their last two games. Markkanen, Arcidiacono and Satoransky were back in Chicago. KEY STAT Since the start of the 2018-19 season, the Bucks have gone 28-3 against Central Division opponents. They were 13-1 against the Central last season.","401267233"
"Bradley Beal gets to the short corner and sinks a jump shot for the Wizards vs. the Timberwolves. (0:23) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Bradley Beal had 31 points and seven assists, and the Washington Wizards beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 130-109 on Friday night without Russell Westbrook for their first win of the season. Westbrook sat out for rest on the second game of a back-to-back, but the Wizards (1-5) looked like a much better team than the one that lost the night before to Chicago at home. Washington jumped to an early lead and answered every Minnesota challenge. “The energy's totally different; it's just positive,” Beal said of earning the team's first victory. “It's uplifting. It's like a weight off your shoulders in a way, but it's even better to know we played the right way and played the way we know we're capable of playing.” With Beal leading the way, the Wizards finished the third quarter on a 29-7 surge and scored 40 points in the period for a 100-79 lead. Beal had 14 in the quarter. Malik Beasley scored 21 to lead the Timberwolves (2-3), who have lost three in a row with star center Karl-Anthony Towns missing all three games because of a dislocated left wrist. D’Angelo Russell had 14 points for Minnesota. “Our energy was low,” Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said about the third quarter. “They were desperate tonight and we should have been that team, too, after our LA trip. We were not and it was evident in that third quarter."" Thomas Bryant added 18 points and seven rebounds for Washington, which had eight players score in double figures and shot a season-high 55.1% from the field. Westbrook missed his second game of the season, but Beal has grown accustomed to playing without a star backcourt mate. John Wall missed last season and played only 73 games over the past three seasons while Beal developed as one of the NBA's top scorers. Beal scored 14 points in the first quarter as the Wizards led by as many as 12 and went without a turnover. He didn’t play in the fourth. “We can have seven, eight straight losses and we still believe in ourselves,” rookie Deni Avdija said. ""Mark my words — we’re gonna be good.” Russell, the Wolves’ sidekick for Towns, couldn’t pick up the slack without him. He shot 6 of 16 from the field and had five turnovers. Without their main man in the middle, Minnesota allowed more than 120 points for the third straight game. “We don't feel like you have to add to your load just because a guy like Karl is out,” Saunders said. “It's on all of us. We need more offensively, more defensively. That's not just from an individual player, that's from a collective group. With that, individually, we need more from guys to get out of this rut."" TIP-INS Wizards: Raul Neto made his second start this season in place of Westbrook and had 12 points, including a pair of 3-pointers. … Beal has scored at least 20 points in 29 straight games, the longest current streak in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard started the day second on the list with 14 in a row. Beal is the first player in team history to score at least 25 points in the first six games of a season. … Davis Bertans was 3 of 7 from 3-point territory a day after going 0 of 8. Timberwolves: Minnesota was also without forward Josh Okogie, who missed his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. … No. 1 overall draft pick Anthony Edwards had 17 points. Naz Reid scored 17 starting in place of Towns. LEARNING ON THE FLY Avidja, the No. 9 overall draft pick, had a season-high 11 points and added seven rebounds, three assists and three steals. His best game of the season earned accolades from coach Scott Brooks. “I thought Deni took another step in a young career,” Brooks said. “I thought he was able to make a few plays that we can maybe utilize him more in the future.”","401267234"
"LeBron James goes for 26 points while Anthony Davis puts up 34 in the Lakers' 109-103 win over the Spurs. (2:28) SAN ANTONIO -- — The Los Angeles Lakers know they are not always going to feel or play like the defending league champions. Anthony Davis had 35 points and 11 rebounds and LeBron James added 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists as the Lakers rallied to beat the San Antonio Spurs 109-103 on Friday night. The Lakers closed the game with a 9-0 run for their second win against the Spurs in three days. “We persisted through our struggles,” Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel said. “That’s going to happen from time to time. In a 72-game season, you are going to have some wins that are uglier than others. We knew coming into this season, with the quick turnaround, there was going to be some ugly nights. The key is to find a way to win when you are not at your best.” The Lakers found a way to win by attacking the paint late against the youthful core of the Spurs. San Antonio forward Keldon Johnson blocked James’ layup attempt, but Kyle Kuzma tipped in the follow to give the Lakers a 105-103 lead with 53.9 seconds remaining. James followed with a layup and Davis closed the scoring with two free throws. “Their game plan tweaked,” Kuzma said. “They added a little bit of a different element for us. We had to adjust down the stretch.” Johnson had a career-high 26 points and added 10 rebounds for his fourth game of 20-plus points in two seasons. Only Hall of Famer Tim Duncan had more 20-point efforts through his first 25 career games with the Spurs, getting six during his rookie season. “He’s a competitor,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said of Johnson. “He’s a fine young player and he’s going to have a great career. That’s about all I can say. He’s been wonderful.” Johnson was 5 for 9 on 3-pointers, including a 26-footer with 6:30 remaining that put the Spurs up 95-94. Unlike in Wednesday’s 121-107 loss, the Spurs were able to keep pace with the Lakers early. “We played a heck of a basketball team, and we were a good basketball team tonight also,” Popovich said. “So, I was happy with their play.” The Lakers picked up their pace to start the second half, resulting in a 10-2 advantage in fast-break points and a 64-57 lead a minute into the third quarter. Los Angeles closed the game with a 12-9 advantage on fast-break points. Lakers guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope exited in the second half after mildly spraining his left ankle when he stepped awkwardly driving for a layup. Caldwell-Pope remained down for about a minute before being assisted off the court. He had 11 points before exiting with 8:31 left in the third quarter. DeMar DeRozan had 23 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for San Antonio, which has lost three straight after opening the season with two victories. Spurs guard Derrick White had nine points in 23 minutes in his season debut after undergoing toe surgery in the offseason. TIP-INS Lakers: The Lakers entered the game shooting 42 percent on 3-pointers, which is second in the league. They were 14 for 33 on Friday. … Wesley Matthews was scoreless, going 0 for 2 on 3-pointers after going 6 for 6 on 3s and scoring 18 points in Wednesday’s victory over the Spurs. … James fell to the court after taking an elbow from Drew Eubanks early in the fourth. James continually grabbed his side for a few possessions after but appeared fine afterwards. Spurs: LaMarcus Aldridge missed his second straight game with an undisclosed illness as well as a sore left knee. ...

"Jamal Murray drains the 26-foot step-back jumper right over DeAndre Ayton late in the third quarter. (0:16) DENVER -- — Chris Paul presented a convincing argument in persuading his coach to challenge a late call. There was no argument necessary to convince anyone who should take a clutch shot in the closing seconds. Paul came through yet again. The point guard hit a big jumper with 7.3 seconds remaining after a successful coach's challenge on the other end and the Phoenix Suns moved to an NBA-best 5-1 by holding off the scuffling Denver Nuggets 106-103 on Friday night. They were last 5-1 in 2009-10. Moments like this are precisely why the Suns acquired Paul in a deal with Oklahoma City. Paul led the NBA in clutch scoring last season. “Him being able to knock down shots, and the ability and will to take those shots, is huge for us,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. His lobbying skills proved just as powerful. With Phoenix leading 102-100 with around 30 seconds remaining, Mikal Bridges was called for a foul that would've sent Gary Harris to the line. But on the advice of Paul, Williams decided to challenge the play. Replays appeared to show Bridges sliding underneath Harris near the basket — and with no contact — as Harris lost the ball. “Usually, fouls aren’t overturned,” Williams explained. “But he’s like, ‘Coach, why not?’ ... That's how it happened. He’s an asset to our team in many ways."" Phoenix's Deandre Ayton won the jump ball and Paul hit a jumper to help send the Suns to the victory after blowing a 16-point lead. Jamal Murray's shot at the buzzer rimmed out. Ayton had 22 points and 11 rebounds, Devin Booker added 22, and Paul 21 for Phoenix, which won the night before in Utah. That's two big wins over two playoff teams from a season ago. “It just shows our resilience,” Paul said about blowing a second-half lead against Denver and bouncing back. “We want to learn in these situations and win at the same time.” Murray returned from a bruised right elbow and found his range early, scoring 14 of his 31 points in the first quarter. Nikola Jokic finished with 17 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds despite foul trouble. The Denver big man is posting big numbers but his production isn’t translating into wins as the Nuggets fell to 1-4. The Nuggets are struggling to find their rhythm after making the Western Conference finals last season. “Did a lot of really good things. Gave ourselves a chance,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “But this is not Year 1 or Year 2 where that’s acceptable. We lost another game. We lost another game at home. We have to be better.” The Nuggets were missing forward Michael Porter Jr., who was held out in accordance with the league’s health and safety protocols concerning COVID-19. Gone with him were 19.5 points per game. Phoenix appeared on its way to an easy win when Booker extended the lead to to 87-71 on a 3-pointer with 2:17 left in the third. But Denver stormed back, with Monte Morris giving the Nuggets a 98-97 lead on a 3-pointer with 2:41 remaining. Paul then hit two free throws and Booker a 3-pointer to restore some separation down the stretch. TIP-INS Suns: F Dario Saric (sore right quad) sat out on the second night of a back-to-back as a precaution. ... Williams said F/C Jalen Smith (sprained left ankle) is “on a course to be back here soon."" Nuggets: F JaMychal Green scored eight points in his Nuggets debut. The free-agent pickup missed the start of the season with a strained left calf. “Just happy to be back out there,"" he said. TEACHING MOMENT Nuggets coach Michael Malone is using the situation with Porter as a way to further emphasize the importance of adhering to all of the safety protocols in regard to the virus. Porter could miss multiple games because of contact tracing. “These are real protocols. They’re in place for a reason,” Malone said. “Unfortunate, but this is the current situation we’re in.” PRAISE FOR PAUL Count Malone as a big fan of Paul. “A first-ballot Hall of Famer,” Malone said.","401267236"
"Mike Conley drains a 3-pointer from the corner late as the Jazz hang on to defeat the Clippers 106-100. (0:16) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Mike Conley endured many frustrating moments during his first season after being traded to Utah from Memphis. Everything from injuries to struggles absorbing the Jazz offensive system kept him from finding a rhythm for much of last season. Conley is not feeling that same frustration in his second season with Utah. He made seven 3-pointers and scored a season-high 33 points to lead the Jazz to a 106-100 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night. Conley consistently made the right reads on offense as evidenced by his seven assists. It added up to one big play after another for the veteran point guard. “He just did a great job of controlling the whole game and just making big plays for us,” forward Derrick Favors said. Conley came into the season with a focus on building off his solid performances inside the NBA bubble. In a short time, he’s already demonstrating his growth. He credited Utah coach Quin Snyder with giving him a chance to adapt and learn. “He stuck true to me,” Conley said. “He’s given me nothing but confidence.” Donovan Mitchell added 15 points for the Jazz. Favors chipped in with 14 points and 11 rebounds off the bench as Utah earned its first home victory of the season. Paul George had 25 points, eight rebounds and six steals to lead Los Angeles. Kawhi Leonard added 20 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists. The Clippers shot just 38.8% from the field. Los Angeles trailed by as many as 20 in the second half before rallying in the fourth quarter. The Clippers cut Utah’s lead to 95-94 after George drained a 3-pointer with 3:15 left. Rudy Gobert answered with a layup and then Conley sank his seventh 3 with 1:49 remaining to keep Los Angeles from overtaking the Jazz. “This is a hard-working team,” George said. “We play hard. We never count ourselves out. We continued fighting all the way to the end and gave ourselves a chance.” The Clippers became sluggish on offense as the first quarter progressed. Los Angeles shot just 25% from the field during that 12-minute stretch and scored only two baskets after taking a 13-11 lead on a 3-pointer from Nicolas Batum midway through the quarter. That opened the door for the Jazz to surge ahead late in the quarter, and Utah had no trouble finding its shot. The Jazz shot 52% from the floor during the opening period. Utah scored baskets on seven straight possessions and nine of 10 to fuel a 24-4 run over a 5½-minute stretch spanning the first and second quarters. Conley scored five of those baskets — including Utah’s final three field goals of the first quarter — and totaled 12 points in the first quarter alone. Jordan Clarkson and Conley punctuated the run with back-to-back 3s, giving the Jazz a 37-19 lead a minute into the second quarter. “Conley was great. He was special,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “We did a great job on Donovan and (Bojan) Bogdanovic, giving different looks and coverages … but Conley’s shot-making made the difference tonight.” The Clippers nearly erased the deficit before halftime. Los Angeles scored on four straight possessions, bookended by baskets from Leonard, to trim the deficit to 43-42. Utah weathered the surge and scored three straight baskets to end the half, capped by a dunk from Favors. The Jazz then opened the second half with three unanswered baskets and extended their lead to 67-47 on a corner 3 from Conley midway through the third quarter. “It was a fun night and a night we definitely needed,” Conley said. TIP-INS Clippers: George shot 6 of 21 from the field. … Leonard totaled 10 rebounds in his first three games of the season. … Los Angeles finished with just eight turnovers. Jazz: Joe Ingles set season highs in assists (seven) and rebounds (eight) to go with 11 points. … The NBA fined Clarkson $25,000 for shoving a referee during the second quarter of Utah’s 106-95 loss to Phoenix on Thursday. … The Jazz outscored the Clippers 46-30 in the paint. EMBRACING HIS ROLE Favors notched his first double-double in his second stint with the Jazz, finishing with season highs in points and rebounds. Friday was also the first time this season the veteran forward had more than 10 rebounds in a game. He averaged 5.5 rebounds through his previous four. Favors’ defensive mindset has bolstered Utah’s second unit. Coming off the bench is a new role for him, but one he has fully embraced since his return. “Credit to him, he’s always ready to play,” Snyder said. “Whatever you ask him to do, he’s going to embrace (it).” DIFFERENT KIND OF MASK Leonard played his second straight game wearing a protective facemask. The facial apparatus has been in place since he missed two games after taking an inadvertent elbow from teammate Serge Ibaka on Christmas. The blow caused a nasty laceration. Until the stitches come out, the mask stays on. The Clippers forward has averaged 24 points, 9.5 rebounds and 8.0 assists in the mask. But that doesn’t mean he’s feeling comfortable in it. “I don’t know how you get used to wearing something like that on your head,” Leonard said. “I don’t want to wear it but I need to protect myself and it’ll be off soon.”","401267237"
"Damian Lillard drops 34 points in the Trail Blazers' blowout victory over the Warriors. (2:10) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Damian Lillard joined Hall of Famer Clyde Drexler as the only Portland players to score 15,000 points for the franchise, finishing with 34 as the Trail Blazers spoiled Golden State's home opener with a 123-98 win over the Warriors on Friday night. “Fifteen thousand is a huge accomplishment, something that I’m proud of but my work is far from done,” Lillard said. CJ McCollum added 28 points for Portland, knocking down 4 of 5 3-pointers early as the Trail Blazers hit 10 of 15 from long range to start the game. McCollum became the second player in NBA history to make 25 or more over the first five games of a season. Stephen Curry did it twice. He shot just 4 for 12 from deep and had 26 points, eight rebounds and five assists for the Warriors, Andrew Wiggins scored 15 and Kelly Oubre Jr. contributed 10 points in his first home game with the team. Golden State finally got back to Chase Center for its first home game in a 297-day span. But the Warriors took another lopsided loss following a 2-2 road trip in which they were outscored by 65 points in defeats at Brooklyn and Milwaukee then won at Chicago and Detroit by a combined 11 points. ""They came out smoking hot, they were making everything,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Lillard, from the Warriors’ former city of Oakland, shot 11 for 21 with six 3-pointers and also dished out eight assists. He averaged 43.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and 8.0 assists in three games against the Warriors last season — including a 61-point performance on Jan. 20, 2020. Draymond Green didn't score and had four rebounds, four assists and four fouls over nearly 18 minutes making his season debut for Golden State, his first game since Feb. 27 against the Los Angeles Lakers and a stretch of 309 days. He had been sidelined the first four games by a right foot injury after being delayed starting training camp because he had the coronavirus. “Draymond just looks like he’s getting his wind. He looked like a guy who missed training camp and has been working his way to get onto the floor,” Kerr said. “It looked like an exhibition-style game for him. That’s not a criticism, it’s just where he is physically.” No. 2 overall draft pick James Wiseman gave Golden State a scare when he went down grabbing his left ankle late before walking off on his own. It wasn't serious and he is expected to play Sunday. Images of the late Clifford Robinson wearing both Warriors and Blazers jerseys were shown on the big screen during a first-quarter break. He died Aug. 29 at age 53. NO FANS The Warriors moved their championship banners down beneath one basket, a nice touch for fans to glimpse on TV. NEW YEAR’S HOOPS The Warriors played at home on New Year’s Day for just the fourth time in franchise history and the first time since a 125-93 win against the Kansas City Kings in 1982 for the 499th career coaching victory by Warriors Hall of Famer Al Attles. Golden State hadn't played Jan. 1 since 2011 at Miami. “I’m happy the year is ending, like most people. It’s been a lousy year for everybody,” Kerr said leading into the game. “As a coach my job is to remind our players that better times are ahead, on and off the court. On the court we had the worst record in the league in 2020. ... If you look at the off-the-court stuff, there is a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccines and with just a glimpse of the future and we’ve got to all continue to try to inspire others to be smart, be safe, try to protect each other, wear our masks and be really patient and understand that we’re all going to get through this eventually. It’s not going to happen overnight.” TIP-INS Trail Blazers: F Rodney Hood was limited to five minutes because of a cramp in his left quadriceps. ... Drexler scored 18,040 points. In Lillard's 620th game played, he tied Larry Bird as 21st-fastest in NBA history to score 15,000 points and fourth among active players behind LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony. ... Anthony's 18 points gave him 26,499 and he passed Tim Duncan (26,496) for 14th place on the all-time NBA scoring list. Warriors: The Warriors began 3 for 12 to fall behind 22-7. ...

"De'Aaron Fox uses a spin move through the lane to avoid the defense and goes up to put down a two-handed dunk. (0:15) HOUSTON -- — John Wall scored 28 points and the Houston Rockets beat the Sacramento Kings 102-94 on Saturday despite playing without an injured James Harden. Harden, who sat out with a sprained right ankle, was not listed on the injury report and coach Stephen Silas did not mention his injury in his pregame availability. The team announced that he wouldn’t play about 38 minutes before the game was scheduled to begin. Wall, who sat out Houston's first two games because of COVID-19 contact tracing, missed all of last season and played just 32 games two years ago because of injuries. He scored 22 points in his Rockets' debut on Thursday after a trade from Washington to make him the first player to score 50 points in his first two games after an absence of at least two years since Michael Jordan did it in 2001, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. “I just put in a lot of hard work and dedication to get to this point,"" Wall said. “I couldn’t ask for a better start to be 2-0 in my first two games."" Silas wasn't sure what to expect from Wall after being out for so long. But he has definitely been impressed. “Whatever expectations I had, he’s obviously exceeded them,"" he said. The Rockets scored the first nine points of the fourth quarter to extend their lead to 92-81 with about 8½ minutes left. Eric Gordon led the team in that stretch, making a 3-pointer and three free throws. Sacramento ended a scoring drought of more than 3½ minutes soon after that on an alley-oop dunk by Richaun Holmes. Both teams struggled to score after that as they combined to miss 10 shots in a row. Gordon finally made a shot for Houston with just less than five minutes to go, and Wall added a bucket a few seconds later to extend the lead to 96-83. Silas raved about his team's defense on Saturday and said without Harden's scoring prowess it was even more important to concentrate on that part of the game. “We really buckled down and played some defense,"" Silas said. “In order for us to be good we have to be good on defense. We can’t just outscore people."" The Kings used an 8-2 run, capped by four points from Harrison Barnes, to get within 98-91 with less than a minute to go. But Christian Wood responded with a dunk to put the game out of reach. Harden had started Houston’s first three games this season and is averaging a league-leading 37 points with 11 assists. De’Aaron Fox had 23 points for the Kings, who lost to the Rockets for the second straight game after winning three of their first four games. “The guys should feel bad about the loss just like I do, losing is painful,"" coach Luke Walton said. “But they should also feel very good about how they are playing as a group.” He said they got stagnant offensively in the second half and was particularly disappointed in their lack of assists. “We only had 11 assists tonight as a team, which is awful,"" he said. “That’s not who we are as a group.” Wood had 20 points and 16 rebounds and Gordon added 21 points for Houston. The Kings cut the lead to two points on a 3-pointer by Buddy Hield with about 7½ minutes left in the third quarter. Wall made four quick points after that to stretch the lead to 79-73. The Rockets were up by seven late in the third before Fox scored the last five points of the quarter to cut the deficit to 83-81 entering the fourth.

"Malcolm Brogdon can't miss a shot as he puts up 17 points on 6-of-6 shooting in the first quarter. (0:29) INDIANAPOLIS -- — New coach Tom Thibodeau expects the New York Knicks to play tough and physical. He also knows a veteran like Austin Rivers can help show his young team how it's done. Rivers made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 3:23 to play and added another clutch basket during the game-sealing run Saturday night to help the Knicks record a rare 106-102 victory over Indiana. “I think the experience is huge and it gives us another guy who can put the ball on the floor,"" Thibodeau said. “He can makes 3s, he can play defense and I think that’s the way the league is going right now. I thought he made big shots, big plays and he’s still working his way through the conditioning piece of it.” Rivers missed New York's first four games with a groin injury before returning to the lineup Thursday. Two nights later, he made an impact. Less than two weeks after the Knicks lost to Indiana for the ninth time in 10 meetings, by a 14-point margin, Rivers helped them find a way to rebound. No, he wasn't the team's top scorer. That honor belonged to RJ Barrett, who had 25 points. And, no, Rivers didn't have a second straight double-double. That was Julius Randle, who had 13 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. But Rivers was effective inside and outside, and his teammates took the cue by following their coach's calling card. New York outrebounded Indiana 51-32, with the Pacers grabbing just five offensive rebounds. “That’s the difference in the game,"" Indiana guard Malcolm Brogdon said. “Their ability to rebound the ball and be physical inside was huge."" Brogdon led the Pacers with a career-high 33 points but his 3 was blocked by Mitchell Robinson with less than a minute to go, which led to Rivers' breakaway basket during the decisive 11-0 run. Neither team earned style points in a game played with typical post-holiday sluggishness. But after trailing 51-50 at the break, the Knicks opened the second half on a 16-5 scoring flurry to retake the lead and extend it to 66-56. And after Justin Holiday tied the score at 82 with a buzzer-beating 3 at the end of the third quarter, Randle broke the tie with a 3 to start the fourth. Then after Indiana charged back to take a 96-93 lead, Robinson started the closing run with a dunk. Rivers followed with the 3, and his breakaway basket sealed it. “(Thibodeau) just tells me to go play because he knows I really don’t have any familiarity with the sets,"" Rivers said. “The easiest thing to do sometimes is just go play.” TIP-INS Knicks: Barrett apparently likes playing at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, where he was 4 of 5 on 3s in this one and is 7 of 8 from long range this season. He is 0 for 21 on 3s in every other venue. ... Robinson had 16 points and nine rebounds. Pacers: Brogdon was 6 for 6 from the field in the first quarter. The rest of his teammates made just four first-period baskets. He finished 7 of 10 on 3s. ... Domantas Sabonis had his sixth straight double-double with 13 points and 13 rebounds. ... Myles Turner had 17 points and one block. ... Indiana was 19 of 50 on 3s and forced 15 turnovers. HOLIDAY START Pacers guard Aaron Holiday made his third start of the season and his second straight in place of injured forward T.J. Warren. Warren is out indefinitely after having surgery on his left foot, meaning Aaron Holiday could see significant minutes for the foreseeable future. The Pacers need him to play better than he did Saturday, though. He missed all six shots, including five 3s, and did not score. He had two rebounds and one assist. “I think T.J. is the best pure scorer on the team,"" Brogdon said. “So that hurts us a lot.”","401267240"
"Magic pressure defense results in a loose ball picked up by Terrence Ross who wins a footrace for a bucket on the other end. (0:19) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Darius Bazley had a season-high 19 points, George Hill scored 13 of his 18 points in the third quarter and the Oklahoma City Thunder dominated the second half of a 108-99 win over the Orlando Magic on Saturday. The Thunder ended a three-game losing streak and bounced back nicely from a 33-point loss to New Orleans two nights earlier. Oklahoma City also avenged a 118-107 home loss against the Magic five nights ago. “I just thought it was a good, resilient game for us because we carried a lot of stuff over from the New Orleans game that we wanted to address and from the last time we played Orlando,” coach Mark Daigneault said. “Orlando is a good team that makes you play a clean game to win and I was pleased with how we did that.” Orlando (4-2) has dropped two straight after starting the season 4-0. The Magic were routed 116-92 by Philadelphia on New Year’s Eve and lost on Saturday after making just 37% of their shots. Orlando was even worse in the fourth quarter when it made just eight of 28 shots (28.5%) and missed all 10 of its tries from 3-point range. That allowed the Thunder to outscore the Magic 24-17 over the final 12 minutes to break open a close game. “It started with one-on-one defense and we weren’t getting stops,” said Magic forward Aaron Gordon, who had 15 points, eight rebounds and five assists, but made only 6 of 15 field goal attempts. “It’s just one-on-one defense and that just comes down to pride, technique and energy.” Nikola Vucevic scored a season-best 30 points by making 13 of 21 shots, including four 3-pointers. He also grabbed 13 rebounds. Terrence Ross added 26 points and four 3-pointers off the Orlando bench. Six players scored in double digits for Oklahoma City, which shot 44.2% from the floor with 13 3-pointers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 16 points, while Al Horford, Hamidou Diallo and rookie Theo Maledon each scored 12 points. Bazley converted a driving, left-handed dunk with 4:37 left to give the Thunder a 99-91 lead, their largest of the night up to that point. Horford drilled a straight-on 3-pointer with 50 seconds to play, sending the Thunder on their way to the second road victory of the season. “Our coaches really harped on what we needed to improve upon from last game and we carried it over,” Horford said. “We did much better job of setting the tone early in the game.” The Thunder trailed by three points just after halftime, but they grabbed the lead late in the third quarter and never trailed the rest of the way. They outscored the Magic 22-15 in the fourth period. Standout guard Evan Fournier missed Saturday’s game with back spasms. Michael Carter-Williams started in place of Fournier and missed nine of his 11 shots and all four tries from 3-point range. “We struggled a little offensively, especially toward the end, because we didn’t work the offense enough and we could have gotten some better shots,” said Vucevic, who missed four of his six attempts in the final quarter. TIP INS Thunder: Saturday’s game was the first stop on a five-game, 10-day road trip for the Thunder. The trip will allow the Thunder to face two teams — Orlando and New Orleans — that they have already lost to this season. ... The Thunder entered Saturday’s game ranked 30th in the league in free throw percentage (62.3%), 29th in makes (12) and 28th in attempts (19.3). They were 19 of 21 from the line on Saturday. Magic: Orlando entered Saturday last in the league in 3-point attempts (26.8) and makes (8.8) per game. They hit just 10 of 38 attempts from beyond the arc on Saturday.","401267241"
"Seth Curry fires a beautiful no-look lob up to Ben Simmons at the hoop for a nice alley-oop in transition vs. the Hornets. (0:18) PHILADELPHIA -- — Tobias Harris punctuated a drive with a dynamic dunk that should have made a packed arena quake. He had to settle for leaving the Hornets shaken. Joel Embiid had 19 points and 14 rebounds and Harris scored 24 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 127-112 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. Ben Simmons had 15 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists to help the Sixers beat the Hornets for the 12th straight time. Philadelphia has not lost to Charlotte since Nov. 2, 2016. “When we're shooting the ball like that, we're dangerous,” coach Doc Rivers said. “We can every night. We have great shooters.” Terry Rozier scored 35 points for the Hornets. The Sixers are rolling in Rivers’ first season on the bench and followed a 24-point win over Orlando with another victory where they led by double digits for most of the game. Maligned in Philly for a paycheck not commensurate with his production, Harris has become the catch-and-shoot 3-point ace the Sixers needed to give them another scoring threat alongside All-Stars Embiid and Simmons. Yet it was Harris' full-court drive-and-dunk down the lane that posterized — or perhaps GIF’d in the modern era — Bismack Biyombo and left the Hornets reeling. “He’s made a huge leap from the past year to now,” Simmons said. The Sixers got a little something from everyone, including 21 points from Seth Curry and 13 from Danny Green, two offseason pickups the Sixers hoped would address outside shooting woes. “The key is, we're shooting well because we're getting open shots,” Green said. Harris blossomed when he played for the Clippers (43% on 3s) under Rivers before he was traded to Philadelphia in 2019. Harris stumbled from long-range in his 1 1/2 seasons with the 76ers only to find the reunion with his old coach the spark he needed to find his stroke. He hit all 3 attempts in the first half and the Sixers hit 12 of 22 overall before halftime to lead 73-58. “They’re making my job easier when they do that,” Simmons said. The Sixers hit a lull in the third. Green’s lazy entry pass was picked off by Rozier and Rivers threw up his hands in exasperation. Rozier hit Gordon Hayward for the bucket that cut it to 94-83 and the Sixers called timeout. No worries in Philly. Simmons scored consecutive buckets late in the fourth, the second on an alley-oop from Curry that had the Sixers drummers — aka the Sixers Stixers — going wild. Hey, someone had to with fans still banned from the Wells Fargo Center. TIP-INS: HORNETS: Coach James Borrego said it was too early in the season to consider shaking up the starting lineup. “If there’s changes to be made, we’re going to make them,” he said. That meant another game off the bench for the No. 3 overall pick, LaMelo Ball. Ball scored 13 points had four steals and continued to show flashes as the best Hornet on the court. 76ERS: F Mike Scott sat out with an injured left knee suffered Thursday in Orlando. SLUMPING GRAHAM The Hornets lost 108-93 to the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night and got little production from Devonte’ Graham in both games. He missed nine of 10 shots and scored five points against the Sixers. He is 2-for-20 from the floor the last two nights. “I've just go to help him,” Borrego said. “It's on me to try to help Devonte. That's on me. He's going to do his part. He's going to put his work in. I've got to find him ways to get him better looks, open looks."" BANGED UP Borrego said forward PJ Washington played limited minutes in the second half because of a thumb issue. HE SAID IT Much like predecessor Brett Brown, Rivers downplays Simmons’ struggles from 3-point range. Simmons hit his first 3 of the season -- and third ever in 222 games — Thursday against Orlando. “We didn’t have a parade or anything, I can tell you that,” Rivers said.","401267242"
"JaVale McGee drives down the lane and somehow gets a left-handed layup to fall while being fouled. (0:20) ATLANTA -- — Collin Sexton scored 27 points, Andre Drummond had 12 points and 11 rebounds and the Cleveland Cavaliers wiped out a 15-point deficit in the third quarter and beat the Atlanta Hawks 96-91 on Saturday night. The Cavs' keys to the game defensively were to prevent Atlanta from spending the whole game shooting free throws and from firing at will from beyond the arc, two categories in which the Hawks are among NBA leaders. “In the first quarter they were having their way with some 3s,"" Larry Nance Jr. said. “Get them off the free throw line, get them off the 3-point line and anything in between that we'll live with. Andre and JaVale are way too good at the rim contesting shots. It's hard to finish over that kind of length."" JaVale McGee, who finished with 14 points, scooped in a runner to help the Cavs reclaim the lead at 84-83, and Sexton made it a three-point lead with a 17-footer on the next possession to keep Atlanta on its heels. Clint Capela had 16 points and 16 rebounds for the Hawks, who had 22 turnovers in the final three quarters but tied it at 88-all on Bogdan Bogdanovic's 3 before Sexton hit a 3 to put the Cavs up 91-88 with 27.2 seconds remaining. John Collins missed an ensuing dunk attempt before Darius Garland hit a free throw and Sexton hit four foul shots to end the scoring in the closing seconds. “It feels good just to have my teammates behind me each night,"" Sexton said. “Early on they were like, ‘Keep going, keep going, you're going to get your rhythm.' ... They pretty much have a lot of confidence in me."" Collins' alley-oop dunk on a feed from Trae Young gave the Hawks their biggest lead at 15 points with 6:28 left in the third, but the Cavs went on an 18-5 run to trim it to 72-70 on Garland's 3 in the final minute of the period. They finally took the lead early in the fourth when Cedi Osman's 3-pointer from the right wing made it 76-74 with 9:47 remaining. Atlanta took its first double-digit lead when Young’s acrobatic layup made it 30-19 at the 2:49 mark of the first. Young had other highlights in the second, stealing the ball and passing from his knees to Cam Reddish for a layup that made it 45-35, and assisting Capela from the left side for an inside basket that kept the lead at 10 at the 2:39 mark. The Hawks, coming off a win at Brooklyn on Thursday, looked sluggish throughout, but still carried a 56-44 lead into intermission. The closest Cleveland got in the second quarter was a 3 by Osman that made it 53-44, but Kevin Huerter quickly followed with a 3 from the right wing to push the lead back to 12. The Hawks began the game leading the NBA in scoring (125.8) and free throws made per game (25.2), and ranking second in 3-pointer made, second-chance points (17.0) and rebounds (49.4). “It happened tonight where they're in a rhythm and getting back into the game,"" Young said. “We've just got to lock in a little bit more.""

"Brandon Ingram goes to the free throw line and says, ""It's over,"" multiple times as he knocks down both shots to ice the game for a Pelicans win over the Raptors. (0:43) NEW ORLEANS -- — Eric Bledsoe capped a 19-point, 10-assist performance with a go-ahead 3-pointer in the final minute, and the New Orleans Pelicans held on for a 120-116 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night. Brandon Ingram added 31 points, capped by four free throws in the last 13 seconds to seal the victory. Zion Williamson scored 21 points, highlighted by a pair of driving spin moves in the lane to set up left-handed leaners off the glass. The Pelicans lost a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter, briefly falling behind in the final four minutes, but were able clamp down defensively and limit the Raptors to just one point during the final 2:47. “The thing I like the best is our resilience,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “It’s not easy to give up a double-digit lead with (8:30) to go and then go behind. A lot of teams sort of fade away at that point.” Fred VanVleet scored 27 points and Chris Boucher added 24 for Toronto. Pascal Siakam scored 10 points, but fouled out with 8:30 remaining. “He struggled, there was no doubt about it,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Siakam. “He had a few decent plays and a few good drives in there, but again he obviously struggled.” The Pelicans led 101-89 when Josh Hart made a free throw just after Siakam fouled out. But Kyle Lowry quickly responded with a 3, igniting a 22-9 run that ended with 3s by OG Anunoby, Powell and VanVleet to put Toronto up 111-110 with 3:16 to go. Ingram's free throws tied it at 113 with 1:08 left. And after Toronto lost the ball out of bounds, Bledsoe hit his pivotal left-wing 3 with 41.6 seconds left. “I was kind of locked in,"" Beldsoe said, noting that he expected Toronto to double-team Ingram and leave someone open on the perimeter. ""I was just trying to stay ready and when I got the ball I was going to shoot it with confidence.” VanVleet scored 11 of his 21 first-half points during the last seven minutes of the second period to push Toronto in front late in the half. Lowery added a 3 from 30 feet away to put the Raptors up 60-50 before a 3 by Lonzo Ball and Steven Adams' putback dunk trimmed it to 60-55 at halftime. Although they've lost four of their first five games, the Raptors didn't sound inclined to start panicking yet. “Once we start winning some games and get a lot of minutes — good minutes — together as a team playing solid defense, and getting stops, and running, and things like that, you know, it’ll get back to normal,” Siakam said. ""I just think that the game is focusing on little things and continuing to get better as a team and an individual.” TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto went 26 of 27 on foul shots. ...

""He was outstanding.” MEA CULPA Van Gundy said he couldn't play Williamson as much as he wanted to in the final few minutes because he had lost a timeout when he unsuccessfully challenged a foul called against New Orleans in the second half. “I made a huge mistake in the game that you guys should all write about and criticize me for because you'll sound like you really know what's going on,” Van Gundy said, noting that even though he thought he might win the challenge, it was too risky to jeopardize what few timeouts he had left. “We should have never challenged that."" Van Gundy explained that he felt matchups dictated removing Williamson in favor of having four perimeter players to defend in the final minutes, adding, ""We couldn't take a timeout to get (Williamson) back in on offense.”","401267244"
"Jayson Tatum knocks down an uncontested jumper after Blake Griffin loses his footing. Griffin's heave would fall short on the other end to lock up the Celtics' win.

Jaylen Brown led Boston with 31 points. He hit a late 3-pointer and was 13 of 16 from the field, two nights after his late miss sealed a loss in the opener in Detroit. “We haven’t been good, especially down the stretch, executing-wise,” said Marcus Smart, who added 17 points and eight assists. “We got to our spots, we got the ball where we wanted it, and those two players made great shots and great reads.

"Kyrie Irving takes Bradley Beal to the baseline, then shakes him with a crossover before dropping the ball off for an easy slam dunk. (0:21) NEW YORK -- — First Kyrie Irving, then Kevin Durant. Once both superstars had missed, a Brooklyn Nets team that believes it's good enough to win a title wasn't even good enough for a winning record. Bradley Beal had 27 points, 10 rebounds and the assist on Thomas Bryant's go-ahead dunk with 14.9 seconds left, leading the Washington Wizards to a 123-122 victory over the Nets on Sunday. Irving and Durant missed jumpers in the final six seconds, dropping the Nets to 3-4 in their first season with the duo playing together. “It’s just taking time and it’s not going to be put together overnight, nor am I expecting it to, nor am I going to get frustrated over six games or however many games we’ve played,” Irving said. “The object of this regular season was to continue to get better and prepare for the 16 wins in the playoffs.” Russell Westbrook had 24 points and 10 assists but only five rebounds after recording triple-doubles in his first four games with the Wizards. Bryant finished with 21 points and 14 rebounds as Washington won its second straight after an 0-5 start. “We guarded our tails off. We defended without fouling late down the stretch,” Beal said. “We know how hard of a job that is. We’ve got two of the best players ever to touch a basketball on the other side, so it’s a tough task, man, but I think we did an excellent job of accepting that challenge.” Irving had 30 points and 10 assists for the Nets, while Durant had 28 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. But Durant also had six of the Nets' 20 turnovers that led to 23 Washington points. “I can live with two or three, but six of them is too much for me,” Durant said. The lead changed hands frequently down the stretch before Beal missed a jumper with the Wizards down by one. Bryant grabbed the rebound and the ball got back to Beal, who drove into the lane and dished it to his big man. Irving then missed a 3-pointer but the Nets grabbed the rebound and got it to Durant, whose jumper with 1.5 seconds left was off. The Nets, who pulled out a 145-141 shootout against the Hawks on Wednesday, were on pace for another one at halftime. Down 12 early in the second quarter after being outscored 11-0 to start the period, they finished with a flurry to lead 71-70. The Wizards picked up their defense in the second half and went aggressively to the boards, finishing with 23 more shot attempts. “I thought we had a chance to extend the lead a couple of times but that’s a team that’s ready for the championship this year with all that talent they have,” Washington coach Scott Brooks said. “They just keep coming with talent but I thought we competed.” TIP-INS Wizards: Rookie Deni Avdija turned 20 on Sunday. Brooks joked that the first five games with the first-round pick were rough. “I don’t like coaching teenagers,” Brooks said. ... Westbrook had no rebounds in the first half.

James had 22 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists, Anthony Davis added 17 points and nine rebounds as the Lakers opened a two-game set in Memphis with a 108-94 victory over the Grizzlies on Sunday night. “We were doing a lot of jostling with Memphis,” James said, “At the start of the fourth, I wanted to try and implement myself and my scoring a little bit more. Get a bit more in attack mode and see if I could kind of open the game up and we were able to do that.” James played within the offense for the first three quarters, then became more aggressive to start the fourth, scoring the Lakers first 10 points of the period.

Gasol played 10-plus seasons with the Grizzlies. The Raptors did not travel to Memphis after COVID-19 stalled last season. The Grizzlies had a video tribute to Gasol during a first-quarter timeout. “You always have in the back of your mind – when am I going to play Memphis again,” Gasol said of the post-trade situation. “In your mind is the stands are full. …It makes it a little less special because with people it would have made this journey here to Memphis unique and special to me.” James added: “I hope when we get our fans back, that Marc can get another (video),” James said. “I truly hope that they re-show that video again.","401267247"
"Nikola Jokic drives in and dishes a nice assist to PJ Dozier for the bucket, giving Jokic the assist he needs for a triple-double. (0:22) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Jamal Murray scored a season-high 36 points, Nikola Jokic had 19 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists for his fourth triple-double of the season and the Denver Nuggets beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-109 on Sunday night. Murray kept Denver afloat while Jokic dealt with early foul trouble for the second straight game. Murray scored 26 points in the first half, including 16 in the second quarter. Jokic then helped the Nuggets overcome a Minnesota lead at the start of the fourth to pull away and snap a two-game losing skid. The teams will complete home-and home set Tuesday night in Denver. “We weren’t great tonight, but we got a win and we needed a win,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “We play them in a couple days. We’ll have to be even better than we were tonight.” Malik Beasley, the former Denver draft pick traded to the Timberwolves last season, scored a season-high 25 for Minnesota. It lost its fourth straight game without Karl-Anthony Towns, who is out with a left wrist dislocation. D’Angelo Russell finished with 18 points and seven assists for the Wolves. “I’m not happy now because a loss is a loss,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “But I’m happy with in those moments where you see that growth and you see things that you work constantly with these guys at, they’re getting better.” Russell keyed a third-quarter comeback for the Wolves, who led 84-83 before the start of the fourth. Russell had 10 points and six assists in the third, while Beasley had 11 and Jarrett Culver added 10 in the quarter as Minnesota’s offense finally found some rhythm without Towns. With Jokic on the court, Denver took control with a 20-2 run in the fourth and didn’t look back. The Nuggets outscored the Wolves 41-25 in the quarter, while Jokic had seven points and three assists. “Someone needed to kind of pick it up a little bit, just the energy,” Jokic said about starting the fourth with Murray on the bench. “I think I had a couple of defensive rebounds and pushing the pace. I didn’t think of the score, but we were pushing. We were playing a little bit harder and a little bit faster. That helped us a lot.” Minnesota allowed at least 120 points for the fourth straight game, and surrendered at least 40 points in a quarter for the second straight game. “Not thinking that we need any type of home run play or home run defensive stand to stop the bleeding, but us to just focus on winning one possession,” Saunders said. TIP-INS Nuggets: Michael Porter Jr. missed his second straight game as part of the league’s health and safety protocols for COVID-19. … Murray had his fourth straight game with at least 20 points. … Facundo Campazzo was 5 of 7 from 3 for his season high. Paul Millsap had four 3s and JaMychal Green added three in his second game with the Nuggets. Timberwolves: With Saunders moving Davis and Juancho Hernangomez into the starting lineup, Minnesota had its fifth different starting group in six games this season. … Josh Okogie missed his third straight game with a left hamstring strain. … Culver finished with a season-high 20 points. FROM DOWNTOWN Campazzo, a rookie free agent from Argentina, was a spark off the bench and a hit three of his 3s in the fourth to help Denver pull away. “Facu, you knew he was going to break out,” Malone said. “The guy has played at a high level in the Olympics, the world championships and the biggest games over in the Euro league. It was great to see that.”","401267248"

"Coby White accelerates to the rim and gets bumped, but gets the layup to fall. (0:25) CHICAGO -- — Zach LaVine had 39 points and Coby White scored 21 of his 23 points in the second half to lead the Chicago Bulls to a 118-108 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night. Jalen Brunson, starting in place of the injured Luka Doncic, had 31 points for the Mavericks. Otto Porter Jr. added 15 for the Bulls, who were without starter Lauri Markkanen and reserves Tomas Satoransky, Chandler Hutchison and Ryan Arcidiacano. Chicago has won three of four and won for the first time in four home games. “I thought Zach was very aggressive, which we need him to be,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “He was big for us tonight. He had half our points in the first half. I told him he needs to remain aggressive, and that just doesn't mean scoring.” Doncic sat out because of a left quadriceps contusion. He was injured Friday night in the second quarter of a home victory over Miami Heat. He continued to play and finished with season highs of 27 points and 15 rebounds. He’s listed as day-to-day, with his status Monday night at Houston uncertain. “We’ll see how he is tomorrow,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “We don’t think this is a long-term thing.” The 21-year-old Slovenian star is off to a relatively slow start this season. He’s averaging 24.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 6.4 assists, shooting 43.2% overall and 16.1% on 3-pointers in five games. Dallas led 60-59 at halftime despite LaVine scoring 29. LaVine was 9 for 13 from the field while the rest of the Bulls were 10 for 27. Brunson had 18 first-half points on 7-for-8 shooting for the Mavericks. “I had a little more opportunity and tried to help my team win,” Brunson said. “We came up a little short. We're capable of doing so much better.” Chicago scored the final seven points of the third quarter to take an 86-81 lead into the fourth. The Bulls stretched the lead to 100-91 with just over 8 minutes on a pair of free throws by White — the largest lead to that point by either team to that point. The Mavericks pulled to within 103-98 on a basket by Josh Richardson with just under 5 minutes to go. Porter Jr. answered on the end with a 3-point play on an offensive rebounds to build the lead back up to 106-98. Dallas responded with six straight points (four by Brunson) to make it 106-104 with 3 1/2 minutes to play. LaVine then was fouled at other end and hit two free throws. Following a defensive stop, LaVine fed Porter Jr. for a layup to make it 110-104 with 2:50 remaining. “Otto does a great job of reading the play,” LaVine said. “Otto made a quick backdoor cut and I hit him with it. It was a smart play.” White hit a 3-pointer with 1:33 left for a 113-105 lead. TIP-INS Mavericks: F Kristaps Porzingis (right knee surgery) has been cleared for full contact, but there is no timetable for his return. He is expected to participate when the team holds its next practice session on Wednesday. “There's nothing imminent with him playing (in a game),” Carlisle said. “But we're a lot closer than we were.” Bulls: Markkanen, Satoransky, Hutchison and Arcidiacono each missed his third straight game under the NBA's health and safety protocols. Satoransky and Hutchison have tested positive for COVID-19. None of the four is expected back until at least the end of the upcoming four-game West Coast trip. WINNING PLAY LaVine has scored a lot of points the previous two seasons for a losing team, but Donovan wants him to focus on doing things to help the Bulls win. “I think he wants to learn,” the coach said. “He's a bright guy. I think he is learning. I've seen a lot of growth in him. He wants to win.”","401267250"
"Paul George takes exception to a hard foul and he and Devin Booker have to be separated after some jawing. The two would be assessed technical fouls. (0:56) PHOENIX -- — Paul George scored 39 points and the Los Angeles Clippers held on to beat the Phoenix Suns 112-107 on Sunday night after nearly blowing a 31-point lead in a matchup of two of the Western Conference’s top early season teams. At 5-2, the Clippers are tied with the Suns and Los Angeles Lakers for the West lead. George was 7 of 10 from 3-point range and Los Angeles was 17 of 29 overall. Kawhi Leonard added 15 points, but shot 4 of 21 from the field, and Luke Kennard came off the bench to add 14 points. “I had to be aggressive and stay in attack mode,” George said. “It is not going to be everybody’s night every night. I had to step up and help our best player on the team, help Kawhi. My job is to help him lead and help him score and give him a break from time to time.” Devin Booker led Phoenix with 25 points, and Deandre Ayton added 24. Chris Paul, who played six seasons for the Clippers, had 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists. They had won four in a row and 13 of 14 dating to their perfect run in the NBA bubble. Los Angeles opened the second quarter with 15 straight points to make it 50-24. George, Kennard and Reggie Jackson each had five points in the run. The Clippers pushed the lead to 31 at 60-29 with 6:28 left in the half and led 64-44 at the break. Phoenix cut it to 88-81 at the end of the third. In the fourth quarter, Phoenix pulled within a point at 90-89 on Cameron Johnson’s 3-pointer with about 10 minutes left. “It was obviously not the start we wanted,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. “They came out shooting the heck out of the ball. Even the 3s they made were off the dribble with a hand in their face. It is like, `What defense do you have for that.'” Two 3s by L.A.‘s Serge Ibaka extended the lead to 96-91. The Suns pulled to 107-104 in the final minutes, but Nicolas Batum hit a 3-pointer to put it away. “I was ready anytime to make a shot and a play for the team,"" said Batum, who missed much of last season with injuries. “It is great to be on the court after what happened to me the last 18 months, basketball wise, to play on a team like that and in those situations. The trust of my teammates and from a guy like (George) to give me the ball and make a shot. It feels great.” TIP-INS Clippers: Prior to the game it was announced that seven members of the Clippers’ support staff will begin a seven-day quarantine after one person in the group tested positive for COVID-19. There were no players or coaches included in the quarantine. … Forward Marcus Morris missed his seventh game. He has not played this season because of right knee soreness. Suns: The Suns held a moment of silence for Hall of Famer Paul Westphal. He died Saturday of brain cancer at age 70. He went to the NBA Finals as a player and coach with the Suns. ... Forward Abdel Nader, who was acquired in the Chris Paul trade, sat out again because of concussion protocol. Nader suffered the concussion in a preseason game against Utah.","401267251"
"Steph Curry goes nuclear, scoring a career-high 62 points to lead the Warriors as they earn a hard-fought 137-122 home win over the Trail Blazers. (2:31) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Stephen Curry twirled an arm in the air to acknowledge a small cheering section of family members in a near-empty arena, then gleefully disappeared down a tunnel to celebrate his best scoring night yet. Curry let it fly from way out under pressure with a minute-plus left for another perfect swish on the way to a career-high 62 points, and the Golden State Warriors beat Portland 137-122 on Sunday night to split the two-game set with the Trail Blazers. “I love it. I love everything about what this game offers, the competitiveness and the fire,” Curry said. “I never run from it. Just excited to be in that atmosphere where I get to play at the highest level and do what I do.” Curry delivered the highest-scoring game in the NBA this season early in his 12th campaign, finishing 18 for 31 and 8 of 16 on 3-pointers after beginning with a 21-point first quarter. He had his 10th career 30-point half to help the Warriors take a 66-54 at the break, then doubled his total exactly with his teammates telling him his count at every chance. “He was making every shot within like 10 seconds and we couldn’t even keep up,” rookie James Wiseman said. One small blemish in his brilliant night: Curry had his streak of free throws snapped at a franchise-record 80 in the first. The run dated to March 29, 2019, vs. Memphis. ""And then he just choked. It’s just incredible,"" cracked coach Steve Kerr, who jokingly offered the game ball to Wiseman before handing it over to the most deserving recipient. Against Portland, Curry made a career-high 18 of his most attempts yet at 19. No fear, the 6-foot-3 Curry even took it right at imposing 7-footer Jusuf Nurkic. ""He did a little bit of everything,"" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Curry boogied. He smacked the floor and screamed in delight. The 32-year-old two-time MVP closed his eyes and showed off a open-mouthed grin as brother-in-law and teammate Damion Lee poured water over his head — this kind of night was a long time coming after a broken left hand limited Curry to five games in the coronavirus-shortened 2019-20 season. “When you have something to be excited about you kind of feed off your own energy,” said Curry, who says the “great ones” learn how to block out the critics and embrace the expectations. “He came out looking like a man on a mission,” Draymond Green said. Damian Lillard scored 32 points for Portland, and CJ McCollum added 28. McCollum shot 2 for 8 from deep after his 25 3-pointers over the initial five games left him and Curry as the only players to ever do so. After Portland’s 25-point win Friday night, the Warriors were embarrassed and determined to be more aggressive and defend better after the Blazers came out firing to finish 20 of 43 from deep — and they looked more energetic on the defensive end. Portland shot 14 of 43 on 3s Sunday. Curry did it all on the other end. When he sat down for good in the waning seconds and received hugs from teammates, the piped in crowd noise seemed extra loud in an arena devoid of real fans. “It's just a privilege to coach him, it really is,” Kerr said. “Sheeeesh (at)StephenCurry30!!” injured Splash Brother Klay Thompson posted on Twitter with a fire emoji. “Welcome to the club big bro #62.” Green had eight assists and scored one point playing his second game of the season with his minutes increased from just below 18 to 28. He was sidelined the first four games by a right foot injury after being delayed starting training camp because he had the coronavirus. WILT'S 60-POINTERS Wilt Chamberlain had 27 60-point performances for the Warriors franchise, the only one in team history with more than one. Thompson scored 60 on Dec. 5, 2016, against Indiana. LILLARD VS. WARRIORS Lillard, who became just the second Portland player joining Hall of Famer Clyde Drexler to reach 15,000 points Friday night, is at his best against the Warriors. Lillard has scored at least 29 points in seven straight games against the Warriors and has made at least five 3-pointers in six of those games. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: F Rodney Hood didn't play after he strained his left quadriceps Friday night and played just five minutes. ... McCollum had five assists, nine rebounds and two steals. Warriors: Curry's previous career high was 54 points on Feb. 27, 2013, at New York's Madison Square Garden. ... Curry scored 20 or more in a quarter for the 27th time in his career. ... Golden State went 13 for 34 from deep after making just 7 of 35 from 3-point range Friday. ... Andrew Wiggins has scored in double figures every game so far.","401267252"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Free of the minutes’ restriction that had been placed on him early this season as he recovered from a hamstring injury, Orlando forward Aaron Gordon made the most of his extra time on the floor. Gordon broke out of a shooting slump Monday night, hitting six of nine 3-pointers on the way to a season-high 24 points as the Magic beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 103-83. Orlando snapped a two-game losing streak that had followed four straight victories to open the season. The Magic made a season-high 15 3-pointers, easily surpassing their previous season high of 11. Orlando entered the game 30th in the NBA in 3-point makes per game with nine. Gordon entered having made just three of 20 3-point attempts. He tied a career best with the six made 3s midway through the third quarter. Gordon scored 13 points in the third as the Magic broke open a close game. He also grabbed a season-best 11 rebounds in 28 minutes. “They bumped me up a little bit and I think I’m around 28 or 30 minutes now, and I want to be on the floor as much as I possibly can,” said Gordon, who is still nursing a hamstring injury from late last season. “I don’t want to be limited in any way. I just want to go out there and be free and play in the game’s flow.” Up two points at the break, Orlando outscored Cleveland 38-18 in the third period, pushing its lead to 89-67. The Magic made six of 10 shots from beyond the arc in the third period and posted their second-highest scoring quarter of the season. “We were better in the second half, but they’re hard to play against,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said of Cleveland’s zone defenses. “They switch things up, which takes away your rhythm. In the second half, we did a better job of taking care of the ball and Aaron Gordon was great.” Nikola Vucevic scored 23 points and grabbed eight rebounds, while Terrence Ross chipped in 15 points off the bench. Khem Birch added 12 points and 12 rebounds, while rookie guard Cole Anthony added nine points, five rebounds and four assists. Cleveland lost its fifth straight to Orlando, a streak that dates to 2019. The Cavaliers are 1/3 since starting the season 3-0. Cleveland guard Collin Sexton scored 24 points and tied LeBron James’ franchise record for consecutive games with at least 20 points to open a season. Sexton, who came into Monday 10th in the NBA in scoring at 26 points per game, has scored at least 20 points in all seven games. James scored at least 20 in seven straight to open the 2004-05 season. Cedi Osman scored 13 of his 18 points in the first half and added seven rebounds and seven assists. Andre Drummond had 10 points and 14 rebounds for his seventh straight double-double. TIP INS Cavaliers: Already without starters Kevin Love (calf strain), Darius Garland (shoulder strain) and Isaac Okoro (foot sprain), Cleveland lost guard Dante Exum to a left leg injury just 47 seconds in. Cleveland is already down seven players. “It is what it is and we’ve just got to figure it out,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We are down bodies and we talked about adversity a few games back and this is the epitome of it. We’ve just got to figure it out.” Magic: Magic coach Steve Clifford chatted with Washington Football Team head coach Ron Rivera on Monday morning to congratulate him on getting Washington to the NFL playoffs. Clifford and Rivera are close friends from their time together in Charlotte — the former with the Hornets and the latter while coaching the Panthers. “We communicated this morning and we have a good friendship,” Clifford said. “He’s a great coach and a tremendous human being. They’ve had a phenomenal season after a tough start. His teams always get better and better.’’","401267253"
"Ben Simmons gets the ball and does a behind-the-back dribble and a behind-the-back assist to Joel Embiid for a smooth finish. (0:17) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid wore a sweatshirt with “The Process” emblazoned on the front, his nickname that’s a nod to the path the 76ers took from a forlorn franchise to one that has the best record in the NBA. And just maybe, the best player, too. Embiid had 14 points and 11 rebounds, Tobias Harris scored 22 points and Philadelphia beat the Charlotte Hornets 118-101 on Monday night for their fourth straight win. “The main thing we have is Joel,” coach Doc Rivers said. “Joel sets the table for us.” The Sixers swept the two-game set necessitated on the schedule this season because of the pandemic and beat the Hornets for the 13th straight time. Philadelphia has not lost to Charlotte since Nov. 2, 2016. Embiid has been the biggest reason the Sixers are off to a 6-1 start in Rivers’ first season. Perhaps motivated by the birth of his son, reinvigorated under a new coaching staff or both, the 26-year-old has seemingly harnessed his talent and developed into a workload-heavy force on both sides off the ball. Gone are the days when Embiid’s minutes were limited because of injuries — Sixers fans still cringe at “load management” — and he needed to sit out just one game of a back-to-back set to rest up. Embiid entered Monday night averaging 33.4 minutes (and 25.0 points), the most on the Sixers. “He can handle it,” Rivers said. “I think he played the other night almost 37, I didn’t like that, but that’s going to happen. You go through the year and it evens out, that 34, 33. I don’t really have a minutes barometer, I just know where I’d like to keep it.” Embiid added a personal chef, nutritionist, physical therapist and massage therapist — making $29.5 million this season, he can afford the staff — to help turn those flashes of greatness into a sustained MVP campaign. “Everything I’ve been doing, I guess has been working,” Embiid said. “I’m glad to have the support I put in place. I’ve got to keep on doing it. We’ve got to keep on doing it.' Want rim protection? Embiid can do it. Gordon Hayward learned on a drive late in the third when he saw Embiid’s outstretched arm and tossed a wild shot high above the rectangle. Embiid grabbed one of his 10 defensive boards. Also in the third, Embiid ran straight into a double team out on the wing. He didn’t force his way into making a play that wasn’t there — he kicked it to Seth Curry for a wide open 3 and a 61-45 lead. “Any time they come from any angle, we’re putting guys in spots where Joel can see them and make easy decisions,” Rivers said. “All great players are going to get trapped. I have this attitude, if you trap us, we will score. You can feel the guys believing it.” Embiid even hit a little fadeaway in the third as the Sixers turned this one into a rout and he got his rest at just 25 minutes Ben Simmons was steady with 12 points and 10 rebounds, and Danny Green hit three 3s for 13 points. Hayward had 18 points and struggling Devonte’ Graham added 15 for the Hornets, who also lost Saturday in Philly 127-112. “We couldn’t score tonight,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “We couldn’t find the bucket and it bled over into our transition defense. Until we figure out the offense and find guys that can score and put the ball in the hole, we’re going to have to play defense consistently.” TIP-INS Hornets: C Cody Zeller still hasn’t been cleared to use his left hand in shooting drills after breaking his ring finger in the season opener. The Hornets hope Zeller can return in early February. 76ers: Harris was named Eastern Conference player of the week, averaging 23.3 points, 9.7 rebounds and 4.0 assists over three games. ... Team owner Josh Harris sat courtside and chatted with decision makers Daryl Morey and Elton Brand. FINE MESS The NBA adopted a tougher policy regarding masks on Monday. Rivers, who frequently pulled his down to communicate with players and officials, said he was fined $10,000 by the league this season for violating policy.","401267254"
"Julius Randle puts up 28 points, 17 rebounds and 9 assists as the Knicks come from behind to defeat the Hawks. (2:01) ATLANTA -- — Julius Randle scored 28 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, Austin Rivers hit a huge 3-pointer and the New York Knicks kept up their strong start with a 113-108 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night. The Knicks capped a four-game road trip with their third win, improving to 4-3 under first-year coach Tom Thibodeau. This is New York's best record after seven games since a 6-1 start for the 2012-13 team, which was also the last Knicks squad to finish with a winning record. “We didn't play great, but we found a way to win,” Thibodeau said. “I love the fight in our team.” The Hawks took their second straight home loss after winning four of their first five, squandering a 15-point lead late in the third quarter. Atlanta's three losses have been by a total of 14 points. “I feel like we've lost three games we shouldn't have lost,” John Collins said. De'Andre Hunter brought Atlanta to 107-106 on a 3-pointer with 1:40 remaining, but Rivers answered with a trey of his own to give the Knicks some breathing room. Randle sealed it with a put-back, tipping the ball in after Rivers missed on a drive with 46.1 seconds to go. “Julius had a monster game,” Thibodeau said. RJ Barrett  wasn't bad, either, contributing 26 points and 11 rebounds. And rookie Immanuel Quickley came up big down the stretch. The rookie guard, who had 16 points, put New York ahead to stay on a pair of free throws that made it 103-101. But his biggest play came with the shot clock running down, when he got off a wild 3-pointer that had no chance but drew a foul from Trae Young. Quickley made all three free throws with 2:34 remaining, pushing the Knicks ahead 106-101. “It's become a big part of the NBA to get to the foul line,” Quickley said. “That foul I drew on him was just from watching a lot of great players.” Young had 31 points and 14 assists for the Hawks. Hunter chipped in with 23 points. New York raced to an early double-digit lead, forcing the Hawks to call a timeout after Barrett's dunk off a pass from Elfrid Payton gave the Knicks a 24-14 edge. Atlanta finally found its offensive rhythm late in the first quarter and led 58-54 at halftime. The Hawks stretched the lead to 82-67 on Hunter's lay-in with 4:47 remaining in the third, but they couldn't put New York away. The Knicks closed the period on a 17-6 run. ROAD WARRIORS The Knicks have played five of their first seven games on the road. While not exactly a favorable schedule, Thibodeau said the time away from home has helped to build team chemistry. “It's almost like going away to training camp,” he said. “I take the positives out of that. With all the team meals and film sessions, sort of being around each other as much as we are, that's been very productive for us.” TIP INS Knicks: C Nerlens Noel was a late scratch with a sprained left ankle. ...

"Goran Dragic finds a driving Jimmy Butler on the baseline for an easy two-handed dunk. (0:20) MIAMI -- — Kelly Olynyk became the latest option in Miami’s starting lineup. He made a case to stick around. Olynyk made five 3-pointers on his way to 19 points, Bam Adebayo led all scorers with 20 on 9-for-10 shooting and the Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 118-90 on Monday night. Miami has played six games, alternating losses then wins in all six, and has used a different starting five every time. “I think the starting lineup is so overstated in so many ways,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “The more important thing is us building consistency to how we want to play."" Jimmy Butler scored 18 points for Miami, which used a 20-0 third quarter run to turn what was a four-point game into a runaway. Olynyk had 11 points in that spurt, including three 3-pointers, and the Heat stretched the lead to 35 — their biggest such cushion of the young season. “It's a different flow and a different game when you start,"" Olynyk said. “You can kind of let the game come to you. ... But nonetheless, you've got to play your role, whatever it is."" Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 18 points for the Thunder, who sat their starters in the fourth quarter. Darius Bazley scored 16 and Luguentz Dort scored 12 for Oklahoma City — which saw its chance slip completely away during that five-minute stretch of the third quarter. “We want to be a team that plays 48 minutes,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. The Thunder were just 13 of 48 from 3-point range. “The way our offense is set up, guys are going to get open looks,"" Bazley said. “A lot of the teams we play, they're like packed into a shell ... guys are set up to get good looks, especially when you're playing off the ball."" The Heat shot 57%; the Thunder shot 37%. Duncan Robinson scored 12 points for the Heat, all of them coming from 3-point range. Adebayo became the fourth player to have multiple games shooting 9-for-10 or better in Heat history, joining Hassan Whiteside (five times), Alonzo Mourning (four) and Udonis Haslem (three). Adebayo also went 9 for 10 on Jan. 5, 2020 against Portland. TIP-INS Thunder: Rookie Aleksej Pokusevski (concussion protocol) missed the game. ... Oklahoma City was down 63-49 at the half, its biggest deficit at the break so far this season. ... The Thunder went 0 for 10 from the field during Miami’s 20-0 run, seven of those misses from 3-point range. Heat: Butler missed all six of his shots in Dallas on Friday, so the Heat got him a layup on the first possession of the game Monday. ... The Heat debuted their latest “Vice” court and uniform. ... Miami has played six games; it has led by at least 20 in two and trailed by at least 20 in two others. REF HURT Crew chief Kane Fitzgerald left with 3:50 remaining in the first quarter with a left leg injury, possibly to his hamstring. That left two officials to finish the game, referee Aaron Smith and umpire Brandon Schwab — a non-staff official. RARE WIN Miami got a home win over the Thunder for the first time since Dec. 3, 2015. The Thunder didn’t come to Miami in 2017 or 2020; the 2017 quirk was just based on the way the schedules fell, and last season’s “home” game for the Heat was played inside the bubble at Walt Disney World.","401267256"
"Jayson Tatum leads all scorers with 40 points as the Celtics defeat the Raptors 126-114. (1:39) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Jayson Tatum scored 40 points and the Boston Celtics rolled to a 126-114 win over the Toronto Raptors on Monday night. Playing without three of their top guards, the Celtics shook off a slow start to lead by as many as 26 in the second half. They shot 48.8% overall. Tatum turned the game around with 21 points in the second quarter. He hit five 3-pointers on the night and converted all 13 free throws, finishing one point short of his career high set against New Orleans last January. “Disappointed? No,” Tatum shrugged. “I’m going to get there soon enough.” Rookie guard Payton Pritchard had 23 points and eight assists in 32 minutes for the Celtics (5-3), and Jaylen Brown scored 19. Robert Williams III came off the bench to contribute 11 points and 15 rebounds. “Tatum was tremendous tonight but we had a lot of good performances, playing on a back-to-back with no excuses,” Boston coach Brad Stevens said. “We had a lot of guys out.” Playing in front of fans for the first time in 10 months was a refreshing change for Tatum. A maximum-allowed crowd of 3,740 attended the game in 19,000-seat Amalie Arena. “It felt great,” he said. “I missed playing in front of people. There were a lot of Boston people here. It felt different with people in the stands, but I enjoyed it.” Fred VanVleet led the Raptors (1-5) with 35 points and eight rebounds. VanVleet scored 14 in the first quarter and Toronto made seven of its first nine 3s to lead 28-15 through the first eight minutes. But the Raptors missed their next 13 tries from 3-point territory, and by the time VanVleet hit one with 7:24 left in the third quarter, they were down by 15. Tatum took over late in the first half, scoring 13 points during an 18-2 Boston run. He finished the half with four straight free throws to put the Celtics up 61-46. They stretched the lead to 23 in the third quarter, and when Tatum went to the bench with five fouls with 9:52 left in the game, Boston led 109-83. The Raptors, who have held double-digit leads in every game this season, shot 40% overall and finished 13 for 37 from behind the arc. TIP-INS Celtics: Injuries to Marcus Smart (sprained right thumb) and Jeff Teague (sprained left ankle) depleted the backcourt. Kemba Walker is still recovering from a knee injury. ... Tremont Waters got his second NBA start at point guard. ... Boston had a 56-37 advantage in rebounds. Raptors: VanVleet tied C.J. Miles' franchise record of 38 consecutive games with a 3-pointer. ... Raptors coach Nick Nurse said 6-foot-6 Stanley Johnson will get more minutes because Toronto's smallish guards have been getting burned on defense. “I can't keep putting out another small guard,” Nurse said. “Defense is mostly what we need.” ... The Raptors entered as the worst shooting team (41.4%) in the NBA. NO HOME TEAM TO VISIT The irony of playing on the road against a team playing 1,300 miles from its real home was not lost on Stevens, who didn’t see an advantage nor a disadvantage to playing in Tampa. “It is pretty interesting that the first time we’re going to play in front of fans is down here in Florida,” he said.","401267257"
"Luka Doncic tallies 33 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists as Dallas beats Houston 113-100. (2:05) HOUSTON -- — Luka Doncic had 33 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists, and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 30 off the bench as the Dallas Mavericks used a big fourth quarter run to pull away in a 113-100 win over the Houston Rockets on Monday night. Dallas was on top by 3 with about seven minutes remaining before using a 14-3 spurt, with seven points from Hardaway, to extend the lead to 106-92 with about 2½ minutes remaining. Houston couldn’t get anything going as the Mavericks took over. The Rockets missed five shots and had two turnovers in that span. Hardaway, who made 8 of 10 3-point attempts, added another 3-pointer down the stretch to put the game out of reach. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle changed his starting lineup to get more size against the Rockets and moved Willie Cauley-Stein, who is 7 feet tall, in for Hardaway for the first time this season. Carlisle heaped praise upon Hardaway for the way he played off the bench. “It was a really strong character performance by Tim,"" he said. “He was great at both ends of the floor... Tim Hardaway showed what class and professionalism is in responding to a lineup change."" Hardaway didn't feel like the move was that big of a deal. “You’ve got to be a pro,"" he said. “I’m here to help this team out any way I can. I just had to make sure I was ready when I got in the game to make an impact."" Christian Wood had 23 points to lead the Rockets and James Harden added 21. “We were way too stagnant, didn't move the ball enough to put pressure on them and make it hard on them,"" coach Stephen Silas said. Both Doncic and Harden were back after sitting out in their team’s last game with injuries. Doncic returned after missing Sunday’s loss to Chicago with a bruised quadriceps. Harden played after sitting out on Saturday against the Kings because of a sprained ankle. Carlisle was impressed that his team was able to slow Harden down and limit the Rockets to just 100 points. “Defensively is where we’re going to make our ground this year,"" he said. “That’s just how it’s going to be. We’ve got to build on this somehow."" Houston made just 11 of 40 3-pointers and Harden was 3 of 11 from long-range and 5 of 17 overall. “I'm really just disappointed in our offensive effort tonight because that's not the game that I envisioned us playing,"" Silas said. The Mavericks led by seven points to start the fourth before Houston opened the quarter with an 8-1 run to tie it with about 10 minutes remaining. Eric Gordon made three free throws to get things going and Sterling Brown had a 3 that tied it. Dallas had a 16-point lead after a three-point play by Doncic with about eight minutes left in the third quarter. The Rockets then scored the next 14 points to get within 72-70 four minutes later. Harden had a step back 3-pointer in that stretch and Jae’Sean Tate capped it with six straight points. Doncic struggled during that time, turning the ball over three times and receiving a technical foul. The Mavericks finally ended a scoring drought with a 3-pointer by Hardaway with less than three minutes left in the quarter. Another 3-pointer by Hardaway later in the third extended the lead to six points before Gordon hit a 3 for Houston. But Doncic scored the last four points of the quarter to put the Mavericks up 84-77 entering the fourth. DeMarcus Cousins was ejected after receiving two technical fouls in about three minutes in the second quarter. The first one came when he and Cauley-Stein both got one after jawing at each other after fighting for a rebound. Cousins was ejected when he yelled at an official after not getting a foul call after a layup with about nine minutes left in the first half. Silas was clearly unhappy with the call and stood inches away from a referee pointing and arguing about it for a couple of minutes before he was pushed away by Harden. TIP-INS Mavericks: James Johnson received a flagrant-1 foul after hitting Tate in the face on a foul in the third quarter. ... Cauley-Stein added 15 points with seven rebounds. Rockets: Danuel House missed the game with back spasms. ...

"Giannis Antetokounmpo gets rolling early in the game and never stop going, as he scores a season-high 43 points and the Bucks get a 125-115 win. (1:38) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 43 points and the Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Detroit Pistons 125-115 on Monday night to move above the .500 mark for the first time this season. The reigning two-time MVP scored 30 points by halftime, shot 17 of 24 from the floor overall and finished with nine rebounds. Antetokounmpo said he might have gotten a little more room to operate inside because the Bucks (4-3) have shot so well from 3-point range lately. Milwaukee made at least 20 3-pointers in three of its first six games, including 22 in a 126-96 blowout of Chicago on Friday. “They know that the previous game I’d been finding my teammates for a lot of 3s, finding the shooters,” Antetokounmpo said. ""Coming to this game, they probably were like, ‘Don’t let them pick us apart with our passing.’ That’s why there was a lot of space.” Antetokounmpo's presence helped the Bucks outscore the Pistons 62-42 in the paint, including a 40-14 edge in the first half. “Next game we've just got to make it harder for him,” said Detroit guard Derrick Rose, who scored 24 points off the bench to match Jerami Grant for the team lead. “Nobody was taking any charges tonight against him. We didn't make him think.” The Bucks (4-3) have won their last eight regular-season meetings with the Pistons, which represents the longest streak for either team in the history of the series. Detroit (1-6) played without two of its top three scorers in Blake Griffin and Josh Jackson. The Pistons rested Griffin to protect his surgically repaired left knee after he played 29 minutes a night earlier in a  122-120 loss to Boston. Jackson has a sprained right ankle. Milwaukee's Khris Middleton scored 19 points, Jrue Holiday had 15 and D.J. Augustin 11. Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis added 10 each. Sekou Doumbouya, Wayne Ellington and Svi Mykhailiuk scored 13 each for the Pistons. Milwaukee went ahead for good midway through the first quarter and led by as much as 18, though Detroit cut the margin to single digits in the fourth quarter. The Bucks led 118-110 with just over two minutes left when Doumbouya drove into the lane and had his shot blocked by Antetokounmpo. The star forward followed that up with a putback on the other end to give Milwaukee a 10-point edge with 1:39 remaining. Detroit never threatened again. “They just kept coming at us, coming at us,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “They made some big 3s, tough 3s, and that blocked shot and then the putback was big.” TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit coach Dwane Casey is optimistic Jackson will return for Wednesday’s game at Milwaukee. “If it was up to him, he’d probably be ready to go again tonight. But take our time, let it get fully healed and try not to cause any further damage,” Casey said. Bucks: Milwaukee didn’t have reserve guards Pat Connaughton or Sam Merrill available. Budenholzer said Connaughton strained his left groin in practice and Merrill sprained his left ankle while landing on a stanchion during Friday's game. Budenholzer didn’t have a timeline for when either player might return. HAYES HURT Pistons rookie guard Killian Hayes headed to the locker room early in the third quarter after he got hurt making a diving attempt to deflect a pass. Casey said Hayes would get an MRI on Tuesday. “They thought it was a hip flexor, but they weren't sure, so they're going to see,” Casey said.","401267259"
"Malcolm Brogdon hits the deciding shot with less than two seconds left in overtime as the Pacers defeat the Pelicans. (0:38) NEW ORLEANS -- — Malcolm Brogdon capped a 21-point, 11-assist performance by bouncing in a driving, one-handed floater with 1.7 seconds left in overtime, and the Indiana Pacers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 118-116 on Monday night. “It was pretty simple,” Brogdon said of the winning basket. “Coach (Nate Bjorkgren) trusts me with the ball. He wanted me to get it, get to my spot and make the last shot. I got to my spot and it dropped."" Victor Oladipo scored 25 points for Indiana, hitting a 29-foot 3-pointer and following that up with a steal from Lonzo Ball to spark a six-point comeback in the final 20 seconds of regulation. “We have a lot of guys who can step up and hit big shots and it’s huge for this team,"" Oladipo said. ""Our team did a good job of weathering the storms tonight.” After Oladipo's steal, Brogdon got the ball to Myles Turner, who made an open, game-tying 3 from straight away with 8.2 seconds left in regulation. “I’m very confident in everything I do. Obviously it was a big shot,"" Turner said. ""I’m always ready for moments like that and I let the game come to me. I say it all the time: ‘I work too hard on my shot not to trust it.’” Turner had 17 points and three blocks before he fouled out with a minute left in overtime. Domantas Sabonis had 19 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out with about four minutes left in regulation. “This team doesn’t quit,” Turner said. “It’s just a winner’s mentality, and that’ll carry you a long way.” Brandon Ingram scored 31 points and Zion Williamson added 24 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans, which led 104-94 with 3:46 left in regulation after Ingram's three-point play on a short pull-up as he was fouled by Sabonis. Pelicans guard Eric Bledsoe had 12 points and 11 rebounds for his second double-double in as many games. “I'm not discouraged,” Ingram said. “Anybody can win or lose on any given night. So, we believe in our guys. We're not discouraged. We're ready for the next test.” The Pelicans were still up by six with less than a half-minute to go when JJ Redick missed a 3-point attempt from the near the right sideline, setting up the dramatic sequence in which the Pacers tied it. “I screwed that up,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “All we had to do was get a timeout when we were struggling with the press and advance the ball up the floor and we probably end up winning the game. So that one's on me.” Ingram pulled up from 20 feet at the end of regulation, but was unable to connect, forcing overtime. Turner and Oladipo each scored five points in overtime before Brogdon's winner. TIP-INS Pacers: Made 19 3s on 45 attempts (42.2%). ... Doug McDermott scored 11 points. ... Oladipo had his fourth 20-point outing in six games. ... Turner committed his fifth foul with 8:36 left in the third quarter. ... Brogdon and T.J. McConnell each had three steals.

Williamson now has four double-doubles in seven games this season after registering two in 24 games as a rookie. ... The Pelicans went 9 of 27 from 3-point range. TURNOVER TROUBLE The Pelicans committed 18 turnovers, leading to 22 Pacers points. “We just got to get better with the ball. It's been a major problem,” said Van Gundy, who is in his first season as Pelicans coach but was also alluding to how the team played before he arrived. “We have some games where we take care of the ball and when we do we play well and we win and when we don't, we struggle. But a lot of that is just individual guys making better plays and being more solid with the ball. They were very physical tonight — a lot of grabbing and holding — an we've got to play a lot stronger.”","401267260"
"Draymond Green wildly jumps up and down to orchestrate the Warriors' offense. (0:24) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Stephen Curry followed up his career-high 62 points a night earlier with another 30 points, nine rebounds and eight assists to lead the suddenly clicking Golden State Warriors past the Sacramento Kings 137-106 on Monday. Curry had 23 points at halftime on 7-for-11 shooting, including 4 of 7 on 3-pointers — nine fewer than his total at the break the night before but impressive nonetheless on a winning back-to-back. He finished with five 3s. “It’s a statement to us that we’re getting better. That’s all you can ask for,” Curry said. With 92 points over the past two nights, Curry posted his third-highest point total in a two-game span, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He scored 97 combined on Feb. 25 and 27, 2016, and 93 on Feb. 24-25, ’16. After another stellar outing, Curry's sister, Sydel, chimed in — apparently at critics of No. 30, who peeled a wrap off his right quad muscle before the second half began and used a wrap on his lower back during breaks that coach Steve Kerr said is ""just maintenance."" “Now please shut up! Respectfully, proud lil sis,” she posted on Twitter. Kelly Oubre Jr. took some pressure off Curry on the perimeter by knocking down four 3-pointers on the way to 18 points. Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins dished out five assists apiece as the Warriors totaled an NBA season-high 41. Golden State jumped to a 19-7 lead and the Kings called a timeout after Curry's first 3 of the night at the 5:24 mark in the opening quarter. With Green back and healthy playing his third game this season, the Warriors again showed more effort and energy on the defensive end as they did Sunday to split a two-game home set against Portland. “That's got to be the identity of this group,” Green said. “As we continue to figure each other out offensively, figure out where shots are coming from, the one thing we can be consistent on is our energy and effort on the defensive end."" Sacramento's Harrison Barnes had 18 points and nine rebounds against his former team, and De’Aaron Fox added 18 points and seven assists. The Kings, coached by former Warriors top assistant and Kerr close friend Luke Walton, dropped their third straight. They were coming off consecutive losses at Houston. “Well that was a frustrating one, clearly,” Walton said. “We looked like the team that played on a back-to-back instead of them.” STOPPING STEPH Walton texted Kerr late Sunday about Curry's career performance — and then got to work trying to figure out a way to slow down the two-time MVP who shoots from anywhere his heart desires. “Obviously, Luke is beloved around here; he's got a lot of friends. He said something about how much fun it was to watch Steph and then he had that moment of ... ‘Now I’ve got to guard him tomorrow night, I don't know what we're going to do.'” The 32-year-old Curry received Western Conference Player of the Week honors for the 15th time in his 12-year career. “Part of Steph’s magic is when he gets going he lights up the gym and he lights up the basketball world. Everybody’s watching and talking about him,"" Kerr said. ""Our guys were thrilled on the sidelines. It was so much fun to be part of and to witness it and when that happens there’s just a natural glow in the building.” NO LETDOWN Kerr wasn't sure what to expect from his young group after the high of Curry's special night and a quick turnaround. “We've got to back it up,” he said. “If we're going to be a good team, these are the games we have to win to build some momentum and continue to build our identity and figure out who we are, what kind of team we are.” TIP-INS Kings: F Jabari Parker missed the game for personal reasons. ... The Kings fell behind 30-14 while making only four of 14 shots to begin the game. ... Sacramento had won the last three in the series, and two in a row on the Warriors' home floor. ... Buddy Hield is at 73 straight games with at least one 3-pointer dating to Nov. 3, 2019, the NBA's longest active such streak.

"Kyrie Irving goes behind the back to set up Jarrett Allen's one-hand dunk. (0:30) NEW YORK -- — Kyrie Irving scored 20 of his 29 points in the first half to lead the undermanned Brooklyn Nets to a 130-96 win over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night. Brooklyn, which entered the game having lost two straight and four of five, never trailed. The Nets led 35-14 after the first quarter and 63-44 at halftime. Brooklyn’s 19-point halftime lead was its biggest in about 10 months. In the Nets’ 139-120 win over San Antonio on Mar. 6, 2020, they had a 21-point (75-54) halftime lead. Irving was a prime factor in the Nets’ first-half attack, scoring 18 points in the first quarter and 20 by halftime. Irving’s 18 first-quarter points were the third-most scored by an player on any team in an opening quarter this season. His 20 first-half points marked the fifth time this season he had that many in an opening half. “(Irving is) going to score,” Bruce Brown said. “He was hot. ... Kyrie just went crazy today.” As brilliant as he was individually, Irving had help from Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert. Allen recorded his third double-double of the season with 19 points and 18 rebounds. Allen credited a change of his pregame meal from pasta with pesto sauce to pasta with alfredo sauce for his season high in points and rebounds. “I think that was the thing that turned my game on tonight,” Allen said with a grin. LeVert came off the bench to score 24 points off the bench. Joe Harris chipped in with 10 points. “It’s really satisfying,” LeVert said. The Nets did not let up in the second half as they cruised to their fourth win in eight games this season. A sequence in the final 1:34 of the third quarter all but put the game away. It began with an Allen alley-oop dunk off a feed by LeVert, followed by a jumper by LeVert, a breakaway layup for the Nets’ sixth man, and Brooklyn’s young big man buzzer-beating putback. In that stretch, Brooklyn extended its lead from 92-70 to 98-73. Donovan Mitchell led Utah (4-3) with game-high 31 points. Jordan Clarkson added 12, and Rudy Gobert and Royce O’Neale had 10 each for the Jazz, whose two-game winning steak was snapped. “We didn’t come out ready for their pressure,” Mitchell said. “We just didn’t do much right. ... We have to figure out who we want to be.” TIP-INS: NETS: Brooklyn came into the game short-handed, missing Spencer Dinwiddie (right knee anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery) and Kevin Durant (quarantining after coming into contact with a positive COVID-19 test). Tuesday night’s game was the first of four for Brooklyn this week — the Nets host Philadelphia on Thursday and Oklahoma City on Sunday, and travel to Memphis on Friday. Before the game, first-year coach Steve Nash said “the length of the quarantine is kind of a moving target.” Nash did add that he didn’t think Durant would be able to participate in “on-court activity” this week. Durant, who was replaced in the starting lineup by Taurean Prince, is averaging 28.2 points, which leads the Nets and ranks fifth in the NBA. He is also averaging seven rebounds and 4.8 assists, and had played in six of Brooklyn’s first seven games prior to Tuesday night after missing all of 2019-20 recuperating from a ruptured right Achilles tendon. JAZZ: In light of a report from ESPN which said seven seven members of the Los Angeles Clippers’ support staff are quarantining due to a positive COVID-19 test following the Jazz’ 106-100 win on New Year’s Day, Utah coach Quin Snyder expects outbreaks of the virus will challenge all of the league’s teams. “We’ve gone through similar things and I’m sure everybody will at some point this this season,” Snyder said. “Everybody’s in the same boat.”","401267262"
"LeBron James drives around a defender and then bounces a pass to Anthony Davis for a two-handed dunk. (0:18) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Anthony Davis and LeBron James each scored 26 points, rallying the Los Angeles Lakers to a 94-92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. James added 11 rebounds and seven assists, and Dennis Schroder finished with 12 points for Los Angeles. “That’s why he’s great,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said of James taking over the game with Davis. “He finds a way to make those superhero-type of plays. Our focus is on making sure we don’t need those superhero-type of plays to close games out.” Jonas Valanciunas, Dillon Brooks and Gorgui Dieng led Memphis with 13 points apiece, and Brandon Clarke added 12 points. Valanciunas finished with 11 rebounds. On a poor shooting night for both teams, the Lakers were able to depend on James and Davis down the stretch. Los Angeles trailed 79-77 with five minutes left when the two big men combined for a 9-2 run and an 86-81 lead. The final basket came on a dunk by Davis on an assist from James. James and Davis combined for a run of 15 points late in the fourth to take the lead to 92-83 with 31.1 seconds left. “I have a lot of confidence in LeBron James in the fourth quarter,” Vogel said. ""I don’t really know any other way to say that. I trust him.” Memphis was able to put together some late baskets to make it close, but couldn’t overtake the Lakers, who won their fourth straight. “Obviously in a hard fought game like that, you hope to come out with a victory,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “But our guys were amazing. “Effort again. But the attention to detail, the execution. These guys, for 48 minutes, were unbelievable. Came up a little short in the end.” TIP-INS Lakers: Entered the game as the only NBA team ranked in the top 5 in offensive efficiency (2nd/115.7) and defensive efficiency (4th/104.5). … Both Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (left ankle sprain) and Alex Caruso (health and safety protocol) again sat out. Both appeared headed for return in the coming games, according to Vogel. Grizzlies: Valanciunas recorded his seventh straight double-double. … Rookie Desmond Bane saw his streak of games with multiple 3-pointers end at six. That marked the second-longest streak to start an NBA career behind Chicago’s Lauri Markkanen’s 10 straight to open the 2017-18 season. … Swingman John Konchar was the latest Memphis player to miss a game after suffering a left ankle sprain. SOCIAL JUSTICE: Several Laker players referenced news earlier in the day regarding no charges filed against the Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer who shot Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed. “The flame is already lit,” guard Wesley Matthews said. “It just has to continue to keep burning, but burn the right way. Not where anything can be sidetracked.” Matthews later added: “It really is disheartening. But leaders have to be leaders and everybody has to take ownership for their own community.” LIKE ORLANDO: The NBA season has led to creative scheduling. For example, the Lakers ended a road trip where they played consecutive games in San Antonio and then Memphis. And with very little outside interaction in hopes of avoiding the coronavirus. “It’s almost like we were in the bubble, except we’re not in the bubble,” Vogel said. “You kind of go to work, go back to the hotel and not too much else.”","401267263"
"Jared Vanderbilt gives a no-look pass to Anthony Edwards, who barely misses hitting his head on the backboard as he slams it down. (0:22) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic showed his cool down the stretch after losing it earlier in the game. Jokic scored 13 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter and the Denver Nuggets scrambled late to beat Minnesota 123-116 on Tuesday night for their 10th straight win over the Timberwolves. Denver's big man shook off two second-quarter technical fouls — one for hanging on the rim and another for jawing at an official — to lead the Nuggets to the comeback victory. He also had 15 rebounds. “That’s part of basketball,” Jokic said of the calls. “You just forget it.” And remember this: Teammate Will Barton's pregame advice. “I tell him before every game, ‘Just go out there and win MVP. You could be the best player in the world if you want to,’” recounted Barton, who scored 20 points. ""When he’s aggressive, it’s over with.” JaMychal Green had 17 points off the bench for the Nuggets, who squandered an 18-point lead in the first half and fell behind by eight in the third quarter. They went on a 15-0 run in the fourth to take control. Denver held Minnesota scoreless for more than five minutes during the decisive stretch. D’Angelo Russell scored 33 points and Juancho Hernangomez added 25 against his former team. It was the fifth straight loss for the Timberwolves. “We didn't play with a flow,” Hernangomez said of the fourth-quarter struggles. “We need that. We played really good the first three quarters. We have to watch film and figure it out for the next game.” This game appeared headed toward a blowout when Denver opened a 49-31 lead with 7:30 remaining in the first half. But the Timberwolves caught fire behind the shooting of Hernangomez, who was acquired along with Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt in a deal with Denver last February. It was the second time in three days the teams faced each other. Denver beat the Timberwolves 124-109 in Minnesota on Sunday behind Jokic’s triple-double. Jokic entered this one leading the NBA in assists (12.8 per game) — and turnovers (5.3). The miscues come with the territory when he touches the ball so much, coach Michael Malone conceded. Although, Malone wants to see Jokic’s assist-to-turnover ratio around 3-to-1. “He understands he has to be better and I’m sure that he will,” Malone said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota rookie Anthony Edwards scored 15 points. ... Beasley had 15 and Vanderbilt 11. Nuggets: F Michael Porter Jr. missed a third straight game due to the league’s health and safety protocols involving COVID-19. ... The Nuggets won a coach's challenge late in the third. P.J. Dozier's foul on a 3-point attempt was overturned. ... Denver attempted 45 free throws, its most in a non-overtime game since Jan. 3, 2016. FLASHBACK TO ’18 The last time Minnesota beat Denver was Game No. 82 to close out the 2018 season. That was a winner-goes-to-the-playoffs situation, with the Timberwolves prevailing in overtime. “I don’t think that game resonates at all with our guys anymore,” Malone said. Since then, Denver has captured back-to-back division titles. “Even though we lost the game in our third year with a chance to go to the playoffs, there was no need to panic, there was no need to make wholesale changes,” Malone explained. “Everybody wants the get-rich-quick scheme. Sometimes you have to build it, let it grow and let it come together like we’ve done.” TOWNS UPDATE Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said center Karl-Anthony Towns has “progressed steadily” from a dislocated left wrist, but wouldn't be available against Denver or again Thursday at Portland. “He’s doing a little bit more where he can kind of handle a basketball on the court,” Saunders explained. “Once we get back to Minnesota, we’ll evaluate more, and get him around the team and see where he is at that point.”","401267264"
"Patrick Beverley shoves Patty Mills in the back with two hands while fighting for a rebound. (0:33) LOS ANGELES -- — Patty Mills hit a career-high eight 3-pointers and scored 27 points off the bench, and the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 116-113 on Tuesday night to snap a four-game skid. Dejounte Murray added 21 points, Rudy Gay had 16 points, LaMarcus Aldridge 14 points and Keldon Johnson grabbed a career-high 11 rebounds for the Spurs. They led by 24 in the first quarter and withstood an onslaught by Kawhi Leonard in the third before nearly blowing their lead in the fourth. The Spurs tied a franchise record with 20 3-pointers. “It was a mentality we came out with on the defensive end. It has nothing to do with shooting the ball,” Mills said. “Playing team defense like that fuels the fire and confidence for everyone to be able to play with the same sort of energy.” Leonard scored a game-high 30 points and had 10 assists. He had 11 points in the third, when Patrick Beverley made three 3-pointers, and the Clippers closed within one. Nicolas Batum had 21 points and nine rebounds, and Beverley finished with 20 points. “He was pushing the pace in transition, getting to the paint and throwing it out to shooters,” Leonard said of Beverley. “He was very active on defense.” The Clippers were without Paul George, who tweaked his ankle in Sunday’s win over Phoenix. They sorely missed his averages of 25.1 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.1 assists per game. The Spurs opened the fourth with a 12-2 run that restored their lead to double digits. Mills hit three 3-pointers in a row to extend San Antonio's lead to 111-96. But the Clippers kept clawing. They closed the game on a 17-5 run despite Leonard scoring just two points in the fourth quarter, when his shot from the right side with five seconds left missed under defensive pressure from DeMar DeRozan. “That’s what we wanted,” Spurs rookie guard Devin Vassell said. “We knew they couldn't get an open 3 off.” The Clippers scored 40 points in the third to pull to 85-84. Leonard had 11 points and Beverley hit three 3-pointers to help them rally from 19 down at halftime. The Spurs opened the second quarter with an 18-3 run that pushed their lead to 54-30. Five players scored, led by Murray with five points. Leonard scored the Clippers' final 11 points. TIP-INS Spurs: They have the franchise's youngest roster since Gregg Popovich became coach in 1996, with an average age of 25.5 years.

"Derrick Jones Jr. continues to amaze with his flashy dunks as he takes off and flies for the one-handed jam in the third quarter. (0:23) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Zach LaVine was blunt: The Chicago Bulls of the recent past wouldn't have come back to beat the Trail Blazers like this. The short-handed Bulls rebounded from a 20-point first-half deficit to down Portland 111-108 on Tuesday night. Coby White had 21 points and a career-high 10 rebounds, while Otto Porter Jr. added 19 points and 13 rebounds. The Bulls had seven players in double figures. “We didn't stop playing,” said LaVine, who finished with 18 points and nine assists. “After the first quarter, they came out hitting a lot of tough shots. It's not like we were playing bad, it just happens in a game. We got to a timeout and we just said we're going to keep playing regardless, and we got back into it."" Asked point-blank if it was a game last season's Bulls would have won, LaVine emphatically said “No.” CJ McCollum led the Blazers with 26 points, including six 3-pointers. Damian Lillard had 24 points and nine assists. The Blazers led by as many as 20 points early in the game, but the Bulls chipped away at the lead, tying it in the fourth quarter at 91 on Porter's 3-pointer. Garrett Temple's 3 gave the Bulls a 96-94 lead with 6:36 left. Portland went up 100-98 lead on Carmelo Anthony's 3-pointer before Chicago rookie Patrick Williams' floater tied it again with 4:12 to go. Porter's pull-up jumper made it 104-100 with just over three minutes left. Lillard was fouled on a 3-point attempt and made all his free throws, pulling Portland within 106-103. He added two free throws with 30.8 seconds left to narrow the gap further. LaVine's step-back 3-pointer appeared to be the winner for Chicago — until Lillard made a 3 to get the Blazers within a point again with 5.7 seconds to go. White made a pair of free throws in the final moments and Portland fell short. “I think the guys just had a real good disposition when we were down about what we had to do to get back in the game,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. The Blazers (3-4) were coming off a 137-122 loss to Golden State on Sunday. Golden State's Stephen Curry scored a career-high 62 points against Portland. “Make no mistake. We didn't shoot the ball in the fourth quarter,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""We lost this in the second half. Chicago out played us, they played harder than us. We let down our guard and gave up 66 points in the second half after having an outstanding first half defensively.” After going 0-3 to start the season, the Bulls have improved with wins in four of their last five games, including a 118-108 victory over the Mavericks, paced by LaVine's 39 points. The Bulls were without Lauri Markkanen, Ryan Arcidiacono, Chandler Hutchinson and Tomas Satoransky for the fourth straight game because of the league's COVID-19 protocols. Hutchinson and Satoransky tested positive and are isolating. The Blazers made four straight 3-pointers to open the game and went on a 14-0 run to close out the first quarter with a 39-21 lead. Gary Trent Jr.'s shot from distance gave Portland a 47-27 lead. The Bulls closed the gap with a 13-0 run capped by Porter's 3-pointer to get within 47-40. The Blazers went into halftime with a 54-45 lead. “When that adversity hits and there are momentum swings, it’s no reason to hang your head and get down,"" Donovan said. ""It’s part of the game, and you've gotta be able to compete through those moments. I thought our guys did a good job of competing and staying the course.” TIP INS Bulls: It was the first of a four-game road trip for the Bulls. ...

"Kendrick Perkins says Max Kellerman is ready to put a ring on his take that the 76ers should hold off on trading for James Harden. (1:44) INDIANAPOLIS -- — The Indiana Pacers needed Malcolm Brogdon to play a bigger role when T.J. Warren injured his foot. Brogdon has thrived in it. He scored 35 points, his second career high in three games, and made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:22 left to lead the Indiana Pacers past the Houston Rockets 114-107 on Wednesday night. “I think he’s comfortable with the offense, comfortable with coach (Nate Bjorkgren), he knows where to get his shots and when to be aggressive,” two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo said. “He’s playing great for us right now. We’re going to need him to do that all year.” Brogdon has logged more than 40 minutes in each of the past three games, and on Wednesday he even played the leading role on defense against the usually high-scoring James Harden. Harden finished with 15 points, his second straight sub-20-point performance as the Pacers won their second straight and beat Houston at home for the first time since January 2017. “My team trusts me with the ball, my coaches trust me with the ball,” Brogdon said. “These shots were already made this summer, these shots were already made in preseason."" But the Pacers won this one with defense, too. After Harden scored on a late layup to make it 107-106, Brogdon answered with the go-ahead 3, Domantas Sabonis scored on a putback to extend the margin to four and Brogdon sealed the victory with two free throws with 29.9 seconds to go. Indiana scored the final eight points. Justin Holiday had a season-high 20 points for Indiana, while John Wall scored a season-best 28 points in his fourth game with the Rockets. Harden also had 12 assists for Houston — not enough to avoid a second straight loss. “They were really good at driving the ball into the paint and that was one of the things for us this game, was to protect the paint,"" coach Stephen Silas said. “They had 60 points in the paint, so that tells you how well we did. But the 8-0 run, we had a turnover in there. We’ve just got to be better.” TIP-INS Rockets: David Nwaba had a season-high 15 points. ... Houston was 8 of 30 on 3s and had 16 turnovers. ... Houston is 1-2 when Harden and Wall are in the lineup together. ... The Rockets are 1-4 when allowing 110 or more points and 0-3 on the road this season. ... F Christian Wood did not play. ... Houston has had at least two players score 20 or more points in all six games. Pacers: Holiday's first 3-pointer of the game late in the first quarter was his 133rd off the bench for Indiana. That broke a tie with Sam Perkins for No. 7 in the franchise's NBA history. Holiday finished with three 3s. ... Myles Turner had eight blocks, matching his career best for the second time this season. ... Sabonis had 22 points and 12 rebounds, his eighth straight double-double this season. ... Doug McDermott left in the second half with a sprained left ankle and did not return. He scored six points. HELPING HAND DeMarcus Cousins got off to a strong start, scoring nine points and grabbing 10 rebounds in the first half. The second half wasn't nearly as impressive. Cousins was shut down over the final two quarters, going 2 of 9 from the field and finishing with 14 points and four blocks. Silas appreciated the effort. “I thought he was great,"" Silas said. “He started the game off really good and really rebounded the ball well and attacked the rim.”","401267267"
"Markelle Fultz's knee gives out as he drives to the rim, sending him to the floor in excruciating pain. (0:28) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Former top overall draft pick Markelle Fultz suffered a season-ending tear of the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the first quarter of the Orlando Magic’s 105-94 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night. Fultz, who was off to the best start of his career, was driving to the basket less than five minutes into the game when he was cut off by Isaac Okoro and his left knee buckled without contact. The Orlando point guard writhed in pain on the floor for several minutes before he was helped into a wheelchair. The team confirmed after the game that Fultz tore his ACL. “It’s a huge blow for us,” said Magic center Nikola Vucevic, whose team also will be without standout forward Jonathan Isaac this season because of an ACL tear. “Unfortunately for (Fultz) this is really sad because for two years he had the injury with his shoulder, then last year he finally got to play and this year it was supposed to be a big year for him. He was ready and he started the season out awesome. This really sucks for a guy like him who has worked his way back. It’s hard to see and you feel for the guy.” Fultz signed a three-year, $50 million extension last month and was finally showing the promise that made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft as he led the Magic to a quick start this season. He came in averaging a career-best 14-3 points in seven games. Fultz was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers as part of their lengthy rebuild but struggled for years with a difficult-to-diagnose shoulder injury ultimately determined to be thoracic outlet syndrome, a nerve ailment that affected the feeling in his arm and hand. He was traded to the Magic in February 2019. Rookie Cole Anthony, who had eight points, four rebounds and three assists on Wednesday, will now be the starter at point guard for the Magic. Fellow rookie Jordan Bone will also see playing time with Michael Carter-Williams out with a sprained foot ligament. Terrence Ross scored 20 points and hit five 3-pointers to lead the Magic, who beat the Cavaliers for a second time in three nights. “This is part of the league. It happens, people get hurt,” Ross said. “We play a lot and go through a lot and people get hurt. We’ve still got to keep playing ball. We have a way to play and we can’t let the whole season fall or collapse because of a couple of injuries.” Dwayne Bacon added 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting and Nikola Vucevic chipped in 16 points, seven rebounds and six assists for an Orlando squad off to its best eight-game start since the 2017-18 season. Down by as much as 13 points early on, the Magic surged ahead by as much as 21 early in the fourth quarter. Collin Sexton scored 21 points for Cleveland, his eighth straight game with at least 20 points to start the season. That broke LeBron James’ franchise record from 2004-05. Sexton played through a left ankle sprain suffered in the first half. Orlando missed its first six 3-point tries but made 10 of 17 from beyond the arc in the second and third quarters. Cleveland was 4 of 26 from 3-point range. Andre Drummond had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Cavs, his eighth straight double-double. TIP-INS Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said he stopped his preparations for the game to watch supporters of President Donald Trump storm the U.S. Capitol. “It’s saddening and it’s disgusting, to be honest with you. Our democracy has been a beacon for hundreds of years of what the world ideologically should be, and people have looked up to us all over the world.

"Bradley Beal drops 60 points vs. 76ers to tie Gilbert Arenas for the Wizards' single-game scoring record. (2:45) PHILADELPHIA -- — Bradley Beal sank his free throw in the final seconds to reach a milestone, a Washington record-tying 60 points. Dominant again, Joel Embiid had already made it a moot point. Embiid scored 38 points and the NBA-leading Philadelphia 76ers overcame Beal's first career 60-point game in a 141-136 win over the Wizards on Wednesday night. The Sixers are an NBA-best 7-1 in coach Doc Rivers' first season in Philadelphia. “They pay me to take over the game, and they pay me to dominate,"" Embiid said. Beal scored 57 points through three quarters and seemed poised to not only smash the 60-point mark, but complete Washington's rally from 21 points down. Embiid snuffed that out in the fourth, scoring 11 points to just three for Beal. “I put it on myself to close it out,” Beal said. “I've got to be better.” Beal was stuffed on a layup and missed a 3-pointer inside the final minute, nearly coming up short of joining Golden State’s Stephen Curry as 60-point scorers this season. Curry scored a career-high 62 points on Sunday night. Beal, who once scored 53 and 55 points in consecutive games, sank a free throw with 4.4 seconds left to hit the mark. He went 20 of 25 from the floor, made 7 of 10 3-points and went 13 of 15 from the line to match former Wizard Gilbert Arenas for the franchise single-game mark. “There’s no reason anybody should drop 60 on us,” Embiid said. Beal was sensational from the start, going 11 of 16 (four 3-pointers) from the floor in the first half for 32 points and joined Michael Jordan (34 points in 2001) and Arenas (33 points in 2006 and 30 in 2007) as Wizards to score 30 in half over the last 20 years. He hit seven 3s and reached 57 points through three quarters, and that should have been enough to give the Wizards the lead. But Washington's defense was atrocious in the first half. They gave up 82 points and trailed by as many as 21 points, Beal outscoring the rest of the Wizards. “He can score a lot of points on any team on any given night, but he wants to lead us in victories,” coach Scott Brooks said. Arenas, who turned 39 on Wednesday, scored 60 points on Dec. 17, 2006. Beal failed to win again on a night on which he topped 50 points. “All my career highs have been losses,” he said. “I don’t give a damn.” Embiid again carried the Sixers after a rare slow start and continued his torrid early season run. He missed all six shots in the first quarter and scored one point. He then scored 14 in the second and helped the Sixers roll to a 19-point lead. Embiid tossed in a fadeaway and made the free throw to give the Sixers a 131-127 lead. His second three-point play in 90 seconds made it 134-131. He then buried a 3 to seal Philadelphia’s fifth straight win. Seth Curry hit six straight 3-pointers in the first half and finished with 28 points. Ben Simmons had 17 points and 12 assists. Tobias Harris scored 19. The Sixers made 18 of 29 3-pointers and shot 62% overall from the floor. Russell Westbrook played a dislocated finger on his right hand and scored 20 points for the Wizards. RIVERS SPEAKS Rivers used his voice to condemn the riots in Washington much in the same way he denounced racial injustice in the NBA bubble as teams grappled with how to deal with issues far more important than basketball. He was invited to speak at a Joe Biden rally after the President-elect used Rivers’ words in an October speech, calling for racial unity at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Rivers again decried the riotous mob Wednesday in Washington, though he cautioned, “democracy will prevail.” “I’ll say it because I don’t think a lot of people want to: Could you imagine today if those were all Black people storming the Capitol and what have happened,” Rivers asked. “That to me is a picture worth a thousand words for all of us to see. It’s something for us to reckon with, again, no police dogs turned on people, no billy clubs hitting people. People peacefully being escorted out of the Capitol. It shows you can disperse a crowd peacefully, I guess.” Rivers added: “As an older black male, I’ve seen police dogs being unleashed on people, and then you see today where there’s nothing, and so that’s an emotion that I have, right?” TIP-INS 76ers: The Sixers haven’t lost at home since Dec. 20, 2019. ...

"Gordon Hayward leads all scorers with 44 points as the Hornets defeat the Hawks 102-94. (1:32) ATLANTA -- — Gordon Hayward scored a career-high 44 points and the Charlotte Hornets recovered after trailing for the first time in the fourth quarter and beat the Atlanta Hawks 102-94 on Wednesday night. The Hornets led by double figures most of the game before Atlanta claimed its first lead, at 86-85, on John Collins' three-point play with 5:22 remaining. Hayward answered with a jumper and his own three-point play and the Hornets never trailed again. Hayward said it was a true career high — the most points he had scored at any level. “I never scored 40 in high school,” Hayward said before giving credit to his teammates. “People were finding me all night.” Hayward made 15 of 25 shots, including 4 of 9 from behind the arc. “I was proud of Gordy,” said Charlotte coach James Borrego. “He understood we needed pressure taken off our offense tonight, and he took the pressure.” Collins led Atlanta with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Kevin Huerter had 19 points. Trae Young, averaging 28.6 points, scored only seven points while making 2 of 9 shots from the field. De’Andre Hunter added 17 points. The Hawks entered the game fourth in the league in scoring, but with Young struggling they couldn't find their scoring touch against the Hornets. The Hawks have lost three consecutive games. “Tonight was nasty,” said Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce. “There’s no shaking that. I’m thankful our guys were able to get back and take the lead and show the resiliency we need in this league."" Pierce said he wasn't worried about his team. “Our guys, they’re high-confidence,"" Pierce said. ""They’re learning each other. They’re high-character guys.

YOUNG'S OFF NIGHT Young’s only points of the first half came on a drive midway through the second period. He wasn’t the only Atlanta player to struggle from the field. The Hawks’ 40 first-half points set a season low for any half. Young had seven turnovers and three assists. “I don’t know what the cause was,” Young said. “For me, personally, I had a lot of turnovers in that first half, kind of just losing the ball out of my hands trying to make passes, things like that.”","401267270"
"Goran Dragic ties the game with a 3-pointer, but Payton Pritchard comes through at the other end as he banks in the game-winner for the Celtics. (0:50) MIAMI -- — Rookie guard Payton Pritchard wasn't there last season when the Boston Celtics lost to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference finals. He helped Boston get a measure of revenge Wednesday. Pritchard's putback with two-tenths of a second left capped a wild finish, and the Celtics — who strongly considered not playing the game in response to the latest Jacob Blake decision and the scene at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday — beat the Heat 107-105 in the first matchup this season of last year's East finalists. “To be honest ... I didn't think we were playing,"" said Celtics coach Brad Stevens, who emerged from a pregame team meeting to call his wife about a half-hour before game time and tell her the same. “And then coaches left the room, players finished talking and chose to play."" Jayson Tatum scored 27 points and Jaylen Brown had 21 for the Celtics, who wasted an early 17-point lead and a 10-point lead in the final minute before winning. “Sports is often used as a way to lift people up and spread some joy,"" Brown said. Jimmy Butler had 26 points for Miami, which got 16 points from Duncan Robinson, 15 points from Bam Adebayo and 14 from Goran Dragic. The teams knelt for the national anthem in response to the decision earlier in the week to not charge the police officer who shot Blake last year — as well Wednesday’s developments at the Capitol, where a violent mob loyal to President Donald Trump delayed Congress from certifying the results of November’s election. “Tip your hat to all the pros in both locker rooms,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “It's legitimate that everybody does have a lot on their mind and heavy hearts, disappointment, discouragement, all of these different emotions."" The Celtics went on a late 13-0 run to go up 10 with 1:17 left — only to see the Heat score 10 points in 55 seconds to tie the game on a pair of 3-pointers by Robinson, one while getting fouled, and another from Dragic. “Obviously, there, the urgency is heightened,"" Robinson said. “It just shows how capable we are."" Marcus Smart missed a layup on Boston's last possession, but Pritchard swooped in for the rebound and gamewinner. Miami's last-ditch try was knocked away as time expired and the Heat have now alternated losses and wins in all seven games this season. “We've got to figure this out before it's too late,"" Adebayo said.

The Knicks trailed by 18 in the first half but outplayed the Jazz in the second and won for the fifth time in six games. “It just shows you our spirit and our growth,” Rivers said. “This is a young team, so for us to do that against a team like this, a top tier-caliber playoff team, that’s pretty impressive.” Rivers made four 3-pointers in the final 4:17. “When he gets going like that he’s hard to stop,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said, “and he’s got a lot of toughness to him. Mental toughness, physical toughness, the courage to take those shots, but we had a lot of guys step up in the second half and really fight.” Elfrid Payton scored 22 points for the Knicks (5-3), who have already won more times under Thibodeau than they did in their first 22 games last season under David Fizdale, who was fired when they were 4-18. Jordan Clarkson had 19 points and Donovan Mitchell added 18 for the Jazz, who were swept in a back-to-back set of games in New York. The Brooklyn Nets routed them 130-96 on Tuesday, but Mitchell said the Jazz will get things figured out. “At the end of the day, we’re going to do this,” he said. “It’s just a matter of when.” It appeared the Jazz would bounce back easily after building a big lead in the second quarter, but the Knicks outscored Utah 68-44 in the second half. It was tied at 96 with under five minutes to play before Rivers' surge. He scored five straight points before a basket by Mitchell, then nailed consecutive 3s to give New York a 107-98 lead with 2:22 to go. Mitchell scored again but Rivers answered with another 3 for a 10-point lead with 47 seconds remaining. Utah coach Quin Snyder said it was hard to have a normal preparation for Wednesday's game because of the difficulty concentrating on basketball while watching the violence in Washington. Yet, the Jazz appeared much more ready to play Wednesday than a night earlier, when they trailed 35-14 after one quarter. A 19-5 spurt pushed their lead to 34-20 and they were ahead by as much as 18 later in the period. But the Knicks outscored the Jazz 34-19 in the third. TIP-INS Jazz: Rudy Gobert had 14 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks. ...

Pistons rookie Saddiq Bey had 20 points and 10 rebounds while shooting 6 of 10 from 3-point range. Pistons coach Dwane Casey said his team hurt itself by starting slowly in the first and third quarters. “We didn't start the right way,” Casey said. “Subsequently, we had a 15-point loss.” Brook Lopez scored 17 points, Bobby Portis had 16, rookie Jordan Nwora provided 11 and Jrue Holiday added 10 for the Bucks. Wayne Ellington scored 12 and Derrick Rose had 10 for the Pistons. Rose left the game early with a bruised right knee. The game got a bit testy in the closing minutes with physical play that included Antetokounmpo falling to the floor after tangling with Detroit’s Isaiah Stewart. Antetokounmpo went to the Pistons’ bench after the game and exchanged words with Stewart before they were separated. MAKING A STATEMENT On the night after a  prosecutor decided not to file charges against a white police officer who shot a Black man in Wisconsin,  both the Bucks and Pistons offered their response  at the start of the game. After the Bucks won the opening tip, Antetokounmpo held the ball as players from both teams took a knee. After the ensuing inbounds pass, Detroit's Blake Griffin held the ball while players again took a knee. Budenholzer proposed doing something during the game — when it would be more visible — rather than during the national anthem. The Bucks said they held the ball for seven seconds to reflect the seven times Jacob Blake was shot. “We know that when the game starts, people are going to be paying attention,” Antetokounmpo said. “That was the right time to do it. It was a great idea by Bud.” Blake was left paralyzed after getting shot in the back by Kenosha police officer Rusten Sheskey on Aug. 23. The Bucks sat out a first-round playoff game  with the Orlando Magic last summer to protest that shooting. TIP-INS Pistons: Rookie guard Killian Hayes tore the labrum in his right hip during the third quarter of Monday’s game. The Pistons announced the severity of Hayes’ injury  Wednesday without offering a timetable for his potential return. Bucks: Milwaukee was 19 of 43 from 3-point range and just missed reaching 20 3-pointers in a game for the fourth time this season. Before this year, the Bucks had made at least 20 3-pointers in a game just four times in franchise history.","401267273"
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander drives inside and finishes with a floater high off the backboard. (0:19) NEW ORLEANS -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 points, George Hill hit the go-ahead free throws with 12 seconds left, and the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 111-110 on Wednesday night. “It was a fun win. Guys were excited after that one because we had to earn that one, all 48 minutes,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “We stuck together and we made plays. Guys made plays tonight when they had to.” The Pelicans had the final possession, and top scorers Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson both touched the ball. But it was second-year reserve guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker who took the last shot from 3-point range. It rattled out with a couple of seconds remaining and neither team could control the rebound before time expired. “I saw an open Nickeil,"" said Ingram, whose pass set up the final shot. “A shot that I’ve seen him make a thousand times in practice and different games. He was open. He almost made it. It just rolled in and out. It was a good play.” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy took no issue with the final play, either. It was the Thunder's 27 fast-break points that annoyed him. “I don’t think the last play had much to do with anything. The bottom line is we didn’t play any defense,” Van Gundy said. “Been going on too long with this group. Dig in, and play the game defensively. ... If you can’t win scoring 110 points, there’s something wrong.” Darius Bazley had 20 points and 12 rebounds for Oklahoma City, which avenged a home loss to New Orleans last week while winning for just the second time in six games. Reserve forward Mike Muscala scored 18 points, hitting five 3-pointers. Hill finished with 13. Williamson scored 29 points, while Ingram had 24 points and 11 rebounds. Steven Adams had 10 points, 10 assists and 11 rebounds for his first career triple-double. Adams scored five points in the final 2:30. He put the Pelicans up 104-100 with a putback while he was fouled and later gave New Orleans a 106-103 lead with 1:35 left. Gilgeous-Alexander tied it at 106 with a driving layup as he was fouled by Alexander-Walker. He later baited Lonzo Ball into a shooting foul behind the 3-point line and made all three free throws to put Oklahoma City up 109-108 in the final minute. Williamson's short turnaround off the glass briefly put New Orleans in front once more before Al Horford beat the Pelicans to a rebound of Gilgeous-Alexander's miss and the ball found Hill, who was fouled by Ball to set up the decisive free throws. ""We did a great job of staying resilient and making plays when we had to,” Hill said. TIP-INS Thunder: Made 19 3-pointers on 46 attempts (41.3%). ... Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with nine assists. ... Oklahoma City led by as many as 14 points in the game and by 10 in the fourth quarter before allowing New Orleans to take several late leads. Pelicans: JJ Redick bruised his right knee and did not play in the second half. ... New Orleans missed 18 of 22 3-point attempts (18.2%) but shot 49.4% (44 of 89) overall. ... The Pelicans outscored the Thunder 58-36 in the paint and outrebounded Oklahoma City 52-38. ... Alexander-Walker finished with 13 points. Ball scored 15 points and Eric Bledsoe 13. ... Josh Hart grabbed 10 rebounds. ADAMS' ASSISTS Daigneault, a Thunder assistant during Adams' last season in Oklahoma City, wasn't surprised to see the 7-footer finally get double-digit assists. “He showed last year that when you play through him, he can glue your offense together and that was on display tonight,"" Daigneault said. ""We made a couple mistakes on cuts and he really made us pay for it. That’s what makes him a really good player. He not only does the dirty work, but he can quarterback it a little bit, too.”","401267274"
"Chris Paul sneaks an inbounds pass to Cam Johnson, who sinks a 3-pointer. (0:22) PHOENIX -- — Devin Booker scored 24 points, Jae Crowder added 21 and the Phoenix Suns made 21 3-pointers on the way to a 123-115 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night. The Suns made at least 20 3-pointers in a game for the fourth time in franchise history and hit from long range all night, making nine in the first half and 12 more in the second. Crowder led the way with six 3s while Cameron Johnson added four. The Suns have won five of their past six and improved to 6-2, which is tied for tops in the Western Conference with the Los Angeles Lakers. Phoenix has continued the momentum it gained at the end of last season, when it won all eight games in the NBA’s Florida bubble and nearly qualified for the playoffs. Crowder was an under-the-radar signing for the Suns during the offseason after helping Miami reach the NBA Finals last year. The veteran forward has scored at least 15 points in four of eight games. Suns coach Monty Williams said Crowder is useful because he can contribute scoring without being the focal point of the offense. He's quickly found his role with the Suns, providing tough defense and sliding into spaces where he can make shots. “I just think Jae figures it out,” Williams said. “He’s one of those guys who knows how to space and knows how to read the defense when they close out.” Johnson scored 16 to lead the Suns bench, which poured in 42 points. Dario Saric added 15 points and Cameron Payne tied a career high with 10 assists. “We just play really hard,” Payne said. “We try our best to play hard and find each other in the right spots.” The Suns finished 21 of 40 (52.5%) from 3-point range. “Give them credit — they kept stepping into them and kept making them for the most part,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “The 3-point defense hurt us tonight.” Pascal Siakam scored 32 points on 11-of-21 shooting and Kyle Lowry added 24 points for the Raptors, who fell to 1-6 and had their six-game winning streak against Phoenix snapped. The Raptors shot nearly 50% from the field but couldn’t keep up with the Suns. Phoenix led 96-87 going into the fourth quarter and extended its advantage to 105-90 on a corner 3 by Saric with about 9:30 remaining. The Raptors cut the advantage to 121-115 with 35 seconds left but Chris Paul made two free throws to turn back the rally. The game stayed tight throughout the first half and the Suns took a 58-54 lead into halftime. Crowder scored 15 points in the first half and made four 3-pointers. Johnson came off the bench to add 13 and made three 3s. Siakam had 19 points before the break, shooting 7 of 10 from the field. ANTHEMS The teams met at center court and linked arms during the singing of the Canadian and U.S. national anthems, reacting to a tumultuous day on which a violent mob supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. “Just a sign, a symbol of unity and togetherness that we want to be a part of as a league and a country,” Williams said. “We realize these are some different times.” TIP-INS Raptors: Forward Aron Baynes returned to the desert after playing last season with the Suns. He averaged a career-high 11.5 points per game last season, playing particularly well early in the season when Ayton was out because of a 25-game suspension. Baynes finished with no points and five rebounds in 13 minutes. ... Lowry was hit in the face during the fourth quarter while trying to defend Ayton. Officials reviewed the play but said no “hostile act” occurred. Lowry stayed down for a minute but returned to the game. Suns: Deandre Ayton had 11 points and 16 rebounds. ... The Suns shot 22 of 24 on free throws. ... Paul had 12 points and eight assists.","401267275"
"Draymond Green and James Wiseman connect for a high-flying alley-oop in the third quarter. (0:16) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Kawhi Leonard scored the tying basket with 6:40 to play, then put his team ahead with a jumper the following possession on the way to 21 points, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Golden State Warriors 108-101 on Wednesday night in the first of two straight matchups between the Pacific Division rivals. Paul George returned from a one-game absence with a sore right ankle to add 21 points and 12 rebounds in the Clippers' fourth straight win against Golden State, which got just 13 points from Stephen Curry on a cold shooting night for the two-time MVP. He tweaked his left ankle late but it wasn't considered serious and Curry will receive treatment Thursday. He had scored 92 the previous two games, including his career-high 62 against Portland on Sunday night. Players and coaches on both sides knelt for the national anthem following earlier chaos at the U.S. Capitol. Marcus Morris Sr. made his season debut after being sidelined by a right knee injury but didn't think the teams should have played. It wasn't discussed, he said. “It’s hard to really put it into words just the direction this country is going in,” Morris said. “... It’s just unfortunate the state that we’re in in this country.” “It was so disheartening,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""I think everybody came into the arena this evening just sort of dazed.” Draymond Green received a Flagrant-1 foul with 4:58 left and Leonard converted both free throws. Patrick Beverley made a 3 with 4:14 left, then Nicolas Batum hit from deep the next two times down. Leonard told coach Tyronn Lue he wanted to play in back-to-backs this season, not typically his routine in recent years, so it’s something they will evaluate regularly. “I was patient and I'm able to play,” Leonard said of health previously dictating his days off. Eric Paschall came off the bench to score nine quick points over five minutes on the way to 19 for the Warriors, who used a 9-0 run over the final 1:13 of the second quarter to get within 52-51 at halftime. The teams were a combined 3 for 19 from 3-point range in first quarter, 1 of 10 by Warriors as they trailed 21-15. Curry missed his three tries from deep and started 1 of 6. He shot 5 for 17 overall, missing five of six 3s. “Our philosophy is we want to try to take the best player out,” Lue said. “We know Steph could go for 60 like he did the other day.” KERR REFLECTS Lue and Kerr were open to their players taking a stand — or a knee — after the violence in Washington and the two coaches talked before tipoff. “I started the day thinking about how we were going to guard Lou Williams without fouling him, suddenly that didn't seem quite as important when I turned the TV on as shootaround was beginning,” Kerr said. ""... It’s just a clear reminder that the truth matters in our country.” DYNAMIC DUO Lue knows when Curry and Green get going, Golden State is tough. Green played in his fourth game of the season since returning from a right foot injury. “With Draymond back, they have a great two-man connection,” Lue said. TIP-INS Clippers: Serge Ibaka had 12 points and 14 rebounds for his first double-double of the season. ... L.A. swept the season series with the Warriors 3-0 last season, holding Golden State to 41.2% from the floor with a 127.0-109.7 scoring advantage. ... The Clippers are 6-2 against the Western Conference, 4-0 vs. the division and 4-1 on the road. Warriors: Green had six of the Warriors' 25 assists and Curry added five, down from their NBA season-high 41 in a rout of the Kings on Monday. ... Andrew Wiggins had 19 points and has scored in double figures in every game, but didn't have a block after getting at least two in each of the previous four games.","401267276"
"Coby White double clutches and finishes with the floater off the backboard while being fouled by Marvin Bagley III. (0:27) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Buddy Hield converted a four-point play with 38 seconds left to make up for a horrible shooting night, and the Sacramento Kings held off the Chicago Bulls 128-124 on Wednesday. Hield missed 12 of his first 14 shots and was 1 of 8 on 3-pointers before hitting one from the top of the arc and getting fouled by former Kings teammate Garrett Temple. Hield sank the free throw to give Sacramento a 124-119 lead and finished with 10 points. “I was joking that the only reason he made the last one is somebody hit him in the head,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “It knocked off his calibration. The only time I ever worry about Buddy shooting is if he turns down a shot, and I haven’t seen him do that yet.” First-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton scored 15 of his season-high 17 points in the fourth quarter and made a key steal in the backcourt. Haliburton followed Hield’s pivotal 3 with one of his own against a pair of Chicago defenders to help the Kings end a three-game losing streak. Marvin Bagley III had 21 points and 12 rebounds for Sacramento, which played most of the game without De’Aaron Fox. The point guard strained his right hamstring midway through the first quarter and did not return. Richaun Holmes had 24 points, eight rebounds and five assists for the Kings. Harrison Barnes added 20 points. Coby White had a career-high 36 points and seven assists for the Bulls. Zach Lavine scored 32 and Wendell Carter Jr. added 11 points and a career-best 17 rebounds. Hield’s clutch shot bailed out the Kings after Sacramento blew a 12-point lead in the first half and trailed with 6 minutes remaining. “Even if (Temple) didn’t foul him, he made the shot anyway,” Chicago coach Billy Donovan said. “They made three 3s coming down the stretch and one of them was a four-point play. I thought they were all well-contested.” Haliburton’s 3-pointer was equally big, making it 127-121 with 12 seconds remaining just before Barnes missed a pair of free throws for Sacramento. Lavine countered with a 3 to cut it to 127-124 with 2.6 seconds to play. Haliburton missed the previous two games with a bone bruise in his left wrist but played the entire fourth quarter of this one while Fox watched from the bench. “I was kind of disappointed in my performance up to that point,” Haliburton said. “Without me, De’Aaron has been asked to do a lot. When he’s out of the game, and even when he’s in the game, sometimes when we’re getting into our half-court offense we tend to walk it up. I was just trying to keep everyone involved. That leads to us winning games.” Before the game, players from both teams locked arms with their teammates during the national anthem. That followed a pattern set by other teams around the NBA after a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to prevent Congress from certifying the results of last November’s presidential election. TIP-INS Bulls: Denzel Valentine had seven points in the final 3:51 of the first quarter. … Carter was called for defensive three seconds, resulting in a technical foul. … Temple scored 11 points in 33 minutes. … Patrick Williams spent much of the first half in concussion protocol after getting hit in the head. Williams finished with nine points. Kings: Walton lost a challenge after Bagley was whistled for a foul early in the fourth quarter. … Jabari Parker missed a second consecutive game for personal reasons.","401267277"
"With Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving out, the Nets still pull off a convincing 122-109 win vs. the 76ers. (1:51) NEW YORK -- — The Brooklyn Nets couldn't put Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant into those throwback blue tie-dye jerseys from 30 years ago. The NBA's leading team still couldn't come close to beating them. Joe Harris scored a season-high 28 points and the Nets shook off the absence of their two superstars to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 122-109 on Thursday night. Brooklyn jumped out quickly and had a double-digit lead for much of the second half while winning its second straight, both without Durant. “Obviously it’s a totally different team when those guys are out here,” guard Caris LeVert said, “but I think we’ve done a great job of having a next-man-up mentality, guys stepping into those roles and fulfilling what we need as a team.” LeVert had 22 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds, and Jarrett Allen added 15 points and 11 boards for the Nets. Irving was ruled out Thursday afternoon for personal reasons, though coach Steve Nash said before and after the game he hadn't spoken to his point guard and didn't know the reason for his absence, calling it a personal matter. LeVert said Irving texted his teammates before the game and they supported his absence. The Nets said Irving would not travel with the team to Memphis on Thursday night. The Nets already knew they’d be without Durant for a second consecutive game because of the NBA’s health and safety protocols. Nash said Durant would be able to return Sunday if he continues to test negative for the coronavirus until then. Nash said he didn't think the strong performance without them sent a message to the rest of his players. “I think the message is for the whole group that when we play connected and we have that fighting spirit, we give ourselves a great chance every night no matter who’s available,” he said. The 76ers came in at 7-1 and off their best performance of the season, when they shot an NBA season-high 61.7% in a 141-136 victory over Washington on Wednesday. But they couldn't duplicate that, with Joel Embiid starting slowly before finishing with 20 points and 12 rebounds. Shake Milton had a season-high 24 points in his first start of the season in place of Seth Curry, who had a sore left ankle, but Ben Simmons was limited to 11 points, four rebounds and two assists. Milton said he didn't believe the Sixers had a letdown because of the Nets' absent stars. “I don’t think that was it at all,” he said. “It’s the NBA and it was a back-to-back, but guys in the NBA know they can play. So if you don’t come out and you’re not on top of your game and you’re not ready to go, not mentally locked in, you can get beat by anybody.” The Sixers quickly fell into a 20-8 hole, but recovered to move into the lead early in the second quarter. The Nets broke away again late in the period, going up by 16 before taking a 65-51 lead to the locker room, and were never seriously threatened afterward. TIP-INS 76ers: Dwight Howard had an eventful night, totaling nine points, 12 rebounds and six fouls in just 16 minutes. ... Coach Doc Rivers said he believed Curry was hurt late in Wednesday's victory, when the guard scored a season-high 28 points. Rivers didn't believe the injury was severe but said it was best to rest Curry. Nets; Brooklyn was also without G Tyler Johnson because of the health and safety protocols. Nash said he believed it was due to contact tracing. ... Jeff Green scored 14 points. OLD JERSEY Irving, who grew up in New Jersey, missed the chance to wear the Nets’ uniforms they wore while playing there. Their blue uniforms were a throwback to the tie-dye ones they wore during the 1990-91 season. The franchise switched to black and white after moving to Brooklyn in 2012.","401267278"

(0:16) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Andre Drummond had 22 points and 15 rebounds, Larry Nance Jr. added 18 points on 7-for-7 shooting from the field and the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 94-90 on Thursday night. Cedi Osman scored 16 points as Cleveland snapped a two-game skid. JaVale McGee added 13 points. Jonas Valanciunas led Memphis with 17 points and 10 rebounds, while Brandon Clarke had 14 points. Dillon Brooks scored 11 but was 4 of 13 from the field. “Pretty bad game for us,” Valanciunas said. “We’ve just got to bounce back. Play better offense. Play better defense. A little more effort in the game. All of us, me included.” A key sequence came with 34 seconds left. On a breakaway by Memphis guard Tyus Jones, Isaac Okoro was called for a foul on Jones’ layup attempt, which the rookie from Auburn blocked. Cleveland challenged, the foul was overturned and the Cavaliers won the ensuing tip. That led to a dunk from Okoro with 10.6 seconds left for a 93-90 lead. “What Isaac understands is there are a multitude of ways you can impact winning throughout the game, and especially in the clutch,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “That chase-down block, if it wasn’t the middle of January, we’d be talking about that block for a long, long time. It was phenomenal.” The Cavaliers were minus leading scorer Collin Sexton, who sat out with a left ankle sprain. That left Cleveland trying to pick up Sexton’s missing 25.1 points a game. In the aftermath of Wednesday’s chaos at the U.S. Capitol, and to protest racial and social injustice, the teams paused at the opening tip, went to the sideline, locked arms and took a knee. They were joined by coaches, staff and reserves covering the entire sideline from end line to end line. The three officials knelt at midcourt behind the line of players. “I’m just so proud to be a part of this league. Our league is at the forefront of all … positive change in my mind,” Nance said. “All things equality. All things social justice. I couldn’t be more proud of the players, the teams, the league we’re in.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: With a steal in the third quarter, Nance reached 400 for his career. He leads the NBA with 2.38 steals per game. ... G Damyean Dotson started his second game of the season. … Played their first game against a Western Conference opponent. ... Drummond has a double-double in all nine games this season. Grizzlies: Have not won a home game this season. Their only two wins came on the road at Brooklyn and Charlotte. … Had 14 steals, a season high. SOCIAL STANCE Both coaches addressed Wednesday’s events in Washington and other questions regarding social justice in the country. “The last nine or 10 months has given us all a priority check, I think,” Bickerstaff said. “Through the civil unrest. Through COVID itself. We have to be able to sit back and prioritize what is important, and there are larger issues at hand that we deal with on a day-to-day basis. … How we interact with each other as a society and as a larger community is more important.” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins noted the first three words of the U.S. Constitution are “We the people,” and said those are strong words to remember as the country reflects on recent events. “It starts with each individual. ‘We the people’ have the power to make change … knowing that better days need to be ahead of us. And they will be ahead of us if we all take that long, hard look at what part can I play in making a difference in positive change?”","401267279"
"Luka Doncic sinks a 3-pointer in overtime as the Mavericks edge out the Nuggets. (0:18) DENVER -- — Luka Doncic is always ready to take the big shot, but he isn’t afraid to pass to a teammate with the game on the line. Maxi Kleber rewarded Doncic’s trust with a clutch 3-pointer late in regulation, then set up a teammate himself for another huge 3 in overtime to lead the Dallas Mavericks over the Denver Nuggets 124-117 Thursday night. Doncic came within one rebound of his second straight triple-double, finishing with 38 points and 13 assists. He sat out Sunday’s loss to Chicago and responded with his first triple-double of the season against Houston on Monday. He followed that up with a season high in points. Nikola Jokic scored 20 of his 38 points after halftime and grabbed 11 rebounds for Denver. Jamal Murray added 21 points and nine assists. The Nuggets led by one in the final seconds of regulation when Kleber came through. Doncic had the ball with time running out, and when the defense collapsed on him he found Kleber, whose 3-pointer put Dallas up 109-107 with 2.4 seconds left. “He’s a great shooter. He's a great player. He does a lot of stuff that few people see,” Doncic said. “Our whole team sees that. It was a great shot. Even if he would have missed it, it was a great shot.” Jokic capped a 17-point fourth quarter with an 18-foot jumper at the horn to send the game to overtime, and Kleber delivered again. He fed Josh Richardson for a 3 with 1:25 left that put the Mavericks ahead 119-114. Denver got within three on a 3-pointer from Jokic, but Doncic scored four straight to ice it for the Mavericks. Richardson finished with 14 points, including a tiebreaking jumper before his 3-pointer. “We had the game. We had the game,” Murray said. “We just didn’t close it like we should have.” Dallas rallied from four down to take a 101-97 lead on a 3 by Kleber, his first points of the night, but Jokic scored the next five to put Denver ahead. “I’m trying to be ready and take that shot with confidence,” Kleber said. “Shots are going to fall or not — you just have to trust and believe.” TIP-INS Mavericks: G Trey Burke wasn’t with the team but coach Rick Carlisle said “to my knowledge, it is not COVID-19 related.” ... F Kristaps Porzingis (knee) is on the trip and making progress but there is no timetable for his return. ""He is ramping things up and the hope is that his progress can continue without issue and then we can see where things are as we move forward,” Carlisle said. Nuggets: F Michael Porter Jr. was expected back Thursday night but he was ruled out hours before tip-off due to health and safety protocols. Porter missed the previous three games because of COVID-19 contact tracing. “He’s not here right now, so I’m not even going to speak on that,” coach Michael Malone said after the game. “We have guys that are talented, have been in the league. They got to step up and help us play. We’ll speak about Michael when he gets back to our team.” SHOW OF UNITY The teams locked arms in a circle and kneeled for the national anthem before the game as a show of solidarity following the insurrection by rioters Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol. “We came together as a team, and we talked to the opponent today, and we wanted to stand together and that’s why we decided before the game to kneel,” Kleber said. “We all have a platform and stand for the right thing.

"Damian Lillard scores 39 points as the Trail Blazers defeat the Timberwolves 135-117. (1:24) PORTLAND. Ore. -- — Damian Lillard had 39 points, including seven 3-pointers, and the Portland Trail Blazers handed the Minnesota Timberwolves their sixth straight loss with a 135-117 victory Thursday night. CJ McCollum added 20 points for the Blazers, who led by 33 in the second half. Jusuf Nurkic had 17 points and seven rebounds before Portland rested its starters in the fourth quarter. D'Angelo Russell and Anthony Edwards each scored 26 points for the Timberwolves (2-6), who continue to struggle without Karl-Anthony Towns as he recovers from a dislocated left wrist. He’s missed six games, coinciding with Minnesota's losing streak. Lillard, who also had seven rebounds and seven assists while playing less than 30 minutes, said he made a point of coming out strong. “I need to be more aggressive, be in attack mode, just trying to lift the level of urgency from the start,” Lillard said. The Timberwolves had a narrow 29-28 edge after the opening quarter, paced by Russell with 11 points. Portland (4-4) pulled in front in the second, taking a 46-36 lead on Gary Trent Jr.'s 3-pointer. Robert Covington's 3, which capped a 15-0 run, extended the lead to 54-36 as Minnesota's offense stalled. After leading 75-56 at the break, the Blazers pushed their advantage to 95-65 in the third quarter on Lillard's 3-pointer from 33 feet out. Edwards dunked to get Minnesota to 116-100 with just over six minutes left. “Losses when they stack up, it hurts,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “We're all competitors here. You’ve got to fight the natural instinct to let go of the rope when things get tough. You grab onto somebody next to you when things get tough.” Saunders said help might be on the way soon because Towns has been making progress. “Once we get back to Minnesota, we’ll evaluate more, and get him around the team and see where he is at that point,” Saunders said. Until their big man does return, Malik Beasley said the Timberwolves need to weather this slump. “We've got to help each other. We've got to trust each other. That’s the main thing. We've got to have each other's back. I don't think we're doing that right now. We’ve got to come together,” he said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota was also without Josh Okogie, who has missed five games with a strained left hamstring. ... Saunders said the Timberwolves discussed the mob of President Donald Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. “It was disgusting to watch in so many ways and it shows just how far we have to come as a country when it comes to coming together,"" he said.

CAPITOL SEIGE Lillard was asked his reaction to the events that unfolded Wednesday in Washington, D.C. “Guys around the league have spoken about it, talk about how we pretty much live in two different Americas,” Lillard said. “Being a Black man, I know what that situation would have been if people of color decided to take that kind of route. I know it wouldn't look the way it looked.” PRAISE FOR DAME “Whatever we did, we didn’t do it good enough because he really got going tonight,” Saunders said. “There's a reason why Damian Lillard is an MVP-caliber basketball player. If you’re not in tune with all the details on how to cover him, he’ll make it really tough on you.”","401267282"
"Delon Wright dishes to Saddiq Bey who sinks a 3-pointer from the wing for the Pistons vs. the Suns. (0:21) DETROIT -- — Even while losing seven of their first eight games, the Detroit Pistons competed. None of those defeats was by more than 15 points. So perhaps it was no surprise that after falling behind by 23 against an impressive Phoenix team, Detroit gamely fought back. Jerami Grant had 31 points, 10 rebounds and a crucial assist near the end of regulation, and the Pistons beat the Suns 110-105 in overtime Friday night. Coach Dwane Casey was pleased his team's effort resulted in a win. “They’ve got to get some reward,"" Casey said. ""Slowly but surely, I think we’re going to come together — we’re coming together.” Detroit scored the first nine points of the extra session after barely leading at all during regulation. Grant had only two assists on the night, but one of them was to Mason Plumlee for a dunk that tied it at 93 with 9.6 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. “I’m very impressed with his patience and his decision-making,” said teammate Blake Griffin, who had 16 points and 12 rebounds. “Had a big pass to Mason, obviously, to tie the game. So his decision-making is unbelievable.” Devin Booker missed a jumper that could have won it for the Suns at the end of the fourth. Booker scored 23 points for Phoenix, including a 3-pointer with 40.7 seconds left in overtime that brought the Suns within three. Grant answered with a 3-pointer in front of the Detroit bench to double the lead. The Pistons said the win marked their largest comeback victory in at least the last 20 years. Phoenix entered the game with the best record in the Western Conference. Detroit came in with the worst mark in the NBA. It looked like that for much of the first half. Langston Galloway scored 17 points in the half for the Suns against his former team, and Phoenix led 54-31 in the second quarter. Detroit went on a 17-2 run to end the half and eventually tied it at 70 in the third quarter. TIP-INS Suns: F-C Jalen Smith was out due to health and safety protocols. ... After making 21 3-pointers in a win over Toronto on Wednesday, the Suns made 17 on Friday, but they needed 52 attempts. They also shot just 6 of 13 on free throws. Pistons: Detroit was 25 of 29 on free throws, and that was important because the Pistons shot 41% from the field. ... Detroit has won eight in a row against the Suns. ... The Pistons tied a franchise record with their fourth straight game shooting at least 85% on free throws. ADJUSTMENTS Detroit slowed Phoenix by playing plenty of zone defense. “It was good to us,"" Casey said. ""We weren’t stopping them man to man, so we had to give them a different look.” Suns coach Monty Williams said his team didn't make the zone work hard enough. “We got 52 3s up, so we didn’t have a problem getting up shots. We didn’t make shots,” he said. “When we’re flowing offensively, teams are throwing different defenses at us, and we have to respond the right way.” BIG HALF Galloway, who played three seasons with the Pistons from 2017-20, made his first six shots — five from 3-point range. He didn't score after that, however. “It felt good,” he said. “Just kind of upset and disappointed we didn’t pull that one out. That’s one you’ve got to have.”","401267283"
"Jayson Tatum and Bradley Beal chat shortly before Tatum's positive COVID-19 test, causing Beal to miss time due to contact tracing. (0:16) BOSTON -- — Jayson Tatum had 32 points, Jaylen Brown had 27 points and 13 rebounds, and the Boston Celtics held off Bradley Beal and the Washington Wizards 116-107 Friday night for their fourth straight win. Beal had 41 points and eight rebounds a game after tying the franchise record with 60 points against the 76ers. Tatum hit 14 of 27 shots to power the short-handed Celtics, who were without Tristan Thompson, Grant Williams and Robert Williams. The trio is sidelined in COVID-19 health and safety protocol for the next seven days. “Our job’s not to make excuses for who’s not here,” coach Brad Stevens said. “It’s to play as well as we can with who is and let the results take care of themselves.” Rui Hachimura had 17 points and Davis Bertans had 13 as the Wizards dropped to 2-7. The Celtics were cruising early, outscoring the Wizards 33-19 in the second quarter. They increased a 19-point halftime lead to 28 in the first five minutes of the third quarter. The Wizards rallied from there, clawing within 99-95 with 7:36 left in the game. Boston scored seven straight points to build a small cushion. It was 106-101 when Marcus Smart led a fast break and found Brown for a corner 3-pointer with 2:08 remaining. Coach Scott Brooks said he may have played Beal too many minutes down the stretch. “It’s really on me. I tried to get him some extra minutes because we were right there,” Brooks said. ""He’s been playing probably three minutes too many. It doesn’t sound like a lot. But it does add up.” Russell Westbrook was in action just two days after dislocating a finger on his right hand late in Washington’s loss to Philadelphia on Wednesday night. He played with his right ring and pinkie fingers taped together. He finished with 12 points on 4-of-16 shooting from the field. Daniel Theis started at center for Boston and picked up two quick fouls, prompting Stevens to play second-year, 7-foot-5 Tacko Fall for just the second time this season. Fall made the most of the opportunity, coming up with a block at the rim on Westbrook in the first quarter. He also was the recipient of an alley-oop from Brown in the second. “The coaches have been on me to just stay ready,"" Fall said. ""The game has slowed down a lot which has made my game a lot easier. ... I know I belong, it’s just a matter of going out there and doing my job on a consistent basis.” TIP-INS Wizards: Despite playing the 76ers on Wednesday, a day before Philadelphia guard Seth Curry tested positive for the coronavirus, coach Scott Brooks said they haven’t had any positive tests. ... Westbrook was assessed a technical foul from the bench in the third quarter. Celtics: Had a pregame moment of silence for former NBA player and coach Paul Westphal, then continued to take a knee for the national anthem. Westphal was a member of the Celtics’ 1973-74 championship team. ... G Jeff Teague returned after missing two games with a sprained left ankle. ... Led by 21 in the first half. ... Semi Ojeleye scored eight straight points in the opening three minutes of the third quarter. WALKER CLEARED FOR PRACTICE Celtics All-Star point guard Kemba Walker has been cleared to begin practicing. Walker hasn’t played this season after receiving a stem cell injection in his left knee prior to the start of training camp last month. He’s been on a 12-week strengthening program since the early October procedure. Stevens said Walker’s been pain-free during individual workouts and that the next step is for him to go through some live practices with teammates.","401267284"
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander feeds Hamidou Diallo for the throwdown, sealing the Thunder's 101-89 win vs. the Knicks. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, Hamidou Diallo scored a season-high 23 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame an ugly start to beat the New York Knicks 101-89 on Friday night. Al Horford added 15 points and was practically the only offense early for the Thunder, who got almost nothing to fall at the start but got better as the game went along and improved to 4-1 on the road. “We just stick with it, no matter what it is,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. RJ Barrett scored 19 points for the Knicks, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Julius Randle, scoreless in the first half, finished with 18 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. “From top to bottom, we just didn’t get it done,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “We’re capable of doing much better than we did.” Oklahoma City came in scoring an NBA-low 102 points per game, the Knicks were 28th at 104.4, and even those paltry stats seemed way out of reach the way the game started. The Thunder shot 20.8% in the first quarter — Horford had three of their five baskets — and trailed 24-15. But the Knicks managed just 18 in the second quarter and the game was tied at 42 at the half. “I just felt like today on both ends of the floor, for whatever reason, we just didn’t play for each other and it happens,” Randle said. “You go through that, but the biggest thing is that we nip it in the bud right now and take care of it right now and get back to playing unselfish, playing for each other.” Coach Mark Daigneault praised Diallo and the reserves who helped get the Thunder going after the starters were cold at the start. “They really amped it up and then we carried it through the rest of the game,” Daigneault said. Gilgeous-Alexander was 6 of 7 for 12 points in the third quarter, when the Thunder opened a nine-point lead before Austin Rivers beat the buzzer with a 3-pointer that cut it to 69-63. The Thunder broke it open with an 11-3 spurt in the fourth, with Gilgeous-Alexander's 3-pointer making it 89-76. TIP-INS Thunder: Diallo had 11 rebounds. ... Daigneault coached his first NBA game at Madison Square Garden, but has been part of victories in the arena. He was a student manager at UConn from 2003-07 under Jim Calhoun, winning one Big East tournament title. Knicks: The Knicks have lost the last four meetings. ... Elfrid Payton scored 16 points but shot 4 for 16. NEW KNICK Thibodeau said the Knicks hoped Taj Gibson, signed Thursday, would be cleared to begin playing next week. The veteran forward played for Thibodeau in both Chicago and Minnesota and spent last season with the Knicks, which made him a good fit for a short-handed frontcourt. “I think his career speaks for itself and obviously he embodies all the things that we believe in,” Thibodeau said. FAMILIAR FACE Daigneault has on his staff Mike Miller, who finished last season as the Knicks' interim head coach after David Fizdale was fired. He previously coached the Knicks' team in the G League, where the coaches became acquainted. “He did a great job here,” Daigneault said. “He left a great impression here. Everyone here had great things to say about him. He’s an old-school worker but a new-school thinker.”","401267285"
"Zion Williamson elevates to mash down a two-handed dunk over a defender, drawing a foul for a three-point opportunity. (0:18) NEW ORLEANS -- — Gordon Hayward scored 22 of his 26 points in the second half and the Charlotte Hornets methodically came back from an 18-point, second-quarter deficit to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 118-110 on Friday night. “He’s a pro. He’s been here before. He’s not fazed by a bad half, a bad quarter,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""He gives us a calming force, a presence that we may not have had in the past. “Even in that fourth quarter as that game got tight, there was no panic,” Borrego added. ""And a lot of it has to do with Gordon finishing.” Miles Bridges scored 20 points and Devonte Graham had 17 for the Hornets, who didn't take their first lead until the fourth quarter, when they outscored New Orleans 36-23. Zion Williamson scored 26 points and Josh Hart had 19 for the Pelicans, who've lost three straight, all at home. “There is some frustration because I just want to win,"" Williamson said of the recent skid, characterized by untimely defensive lapses. “We’ve got to hold ourselves accountable for those types of losses, whether it’s the turnovers, whether it’s the lack of rotation, communication."" Brandon Ingram added 17 points but was 3-of-10 shooting. JJ Redick also scored 17 for New Orleans, hitting four 3s. The game marked the first time brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball — both top-three draft choices within the past four years — played against one another. LaMelo Ball, picked third overall in 2020, had the better night, nearly notching a triple-double with 12 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. “He was free and easy out there, kind of what we expect now,"" Borrego said. “He’s not fazed by the moment.” Although the Ball brothers were matched up only intermittently, LaMelo Ball hit a 3 with his brother guarding him and also blocked his brother's driving layup. Lonzo Ball, a second overall draft pick by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2017, missed 6 of 7 3-point shots and finished with five points. “It was cool to be out there with him,” LaMelo Ball said. “Whenever we win, I feel it works out great.” TIP-INS Hornets: Terry Rozier finished with 15 points and Bismack Biyombo scored 11. ...

New Orleans won only once during its four-game home stand. MOMENTUM SHIFT The Pelicans led by double digits most of the first half and by 18 points when Redick’s 3 made it 47-29 in the middle of the second quarter. New Orleans was still up 59-47 to open the second half, but Charlotte quickly began tightening things up. Rozier hit a 3 and Hayward added short jumper and another 3, cutting the lead to 62-55. Another 3 by Hayward, two more by Rozier and one by Bridges in a span of less than three minutes got the Hornets within 72-69. The Pelicans gradually rebuilt their lead to eight late in the period, but LaMelo Ball hit his step-back 3 over his brother to make it 87-82 heading into the final quarter. Graham’s driving right-handed floater as he was fouled by Nickeil Alexander-Walker put Charlotte up for the first time at 105-103 with 5:46 to go. Hayward’s 3 with 3:43 left put the Hornets ahead 109-105. “I’ll keep using the word resiliency,” Borrego said. “It speaks volumes about their character more than anything.

Houston was up by 29 at halftime and had extended the lead to 81-43 after consecutive 3-pointers by John Wall and P.J. Tucker with about five minutes left in the third. “Obviously, they were very decimated... so we took advantage,"" Houston coach Stephen Silas said. “But we really played hard and it seems like our concepts are really sinking in more."" The Magic looked nothing like the team that opened the season 6-2. Aaron Gordon sat out with a left hamstring injury in the team’s first game since guard Markelle Fultz sustained a season-ending knee injury in a win over Cleveland on Wednesday night. A disgusted coach Steve Clifford spoke for only about 30 seconds and left without taking any questions. But it was plenty long enough to get his point across. “This game had a lot more to do with a lack of readiness and a lack of professionalism and a lack of effort than it did talent,"" he said. He talked about the numerous mistakes his team made before punctuating his remarks with: “So that's your story, nothing else mattered,"" and leaving the podium. A 3-pointer by James Harden ended his night and left the Rockets ahead by 36 after three, and a 3 by Ben McLemore extended the lead to 103-63 with about nine minutes remaining.

Silas said he wasn't sure what to expect from McLemore, but is excited to see what he'll bring to the team this season after Friday's performance. “It just gives us a stone-cold shooter on the perimeter,"" Silas said. “As you can see from our previous games, we need that on the floor.""","401267287"
"Gorgui Dieng gives the ball to Brandon Clarke, who gets the bucket and the foul. The basket puts Memphis up for good in a win over Brooklyn. (0:20) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Despite losing another key player — this time for coronavirus safety concerns — the Memphis Grizzlies were able to hold on for their first win at home this season. Dillon Brooks scored 24 points and Memphis pulled out a 115-110 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday night after center Jonas Valanciunas left midway through the game due to health and safety protocols. Brandon Clarke added 21 for Memphis. “Great job by our team. … What an unbelievable game,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. The Memphis victory came despite 43 points from Caris LeVert, including 25 in the second half as Brooklyn overcame a 22-point, first-half deficit. “We could have easily folded,” said reserve guard Joe Harris, who finished with 13 points. “The first half was not great by any means.” There were key starters missing for both teams. The Nets were without Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, while Memphis continued missing reigning Rookie of the Year Ja Morant and forward Jaren Jackson Jr. “For us to be a great team, a team that we know we can be, everyone has to be playing at full strength,” LeVert said. “Everyone has to be confident. Everybody has to be ready.” The teams were tied at 104 with 4:15 left. Memphis scored the next seven points, capped by a 3-pointer from De’Anthony Melton, who had 14 points on the night. LeVert’s 3-pointer with 11.4 seconds left pulled Brooklyn within 113-110, but the Nets could get no closer. Memphis lost momentum when Valanciunas did not come out for the second half due to the health and safety protocols. What had been Memphis domination on the boards quickly changed, and the Nets began shooting better than they had in the first half. “As soon as we got notification and in conversations with the league, we had to pull him from the game with an abundance of caution,” Jenkins said, adding that Valanciunas is not positive for COVID-19. In the third quarter, LeVert would connect on 6 of 8 from the field, including all five of his 3-pointers to pull the Nets back into the game. “That third quarter they got going,” Jenkins said. “They had a huge spark. A lot of momentum. Our guys just rallied and stayed the course despite a big run by the Nets.” TIP-Ins LeVert passed Richard Jefferson for 13th on the Nets’ career 3-pointers made list. … LeVert was 15 of 23 from the field, 7 of 9 from 3-point range.

He later said as far as future availability that no decision has been made regarding Sunday’s game against Oklahoma City. As for Durant, who is under the health and safety protocols, Nash said: “Kevin, I believe, is still on track for Sunday, so we just hope the tests continue to be negative and everything stays as is.”","401267288"
"Royce O'Neale hits a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer from 27 feet out to give the Jazz an 85-77 lead over the Bucks. (0:21) MILWAUKEE -- — Utah’s record 3-point shooting ended the Milwaukee Bucks’ home-court dominance. Donovan Mitchell scored 32 points and the Jazz shot 25 of 53 from 3-point range to win 131-118 on Friday night and hand the Bucks their first home loss. Utah’s 25 3-pointers set a franchise record. The Jazz also became the first team in NBA history to have five players make at least four 3-pointers in the same game. “I think more than the total number, the balance is something that I think is significant for us,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “That’s a strength of our team. We’ve got a lot of guys who can make those shots. It’s been something we’ve been banging that drum (about) from the first day. We want guys to take 3s.” Utah players who made at least four 3-pointers included Royce O’Neale (6 of 8), Mike Conley (5 of 10), Jordan Clarkson (5 of 12), Mitchell (4 of 9) and Bojan Bogdanovic (4 of 10). Clarkson scored 26 points, Bogdanovic 20, O’Neale 18 and Conley 17. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 35 points and eight rebounds for the Bucks, while Khris Middleton had 31 points and 10 rebounds. Jrue Holiday scored 17 points, Brook Lopez had 12 and Donte DiVincenzo added 11. The Bucks (5-4) had won their first four home games by an average of 23.5 points but trailed nearly the whole way this time. The Jazz ended a two-game skid after double-digit losses at Brooklyn and New York. “Certainly they played well,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “They executed their offense well. They shared it well. They made shots well. And on top of that, when they did miss, it felt like they were on the offensive boards all night.” Utah broke open a close game by scoring the first 12 points of the fourth quarter to grab a 116-96 edge. The Bucks didn’t score their first points of the final period until Antetokounmpo dunked with 6:47 left. “That’s the team we have to be,” Mitchell said. “The last two games, last few games, don’t really represent who we are. We have to stay at that level. We can’t bring it against Milwaukee and not bring it against New York.” TIP-INS Jazz: Clarkson’s big night continued his productive season off the bench as he improved his scoring average to 16.7. Heading into Friday’s action, Orlando’s Terrence Ross was the only NBA reserve with a higher scoring average. Bucks: Milwaukee didn’t get nearly enough from its bench. All five of the Bucks’ starters had at least 11 points, but Utah had a 35-12 edge in bench scoring. Milwaukee’s reserves shot a combined 4 of 18 overall and 0 of 8 from beyond the arc. SCARY MOMENT Antetokounmpo took a bad fall with 9:30 left in the third quarter, as he leaped in front of the basket to defend Utah’s Rudy Gobert and landed hard on his front side. The two-time reigning MVP rolled around and grabbed his left side. He went into the tunnel but immediately returned to the game. INGLES’ STREAK SNAPPED Utah’s Joe Ingles didn’t play due to a sore right Achilles tendon, snapping what had been the NBA’s longest active streak of consecutive games played. Ingles had appeared in 384 straight games. This marked the first game Ingles has missed since Dec. 16, 2015. “It makes you pause for a second and you reflect on what a streak of consecutive games like that means and what it says about Joe — his toughness, his commitment, the type of teammate he is,” Snyder said before the game. “You pause and reflect for a second and you understand why you respect him like you do.”","401267289"

Paul George had 25 points for the Clippers (6-4) and Kawhi Leonard added 24, but Golden State turned up the defense after the Clippers scored 65 in the first half. Curry got payback after being held to just 13 points in Wednesday’s loss. His nine 3-pointers Friday were the most by a Warriors player this season, and he added 11 assists. “It’s just who Steph is,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “He’s been doing this for many, many years and it’s one of the reasons he’s a two- time MVP. Usually with Steph, when he has a tough game he bounces back with the next one.” Andrew Wiggins scored 16 for the Warriors but Curry was predominantly a one-man show through the first three quarters. He got help in the fourth as Eric Paschall, Brad Wanamaker and Kent Bazemore all hit big shots. The Clippers shot 58.7% from the floor in the first half and led 65-51. George had 17 points on 6-of-7 shooting, including 4 for 4 from beyond the arc. “I think it’s good something like this happened to us early in the season,"" George said.

James and Harrell led the way as Los Angeles held off the Bulls down the stretch without injured starters Anthony Davis and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. The Lakers lead the Western Conference at 7-3 despite the challenges of injuries and several roster changes. “Through the first 10 games, I think we’ve played B, B-plus basketball, and that is absolutely OK,” James said. “We’re a team that added basically five pieces to the rotation, and we’re still learning each other. We’re getting accustomed to different lineups, playing different guys, and we’re playing pretty good basketball. We want to be better. That lets me know we have room to improve, which is a bright spot.” LaVine scored 19 points in the first quarter for the Bulls, who have lost seven straight to the Lakers. Dennis Schröder scored 17 points and hit a 3-pointer with 2:39 to play to put the Lakers up 113-107, but Chicago trimmed the lead to 116-115 on Garrett Temple's 3-pointer with 37 seconds left. James missed an extra-long 3-pointer to put the game in Chicago's hands, but LaVine missed his contested jumper, and his teammates fumbled the ball out of bounds. “From my view, he got off a pretty good look,” Chicago coach Billy Donovan said. “That’s what we wanted. ... I think we’ve gotten better competing. Now I think we’ve got to start to address getting better and not beating ourselves.

"Fred VanVleet scores 34 points to lead the Raptors to a comeback victory vs. the Kings. (1:58) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Pascal Siakam had 17 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds, Toronto made 20 3-pointers and the Raptors set a franchise record for scoring while winning for the second time this season, 144-123 over the Sacramento Kings on Friday night. Fred VanVleet scored 34 points to help the Raptors (2-6) snap a three-game losing streak. Toronto’s only other win came on Dec. 31 against the New York Knicks. Nick Nurse’s team won its seventh straight against the Kings despite being without point guard Kyle Lowry (personal reasons). That, and the poise the Raptors showed after falling behind by 19 points in the first half, had Nurse beaming afterward. “When there’s a whole bunch of guys hitting the floor with that level of fight, it kind of snowballs a little bit. It’s contagious,” Nurse said. “There wasn’t a whole lot to hang our heads about other than the start, and we didn’t then.” Chris Boucher added 23 points and 10 rebounds for Toronto. Norman Powell scored 22 points and Terence Davis had 18. “We did a great job of playing with energy throughout the game, even at the start,” said Powell, who made four 3s. “We clawed our way back into the game and the guys showed a lot of heart, toughness and togetherness to give us a chance going into that second half.” De’Aaron Fox scored 23 points and rookie Tyrese Haliburton had 15 points and eight assists for Sacramento. Toronto outscored Sacramento 33-20 in the fourth quarter. “They manhandled us, especially in that second half,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “We built up a nice, big lead, and you see it all the time in the NBA ... they got hot. It didn’t matter who they put in the game, they weren’t missing. We relaxed, and as soon as we relaxed they found a nice smooth rhythm.” The Raptors’ previous record for scoring in the regular season was 140 points, last done against the New Orleans Pelicans on Oct. 22, 2019. Toronto scored 150 points against the Brooklyn Nets on Aug. 23 in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto had six players in double figures. … The Raptors dominated on the boards 44-26. Kings: Sacramento shot 81% (17 of 21) with six 3s and scored a season-high 43 points in the first quarter. … The Kings had a season-high 36 assists. … Haliburton had a 3-pointer taken away upon review in the first quarter when it was ruled he stepped out of bounds before shooting. … Richaun Holmes picked up his fourth foul with 3:46 left in the second. BEATS STANDING IN LINE Fans have not been allowed inside Golden1 Center all season but that hasn’t stopped some from getting as close a look as possible. Two elderly women in wheelchairs peered through the glass doors encircling the arena and were able to see the game being shown on the giant scoreboard above the court, a ritual they have taken on for every home game this season. They were joined Friday night by a small group of people wearing Kings jerseys who were socially distanced nearby.","401267292"
"Doc Rivers says the team has eight active players and only seven will play, as he won't use Mike Scott. He also claims Dwight Howard will be playing point guard. (0:42) PHILADELPHIA -- — The Philadelphia 76ers opened the week with the best record in the NBA — and now face an uncertain future with a starting lineup fit for the preseason. Nikola Jokic had 15 points and 12 assists to lead the Denver Nuggets past Philadelphia 115-103 on Saturday, beating a 76ers team that had only seven available players. “COVID created this but the concern is not COVID now,” Sixers coach Doc Rivers said. “The concern is injuries.” The Sixers tipped without four regular starters — All-Stars Ben Simmons (sore left knee) and Joel Embiid (back) sat due to injury, and Seth Curry and Tobias Harris over virus concerns. Curry tested positive for the virus Thursday, and the ensuing contact tracing and COVID-19 health and safety protocols led to a slew of unavailable players. The team met the minimum eight active players by including injured forward Mike Scott, who was not actually able to play. Rivers said he didn’t think the game should be played. “We’ve got be very careful in how we navigate the next week,” Rivers said. Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia's 2020 first-round pick out of Kentucky, scored 39 points in 44 minutes on 18-of-33 shooting in his first career start. Isaiah Joe had 13 points. “I had to hunt my shot just a little more because it was needed,” Maxey said. Gary Harris scored 21 points for the Nuggets, who played without Michael Porter Jr. (19.5 points per game) because of health and safety protocols. Danny Green was the only regular in Philly’s starting lineup, joined by backups Dakota Mathias, Dwight Howard, Joe and Maxey. Mathias and Joe also made their first career NBA starts. Mathias, Maxey and Joe all played at least 41 minutes. “It was a good thing for the team even though I still hate losing,” Rivers said. The Sixers play Monday in Atlanta, the first of five games in seven days, and the roster may not change much. Curry will miss five more games at least. Harris and reserves Shake Milton, Matisse Thybulle and Vincent Poirier could miss at least a week because of the protocols. “We don’t know anything,” Rivers said. “I don’t know enough about any of this.” The team was forced to spend Friday in New York after playing at Brooklyn on Thursday and underwent additional testing before arriving back in Philadelphia at 1 a.m. — 14 hours before the afternoon tipoff. “The last 36 hours have been nuts,” Rivers said. Sparked by Maxey, the undermanned, feisty Sixers stuck with Denver throughout the first half. Maxey scored on a fastbreak dunk and Joe hit consecutive 3s to tie the game at 26. A 13.5-point favorite, the Nuggets led only 28-26 at the half before foul trouble caught up with Philadelphia. The Nuggets were off to a slow start at 3-5 but got a chance to regroup against the Sixers and took control in the third. Harris hit two 3s, the Nuggets shot 68% (13 of 19) and outscored the Sixers 35-21. “It seems like every time we get off to a good start and build a lead, we get kind of lax in our approach and allow teams to get back in the game rather quickly,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. TIP-INS 76ers: Maxey’s 22 points were the most in the first half for a Sixer this season. ... Howard moved into 13th on the NBA’s career rebounds list. Nuggets: Jamal Murray and Will Barton each scored 14 points. ALL-STAR ABSENCE Simmons and Embiid sat out with previously undisclosed injuries. “Joel started complaining about his back, that started yesterday,” Rivers said. “And we didn’t know if he was playing or not but honestly, with the minutes we would have to ask, it would be insane to play him tonight.”","401267293"
"Hawks guard Bogdan Bogdanovic suffers a fractured right knee after tripping in a game against the Hornets on Saturday. (0:43) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — LaMelo Ball isn't wasting any time making an impact in the NBA. The rookie point guard became the youngest player in league history to record a triple-double, with 22 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists on Saturday night, helping the Charlotte Hornets beat the Atlanta Hawks 113-105 for their third straight win. “A 19-year-old rookie does not look like this,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""This is rare what you’re seeing.” Ball's history-making performance came just two nights after he missed out on his first triple-double when he finished with 12 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists in a win over his brother Lonzo's New Orleans Pelicans. He said he hasn't begun to process the accomplishment. “I live my life and I know what I’m capable of, so stuff like doesn’t move me like that,"" Ball said. “I know that's supposed to happen.” Ball replaced Markelle Fultz as the youngest NBA player to record a triple-double by 177 days. “He's a tall PG who can pass, can rebound and he's a smart player,” said Atlanta's Trae Young. “Things are going to become even easier for him in this league as he plays more and more games.” Terry Rozier had 23 points to lead the Hornets. Cam Reddish scored 21 points and De’Andre Hunter had 20 for the Hawks. Young struggled all night, shooting 5 of 19 from the floor to finish with 15 points and 10 assists. Ball tied his highest scoring night on 9-of-13 shooting from the field as the Hornets handed the struggling Hawks their fourth consecutive loss. He became only the fifth rookie in NBA history to record a triple-double and the first Hornets player to do it coming off the bench. Borrego said he loves Ball's spirit and his energy, but what has impressed him the most is his poise and confidence. “He's not rattled by the moment. It's like he's been doing this for a number of years,"" Borrego said of Ball, who played overseas before becoming the third pick in the NBA draft. Ball had several sharp passes, including a perfect behind-the-back strike to set up a 3-pointer by P.J. Washington. “It's tough because you don't know when it's coming. He might throw it behind his head, behind his back or straight to you,” joked Washington, who also had 22 points and was on the receiving end of several of Ball's passes. “You have to be active and aware when he has the ball. It's always fun playing with a guy like that.” TIP-INS Hawks: Bogdan Bogdanovic got the start over Reddish but left in the second quarter with a knee injury and did not return. There was no immediate update on his injury. Hornets: Charlotte came in leading the league in assists and had 27 against the Hawks. ... Gordon Hayward finished with 13 points after averaging 35 points over the past two games. YOUNG'S INJURY Young had his wrist iced after the game, saying he fell on it while trying to take a charge. He had X-rays after the game but said it is “nothing severe,” although he added “it's definitely hurting.” Young doesn't seem too concerned about failing to make a 3-pointer in his last two games. “You never get too high or too low,” Young said. “Whenever shots aren't going I understand the work that I put in and I know it's going to pay off.” WASHINGTON BLOCKING SHOTS The 6-foot-7 Washington has been asking the play the 5 position for the Hornets when they go to a small-ball lineup and he has responded well. He had six blocks against the Hawks as the Hornets got back to .500 on the season. ""I love blocking shots because it gets us out in transition,"" Washington said.","401267294"
"Mikal Bridges takes on the scoring load as he puts up a career-high 34 points to lead the Suns to a 125-117 win over the Pacers. (1:31) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Mikal Bridges found his shooting touch quickly, then finished with a flourish. The third-year forward scored a career-high 34 points and made the 3-pointer to cap the decisive scoring spurt midway through the fourth quarter, helping the Phoenix Suns pull away from Indiana for a 125-117 victory Saturday. “Whenever you hit the first couple of shots everything feels good, so you start feeling more aggressive,” Bridges said. “It felt amazing. I know when I get comfortable, I keep telling myself to keep being aggressive. Don't relax and just keep going."" Bridges was 12 of 18 from the field, 6 of 8 on 3s and 4 of 4 from the free throw line. Devin Booker added 25 points as the Suns pulled into a tie with the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers for the best record in the West at 7-3 while earning their first win in Indy since 2016. Phoenix knocked down 16 more 3-pointers after making 38 in its previous two games. The Suns also became the ninth team in league history to open the season with 10 straight games of 10 or more 3s. It was simply too much for the Pacers, despite All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis finishing with 28 points, a career high-tying 22 rebounds and the first 20-20 game of his career. “He was good, really good,"" two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo said. “He did a really good job following up misses and playing his iso plays, getting rebounds. It was big. Unfortunately, we came up short."" Phoenix used a late first-half run to take a 56-53 halftime lead, then opened the second half by scoring the first five points. While Sabonis almost single-handedly kept the Pacers close with 16 points in the final six minutes of the third quarter, Indiana never took the lead. Instead, Bridges heated up again late, knocking down a 3 to cap an 11-0 run that gave Phoenix a 109-96 lead with 5:49 to go. TIP-INS Suns: Teammates doused Bridges with an ice cold celebration following the game. ... Phoenix had only three turnovers just one night after having 20. ... The Suns are 3-0 on the second game of a back-to-back this season. ... Perennial All-Star Chris Paul had 15 points and 10 assists. ... DeAndre Ayton didn't score until 8:43 left in the third quarter and finished with eight points and 14 rebounds. ... Phoenix has its best 10-game record since starting 8-2 in 2009-10. Pacers: Malcolm Brogdon had 22 points, nine assists and six rebounds. ... Oladipo scored 16 points while Myles Turner had 15 points and 10 rebounds and four more blocks. ... Justin Holiday continued his strong play as of late with 17 points, including 14 in 14 first-half minutes. ... Sabonis has a double-double in all nine games this season. ... Indiana is 4-3 at home this season. ... The eight-point difference was Indiana's most lopsided loss this season. ON THE BUBBLE The recent spike in positive COVID-19 tests around the NBA has prompted some to speculate whether the league might have to rethink playing inside a “bubble.” Oladipo made it clear he's no fan of going back in the bubble, especially with up to 1,000 fans to soon be allowed inside Bankers Life Fieldhouse. “I hope not,"" he said of the bubble talk. “But I think the NBA is doing all they can and the NBPA as well, working together to make sure we’re as safe as possible. But it’s tough. You can try your best and unfortunately some people may still catch it. We’ve got to do the best job to limit the virus as much as possible. Hopefully it doesn’t end up being another bubble, but at the end of the day we’ve got to do what’s safest for us.""","401267295"
"Jimmy Butler and Precious Achiuwa run a pick-and-roll for an alley-oop dunk vs. the Wizards. (0:24) WASHINGTON -- — The Miami Heat allowed 71 points in the first half to the short-handed Washington Wizards, and that was too much for coach Erik Spoelstra. With Washington playing without its three leading scorers, the Heat picked up its intensity, held the Wizards to 15 points in the third quarter and won 128-124 on Saturday night. Tyler Herro scored a career-high 31 points and Jimmy Butler nearly had a triple-double with 26 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. “Everybody could see it,”’ Spoelstra said. “We were not defending with enough energy and connection. It was pretty obvious. It was just going back and forth. It almost felt like a pickup game in the first half. In the third quarter, it was much more committed defensively.” Miami (4-4) has alternated wins and losses through its first eight games. “This team has a very deep roster,” Herro said. “Any given night, anyone can score. I’m not really worried about the numbers.” The Wizards (2-8) lost their third straight game and are winless in five home games. Washington played without the NBA’s leading scorer, Bradley Beal, who was a late scratch when he was placed in the NBA’s Health and Safety Protocol. “Found out maybe about an hour before the game,” coach Scott Brooks said. “On the one hand, it surprised me. On the other hand, this is what we kind of have to expect to happen. You hate for it to happen. You hope for the best, but don’t know the next step.” They were also without their other starting guard, Russell Westbrook, out with a left quad injury. Westbrook, who had triple-doubles in his first four games with the Wizards, was intending to play the second half of a back-to-back for the first time after sitting out the first two. Washington’s starting center, Thomas Bryant, suffered a left knee injury less than two minutes into the game, and didn’t return. Brooks said Bryant would have an MRI on Sunday. Garrison Mathews led the Wizards with 22 points. Deni Avdija scored 20. The Heat, which led nearly all the way, outscored the Wizards 28-15 in the third quarter to take a 103-86 lead. TIP-INS Heat: G Goran Dragic had 21 points on seven 3-pointers. … C Bam Adebayo had 16 rebounds despite playing only 21 minutes due to foul trouble. … C Meyers Leonard suffered a shoulder strain. Wizards: Brooks was assessed a technical in the fourth quarter. … The Capital City Go-Go, Washington’s G League affiliate, will flex assign players to the Erie Bayhawks, New Orleans’ G League affiliate, during the season that begins next month in Orlando, Florida. EXPANDABLE ROSTERS The NBA is allowing teams to have 15 active players for each game this season, up from 13 in previous seasons. Brooks said that enables him to give opportunities to players such as Mathews and C Moritz Wagner. “We have open spots and open minutes available, and we’re just trying to search it out and figure it out,” Brooks said. PATCHWORK LINEUP While the Heat’s lineup was familiar to fans who watched Miami’s surprising run to the NBA Finals in October, Washington's lineup wasn't as recognizable with Beal, Westbrook and Bryant out. Jerome Robinson, who started in place of Beal, had scored 15 points in five games. He had 12 points Saturday night. Beal leads the NBA with an average of 35 points.","401267296"
"Khris Middleton scores 27 points with 6 assists and 5 rebounds in the Bucks' 100-90 win over the Cavaliers. (1:40) MILWAUKEE -- — Khris Middleton scored 27 points and the Milwaukee Bucks withstood the absence of two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 100-90 on Saturday night. Antetokounmpo sat out with back spasms after taking a hard fall one night earlier in a loss to the Utah Jazz.  Middleton, an All-Star each of the last two seasons, continued his habit of putting up big numbers whenever Antetokounmpo is sidelined. “The ball's probably in his hands a little bit more on a night like tonight,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “When a teammate is down, he's a guy that wants to be there to help not just pick up that guy but the whole group. It's certainly been a trend for him. It's just a testament to how good he is.” Bobby Portis replaced Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee’s starting lineup and scored 17 points as the Bucks (6-4) closed a five-game home stretch in which they went 4-1. After Jrue Holiday made the game’s first basket, Portis scored the Bucks’ next 10 points. The Bucks overcame a huge performance from Cleveland’s Andre Drummond, who had 26 points and 24 rebounds. Drummond was the first Cavalier to have at least 20 points and 20 rebounds in the same game since Anderson Varejao did it against Boston on Jan. 31, 2012. “When he's the initiator of the force, there's nobody in the league who can guard him,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “I think we saw that tonight and against Memphis (a 94-90 win on Thursday). When he decides to put his chin down and play with that force, he's unguardable.” Cleveland (5-5) needed a big night from Drummond because it was missing so many weapons as it completed a six-game road swing. Collin Sexton, who averages a team-high 25.1 points, missed a second straight game with a sprained left ankle. Other sidelined Cavaliers included Kevin Love (strained right calf), Matthew Dellavedova (concussion), Dante Exum (strained right calf), Darius Garland (sprained right shoulder), Kevin Porter Jr. (personal reasons) and Dylan Windler (fractured left hand). Damyean Dotson scored 21 and Larry Nance Jr. added 17 for Cleveland. Holiday had 15, D.J. Wilson scored 12 and Donte DiVincenzo added 11 for Milwaukee. “I can’t say enough about what these guys are doing,” Bickerstaff said. “They’re many men down, and they haven’t used it as an excuse. They just continue to go out and scrap, continue to go out and fight. We came up short tonight, but I’m proud of their effort and the way they fought.” Cleveland rallied from a 19-point deficit to tie the game late in the second quarter, but Milwaukee closed the first half with a 10-0 run and led the rest of the way despite posting its lowest point total of the season. “Great teams, they don’t just win a game one way,” Middleton said. “They can win it in many different styles. The key thing is to win those games, no matter what.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: Bickerstaff said before the game that Cleveland’s short-handed roster means the Cavs must “make the game as ugly as we possibly can” by winning with defense. The Cavs became the first team to hold Milwaukee below 108 points this season, but they didn't have nearly enough offense to win the game. Bucks: Wilson had fallen out of the Bucks’ rotation and hadn’t played in their last three games, but he got an opportunity Saturday and capitalized. He shot 5 of 9 from the floor in his 16-minute stint. ... Pat Connaughton returned to action after missing three games with a groin injury. He scored six points in 11 minutes.","401267297"

"Luka Doncic flips in a a shot through contact facing away from the basket. (0:26) DALLAS -- — Tim Hardaway Jr. scored a season-high 36 points, Trey Burke did the same with 29 and Luka Doncic had another triple-double as the short-handed Dallas Mavericks beat the Orlando Magic 112-98 on Saturday night. Hardaway and Burke took on expanded roles to help Dallas get over .500 for the first time this season with starters Josh Richardson and Dorian Finney-Smith and backup point guard Jalen Brunson sidelined by COVID-19 protocols. The three Mavericks didn't return with the team from Denver following a 124-117 overtime win Thursday, and coach Rick Carlisle wouldn't discuss how long they would be out. One of the three, who hasn't been identified, tested positive for the virus. Hardaway and Burke made it a rather quiet second triple-double of the season for Doncic, combining to go 15 of 21 from 3-point range while the star point guard had 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. “We got here at 5 o’clock off the whole thing with the Denver trip,” Carlisle said of the team skipping a morning shootaround because of the COVID-19 issues. “I was really impressed with our level of focus and concentration. And it all started with Luka. He understood exactly what the situation was.” Burke, who missed the Denver trip because of an illness that Carlisle said wasn't coronavirus-related, was 7 of 8 from long range to help the Mavericks finish 20 of 40 against an Orlando team tied for the fewest 3s allowed per game coming in. “He’s a dangerous scorer,” Carlisle said. “One reason I think he plays well for us is that he knows that we have great confidence in him. He’s a guy that can just get white hot out there.” Nikola Vucevic had 30 points and 15 rebounds, and Aaron Gordon scored 16 points a night after missing a 42-point loss in Houston with a sore left hamstring as the Magic lost their ninth straight game in Dallas and fell to 2-4 since a 4-0 start. It was Orlando's second game without guard Markelle Fultz, out for the season with a knee injury, and Gordon said it was the first time he has played point guard since high school. “The team needs me to step up and carry some of the load of initiating the offense,” Gordon said. “I've got to take it on my shoulders to get us more organized. There were some times that it was just chaotic.” TIP-INS Magic: F Evan Fournier missed his fifth straight game with back spasms. Coach Steve Clifford said he might return Monday against Milwaukee. ... Vucevic missed his first five 3s and finished 2 of 7 while Gordon was 1 of 7. Orlando was 6 of 31 from beyond the arc.

Then he scored 16 in a roughly seven-minute span to begin the third as Portland rattled off a 22-8 run that ended any hopes of a Sacramento comeback. “He's just playing. He's finding his rhythm,” Portland forward Carmelo Anthony said. ""He’s in his groove right now, and he’s leading us at this moment. We all know he can score the basketball. but it’s how he’s doing it. ... His feel for the game is getting better each year.” Damian Lillard scored 17 points for Portland and Anthony added 13. Marvin Bagley III had 15 points for the Kings, who shot just 40.7 % (33 for 81) from the floor. They went 8 for 30 from beyond the arc and committed 15 turnovers that Portland converted into 30 points. But defense is the biggest issue for the Kings right now. “We just have to understand at this level, against a team like Portland and whoever we're playing, we have to bring it every single night, and that’s what we’re looking for,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""It was a tough one for us tonight.” The Blazers made eight of their first 13 shots on the way to a 38-point first quarter.

They had the ball down five late in the fourth, but Rudy Gobert blocked a shot by Mason Plumlee, and Mike Conley made two free throws to make it 93-86 with 1:00 remaining. “The offense was really good in the first half,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""For us to be able to get stops when we weren’t clicking on offense — we won a different way this game.” Conley finished with 22 points. Utah improved to 3-2 on its seven-game road trip. The Jazz beat Milwaukee on Friday, making a franchise-record 25 3-pointers in the process. Their shooting took a turn for the worse in Detroit, where they went just 11 of 35 from beyond the arc, but the Pistons were even worse at 10 of 42. Detroit trailed by 15 after the first quarter, and it ultimately didn't matter that the Pistons outscored the Jazz the rest of the way. “It goes back to our starts,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""You spot a team that much — 34 to 19 in the first quarter — it’s tough to survive that way.” The Jazz shot 61% from the field in that first quarter. “It sets the tone, whether it’s offensive or defensively, when we have a start of the game like we had today,"" Gobert said.

"Kawhi Leonard pours in 35 points, including 21 in the third quarter, to fuel the Clippers' 130-127 win over the Bulls. (2:00) LOS ANGELES -- — Freed from the pesky mask he'd been wearing on court for two weeks, Kawhi Leonard cut loose. Getting a steal and a dunk, hitting 3-pointer after 3-pointer. He finished with a season-high 35 points, going over 10,000 in his career, and the Los Angeles Clippers rallied to beat the Chicago Bulls 130-127 on Sunday. “It's a steppingstone, but I don't really care about it,” Leonard said of his milestone. “Maybe when I retire I’ll sit back and look at the accomplishments. Right now it’s about being greedy and wanting more.” Leonard reached the 10,000 plateau on one of his five 3-pointers in the third quarter, when he scored 21 points. His points and 3-pointers made were the most in a single quarter in his career. “He understood how they were guarding him and he took advantage of it,” teammate Paul George said. “He was hot, so we definitely kept finding him.” Leonard's last 3-pointer in the quarter gave the Clippers their first lead since they scored the game's first basket. In all, he had seven 3-pointers, tying his career high. “We needed every bit of it,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said.

He got a steal and dunk for his first points of the third, then made five straight 3-pointers before closing out his explosive quarter with a pair of baskets, the last of which tied the game at 87. For the first time in two weeks, Leonard no longer needs the on-court mask he wore strapped around his head to protect eight stitches in his mouth. He got hit by teammate Serge Ibaka's elbow at Denver on Christmas. George had 28 points, seven rebounds and nine assists for the Clippers, who avoided their first three-game losing streak of the season. Lou Williams added 21 points off the bench. Zach LaVine led six Bulls in double figures with a season-high 45 points — four off his career high — and he made a season-best 10 3-pointers. Garrett Temple added 18 points and Patrick Williams had 17 points. Coby White had a career-high 13 assists. Chicago dropped its third in a row for the first time since starting the season 0-3. “We were frustrated we kept letting him (LaVine) get looks that he liked,” George said, “but at our end we were happy and excited that Kawhi had it going.” The Bulls shot 61% from the floor and 55% from 3-point range. The Clippers chased the Bulls through the first three quarters, falling behind by 13. Lou Williams' basket tied the game at 94 heading into the fourth. Los Angeles led by six in the fourth before Temple's three-point play put the Bulls ahead 119-118. Nicolas Batum hit a 3-pointer in front of the Clippers' bench with Thaddeus Young in his face, got fouled and made the free throw, launching an 8-0 run that gave Los Angeles a 126-119 lead. LaVine had a three-point play and a 3-pointer over Marcus Morris Sr. to pull the Bulls to 126-125. White got called for his fourth foul, putting George at the line. He made both for a 128-125 lead. LaVine airballed a 3-pointer from the top of the key with six seconds to go. “I got ten 3s. I’m going to come down and try to make a play,” he said. “I got a clean look. I just didn’t get legs on it.” LaVine got called for his fourth foul and George made both free throws for a 130-125 lead. Temple's late basket closed the scoring for Chicago.

"Caris LeVert gets creative as he bounces the ball between Al Horford's legs to Jarrett Allen for a dunk. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 129-116 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. Gilgeous-Alexander was one of six players to finish in double-figure scoring for the Thunder, who won their third straight and beat Brooklyn for the fifth consecutive time. “It’s been a great road trip,” said Hamidou Diallo, who finished with 25 points, Al Horford had 22, George Hill added 14, and Lugentz Dort and Isaiah Roby had 13 each. Whereas the Thunder left Barclays Center feeling good about themselves, Brooklyn's first-year coach Steve Nash had the opposite feeling about his team's play. “I didn't sense the pride. I didn't sense the competitive fire in the second half,” Nash said of the Nets. Kevin Durant scored 36 points to lead Brooklyn. The loss was the second straight for the Nets. Caris LeVert added 21 points, Jarrett Allen had 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot scored 12. “We (have) to toughen up and show a little more pride,” Nash said. Making the loss harder to digest was the Nets had gotten Durant back after he had sat out Brooklyn’s previous three games — a stretch in which they won two of three — due to the league’s quarantine policy after being exposed to COVID-19. “COVID put us under these circumstances and a lot of guys around the league are under protocol, so it was something we knew coming into the season may happen,” Durant said. “I'm glad I'm back playing, (though).” Midway through the third quarter, Durant drove past Darius Bazley and flipped in a layup as he drew a foul. As Durant strolled to the free-throw line, a frustrated Bazely disgustedly fired the ball off the stanchion. The three-point play gave Brooklyn a 74-69 lead. It didn’t last, as Oklahoma City went on a 25-7 run to finish the quarter with a 94-81 advantage. The Thunder kept the pressure on in the fourth, as they opened the quarter with a Diallo dunk and a 17-foot jumper sandwiched around a 3-pointer from Theo Maledon. “We have a team that’s really well-intentioned,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “We want to run through the finish line.” TIP-INS: Nets: Despite the return of Durant, Brooklyn was not at full strength as Kyrie Irving missed his third straight game due to an undisclosed issue which is believed to be the guard’s distress over the insurrection at the Capitol on Wednesday. During his pregame availability, Nash said Irving and the team have been in communication but declined to offer specifics, saying the talks are “a private matter.” Irving had started Brooklyn’s first seven games, averaging 27.1 , 6.1 assists, and 5.3 rebounds. “I don’t worry about (Irving) falling out of rhythm,” Nash said. “He’s a brilliant basketball player.” Thunder: Oklahoma City was coming off of a 101-89 rout of the New York Knicks on Friday night at Madison Square Garden. Entering Sunday night’s game, opponents were outscoring the Thunder by an average of 6.1 points per game, while Brooklyn ranked third in the league in scoring with an average of 118.8 points per game. “Tactically,” rookie forward Aleksej Pokusevski said during his pregame availability, “we have to be there.” They were as the Thunder limited Brooklyn to seven second chance points and nine fast break points.","401267303"
"Gary Harris gets a hand in the way of the pass and corrals the loose ball before taking it coast-to-coast for an easy slam. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — Nikola Jokic had 22 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in another short night, and the Denver Nuggets reached .500 for the first time this season with a 114-89 victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday. The Nuggets opened 1-4 after reaching the Western Conference finals last season but have now answered with four wins in five games. The last two were easy. The Nuggets pulled away from the seven-man 76ers in the third quarter and rested their starters in the fourth of a 115-103 victory Saturday. They jumped on the Knicks much earlier Sunday and it was never a game after halftime. This was the first time the Nuggets allowed fewer than 100 points this season. “I think our defense in the last five has been a lot better than it was to begin the season in the first five games,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “A marked improvement.” Gary Harris added 14 points for the Nuggets, who got only nine from star guard Jamal Murray. “I think Jokic puts a lot of pressure on you, so you can’t let your guard down for a second,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “And I thought we got in a hole early and when you give a team like that that type of confidence, it’s very difficult to come back on them.” Julius Randle had 29 points, 10 rebounds and five assists for the Knicks, which the team said made him the only player other than Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson to have at least 200 points, 115 rebounds and 70 assists in his team’s first 10 games of a season. But Randle had little help with nobody else over 12 points as the Knicks dropped their second straight following a three-game winning streak. They were held to an anemic 89 points in both games. Denver led 28-21 after one, then made its first six shots of the second with its reserves on the floor to open a 40-22 lead on JaMychal Green's layup. The lead ballooned to 22 late in the first half before the Nuggets took a 59-38 advantage to the break. “We huddle up before the tipoff and just say let’s be better than the other team’s bench,” reserve Monte Morris said. “Let’s go out there and try to bring the energy and if the starters start slow let’s pick them up ,and if they start fast let’s sustain whatever they got going on.” Jokic had eight points while playing the whole third quarter and the Nuggets led by as much as 30 in the fourth. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver has won 19 of the last 24 meetings. ... Morris and PJ Dozier both scored 12 points off the bench. Knicks: Thibodeau said rookie Obi Toppin, limited to one game thus far because of a strained right calf, is making steady progress but still not cleared for anything except individual work. Frank Ntilikina (sprained right knee) is probably out another week before a further update. COACHING COLLEAGUES Thibodeau and Malone were Knicks assistants two decades ago under Jeff Van Gundy, part of a staff that included current Orlando coach Steve Clifford and former NBA Coach of the Year Don Chaney. “We had a lot of guys and so I think we all learned from each other,” Thibodeau said, “and that was the best part of that staff, is you felt like you were going to the best clinic in the world every day.” Malone recalled when the demanding Thibodeau got to coach the Knicks' entrant in the former Boston summer league. “I remember Don Chaney would have ice bags on after practice because Thibs’ summer league practices were like five hours long,” Malone said.","401267304"
"DeMarcus Cousins receives a flagrant foul for his hit to the head on the steal attempt against LeBron James and is ejected from the game. (0:52) HOUSTON -- — Anthony Davis had 27 points, LeBron James added 18 and the Los Angeles Lakers won for the sixth time in seven games with a 120-102 victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday night. “(Tonight) was just A.D. being A.D. and just having him back in the lineup gives us a whole other dynamic both offensively and defensively,"" James said. It was a testy game that included five technical fouls, two flagrant fouls and the first-half ejections of Markieff Morris and DeMarcus Cousins. Davis, who sat out on Friday with a groin strain, helped the Lakers finish with 62 points in the paint in a game in which they led by as many as 27. “His shot-making just makes him so difficult to guard and he can hurt you in so many ways,"" Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel said. The Lakers were up by double figures for most of the night and opened the fourth quarter with a 10-4 run to push the lead to 98-79 with about nine minutes remaining. Houston used a 7-2 run, with a 3-pointer from Ben McLemore, later in the quarter to get within 15 with about five minutes to go. But former Rocket Montrezl Harrell scored four quick points to make it 108-89 and both teams took out most of their starters soon after that. Christian Wood scored 23 points and James Harden had 20 in the first of two straight games against the Lakers with the second one coming Tuesday night in Houston. “Two things for us were the turnovers and transition,"" Houston coach Stephen Silas said. “The transition doesn’t have anything to do with us being together for a day, a month, or a year. Run back.” Morris was ejected in the first quarter after an altercation with Cousin s. Morris knocked Jae’Sean Tate to the ground in the lane with a hard shoulder to the chest and Cousins quickly pushed Morris to the ground. Cousins then turned and was bending down to help Tate off the court when Morris jumped up, charged at Cousins and shoved him with both hands. He was quickly pulled away by teammates and officials but continued jawing at Cousins and trying to follow him to the Houston bench. After a video review Morris received a flagrant 1 foul for the play on Tate and was given a technical foul and ejected for the ensuing dustup. Cousins was also given a technical foul but was not ejected. But he wouldn’t remain in the game much longer. James was driving to the basket early in the second quarter when Cousins tried swipe at the ball but instead hit him in the head and face. James fell to the court where he remained for a few seconds before slowly getting up and remaining in the game. The play was reviewed and Cousins was given a flagrant 2 foul and ejected. Houston came out flat after Friday night’s blowout win over the Magic and the Lakers had a 19-point lead at halftime. Los Angeles opened the third quarter with an 11-3 run, capped by a 3 from Dennis Schroder, to make it 76-49 with about nine minutes left in the quarter. TIP-INS Lakers: Talen Horton-Tucker had 17 points off the bench. ... Harrell had 16 points and eight rebounds. Rockets: Danuel House missed his fourth straight game with back spasms. ...

"D'Angelo Russell hits Malik Beasley in stride with a sweet bounce pass through traffic. (0:16) MINNEAPOLIS -- — D’Angelo Russell had 27 points, five rebounds and five assists as the Minnesota Timberwolves snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 96-88 win Sunday over the San Antonio Spurs. Russell scored eight of his points in the fourth quarter, including a 3-pointer to tie the score with 7:02 left and two free throws to ice it with 31.5 seconds remaining. Russell and Malik Beasley, who added 24 points, helped the Wolves get their first win since Dec. 26. “I thought we had a number of guys who just got fed up with losing at that point and knowing that the defensive end was where it was going to get done,” said Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders. With the score tied at 81, Minnesota scored five straight points and didn’t relinquish the lead. One of the biggest shots in the fourth quarter was a 3-pointer by forward Juancho Hernangómez, who had airballed his previous two shots from 3-point range earlier in the game. Minnesota was playing without star big man Karl-Anthony Towns, who returned to action Saturday after missing six games with a partial dislocation of his left wrist. Sunday’s absence was part of the plan to ease Towns back in and not a result of any reaggravation of his injury. Sunday’s win was Minnesota’s first without Towns this season. The Spurs were also without their leading scorer in DeMar DeRozan, who did not play due to personal reasons. DeRozan had 38 points in Saturday’s overtime win against Minnesota. Lonnie Walker IV picked up the scoring slack with DeRozan out, with a season-high 25 points to lead the Spurs. He paced the offense in the first half with 17 points on 8-of-14 shooting. “It’s been a good run here on the road, but we just ran out of gas,” said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. ""We hit a wall and couldn’t get through it.” LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points for the Spurs, and Patty Mills scored 18. Minnesota’s defense down the stretch was instrumental. This was the first time the Timberwolves had held an opponent to under 100 points since Jan. 2, 2020. “I felt like defensively, the last couple games have been lacking a spark,” said guard Josh Okogie, who returned to the floor Sunday after missing six games with a strained left hamstring. “That’s just why I tried to come in here and focus my energy on defense.” GETTING DIRTY Timberwolves forward Jarred Vanderbilt scored just five points off the bench Sunday, but his work on the glass received praise from his coach and teammates. Vanderbilt had a team-high eight rebounds in 19 minutes, earning himself a comparison to another pretty good rebounder. “He’s like Dennis Rodman for us,” Beasley said. “He does the dirty work.” TIP-INS Spurs: Walker’s previous season high was 16 points in the season opener against Memphis. … Mills scored 13 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter. Timberwolves: Okogie returned to action Sunday after missing six games with a hamstring injury. He was on a minutes restriction and scored six points in 20 minutes. … Rookie Anthony Edwards went scoreless on 0-for-8 shooting. He had a career-high 26 points at Portland on Thursday.","401267307"
"Steve Kerr says he once fined Steph Curry, Draymond Green and Drake for being late to the Warriors' plane. (0:58) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Damion Lee converted the tying and go-ahead free throws with 3.3 seconds left and the Golden State Warriors withstood a rough fourth quarter to hold off the Toronto Raptors 106-105 on Sunday night despite uncharacteristic struggles by Stephen Curry. Curry shot 2 of 16 and missed nine of his 10 3s for 11 points after scoring 143 over his previous four games, including a career-high 62 one week earlier against Portland. “My offense, I expect it to be there every night,” Curry said. “With how teams are defending night to night, being able to figure that out, in terms of us just having confidence across the board no matter who’s out there on the floor, I like where we’re at right now.” Pascal Siakam missed a jumper as the buzzer sounded but finished with 25 points, and Fred VanVleet scored 21 for Toronto in a rematch of the 2019 NBA Finals won in six games by the Raptors. “It went in and out, pretty clean look,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Siakam's last look. The Raptors challenged a foul call on Kyle Lowry beyond the right side of the arc that originally would have given Lee three shots. It was determined on review the foul was before the shot — the third play that went to replay in the final 34.4 seconds. All three calls were confirmed. Andrew Wiggins had 17 points and matched his career high with four blocked shots as Golden State nearly squandered away a game it led by 17 against an opponent that had scored a franchise-record 144 points Friday at Sacramento. Kent Bazemore made a go-ahead lay-in with 1:06 to play for Golden State before VanVleet knocked down a jumper on the other end. Curry turned the ball over with 34.4 seconds remaining and that went to review. Lowry missed a 3-point try and Golden State got one more chance with 7.6 ticks on the clock — another review that stood determining it was Warriors ball. Lowry missed Friday’s game for personal reasons but returned and contributed 17 points, nine rebounds and six assists. His layup with 7:13 remaining pulled the Raptors within 94-90. VanVleet's basket at 4:05 made it a one-point game before Kelly Oubre Jr. hit his first 3-pointer of the night moments later. Eric Paschall scored 15 points off the bench on a night the Warriors reserves produced 46 points. Lee had 13 with three 3s. Late in the third, Golden State's defense showed just how much it is doing for the Warriors: drawing a 24-second violation by Toronto one possession, and then Yuta Watanabe stepped out of bounds the next. Toronto committed another shot-clock turnover in the fourth. “We have enough talent, enough weapons to overcome a bad shooting performance,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. HONORING EDUCATORS For their “Educators Night,” the Warriors hosted 50 fans from the Oakland and San Francisco Unified School Districts to watch from their virtual fan section at Chase Center, recognizing them for their essential work. Kaiser Permanente donated $40,000 to be split evenly between districts. TIP-INS Raptors: Chris Boucher had six blocks before fouling out against his former team. ... Toronto missed its first nine shots and initial five 3s. ... The Raptors are 1-5 on the road. ... Toronto had won three straight in the series, most recently beating the Warriors to clinch a playoff berth in March 2020. Warriors: Curry didn’t take his first shot until sinking a 12-foot jumper with 2:50 left in the first. ... Draymond Green added 10 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. ... Wiggins didn't practice in Saturday's light shootaround session but was probable despite a sore left quad — and he has still scored in double figures every game.","401267308"
"Kevin Knox II goes in for the layup but gets surprised by P.J. Washington who comes in and swats the ball off the court. (0:17) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Gordon Hayward came to Charlotte looking for an expanded role and an opportunity to turn a struggling Hornets franchise into a winner. The 30-year-old small forward is getting both done while playing some of the best basketball of his career. Hayward scored 34 points and the Charlotte Hornets beat the New York Knicks 109-88 on Monday night for their fourth straight win. Hayward has been on fire for the Hornets during the team’s winning streak, averaging 29.2 points while shooting 55% from the floor and 92% from the foul line. “It's been a lot of fun playing with my new teammates and under this coaching staff,” Hayward said. “I'm having a great time. As long as we keep doing our jobs and playing hard every night I think the wins and losses will take are of themselves.” Hayward scored 28 points in the first half on 8-of-12 shooting from the field and 10-of-10 shooting from the foul line to give the Hornets 57-50 lead at halftime. He finished 11 of 17 from the field as the Hornets came in with an aggressive approach against a Knicks team playing on the second night of a back-to-back. “This is why we brought Gordon Hayward here,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “He set the tone for us and came out aggressive. He understands the significance of every game.” Devonte Graham had 19 points and seven assists for Charlotte, and P.J. Washington had 13 points as the Hornets handed the Knicks their third straight defeat. Kevin Knox had 19 points to lead the Knicks, and Mitchell Robinson had 12 points and 11 rebounds. The Hornets scored 24 points off 17 Knicks turnovers. Charlotte committed 10 turnovers while climbing above .500 for the first time this season. Knicks guard Austin Rivers said everyone needs to take a “deep breath” and not worry about the team's losing streak. “We have played some of the best teams in the NBA ... and half of our team is out with injuries,” Rivers said. “So guys have to step up and be better. Our defense has been horrendous and that has led to a bad offense.” RANDLE QUIET Julius Randle came into the game averaging 23.2 points and 11.8 rebounds per game for the Knicks but was held to 11 points and five rebounds and was a non-factor for much of the night. “Julius is getting double-teamed and triple-teamed right now with his post up, trying to get the ball out of his hands and we can operate off of that,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeaux said. “We have to have good spacing, and right now we are hesitating a little bit and I don’t want them to do that.” BALL UPDATE LaMelo Ball, who became the youngest player in NBA history to record a triple-double on Saturday night against the Hawks, was 3 of 13 from the field and finished with eight points, a career-high 14 rebounds and seven assists.

"Brandon Clarke reaches way back with one hand for the alley-oop dunk vs. the Cavaliers. (0:18) CLEVELAND -- — Dillon Brooks had 21 points and seven rebounds, and the Memphis Grizzlies recovered after blowing a 16-point lead to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 101-91 on Monday night. Brandon Clarke scored 15 points and Tyus Jones had 13 points, seven assists and three steals for the Grizzlies, who won their second straight and improved to 3-1 on the road. Kyle Anderson added eight points, six rebounds and nine assists. “The togetherness of this group impresses me and these guys embrace the challenge of being on the road,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “You have to create your own energy when you’re not at home and they’ve been able to do that.” Memphis led 73-57 late in the third quarter, but Cleveland responded with a 27-8 run capped by Damyean Dotson’s basket with 6:43 left in the fourth to go ahead by three. A 3-pointer by De’Anthony Melton put the Grizzlies back in front for good at 89-86. Brooks closed out the victory by drawing the sixth foul on Cavaliers center Andre Drummond and making two free throws in the final minute. “It felt amazing to figure it out and to execute plays with the right pace at the end,” said Brooks, who had 12 points, five boards and two blocked shots in the second half. “It’s great to win. We just have to keep it going.” Drummond had 19 points and 14 rebounds for his 11th straight double-double to start the season, extending his team record. Dotson had 14 points and six assists, and Cedi Osman scored 14 points. Point guard Collin Sexton was expected to start but was a late scratch for Cleveland with a sprained left ankle. The third-year pro, who is averaging a team-high 25.1 points, missed his third game in a row. Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said he was informed Sexton couldn't go right before the national anthem. Cleveland returned to Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse after its longest road trip of the season, covering six games and 10 days. The Cavaliers beat the Grizzlies 94-90 four days earlier. The Grizzlies took their largest lead at 73-57 on an uncontested layup by rookie Desmond Bane. Their 26-11 run to open the second half was highlighted by an alley-oop from Jones to Clarke. “When you turn the ball over 21 times, it's damn near impossible,” Bickerstaff said. “We hit some bumps tonight.” Cleveland failed to reach 100 points for the eighth straight game and is 2-6 during that span. The Ohio Department of Health permitted 1,944 fans inside the arena, which is 10% of capacity. Cleveland had been limited to 300 spectators due to COVID-19 restrictions. NEXT MAN UP Dotson made his third consecutive start filling in for Sexton. They were his first three NBA starts at point guard. “I give a lot of credit to Dot for helping us a ton,” Bickerstaff said. “It’s not easy for a shooting guard to move to the point. Instead of just worrying about yourself, you have to worry about 14 other guys.” TIP-INS Grizzlies: G Ja Morant (left ankle sprain) missed his seventh straight game after being injured on Dec. 28 at Brooklyn.

"Aaron Gordon powers down the lane and dunks over Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:16) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo returned from a one-game absence because of a minor back injury and scored 22 points as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Orlando Magic 121-99 on Monday night. Antetokounmpo, the reigning two-time NBA MVP, started slowly and battled through second-half foul trouble before coming alive in the fourth quarter. Milwaukee won a second straight and beat Orlando for a fifth consecutive time in the regular season. “At the end of the day, I had five fouls, but I was just trying to play the game, go downhill and get my teammates involved,” said Antetokounmpo, who had six rebounds and four assists. “I was just wanting to execute down the stretch.” Khris Middleton finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Bucks, while reserve Bobby Portis played well for a second straight game, scoring 20 points. Nikola Vucevic had 28 points and 13 rebounds to lead the short-handed Magic, who have lost three straight since Markelle Fultz was lost to a season-ending knee injury. Aaron Gordon had 21 points, eight assists and five rebounds and contributed solid defense against Antetokounmpo. “We felt like we played OK for three quarters and we were right there and then we just made too many mistakes on both ends of the fourth,” Vucevic said. “Milwaukee is a team that’s going to take advantage of it.” Milwaukee missed 17 of its first 24 3-point shots but drilled six 3s in the fourth quarter. Seconds after Gordon spectacularly dunked over Antetokounmpo to get the Magic within 88-86, Milwaukee’s superstar forward hit a straight-on 3-pointer that quieted the pandemic-restricted crowd of 3,248. He followed that up by finding Portis for another 3 as the Bucks went on a 22-2 run. “He puts in a lot of time and effort in and he’s growing in all ways,” Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. “It was just two big plays because the momentum could have swung on the (Gordon) dunk. It’s a huge momentum swing for him to make the 3 and then to create the open 3 for Bobby.” The teams were playing for the first time since last August, when they squared off in a first-round playoff series in the bubble at Walt Disney World. Orlando won Game 1 of that series before Milwaukee captured the next four. Milwaukee also won the four regular-season meetings with Orlando last season. Milwaukee led 63-54 at the half despite missing 13 of its first 17 3-point shots. The Bucks forced eight turnovers in the second quarter and 11 in the first half and turned those Magic mistakes into 17 points. In the fourth quarter, the Magic shot 7 of 21, including 1 of 8 from 3-point range. “The game was the first 3 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter where we had just poor possessions on offense, lack of purpose and fouling at the other end of the floor,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Bryn Forbes added 14 points and three 3s for Milwaukee, which shot 50.5% from the floor. TIP-INS Bucks: Monday marked the Orlando return of D.J. Augustin, who played for the Magic the previous four seasons. Augustin averaged double digits in scoring each of the last three seasons and hit the game-winning 3 for the Magic in Game 1 of the 2019 NBA playoffs. After drafting point guard Cole Anthony with the No. 15 pick, the Magic informed Augustin that they wouldn’t be pursuing him in free agency. Said Clifford: “In my 21 years, for me, he’s one of the favorite guys I’ve ever coached. … Those calls when people leave are never easy. That was a difficult conversation.” Augustin finished with eight points and four assists on Monday. Magic: When guard Evan Fournier hobbled off the court on Dec. 31 because of back spasms, the injury wasn’t initially thought to be serious. However, Fournier missed his sixth consecutive game on Monday. Clifford said the guard won’t play Wednesday and could miss Friday and Saturday’s games as well. ... After initially being ruled out earlier in the day, James Ennis started and played on a strained hamstring.","401267311"

Mikal Bridges also had 14. “We didn’t play our basketball,” Booker said. “We played the brand of basketball that they play, and it didn’t work out for us.” Beal, the NBA’s leading scorer, had eight rebounds and nine assists. He missed Saturday’s game with Miami because he was in the NBA’s health and safety protocol. “I was a little beat up,” Beal said. In his previous two games, Beal scored 101 points, tying the team record with 60 points on Wednesday at Philadelphia and hitting for 41 at Boston on Saturday. Washington never trailed and was ahead by 32 with 4:16 to play in the second quarter. They held the Suns to just 14.8% (4 for 27) from 3-point range. “I think we did a good job of defending,” Beal said. “Tonight was the first time we guarded the right way.” The Wizards played their first game without center Thomas Bryant, who suffered a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Bryant injured the knee in the first two minutes of Saturday’s game and is likely to miss the rest of the season. Robin Lopez started in Bryant’s place and had 11 points and 11 rebounds. He’s having a great time playing with Beal. “Watching him handle the ball, watching him do his work, it’s something incredible,” Lopez said. “You see something different. You see something special so often.” Davis Bertans had 18 points for Washington, all on 3-pointers. TIP-INS Suns: F/C Jalen Smith missed his third straight game for health and safety protocol reasons. … G Cameron Payne was out for the second time with a strained right ankle. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks said Westbrook originally hurt the quadriceps more than a month ago. “He got hit pretty bad in his quad in training camp,” Brooks said. “It bothered him. He pushed through it.” Westbrook aggravated the injury Wednesday in Philadelphia, and Brooks said he also dislocated a finger, and the rest will help both injuries. HI MOM! Phoenix coach Monty Williams saw his mother on Sunday for the first time since Thanksgiving 2019, but it was a socially distanced visit. Williams, who’s from the Washington D.C. area, had his mother drive to the parking lot of the team’s hotel, and using a selfie stick, took a photo. “I was able to talk to her from a distance and that’s all you can do, man,” Williams said. “I wanted to abide by the rules, but I also wanted to see my mother’s face. That was a good thing for me.” REPLACING BRYANT Brooks said that losing Bryant was difficult to digest. “It was a punch in the gut,” Brooks said. “He’s pretty bummed out, for obvious reasons.” Without Bryant, Brooks said that Lopez and Moritz Wagner would get additional minutes. “We’ve got options,” Brooks said. “Moe is going to get opportunities. If everything stayed the same, his minutes were going to be limited. Now, he has a golden opportunity.”","401267312"
"Cam Reddish runs down the lane and elevates for an alley-oop dunk vs. the 76ers. (0:20) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 26 points, including the first three baskets of Atlanta's dominant start to the second half, and the Hawks beat the short-handed Philadelphia 76ers 112-94 on Monday night. De'Andre Hunter and Brandon Goodwin had 15 points as the Hawks snapped a four-game losing streak. Clint Capela added 12 points and 10 rebounds as six Atlanta players scored in double figures. Young, who was held to a combined 22 points in his last two games, regained his scoring touch. He opened the second half with a jumper before adding back-to-back layups. “We were just playing fast, getting back to what we do and the shots were just going in,” Young said. “You could see the confidence with everybody rolling.” Young's spurt keyed Atlanta's 15-2 run to open the half. The Hawks stretched a 65-50 halftime advantage to an 80-52 lead with the run. “I think the most important part of the game was how we came out after the break, and Trae was a big part of that,” said Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce. Atlanta led 95-65 late in the third before Young and other starters sat out the final period. Joel Embiid led Philadelphia with 24 points and 11 rebounds. Isaiah Joe had 18 points. The Sixers used nine players. That may have seemed like an abundance of depth after Philadelphia was limited to only seven players in Saturday's 115-103 home loss to Denver. Forward Mike Scott (knee) and Embiid (back tightness) returned to add depth. Philadelphia is far from full strength. Ben Simmons (sore left knee) was again held out. The depth problems will continue through the week after Seth Curry tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday. Tobias Harris and reserves Shake Milton, Matisse Thybulle and Vincent Poirier were again held out due to COVID-19 protocols. The NBA called off two games on Monday due to the virus. “No one is going to feel sorry for us,” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers. “We’ve got to try to win these games. We’ve in a tough spot with COVID. ... I have a sneaking feeling a lot of teams are going to have this problem.” Rookie Tyrese Maxey, who scored 39 points in his first start against Denver, had 15. TIP-INS 76ers: Rivers said he hopes Simmons (sore left knee) can return Tuesday night against Miami after missing his second consecutive game. “We thought it'd be one game and now it's two,” Rivers said. The team was fined $25,000 on Monday for failing to list Simmons on the initial injury report Saturday's game against Denver. ... F Furkan Korkmaz (groin) was held out. Hawks: Pierce had no update on the severity of G Bogdan Bogdanovic's avulsion fracture in his right knee. The team announced Sunday soft tissue inflammation and a bone bruise also was diagnosed. Bogdanovic was one of the major offseason acquisitions for Atlanta, signing a four-year, $72 million contract in free agency. ... G Tony Snell (right foot) made his season debut midway through the fourth period and missed each of his three shots. ALL 3s John Collins took only seven shots, and all were 3s. He made four of them to score 12 points. “He shot 3s because they played big and they played down the floor,” Pierce said of the Sixers. FAMILY AND FRIENDS ONLY The Hawks have pushed back their plan to allow about 1,700 ticketed fans to home games. The target date to allow 10% capacity was changed from Jan. 18 to Jan. 26. The Hawks credited “an abundance of caution” for making the change after after consulting with state and health officials. The team has had only a few family and friends attend home games.","401267313"
"Damian Lillard takes the defensive rebound down the court, past defenders, knocks down the reverse layup, and draws the foul. (0:27) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — CJ McCollum scored 30 points, including the go-ahead jumper with 9.6 seconds left to give the Portland Trail Blazers a 112-111 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Monday night. Damian Lillard added 23 points and Carmelo Anthony scored 20 off the bench for the Blazers, who erased a 17-point deficit and overcame Pascal Siakam’s first career triple-double of 22 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. McCollum hit his clutch shot over Fred VanVleet off a spectacular series of dribble moves. “I work on this stuff,” McCollum said. “I work on my game. I tell people all the time: `I’ve been ready.’” Anthony had 13 points in the fourth quarter, including several big shots from right in front of Toronto’s bench — where the Raptors made noise all night. He relished the moment and the banter. “Yeah, it’s fun,” Anthony said. “You’re going to hear it even more with no fans. You live for those moments. You want that pressure on you. (There’s) nothing like making shots in front of the opposing team’s bench as they are yelling at you.” Siakam’s potential game-winning shot rimmed out on the final play — for the second time in two nights. The same thing happened to him in a one-point loss Sunday to Golden State. McCollum also thought he had something to do with Robert Covington’s defense on Siakam’s shot. “I told (Covington) that Siakam felt like he had a matchup against him tonight and I think he took it personally,” McCollum said. For the Raptors, it was yet another close loss that left them 2-8, tied for the worst record in the NBA. “We fought hard to get wins and it came down to a couple of possessions,” Siakam said. “If we had made a couple of shots, we’d have a different record right now. But if you look at the record, it’s tough.” Portland starting center Jusuf Nurkic went to the locker room in the first half with a bruised quadriceps and did not return. His replacement, Enes Kanter, did a solid job filling in with 14 points and six rebounds in 16 minutes off the bench. Siakam gave the Raptors a 111-110 lead with 54 seconds left on a cutting layup. After an empty Blazers possession, VanVleet missed a jumper on the other end for Toronto before McCollum put Portland ahead. Siakam was dominant early, racking up 12 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the first quarter, which he capped by hitting a jumper at the buzzer. Toronto held a 32-21 lead after the Blazers shot just 36% in the period. The Raptors pushed their lead to 52-35 in the second quarter, but Portland closed the half on a 20-8 run and trailed 60-55 at the break. Kanter gave the Blazers their first lead at 61-60 in the third quarter, but the Raptors answered and led 86-76 heading into the fourth. Siakam picked up his fifth foul while guarding McCollum with 6:37 remaining. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland coach Terry Stotts was asked before the game about the bench pairing of Kanter and Anthony, particularly on the defensive end. “I look at the net rating rather than offensive and defensive rating,” Stotts said. “The last four or five game they’ve been a net positive. There’s been a lot of conversation about that. I think Enes and Melo have played really well together the last five games.” Raptors: Relying on a smaller unit again, coach Nick Nurse benched starting center Alex Len for the entire second half. Fellow big man Aron Baynes did not play. Toronto began the day ranked 18th in the NBA in defensive rating, but held Stephen Curry to 2-for-16 shooting Sunday night against Golden State. According to Nurse, part of that was going small — but he hopes to find more time for Len and Baynes while still playing solid defense. “Our last six quarters of defense are what we’re used to,” Nurse said before Monday’s game. “Maybe it’s some other factors, but it seems to me the small lineup has given us a chance to play that way. But again, we have to figure something out with those guys on the floor.”","401267315"
"De'Aaron Fox throws down a monster dunk on Malcolm Brogdon, sending the Kings' bench into a frenzy. (0:25) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Buddy Hield made a big 3-pointer moments after Indiana’s Domantas Sabonis had a basket taken away following a replay review, and the Sacramento Kings beat the Pacers 127-122 on Monday night. Hield finished with 18 points on six 3s as the Kings won for the second time in seven games. Harrison Barnes had a season-high 30 points and eight rebounds, and De’Aaron Fox added 21 points and nine assists. “This was probably our best win just because it was consistent throughout,” Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. “It wasn’t a ton of highs or a ton of lows. It was just consistent basketball. Win or lose, this is how we have to play.” The Kings held a one-point lead when Sabonis went up underneath the basket and was credited with a bucket as Richaun Holmes was called for goaltending with 1:25 remaining. After a lengthy review, the call was overturned. After Hield’s 3 made it 121-117, Indiana’s Victor Oladipo missed from beyond the arc. Fox then scored on a soaring one-handed dunk. “As a group we know we didn’t put forth our best effort these last couple of games,” Holmes said. “It’s about staying locked in. This is how we feel we can play every night. This has to be the standard.” Sabonis had 28 points and 11 rebounds for the Pacers. Malcolm Brogdon added 24 points, while Oladipo and Doug McDermott scored 21 apiece. Indiana forced turnovers on two of the first three possessions of the game, but coach Nate Bjorkgren felt the Pacers' defense broke down at key times. “We have to do a better job on the ball, just being more active there, so they can’t have their pinpoint precise passes right into their shooting pocket like a coach would pass it,” Bjorkgren said. “That wasn’t much fun tonight.” Oladipo scored 14 of 17 points for Indiana during a late stretch in the fourth. He, too, blamed the Pacers' defense. “We just have to do a better job of getting stops and do a better job of sacrificing on that end,” Oladipo said. “We have to talk better. We have to communicate better. We have to be decisive and smart. It’s the little things right now. It’s not something major we can’t fix.” Fox made a buzzer-beating 3 to end the first half with the Kings up 65-64. It came 10 seconds after Brogdon’s 3-pointer over the outstretched arm of the 6-foot-10 Holmes. TIP-INS Pacers: McDermott had 13 points in the second quarter on 5-of-6 shooting. … Myles Turner followed an offensive rebound with a tomahawk dunk in the first half. ... Bjorkgren won a challenge in the fourth quarter after Turner was initially called for his fourth foul. The call was overturned and the foul rescinded. Kings: Holmes had 16 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high six blocks. “He’s our motor,” said first-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton, who scored 12 points. “When he’s energetic and makes plays like that … it just goes down the line.” ... Sacramento has scored 60 or more points in the first half of five of its 11 games.","401267316"
"Dakota Mathias makes his only bucket of the night, draining a deep 3-pointer in overtime to give the 76ers a lead. (0:21) PHILADELPHIA -- — Pick a position, Joel Embiid got to the basket at will and continued to stir early-season MVP hype. Dakota Mathias needed only one open look to squeeze his way into Embiid's personal highlight reel. Embiid had 45 points and 16 rebounds, Mathias’ only basket of the game was a go-ahead 3-pointer with 26.1 seconds left and the Philadelphia 76ers hung on to beat the undermanned Miami Heat 137-134 in overtime on Tuesday night. “I've got a goal. I want to win the championship and I can't do it alone,” Embiid said. Embiid had some of the great moments of his career and carried the Sixers with a perfect third quarter and clutch buckets in OT to put them on the brink of victory. “He willed that game for us,” coach Doc Rivers said. It was little-known Mathias with the stunner that won it. Mathias, who went undrafted in 2018 and signed this season with the Sixers as a two-day G League player, got the ball from the top of the arc and buried it for the 134-132 lead. “No hesitation,” Rivers said. “It says a lot about him.” With Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic among the Heat sitting out for COVID-related reasons, they pushed the Sixers into OT with a mad-dash end to the fourth. Tyler Herro helped the Heat overcome Embiid’s dominant effort when his 3-pointer tied the game 115-all with 2:25 left. Precious Achiuwa scored two straight baskets -- the first off Philly’s shot clock violation, then off a turnover -- for a 119-115 lead. Embiid buried the pull-up jumper just inside the 3-point arc with 3.3 seconds left that tied it 120-120 and sent the game into overtime. It was his only bucket of the fourth after he made all eight shots in the third. Embiid’s go-ahead three-point play with 2:37 left in OT put the Sixers up 126-124, and Herro matched his regulation theatrics with another tying 3 for 129-all. Danny Green matched the 76ers' record with nine 3-pointers and scored 29 points and Mike Scott had 16 points. Herro finished with 34 points, Duncan Robinson had 26 and Gabe Vincent 24. “It's a shame because our guys did more than enough to put ourselves in position to win,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “They could have kept on going another two overtimes. It wasn't a matter of lack of want or lack of effort. Our guys emptied it all out there. It's just a matter of getting over this hurdle of really finishing plays.” Embiid finished plays in bunches and took over the third quarter when scored 20 points and in OT when he scored 11 points. Embiid was all over the court in the third. He smacked the ball away under the basket to break up a Miami possession, then hustled down to hit Isiah Joe for a 3 and cut the hole to four. Embiid followed that by shaking off a double team and tossing an underhand shot for the basket. He made the free throw and Sixers were down one. Embiid made it back-to-back three-point plays when he got the Heat to bite on a pump-fake from the free-throw line. The big man even handled the rock with ease and went the length of the floor to hit a little fadeaway and extend the lead. He was 16 of 23 from the floor and made all 13 free throws. Embiid had five steals and a blocked shot. “There was no chance we were going down,” Embiid said. “Whatever I had to do and whatever my teammates had to do, we did it.” Achiuwa had 17 points and 13 rebounds and the Heat made 19 of 56 3-pointers. “We're not just trying to develop guys for the future.,” Spoelstra said. “We're trying to develop guys to learn how to win at the highest level, this year. Right now.” TIP-INS Heat: F/C Meyers Leonard sat out with a strained left shoulder. ... The Heat continued to struggle with roster issues after their game Sunday against Boston was postponed because they couldn’t field the minimum number of players. 76ers: Rivers said Ben Simmons had to be summoned back to New York after he tried to return to Philadelphia when the team needed to stay an extra day for additional COVID-19 testing. Simmons had five points, 12 assists and fouled out. ... Dwight Howard moved into 13th on the NBA’s career blocked shots list. ... Dana Barros hit nine 3s on Jan. 27, 1995 vs. Phoenix. DAY OFF Embiid said it was “unfortunate” the 76ers had to play when they were short-handed over the weekend because of COVID issues while other games were postponed. “I guess the league keeps making us play,” he said. “There's really no other explanation behind it.”","401267317"
"Adrian Wojnarowski details what's next for Kyrie Irving as the NBA is reviewing videos circulating on social media of a maskless Irving at what appears to be a family birthday party. (1:12) NEW YORK -- — Kevin Durant had 34 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds, Bruce Brown made a huge contribution while starting for the absent Kyrie Irving, and the Brooklyn Nets rallied from 18 down to beat the Denver Nuggets 122-116 on Tuesday night. Brown scored a season-high 16 points, including the tying and go-ahead baskets down the stretch. Durant followed with Brooklyn's next six points, including a 3-pointer that essentially put it away at 120-113 with 27 seconds to play. “Guys have pride. They want to come out and compete, and everybody came with it tonight, especially in the second half,” Durant said. Nikola Jokic had 23 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds for the Nuggets, who were trying to sweep a three-game road trip. But they were outscored 68-46 in the second half and squandered their chance to climb above .500 for the first time this season. Denver coach Michael Malone said his short-handed team might have been a little tired at the end of a tough stretch. “But we have to find a way to fight through that and hopefully we can realize once again that playing three quarters is not going to get it done in this business,” Malone said. “You have to find a way to play as close to 48 (minutes) as possible and when we do that, I think we have a chance to be a pretty good team.” Caris LeVert added 20 points for the Nets, who had dropped two in a row during Irving's four-game absence for personal reasons and seemed well on their way to a third when they trailed 79-61 early in the third quarter. But they got hot from 3-point range and Durant from just about everywhere. “All we need to do is bring energy, play hard and play defense, and we did that tonight,” Brown said. They blew past the Nuggets with a 29-4 run that gave them a 90-83 lead, and when Jokic checked out after the next possession he kicked over a chair in the last row of Denver’s bench in frustration. Will Barton scored 22 points for the Nuggets, making six 3-pointers. Jamal Murray scored 20. Jokic scored 13 points in the first quarter and Denver already led by double digits barely a minute into the second. The lead was eight with about four minutes left before Murray finally got going with three baskets, including a 3-pointer that made it 70-54 at the break. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver gave 7-foot-2 Bol Bol his first career start, with Gary Harris out for personal reasons. Bol Bol finished with five points in 16 minutes. ... Monte Morris scored 14 points. Nets: Before the game, coach Steve Nash wasn't sure if Durant would play Wednesday at New York. Durant, who missed last season recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon, sat out the second half of the Nets' first back-to-back of the season. “I really hope Kevin plays tomorrow, but we’ll see,” Nash said. “We have to judge these things day to day and moment to moment.” Durant said afterward he planned to play. ... DeAndre Jordan, the starting center to begin the season, didn't play. IRVING UPDATE The Nets and the NBA are looking into Irving’s actions after a video showed the point guard at an indoor family gathering not wearing a mask. General manager Sean Marks said a date for Irving's return hadn't been determined, and the All-Star could face a fine if the NBA determines he violated the health and safety rules in place during the coronavirus pandemic.","401267318"
"Mike Conley crashes into the lane and passes out to Bojan Bogdanovic for an easy 3-pointer. (0:15) CLEVELAND -- — Donovan Mitchell and the Utah Jazz are headed home with a victory, albeit a little earlier than expected. Mitchell scored 27 points and the Jazz rolled to a 117-87 win over the injury-depleted Cleveland Cavaliers, wrapping up their six-game road trip Tuesday night. Utah was scheduled to play Wednesday at Washington, but the NBA postponed the game because the Wizards do not have the minimum eight available players. “It’s a weird time, but we also have a job to do,” Mitchell said. “The key is staying locked in on the task at hand with basketball and being unselfish off the court. We’ve got to continue to be safe and make sure guys are being as careful as possible.” Jordan Clarkson had 21 points and eight rebounds off the bench and Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 points for the Jazz, whose largest lead was 114-80 on a 3-pointer by Miye Oni. Utah went 4-2 on its 10-day journey. “We did exactly what we were supposed to do against a team we were supposed to beat,” Mitchell said. Mitchell, who scored 17 points in the third, and Clarkson each made five 3s as Utah went 24 of 45 beyond the arc. The Jazz nailed a franchise-record 25 triples at Milwaukee on Jan. 8. “Right now, I think all of us are glad to be getting on a plane, going West not East,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “You obviously appreciate the extra rest at any point in the season, but it didn’t factor into how we played this game."" Cedi Osman paced Cleveland with 17 points and six assists. Rookie forward Isaac Okoro and Damyean Dotson had 11 points apiece for the Cavaliers, who failed to score 100 for the ninth straight game and have lost three in a row. Cleveland center Andre Drummond (right Achilles bruise), averaging an NBA-high 15.1 rebounds, was a late scratch after being stepped on Monday against Memphis. The Cavaliers also were without shooting guard Collin Sexton (left ankle sprain) for the fourth straight game, along with power forward Kevin Love (right calf strain), point guard Darius Garland (right shoulder sprain) and four other rotation players. “Not making excuses, but there is just so much that’s different because of the amount of injuries,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “We’ve got to figure out a way to maintain our identity.” Clarkson scored 14 points in the first half and Utah carried a 49-36 lead into the break. The teams combined for two free throw attempts, 31 3-point tries and five airballs on uncontested shots in the first half. NOT YOUR AVERAGE BEAR Cavaliers G Yogi Ferrell, who had 10 points and four assists, spent one day with the Jazz during training camp. The fifth-year pro signed a 10-day contract Monday when the NBA granted Cleveland a hardship exception. “Yogi is a smart player and he knows the league,” Snyder said. “He’s played that position his whole life, so it’s easy to adapt to a new situation.” TIP-INS Jazz: F Joe Ingles (right Achilles soreness) was sidelined for the second time on the trip. His streak of playing in 384 straight games ended last week at Milwaukee. … Utah has started the same lineup all season with center Rudy Gobert, forwards Bogdanovic and Royce O’Neale, and guards Mitchell and Mike Conley. Cavaliers: G Kevin Porter Jr. (personal), who was slated to be the team's sixth man, has been inactive for all 12 games after his offseason arrest in Eastern Ohio. Bickerstaff continues to be vague about Porter’s status. “We’re still following our plan as an organization,” the coach said. “Every day, we have conversations.”","401267319"
"LeBron James says Dennis Schroder bet that he wouldn't make a no-look 3 as he was shooting. He also addresses comparisons to Steph Curry's no-look 3-pointers. (1:23) HOUSTON -- — James Harden publicly acknowledged his discord with the Houston Rockets for the first time Tuesday night following back-to-back blowout losses to the Los Angeles Lakers. “We're just not good enough ... I love this city. I literally have done everything that I can,” Harden said. “I mean, this situation is crazy. It’s something that I don’t think can be fixed.” Harden had remained quiet through months of speculation that he is unhappy in Houston. Numerous reports have indicated he’s looking to be shipped to Brooklyn to play with former Oklahoma City teammate Kevin Durant, who left and became an NBA champion with Golden State. For all his accomplishments, Harden is still seeking an NBA title. He’s been asked repeatedly to address the trade rumors since the season began but has deflected questions and refused to reveal any frustration. That all changed after a 117-100 blowout loss to the Lakers on Tuesday night. The Lakers led by 30 points in the third quarter after leading by 27 during a 120-102 on Sunday. Harden didn't elaborate or take any additional questions following his initial comments. Harden’s words will surely be noticed by NBA officials, but it wouldn’t seem that what he said postgame would merit a trade demand — and subject him to a fine. The league has a longstanding rule about players not being able to publicly express a desire to be traded and has issued $50,000 fines in recent years to players like Anthony Davis and Dewayne Dedmon for breaking that policy. Harden was fined $50,000 earlier this season for conduct detrimental to the league related to him not following the health and safety protocols put into place by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association for navigating a season during a coronavirus pandemic. Harden won each of the last three scoring titles by notable margins — 2.3 points over Davis in 2017-18, 8.1 points over Paul George in 2018-19 and 3.8 points over Bradley Beal last season. His 24.8-point average so far this season ranked 18th in the NBA, still putting him among the leaders but obviously well off his usual pace. He’s averaged at least 25 points per game in each of his eight full seasons with the Rockets. The Rockets traded Russell Westbrook to the Washington Wizards in exchange for John Wall and a future first-round draft pick before the season in what was seen as an attempt to pacify Harden. So far, the pairing of the two ball-dominant guards hasn't gone well. The Rockets are 3-6 and looked completely overmatched in their last two games against the reigning champions. Wall was asked how he and Harden have worked together on the court so far after Tuesday's game. “It’s a little rocky,"" Wall said. “I don’t think it’s the best it could be, that’s all I could say.”","401267321"

(0:25) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Lonnie Walker IV scored 24 points and San Antonio beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 112-102 on Tuesday night, allowing the Spurs to finish a five-game trip with four wins. Keldon Johnson added 18 points for the Spurs, who won their 2,200th game since joining the NBA in 1976. The Spurs committed a season-low four turnovers. “I feel like we fought the whole road trip,” Johnson said. “We gave one away in Minnesota ... but we knew we just had to bounce back and continue to keep fighting and trusting each other and we came out a winner.

They got a shot every time down,” Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. “We didn’t kick the ball all over the gym, but they really converted, obviously, when we did turn it over.

They’ve just taken care of the ball really well. We’ve done nothing special. We’ve called a few more plays to get them a little bit more organized, so it’s a little bit less frantic than in the past. That’s all I can think of, really.”","401267322"
"Aaron Holiday's basket is all the Pacers need as they pull away from the Warriors late in the fourth quarter. (0:17) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Edmond Sumner earned a start for Indiana that came with a daunting assignment: defending Stephen Curry. Myles Turner made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:59 left and scored 22 points, Aaron Holiday converted a layup on the next possession and the Pacers held off Curry and the Golden State Warriors 104-95 Tuesday night. Indiana kept Curry in check by regularly playing him with a tough box-and-1 defense, though the two-time MVP still created his chances. He found his groove again following a rare off night Sunday against the Raptors to finish with 20 points. “People are going to throw everything at Steph,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""That’ll be a big theme this season and we’ve got to do a better job of attacking what people are throwing at us, and we’ll get better at it.” Justin Holiday also hit a key 3 late as the Pacers bounced back from a loss at Sacramento a night earlier to avoid dropping consecutive road games for the first time. Curry shot 7 for 17 with three 3-pointers. Indiana coach Nate Bjorkgren credited his team's defensive energy. “They were mad from last night and they came today with an edge to them,” he said. Curry was coming off an 11-point game in which he shot 2 for 16 and missed nine of his 10 3s in Sunday’s win against Toronto after scoring 143 over his previous four games, including a career-high 62 a week before against Portland. Kelly Oubre Jr. contributed 17 points and key reserves Damion Lee and Mychal Mulder hit consecutive 3-pointers during one fourth-quarter stretch for Golden State before the Pacers got hot. Andrew Wiggins scored 22 points as the Warriors concluded a seven-game homestand, their longest of the season, by going 4-3 at Chase Center in a span of 12 days. Wiggins also blocked a career-best five shots, giving him nine the past two games — the first time in his career he has had three or more blocks in back-to-back games. Turner had 11 rebounds and four blocks for the Pacers, playing a back-to-back following a 127-122 loss to the Kings that began a five-game road trip out West. Four players scored 20 or more points in that game, then five reached double digits Tuesday. Indiana's 12-1 run midway through the second quarter put the Pacers ahead 34-32 before the Warriors roared back with a 16-5 surge that made it 48-39. Golden State rookie James Wiseman picked up his fourth personal foul with 1:10 left in the second quarter. He played in the third until getting his sixth foul at the 6:25 mark. The Warriors honored front-line workers on “ Essential Workers Night, ” with those fans watching virtually and being shown on the LED boards. PASCHALL OUT Golden State forward Eric Paschall sat out and entered the NBA's COVID-19 health and safety protocol. That does not mean he has tested positive for the coronavirus. ""We've got to make up for Eric's loss and it's a big loss with the way he's been playing,"" Kerr said. THOMPSON IN TOWN Curry's injured Splash Brother, Klay Thompson, has been around the team the past couple of days, seeing the training staff Tuesday as he recovers from surgery on a torn right Achilles tendon. He is unlikely to travel with the club for now. Thompson is still in a boot but will begin running in a pool next week. “He’s in good spirits,"" Kerr said. ""He's very upbeat about everything. It was great to see him."" TIP-INS Pacers: Shot 9 for 28 from 3-point range. ... Indiana won on the Warriors' home floor in the lone meeting last season and scored its most points ever in the series in a 129-118 victory. Warriors: Curry missed his first two free throws of the game, rattling each one in and out, and shook his head in disbelief after the first one didn't drop. He had made a franchise-record 80 straight from the line before a miss Jan. 3 vs. Portland.","401267323"
"LaMelo Ball drives in and throws a no-look pass to Bismack Biyombo, who scores for the Hornets. (edited) (0:19) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — The dangerous duo is back in Dallas. Luka Doncic had 34 points, 13 rebounds, nine assists and a career-high four blocks, Kristaps Porzingis scored 16 points in his return from a knee injury and the Mavericks beat the Charlotte Hornets 104-93 on Wednesday night. “When both of those guys are out there at the same time it’s a game changer for us,” said Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, who became the 16th coach in NBA history to reach 800 career victories. “They are two guys who can play on the inside and space the court on the outside."" Tim Hardaway Jr. added 18 points for the Mavericks. They've won four straight after opening 2-4. Terry Rozier had 18 points to lead the Hornets. They shot 38% from the field and had their four-game winning streak snapped. Porzingis played for the first time since having knee surgery in October. The 7-foot-3 Latvian impacted the game at both ends with his size, easily able to shoot over smaller defenders while altering shots in the paint against the smaller Hornets. Charlotte attempted to counter at times with a small ball lineup, but struggled all night with Dallas' height and length. “That’s the first time we’ve seen this lineup and they’re long, they’re physical,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. “Those are two special players that can play at a high level. Give Doncic credit he played a great game tonight. Porzingis’ length and his size obviously was a factor out there.” Porzingis played 21 minutes, finishing 6 of 16 from the floor and 4 of 9 from beyond the 3-point arc. He had four rebounds. Porzingis said he felt good on the floor, but admitted he might have pressed himself into taking some bad shots because he was on a minutes restriction imposed by Carlisle. “I was trying to do as much as I could in the minutes that I had,” Porzingis said. “And sometimes you don't make the best decisions when you really want to be aggressive. But it's OK. It's a part of it. I wanted to be aggressive when I was out there.” “He’s an amazing player,"" Doncic said. “He has to get back into rhythm, but I think for the first game he played amazing.” Doncic appeared to grow frustrated with the lack of calls going his way in the second half, but used that as motivation. After a non-call, Doncic hustled back to block Gordon Hayward's shot, corralled the loose ball and drove the length of the floor where he lofted a one-handed alley-oop pass to Josh Green for the lay-in. Doncic got testy at the end of the third quarter after Charlotte's Caleb Martin said something to him. Doncic began walking toward Martin, shouting something back as officials assessed Martin a technical foul. 800 WINS Carlisle said looking back on 800 career wins he's been fortunate to have had “great ownership” and “exceptional players” during his time on the bench. ""It's just a privilege to be one of 30 guys coaching in this great league,"" Carlisle said. TIP INS Mavericks: Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell and Josh Richardson did not play due to the NBA health and safety protocols. Hornets: Hornets coach James Borrego said Hayward left the game in the fourth quarter because of a strained hip. After averaging 29.2 points during the four-game winning streak, Hayward was held to 16 points on 5-of-15 shooting by the Mavericks. ... P.J. Washington had 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists.","401267324"
"Khris Middleton dishes it out to Giannis Antetokounmpo at the top of the arc, and he takes the open lane to slam down a one-handed dunk. (0:18) DETROIT -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 22 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Milwaukee Bucks easily beat the Detroit Pistons for the third time this month, 110-101 on Wednesday night. The Bucks built a commanding early lead with a barrage of 3-pointers. Brook Lopez connected three times from beyond the arc in the first quarter, when the Bucks were 7 of 11 from long distance. Detroit was just 4 of 20 overall in the period and trailed 27-13 after one. That pattern continued through much of the second quarter. At one point, Milwaukee led 52-29 and had more 3-pointers (11) than Detroit had field goals (9). “We’ve just tried to keep building on shooting and making it a priority,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It takes good passing, good ball movement, and then guys have to knock down shots.” The Pistons cut the deficit to 11 at halftime but never seemed like a serious threat to overtake Milwaukee. Jerami Grant led Detroit with 22 points and Svi Mykhailiuk added 18. “As a young team, we just made enough mistakes at the right time to put yourself in a hole,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. It was the 20th career triple-double for Antetokounmpo. Jrue Holiday added 21 points for the Bucks in another solid performance after arriving in an offseason trade. “I knew he was really good, but every day I play with him, I realize how good a person he is, good a teammate he is, and how much better he is than what I thought,"" Antetokounmpo said. Milwaukee beat Detroit 125-115 on Jan. 4 and 130-115 two days later. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee has won three straight and six of seven. ... The Bucks finished 19 of 43 from 3-point range. ... Lopez didn't score after those early 3s. He had nine points and 11 rebounds. Pistons: Detroit fell to 2-9, but its margins of defeat have remained reasonably respectable. That 15-point loss to Milwaukee was the most lopsided of the season for the Pistons. ... Detroit had a 20-7 advantage in second-chance points. STRUGGLES Detroit shot a solid 40% from 3-point range, but the Pistons were just 22 of 57 inside the arc. “We shot way too many midrange shots tonight,"" Casey said. ""That’s what that team wants you to do.” MAJOR THREAT Antetokounmpo said after the game he wasn't on social media, so a reporter had to relay the NBA's big news of the day — a pending trade sending James Harden to Brooklyn. “It’s an amazing move for Brooklyn,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Obviously, they got better — way better.”","401267325"
"Kevin Durant reacts to the Nets' win vs. the Knicks and will wait till James Harden trade is finalized before commenting on it. (1:19) NEW YORK -- — James Harden might soon be in Brooklyn and Kyrie Irving could soon be back, giving the Nets a potentially tantalizing trio. Kevin Durant's focus was on something else Wednesday. ""We really wanted this game tonight and everybody played like that,"" Durant said. Especially the solo superstar poised to soon be fronting a brand new Big Three. Durant scored 26 points to lead the Nets — short-handed after agreeing to a trade for Harden — to a 116-109 victory over the New York Knicks. Durant was already scheduled to play on both nights of a back-to-back for the first time since surgery to repair his Achilles tendon. He maybe had to do a little more than planned after the Nets shook up their roster earlier in the day with a four-team blockbuster centered around the acquisition of Harden, the three-time NBA scoring champion. Durant, who has won four scoring titles, didn't want to talk about Harden yet, with the deal still not approved by the NBA. With Irving missing a fifth straight game for personal reasons, the Nets had only nine players. The four who are to be included in the trade, confirmed by a person with knowledge of the situation, were not at Madison Square Garden. The Nets lost some good ones — Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince have all been starters and played important roles — but still were plenty good enough and might be even better if the Durant-Harden-Irving tandem works out. “But tonight we had to focus on the task at hand and that was getting the ‘W’ tonight,” said Nets forward Jeff Green, a teammate of Harden's in Houston last season. Joe Harris and Bruce Brown each added 15 points for the Nets, who broke open the game with a 15-2 burst to close the first half. Julius Randle scored 30 points and RJ Barrett had 20 for the Knicks, who dropped their fourth straight but at least rediscovered some offense after being held below 90 points in the previous three. “I’m looking forward to the next game. We’re just trying to get back on track,” said rookie guard Immanuel Quickley, who scored 19 points. Brooklyn's lead was just 46-43 with about 4 1/2 minutes remaining in the half before Durant threw a lob that DeAndre Jordan slammed down while getting fouled. Durant followed with a 3-pointer and the two had consecutive dunks for the last two baskets of the half as the Nets opened a 61-45 lead. The lead was still 16 after three before the Knicks made it appear close in the final minutes, mostly while Durant was on the bench. Durant went over 20 points in his franchise-record ninth straight game to begin a season, his first game at Madison Square Garden since he and Irving joined the Nets in July 2019 while a Knicks team that had enough money to afford two superstars couldn't land any. Irving still hasn't played across town as a Net, missing one game last season while injured and sitting out the second on the day Kobe Bryant died. TIP-INS Nets: Coach Steve Nash said he had no new details on Irving's absence. ... The Nets played just their fourth road game. They came in tied with Houston for fewest in the league. ... Durant improved to 17-3 in his career against the Knicks. Knicks: Rookie forward Obi Toppin played a minute, his first action since the season opener. The college player of the year last season had been out with a strained right calf. ... F Taj Gibson, who signed last week, didn't play in the first game he was available. ... Barrett is Nash's godson.","401267328"
"On a fast break, Kyle Anderson sends up an alley-oop to Brandon Clarke, who throws down a dunk. (0:22) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Jonas Valanciunas had 24 points and 16 rebounds, Grayson Allen scored a season-high 20 off the bench and the Memphis Grizzlies came back to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-107 on Wednesday night. Brandon Clarke added 19 points for Memphis, which outscored Minnesota 38-17 in the fourth quarter to win its third straight game. Playing without Ja Morant for the eighth game in a row, the Grizzlies had a 50-21 advantage in points off the bench. De’Anthony Melton scored 15 and rookie Xavier Tillman chipped in with 12. “Our guys just kept fighting through, fighting through and when a window opened for us to attack, we took advantage of it,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Malik Beasley had 28 points for Minnesota. D’Angelo Russell added 25 and Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 25 points and 14 rebounds. The teams continue a two-game series Friday in Minnesota. “Got to be more physical,” Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. “That’s a physical group over there. Got to be more physical, plain and simple. Take pride in guarding the ball. Take pride in protecting the rim.” The two youngest clubs in the NBA to start this season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, are still trying to find their way through injury and ineffectiveness. Morant has been limited to three games because of a left ankle sprain, while Justice Winslow and Jaren Jackson Jr. haven’t played this season. “It’s always been next man up,” Allen said. “We just have a bunch of hoopers on this team. It makes it easy to just get different groups in there and just play. We’ve got a bunch of guys playing the right way, it makes it easy.” Towns has missed seven games after dislocating his left wrist. The Wolves were winless without their big man in the middle before beating San Antonio on Sunday with Towns sitting out the second game of a back-to-back. With Towns on the bench to start the fourth, Memphis went on a 14-0 run to take a 94-92 lead. Allen hit a pair of 3-pointers during the spurt as the Grizzlies’ bench again took advantage. The Wolves went to their starters to stem the tide, but couldn’t handle Valanciunas down low, while the Grizzlies upped their defensive pressure. “In the fourth, we didn’t play defense,” Towns said. TIP-INS Grizzlies: After scoring 20-plus points in two straight games, Dillon Brooks was limited to nine on 4-of-15 shooting. … Valanciunas set season highs in points and rebounds. He had eight offensive boards. ... G John Konchar was questionable with a left ankle sprain but was active. Timberwolves: In his second game back from a hamstring injury, Josh Okogie returned to the starting lineup, with Jarrett Culver coming off the bench. It marked the seventh different starting lineup in 11 games for Minnesota this season. … F Jake Layman missed the game for personal reasons. … The Wolves had 13 turnovers to seven for Memphis. PLAYING THE PAINT Led by Valanciunas, the Grizzlies scored 80 points in the paint. “One thing we talk about is getting downhill, getting a piece of the paint in a variety of ways and with a variety of different players,” Jenkins said. “We’ve got a lot of guys that can really finish in the paint. That’s our M.O. and we know if we can do that, that eventually opens up more looks from the outside that we shoot with confidence.”","401267329"
"LeBron James can't be stopped from behind the arc as he's shooting with ease, draining back-to-back 3-pointers. (0:22) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — LeBron James scored 26 points and the Los Angeles Lakers routed the Oklahoma City Thunder 128-99 on Wednesday night for their franchise-record seventh straight road victory to start the season. “We just have a bunker mentality on the road — just us,"" James said. ""But obviously, it’s even more just us because of the restrictions, COVID, everything that’s going on. So we've come together even closer.” Montrezl Harrell added 21 points, and Anthony Davis had 18 points and seven rebounds. The defending champion Lakers have won four straight to improve to an NBA-best 10-3. They surpassed the 1985-86 squad with the 7-0 road start. But the road is different this season with mostly empty arenas. “It’s all about execution and your level of focus,” James said. “You’ve got to be able to at times build up your own energy. Like tonight, we come off a back-to-back, three in four nights. For us to come off a back-to-back -- in Houston last night, getting in late to OKC and coming out to an arena with no fans — you’ve got to prosper your own energy from your group, yourself.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 17 points to lead Oklahoma City. The Lakers led by 24 in the second quarter before the Thunder cut it to 58-46 at halftime. James scored 15 points in the half. James hit a 3-pointer with Thunder defensive stopper Lu Dort in his face, then made a 3-pointer and was fouled by Isaiah Roby on the next possession. The free throw gave the Lakers a 74-50 lead. On the Lakers’ next possession, James made a layup to give him nine points in 66 seconds. James made 4 of 6 shots and scored 11 points in the third quarter to help the Lakers take a 93-71 lead. The Lakers’ biggest lead was 31 points in the fourth quarter. The Thunder never led. “It's one of 72 games, and they're all opportunities,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “They're all opportunities to compete and they're opportunities to learn, and we've just got to continue to use every experience to continue to grow and move forward.” TIP-INS Lakers: James extended his streak of games with at least 10 points to 1,008. ...

"Paul George gets the shot off and beats the halftime buzzer to extend the Clippers' lead. (0:28) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 28 points, Paul George added 27 and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans 111-106 on Wednesday night. The Pelicans were missing starters Zion Williamson, Lonzo Ball and Eric Bledsoe. Together, they account for 46.1 points and 15.6 rebounds per game. New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said Williamson was ruled out because of inconclusive test results. Nickeil Alexander-Walker led the Pelicans with 37 points and eight rebounds, both career highs in his first start of the season. “Walker really kept them in the game,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “He made 3s, layups and in-between layups. He pretty much got everything he wanted.” But the Pelicans didn’t get much production out of two other first-time starters. Josh Hart finished with six points, and former Clipper Sindarius Thornwell was scoreless. Brandon Ingram’s jumper drew the Pelicans within four, the closest they came in the fourth quarter. From there, Leonard and George combined to score 16 consecutive points. Leonard’s 3-pointer that restored the Clippers’ lead to double digits had team owner Steve Ballmer whipping his right arm in the air from his seat next to the basket. Leonard finished with nine assists. The Clippers saw their 12-point lead reduced to five in the closing minutes. “It just comes down to us putting the game away when we need to,” George said. “We’re really good in the first and second quarters. In the third and fourth is where we need to clean up and buckle down. That’s going to come.” Alexander-Walker scored nine points in a row for the Pelicans, but he couldn't singlehandedly outduel the Clippers' two stars. “Early on, I tried to let it come to me,” Alexander-Walker said. “As the flow of the game went on, I was just kind of riding its wave and figuring out where to assert myself.” Ingram added 22 points with the Clippers' defense focused on him. Jaxon Hayes grabbed 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, who dropped their fourth in a row. They hadn't played since losing at Charlotte last Friday. Their game at Dallas on Monday was postponed, delaying the start of what was scheduled as a seven-game trip. The Clippers rode a dominant second quarter, in which they outscored the Pelicans 33-15, to an 18-point lead on George's 3 that beat the halftime buzzer. Los Angeles maintained a double-digit lead in the third, when George didn't score and Leonard had six points. TIP-INS Pelicans: Bledsoe sat out with right eye irritation and Ball has bilateral knee tendinopathy. Clippers: Lou Williams missed the second half after experiencing hip soreness. ... George had at least 25 points and five assists for the third straight game, tying the longest such streak of his career. ...

"After grabbing his own missed shot, CJ McCollum sneaks a no-look pass to Enes Kanter for an easy bucket. (0:21) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Damian Lillard scored eight of his season-high 40 points in the final four minutes, and the Portland Trail Blazers tied a franchise record with 23 3-pointers to beat the Sacramento Kings 132-126 on Wednesday night for their fourth straight victory. Lillard and CJ McCollum led Portland’s shooting barrage from behind the arc with six 3s apiece. Lillard added 13 assists without a turnover, while McCollum had 28 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. Jusuf Nurkic had a season-best 18 points and 13 rebounds. “I liked the way we kept our focus,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “Sacramento was hot all night. More than anything else, I like how we fought back after things weren’t going our way in the third quarter.” The Blazers trailed by 20 midway through the second and were down 105-100 going into the fourth before rallying to win their second consecutive game against the Kings in five days. Portland won 125-99 on Saturday. Nurkic had 10 points in the fourth period but it was Lillard who came up big down the stretch. He made four free throws and a pair of driving layups as the Blazers outscored the Kings 16-9. De’Aaron Fox had 29 points, six assists and six rebounds for Sacramento. Buddy Hield scored 26, and first-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton added 17 points and nine assists. The Kings have lost six of eight. This one was particularly painful after they blew big leads of 58-38 and 94-75. “That’s the NBA. The elite teams find ways to finish those off and that’s what we’re building toward. We’re not there yet,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""Down the stretch Dame and CJ hit some big shots.” Portland tied a team record for 3s set last year in the bubble. The Blazers shot 23 for 48 from deep but missed their final four attempts at breaking the mark. “Coach has been emphasizing we need to get more 3s up,” Lillard said. “We continued to penetrate and pitch and take those open shots. It really helped us that we were getting high-quality looks. We didn’t pass any of them up. We took them and kept firing.” The Kings led by 20 early in the second quarter following back-to-back buckets from Marvin Bagley III. Portland responded with a flurry of 3s, making four straight as part of a 20-4 run. After Derrick Jones Jr. dunked off an offensive rebound and Fox missed one of two free throws, McCollum made another 3 to pull Portland to 68-65. BLAME CJ It was the first time Lillard and McCollum both had 10 or more assists in the same game as teammates. “A lot of guys made shots tonight, too, so that helped,” McCollum said. “I don’t get 10 assists very often so that’s probably why we both haven’t done it.” DIFFERENCE MAKER Richaun Holmes sat out with left ankle soreness when Sacramento lost to Portland last Saturday, the only game the 6-foot-10 center has missed this season. Holmes was back in the lineup Wednesday and gave the Kings a big lift inside with 17 points, nine rebounds and six assists. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard is seven field goals shy of becoming the third player in franchise history to reach 5,000 for his career. Clyde Drexler (6,889) and LaMarcus Aldridge (5,121) are the others. … Nurkic was questionable before the game with a quad injury.

"Joel Embiid trolls the Heat with fake timeout calls after Tobias Harris throws down a dunk on the fast break. (0:18) PHILADELPHIA -- — Ben Simmons called trade rumors part of the NBA. With another triple-double, he showed why he's coveted around the league — and needed in Philly. Simmons had 10 points, 10 assists and 12 rebounds and Shake Milton returned from COVID-related issues and scored 31 points and lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 125-108 win over the Miami Heat on Thursday night. “There’s far worse things going on in the world,” Simmons said of recent trade talk. ""If you tell me I’ll never play the game again, that would be a different story.” The Sixers swept the two-game home set against a Heat team that continues to play with a depleted roster because of issues related to the virus outbreak. Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic sat out, and the Heat were roughed up early by Milton, Tyrese Maxey and Tobias Harris. Consider, the 76ers led 73-58 at the break — with only nine combined points from All-Stars Joel Embiid and Simmons. Embiid has emerged early as one of the top players in the NBA, and a 45-point, 16-rebound game Tuesday against the Heat was one of his best. He had only nine points on Thursday, but was barely needed. Duncan Robinson led the Heat with 22 points and Gabe Vincent had 21. “I don’t want to hear anything about fatigue,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Philly just outplayed us.” Simmons had his 30th career triple-double a day after he was dangled as trade bait to Houston in a potential deal for James Harden. Harden landed in Brooklyn in a trade that not only made the Nets the new favorites to win the Eastern Conference, it could ruffle the relationship between Simmons and the franchise that made him the No. 1 pick of the 2016 draft. Coach Doc Rivers talked it out with Simmons after trade rumors swirled earlier this season. Rivers and Simmons had a brief chat at shootaround, leaving the new Sixers coach to say everything was fine. “This is a business. Things like that happen,” Simmons said. ""The only thing I can control is how I approach my workouts, the games, and my day to day things. I’m just trying to be professional and do the right thing and help my team get wins.” The Sixers rolled early with the best record in the NBA until COVID issues sent them on a three-game losing streak -- including a loss last week when they had just seven players against Denver -- but have returned to form as more players returned to the active roster. Milton and Matisse Thybulle returned off the bench after a three-game break and Harris, who had 18 points, was back in the starting lineup. Only starting guard Seth Curry, who tested positive last week for coronavirus, remained sidelined against the Heat. The combination is good enough for Rivers. “I said it before, I like our team,” he said. “I like today after the trade that we are the same team.” Milton sank all three 3s and scored 19 points in the half and Maxey, a first-round pick out of Kentucky, continues to shine with his enthusiasm and floaters that made him an instant fan favorite. Sixers fans on social media were seemingly more outraged when Maxey, who scored 15 points, was rumored as part of a Harden deal more than how they felt about Simmons possibly leaving town. “As long as I’m here, I’m going to try to make Ben a better player,” Rivers said. “And to me, that is the most important part of our relationship.” EMBIID AND SIMMONS Embiid had a brief scare when he went up for a basket and slammed his head on the court when he was fouled by Chris Silva. Embiid came up holding the back of his head after the non-shooting foul. Sixers were yelling “He shot the ball! He shot it!” at the refs, to no avail. No worries, the Sixers kept possession and Maxey connected on an alley-oop to Simmons for a 61-47 lead. TIP-INS Heat: F/C Meyers Leonard sat out with a strained left shoulder. ... G Tyler Herro left the game early with back spasms. 76ers: F Mike Scott left in the first half with a sore right knee. ... Milton was 11 of 15 from the floor with seven assists. ...

(1:09) SAN ANTONIO -- — Houston’s first game without James Harden went better than anyone could have expected. Christian Wood had 27 points and 15 rebounds, and the Rockets rallied to beat the San Antonio Spurs 109-105 on Thursday night in their first game since trading away the franchise cornerstone. “It was fun. It was really cool stuff,” Houston’s first-year coach Stephen Silas said. Sterling Brown, who took Harden’s spot in the starting lineup, had 23 points, seven rebounds and three assists in 36 minutes. Jae’Sean Tate added 13 points, 10 assists and five rebounds. San Antonio forward Keldon Johnson had a career-high 29 points and Lonnie Walker IV added 16 points while tying a career-high with four 3-pointers. Houston sent Harden to the Brooklyn Nets in a four-team blockbuster trade on Wednesday. Victor Oladipo, Dante Exum and Rodions Kurucs, who the Rockets acquired along with numerous draft picks and draft swaps for Harden, are not with the team yet. It was Houston’s first game without Harden since 2012, when Oklahoma City traded its young guard to the Rockets primarily due to salary cap constraints. Harden remained publicly quiet through months of rumors about his unhappiness with the Rockets, but he broke that silence following a second blowout loss to the Lakers on Tuesday. He bluntly said the Rockets were “just not good enough” and that he did not believe the situation could be fixed. Houston showed otherwise, at least in their first opportunity to do so. “We had a team meeting after that last game against the Lakers and we drew the line there,” Tate said. “Everybody has so much to prove.” The Rockets were also without John Wall and Eric Gordon due to injuries. The upheaval led to more minutes for the remaining roster, and they took advantage of it. “Spirit is something I believe a lot in and talk a lot about,” Silas said. “We had spirit tonight.” Seven players scored at least nine points, with Mason Jones scoring a career-high nine points. The Rockets staged a 15-2 run to lead 105-101 with 1:46 left. “It’s got nothing to do with defense (or) offense,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of the late swoon. “It has to do with between the ears and being ready to play. And we had four or five guys who were out to lunch.” Brown had a wild, overhead shot land on the top of the backboard for an out-of-bounds call with 9.5 seconds remaining. San Antonio veteran DeMar DeRozan missed a 15-footer with 0.4 seconds left, and the Spurs fouled P.J. Tucker, who made two free throws to seal it. DeRozan had 13 points, seven assists and six rebounds in his return from a two-game absence due to personal reasons. The teams meet again Saturday at the AT&amp;T Center in the finale of a two-game set in San Antonio. TIP-INS Rockets: Wall missed the game with a sore left knee. ... Gordon was running and shooting 3-pointers prior to game but was ruled out due to tightness in his lower left leg. ... Wood was held to five points in the second quarter, shooting 2 for 7, after collecting 10 points in the opening quarter. Spurs: San Antonio is 6-3 with LaMarcus Aldridge in the lineup. The Spurs lost all three games Aldridge sat out with a sore left knee. He had 11 points Thursday. ... Walker has made 25 of 48 3-pointers in 12 games this season after going 41 of 101 to set career highs last season. He is shooting 40% on 3s in his career. ... Johnson has scored at 25 points twice this season, which is the fourth most through first 30 career games in Spurs’ history. David Robinson leads the list with 12.","401267336"
"Steph Curry scores 35 points on 14-of-23 shooting and grabs 11 rebounds as the Warriors face off against the Nuggets. (2:15) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic scored 18 of his 23 points in the second half to help Denver overcome Stephen Curry's sharp shooting as the Nuggets held off the Golden State Warriors 114-104 on Thursday night. Jokic also had 14 rebounds and 10 assists for his 46th career triple-double. The big man entered averaging a triple-double and leading the NBA in assists. “I think he’d definitely be in the MVP conversation, which is entirely too early to talk about,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “That’s the kind of impact he’s had on the game every single night."" Will Barton and Jamal Murray each added 17 points on a night when seven Nuggets scored in double figures. Curry finished with 35 points on 14-of-23 shooting. He hit five 3-pointers to give him 2,545 for his career. Curry is 15 from tying Reggie Miller for second place on the league's all-time list. Miller eagerly counted down Curry’s made 3s throughout the TNT broadcast. Ray Allen is first with 2,973. “Even though he had 35, we made some things tough for him,"" Malone said. ""We were able to get some stops.” Limited to four shots in the first half, a more aggressive Jokic took over in the third quarter and helped the Nuggets amass a 14-point advantage. But no lead is safe with Curry &amp; Co. around. The Warriors kept things interesting down the stretch. One of Jokic's biggest plays was a steal and assist on Monte Morris' basket with 5:11 remaining that allowed Denver to extend the lead back to 14. “It’s just a matter of our team connecting and figuring out who we are and what we are,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “We’re not really in sync yet. That’s going to take time.” There was a little bit of everything in the first half, when Denver led by as many as 17. Leading the list were a flying dunk by Bol Bol, Jokic's reverse slam on Warriors rookie James Wiseman and a four-point play from Curry. “We’ve got to be better,” Curry said of the defensive effort. “It doesn’t matter what the adjective is. We’ve got to be better.” TIP-INS Warriors: Curry played in his 711th regular-season game, tying him with Al Attles for No. 5 on Golden State’s career list. ... Curry had 11 rebounds and seven turnovers. ... Wiseman had 18 points and Andrew Wiggins added 16. Nuggets: G Gary Harris missed a second straight game for personal reasons. ... F Michael Porter Jr. remains out because of COVID-19 health and safety protocols. ... Denver reserve JaMychal Green had 15 points. MURRAY'S BOARDS Murray had nine rebounds against Golden State. He had just one total rebound on Denver's recent three-game trip. “I told Jamal that can’t be,” Malone said. “He responded in a big way.” PRACTICE, PRACTICE Kerr definitely can’t wait for this — back-to-back practice sessions. The Warriors haven’t had that since training camp. The extra training days opened up after their scheduled game with Phoenix on Friday was postponed because of contact-tracing issues with the Suns. Now, the plan is for the Warriors to fly home, rest and then hold two straight workouts. “This should be a good stretch for us,” Kerr said. PASCHALL RETURNS Warriors forward Eric Paschall returned following a one-game absence necessitated by a false positive coronavirus test and had eight points. He quarantined for 24 hours and missed a 104-95 loss Tuesday night to Indiana that wrapped up the Warriors’ 4-3 homestand, their longest of the season. Paschall’s next test was negative. “I’m good now,” he said. QUOATBLE Malone on defending Curry's deep shots: “I told them, ‘Guys, listen, when he makes his shots, don’t look over at me and say I played good defense when you didn’t,’” Malone said. “This guy is other-worldly, in terms of his talent and shooting ability. You have to guard him with that in mind.”","401267337"
"Myles Turner meets Jusuf Nurkic at the rim and denies him entry. (0:22) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — The Indiana Pacers figured if they slowed down Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, they'd have a good chance against the Portland Trail Blazers. The tactic worked. Domantas Sabonis had 23 points and 15 rebounds, and Indiana held Portland's dynamic backcourt duo in check for a 111-87 victory Thursday night. Malcolm Brogdon added 25 points and seven assists for the Pacers, who improved to 4-1 on the road this season and snapped an 11-game losing streak in Portland. Indiana led by 25 in the second quarter and maintained a double-digit advantage the rest of the way. McCollum and Lillard each scored 22 for the Blazers, playing the second of a back-to-back. “We talked about it as a team before the game — we've got to keep the ball out of Lillard and McCollum’s hands as much as we can and try to make them really work for everything they get,” Indiana's Doug McDermott said. The loss was costly for Portland: During the third quarter, center Jusuf Nurkic left the court holding his right wrist and the Blazers later announced he had sustained a fracture. The Trail Blazers (7-5) won in Sacramento 132-126 on Wednesday night. Lillard had a season-high 40 points in that one and Portland tied a franchise record with 23 3-pointers. The Blazers lead the NBA in 3s but they were off against the Pacers, making just 13 of 43 (30.2%). The Pacers (8-4) were coming off a 104-95 road victory over the Warriors on Tuesday night, when Myles Turner had a season-best 22 points. He finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds against the Blazers, along with four blocks. The Pacers traded Victor Oladipo to the Rockets as part of the four-team blockbuster Thursday that sent James Harden from Houston to Brooklyn. Indiana got guard Caris LeVert from the Nets and a draft pick in the deal. “We lost a very good player, but this team is going to play very good ball,” Brogdon said. Indiana led by six in the opening quarter, but the score was tied at 26 going into the second. A 12-0 run capped by McDermott's layup put the Pacers up 40-28. Indiana extended its lead to 25 before going into halftime up 59-36. The Pacers outscored the Blazers 33-10 in the second period. Portland was hurt in the third when Nurkic headed to the locker room after appearing to injure his right hand. The Blazers announced he fractured his wrist, but additional details were not available. Lillard was asked how Nurkic was doing after the game. “Frustrated. Disappointed. A little sad,” Lillard said. “Like anybody would be in that situation.” But the Blazers chipped away at Indiana's lead, pulling to 82-71 late in the third on Carmelo Anthony's 3-pointer. “I thought Myles and Domas — their aggressive mentality in all the actions, ball screens and pin downs — our guys did a great job of communicating and backing each other up,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. TIP-INS Pacers: Sabonis has 107 double-doubles with the Pacers, one shy of tying Roy Hibbert for seventh in team history. ... The Pacers hadn't won in Portland since 2007. ... T.J. McConnell returned after missing three games because of the birth of his son. Trail Blazers: Portland's 10 points in the second quarter were a season low. ... McCollum, who is from Ohio, punctuated his postgame chat with reporters by exclaiming, “Go Browns!” Cleveland plays the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL playoffs on Sunday.","401267338"
"Tacko Fall lines up with his foot on the 3-point line, banks the shot in and the Celtics bench goes berserk. (0:20) BOSTON -- — Jaylen Brown had 21 points and eight assists, Semi Ojeleye added 18 points and the Boston Celtics rolled to an 124-97 win over the Orlando Magic on Friday night in their return to action following a virus-related week-long hiatus. Jeff Teague finished with 17 points and rookie Payton Pritchard had 16 points to help Boston post its fifth straight victory. Boston returned to action after having three games postponed due to some players testing positive for the coronavirus and others being ruled out because contact tracing showed that they could have been exposed to it. “It’s hectic, A whirlwind tornado you might call it,"" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. But the Celtics didn’t seem to be affected by the layoff, sharing the ball and turning stops into opportunities to run the floor against an Orlando team that struggled to find a rhythm at both ends. “It felt good. Obviously this COVID and this pandemic has affected not just us but every team in this league. Everyone is doing the best they can to cope with it and handle it,"" Smart said. ""The way that we played, with the pace and everything, that was the key for us."" Aaron Gordon had 17 points to lead the Magic, who have lost four straight. Nik Vucevic, Dwayne Bacon and Cole Anthony added 15 points apiece. Orlando had 13 turnovers that led to 16 Celtics' points. “The guys that are out right now, we’re very much challenged offensively,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We can’t give possessions away.” The Celtics took an 88-72 advantage into the fourth quarter and opened the period with a 13-0 run to effectively put the game away. Jayson Tatum and Robert Williams remained in the NBA’s health and safety protocols Friday along with reserve guard Carsen Edwards. But the Celtics had 12 players available thanks to Brown, Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Javonte Green and Daniel Theis all being cleared to return. Magic center Mo Bamba didn’t travel with the team as a precaution while he goes through contact tracing, the latest roster hit to a team that has battled injuries throughout the season. Celtics coach Brad Stevens went deep into his bench to spread out minutes following the layoff. For the game, Boston held a 66-33 edge in bench scoring. “I thought, obviously, in one way our first wind would hit us pretty hard. But I also thought there’s the fresh advantage,"" he said. ""We were able to do that without anyone playing 28 minutes, which was good.” TIP-INS Magic: Were 3 for 12 from 3-point range in first half and finished 7 for 28 for the game. … Finished with 16 turnovers. Celtics: Went 17 of 42 from 3-point distance. … Led by as many as 14 in the first half and took a 60-48 lead into halftime. … Had no turnovers in the first quarter. NEW PROTOCOLS The NBA’s tightened safety protocols  were on display Friday with players being handed a mask along with the customary water and towel whenever they were subbed out.","401267340"
"Andre Drummond goes for 33 points and 23 rebounds in the Cavaliers' win vs. the Knicks. (2:00) CLEVELAND -- — Andre Drummond tied his career high with 33 points and grabbed 23 rebounds, and Cedi Osman scored 25 points in leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 106-103 win over the New York Knicks on Friday night. Drummond posted the Cavaliers’ first 30-20 game since Carlos Boozer had 32 points and 20 rebounds against Seattle on Jan. 20, 2004. He also had three assists, two blocks and two steals as Cleveland snapped a three-game losing streak. “I can’t speak enough about what Dre did, I thought he was awesome,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “He can punish you and when he plays with that determination and that force, there aren’t many people who can stop him one-on-one.” Julius Randle had 28 points and six assists, rookie Immanuel Quigley scored a season-high 23 points and R.J. Barrett had 20 points for New York, which lost its fifth in a row. The Knicks used a 16-0 run spanning the third and fourth quarters to go in front 84-80. Drummond, a 54% career foul shooter, made 13 of 19 free throws. He will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season and could be on the move sooner after Cleveland added center Jarrett Allen in a trade with Brooklyn. “If I do get traded, I can’t control that,” said Drummond, who leads the NBA in rebounding for the fifth straight season. “I know that I love the guys that are here and I’m having a lot of fun. You have to play hard every night because they go all-out for 48 minutes.” Bickerstaff admitted that talk of a potential Drummond trade could be distracting to the Cavaliers. “The optics are obvious, but Dre and I have built a great relationship based on trust,” he said. “Dre knows his worth and you can obviously see what he’s capable of.” Osman and Drummond each made steals in the final 31 seconds, preventing New York from getting closer than three points at 102-99. Rookie Isaac Okoro sealed the win with two free throws, making it 105-101 with 7.3 seconds remaining. “Those turnovers were costly and we need to understand that the intensity in that part of the game is different,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “We’ll keep evaluating and finding the best combinations to move forward. Everything is on the table.” Allen and forward Taurean Prince — acquired from Brooklyn — were inactive because all players in the three-team deal involving James Harden have not taken their physicals. The Cavaliers remain without three starters in five-time All-Star forward Kevin Love (right calf strain) and guards Collin Sexton (left ankle sprain) and Darius Garland (right shoulder sprain). Cleveland took its largest lead at 80-68 in the third, but New York immediately answered with 16 straight points, capped by back-to-back buckets by Randle. Drummond posted 20 points and 14 rebounds in the first half for the initial time in his nine-year career, helping Cleveland take a 57-55 lead into the break. Knicks forward Reggie Bullock returned after missing two games with a sore right hip, scoring four points. LONG LAYOFF The Cavaliers’ next two games were postponed by the NBA because the Wizards do not have the minimum eight available players. Cleveland was slated to play in Washington on Sunday and Monday, which was already problematic because of heightened security in the nation’s capital. “The city of D.C. logistically would have been a nightmare,” Bickerstaff said. “When you add in the COVID factor, it’s definitely the right move not to play those games.” TIP-INS Knicks: G Frank Ntilikina (right knee sprain) missed his ninth straight game and will be “out a while longer,” according to Thibodeau. Ntilikina was injured Dec. 29 in Cleveland. ... G Alec Burks (left ankle sprain), who last played Dec. 27 against Milwaukee, has been upgraded to day to day. Thibodeau said Burks has advanced to conditioning and is getting close to returning. Cavaliers: F Kevin Porter Jr. (personal reasons) joined his teammates on the bench for the first time this season. The second-year pro remains in limbo after an offseason arrest in Eastern Ohio. ... Bickerstaff is excited to have Allen on his roster. “What excites me the most is Jarrett’s ability to impact the game at both ends of the floor without the ball in his hands,” he said.","401267341"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo pours in a game-high 31 points as the Bucks beat the Mavericks 112-109. (2:03) MILWAUKEE -- — Khris Middleton made a couple of huge 3-pointers and the Milwaukee Bucks overcame poor free-throw shooting to snap the Dallas Mavericks' four-game winning streak. Middleton scored eight points of his 25 points in the final 2 1/2 minutes of the Bucks' 112-109 victory Friday night. Middleton took over after James Johnson’s corner 3-pointer with 3:09 left put Dallas ahead 104-103 — the Mavericks’ first lead since the opening five minutes. “He’s just a great decision-maker,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “He knows to take what the defense gives him. If he’s got a shot, he’s an incredible shot-maker, but he’s an incredible playmaker. ... He’s just a great finisher.” Middleton's 3-pointer put the Bucks ahead for good at 106-105 with 2:21 left. Middleton hit another 3-pointer 34 seconds later to make it 109-105. He also hit a pair of free throws with 7.8 seconds remaining to finish with 25 points. Those free throws were particularly noteworthy on a night when nobody could connect consistently from the foul line. The Bucks were 12 of 25 on free throws, with Giannis Antetokounmpo going 1 of 10. Dallas was 6 of 13. “He's just got to keep working through the free-throw line, continue to put the time in, grow his confidence and step up and make them,” Budenholzer said. Antetokounmpo still scored 31 points as the Bucks won their fourth straight. Luka Doncic had 28 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds for Dallas, which also got 22 points from Tim Hardaway Jr. The Mavericks entered the night having won 11 of the last 14 regular-season meetings with the Bucks. Dallas also swept two preseason matchups in Milwaukee last month. Milwaukee went 0-2 against Dallas and 56-15 against the rest of the NBA during the 2019-20 regular season. Dallas had chances to win this one late as well after trailing by as many as 14 early, but Trey Burke and Kristaps Porzingis missed potential go-ahead 3-point shots in the final 21 seconds. Doncic appeared to want a timeout to be called once Dallas got the offensive rebound off Burke's miss. The Mavs instead worked the ball to Porzingis, who missed with 10.4 seconds left. “It’s very difficult to call a timeout and go against a Milwaukee set defense out of the timeout,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. Carlisle added that he thought the Mavericks got two good shots. “It's Coach's decision,” Doncic said. “If we would have made the shot, everything would have been good.” Jrue Holiday scored 16 points, and Lopez had 11 for the Bucks, with Bobby Portis adding eight points and 13 rebounds. Dallas got 15 points from Porzingis, 13 each from Burke and Johnson, as well as 11 from William Cauley-Stein. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas played without Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jalen Brunson, Dwight Powell and Maxi Kleber due to health and safety protocols amid the pandemic. This was the third straight games that Brunson, Finney-Smith and Richardson have missed. Powell and Kleber have been out for two games. Bucks: Reserve forward Torrey Craig was cleared to return to action, though he didn't enter Friday's game. Craig hasn't played since fracturing his nose Dec. 27. Craig said he’s suffered a similar injury twice before, the difference this time being that he underwent surgery for it. Craig doesn’t like wearing a mask because it reduces his peripheral vision and makes him feel hot but added that “I guess I’ll tolerate it for the next few weeks and see what happens.”","401267342"
"After trailing by 10 with two minutes to play in regulation, the Thunder rally late to beat the Bulls in overtime. (1:25) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a career-high 33 points and 10 assists to help Oklahoma City beat the Chicago Bulls and former Thunder coach Billy Donovan 127-125 in overtime Friday night. Oklahoma City rallied from 22 points down in the second half. Zach LaVine, who led the Bulls with 35 points, could have won it in overtime but he missed a deep, off-balance 3-pointer in the closing seconds. Donovan knew all too well how good Oklahoma City can be under challenging circumstances. His Thunder team made a habit of rallying and winning close games last season on the way to a surprising playoff berth. “Those guys are great competitors when they’re down,"" Donovan said. “They play all the way through. I knew even being up 18 at the half that they were going to fight their way through and have some kind of momentum push there.” First-year Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, an assistant under Donovan last season, didn't get caught up in the matchup with his mentor. “I have great respect, obviously, for him,"" Daigneault said. ""I love the guy. But I have a responsibility. It’s like when players play against guys that they were teammates with. Once the ball goes up in the air, we’ve got to do our jobs. At that point, it’s just another game. The relationship lies outside of the competition.” Lu Dort scored 21 for the Thunder, who claimed their first home win in six tries this season. Coby White had 22 points for the Bulls, who lost their fourth straight. The Bulls led 68-50 at halftime, but Daigneault could tell the Thunder hadn't given up. “Coming out of the half, the guys — I thought it came from them today,"" Daigneault said. ""They made a decision walking out of the half to not let go of the rope.” The Bulls led 78-56 early in the second half, but the Thunder responded with a 13-0 run to get back into the game. Dort scored 13 points in a span of 2:33 to help trim the deficit, and Oklahoma City got as close as two points in the period. Chicago took a 95-87 lead into the fourth quarter. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 12 points in the fourth to help force overtime. LaVine missed a contested 3 in the closing seconds that could have won it for Chicago. Lavine's 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds to play in overtime cut the Thunder lead to 126-125. Oklahoma City's George Hill was fouled with 5.2 seconds left. He missed the first free throw and made the second to set up LaVine's final attempt. “I thought our relentless spirit in the game was what stood out,"" Daigneault said. ""And even if we didn’t win it, we stood back up tonight, which is progress for us. It was a really good response from the guys, and it came from inside them.” TIP-INS Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen hadn't played since Dec. 29 because of COVID-19 protocols. He scored 16 points but shot just 5 of 14. ... Oklahoma City scored 19 points off Chicago's nine turnovers in the third quarter. Thunder: C Al Horford sat out for personal reasons.

"Donovan Mitchell tracks down the ball before it goes out of bounds and Rudy Gobert converts with a dunk on the other end. (0:23) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Trae Young was surrounded wherever he went, while Donovan Mitchell found himself alone on the perimeter time and time again. Mitchell made six 3-pointers on his way to 26 points and the Utah Jazz used a 21-0 run in the second half to power past the Atlanta Hawks 116-92 on Friday night for their fourth straight win. “The biggest thing tonight was the way we defended. We wanted to get stops and run,” Mitchell said after the Jazz scored 27 fast-break points. Following a brilliant performance in the NBA bubble last year, Mitchell started this season slowly but is becoming more efficient and effective. He’s making more than half his shots from both 2- and 3-point range over the last four games and averaging more than 28 points. “It’s easier when we keep breaking the paint and finding people open,” Mitchell said. Meanwhile, Young was held to four points on 1-for-11 shooting with seven assists as the Hawks dropped their fifth game in the last six. That scoring total was tied for Young’s lowest since entering the NBA, matching Nov. 13, 2018, against Golden State. “Everybody that guarded him, primarily Mike (Conley) and Royce (O’Neale), they were solid. The main thing we talked about was not fouling, showing our hands,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “Rudy (Gobert) and (Derrick) Favors were great as well, protecting the rim.” Young has shot less than 36% overall and 25% on 3s over the last seven games. “Denied him the entire game as much as they could. You know, challenged him to work. Probably frustrated him,” Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 17 points, Gobert had 15 points and 13 rebounds, and Jordan Clarkson scored all 16 of his points in the second half to boost the Jazz. “We have been emphasizing pushing the pace, playing fast and getting downhill,” Clarkson said. Cam Reddish scored 20 and Clint Capela had 16 points and 11 rebounds for Atlanta. Kevin Huerter’s jumper trimmed Utah’s lead to 82-74 late in the third quarter but the Jazz went on a 21-0 spree to break the game open over the next 4:42. Clarkson’s seven consecutive points and Georges Niang’s 3-pointer staked Utah to its largest lead at 103-74. “We pushed back tonight, being able to withstand their run when teams start to be physical, and we got past that, unlike what we did earlier in the year,” Mitchell said. Capela scored six straight points to cap an 11-0 spurt to start the second half that drew the Hawks to 61-57 after a 15-point halftime deficit, but they never got closer. The Jazz pressured Young from the opening tip and occasionally trapped him to get the ball out of his hands. Young didn’t score until midway through the second quarter and the Hawks struggled to find a rhythm as Utah jumped to an 18-4 lead. “Our mindset coming in was to be more aggressive. We wanted to take our defense to them and not let them dictate the dance,” Conley said. Utah lives by the 3 this season more than ever and saw its margin ebb and flow depending on its accuracy beyond the arc. Two of Utah’s franchise record-high games with 3-pointers made have come in the last four outings, and the Jazz hit 20 of them for the third time in four games. “Our defensive containment on the basketball was a point of emphasis, and we didn’t get it done tonight at all,” Pierce said. On the other side, Atlanta made its first 3 with 4:34 left until halftime. The Hawks finished 5 for 28 from long range. Utah, which allows 1,500 fans in person, hadn’t played at home since beating the Los Angeles Clippers on New Year’s Day but gave the crowd plenty of long-range fireworks. Both teams had an unexpected day off Wednesday because of virus protocols. The Hawks’ matchup with Phoenix was postponed and the Jazz ended their scheduled seven-game road trip one day early because Washington didn’t have the minimum of eight available players. Utah went 4-2 on the trip. TIP-INS Hawks: Onyeka Okongwu, the No. 6 pick in the 2020 NBA draft, made his professional debut after several weeks with left foot inflammation. He had four points and a highlight-reel follow jam. “I haven’t played a game since last year in February, so to get out there and play means the world to me,” he said. … Several times Pierce threw his arms in the air and dropped his head in disgust as the Jazz got a bevy of wide-open looks from 3-point range and the Hawks’ defense scrambled. … Kris Dunn, Danilo Gallinari and Bogdan Bogdanovic all missed the game with injuries. Jazz: Joe Ingles, who had the league’s longest active streak of consecutive games played, missed his third in the last four because of Achilles soreness. ... Mitchell set a team record for consecutive games with at least two 3s, now sitting at 16. … Gobert is riding a seven-game streak with double-digit rebounds.","401267346"
"LeBron James elevates above everyone to grab the Kyle Kuzma miss and slam home a one-handed putback dunk. (0:29) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James had 21 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds, and Anthony Davis added 17 points against his former team in the Los Angeles Lakers' fifth consecutive victory, 112-95 over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit four 3-pointers while scoring 16 points, and Montrezl Harrell also had 16 for the defending NBA champions. Los Angeles fell behind by 15 points early, but rallied ferociously in its first game back at Staples Center after a perfect three-game trip. “We just settled in,” James said. “That first game after a road trip is always kind of difficult, but we got some stops and got back to playing our kind of basketball.” The Lakers remained unbeaten in five meetings with the Pelicans since the franchise-altering trade in July 2019 that sent Davis to LA and three starters to New Orleans. Davis averaged 36 points and 12 rebounds in his three reunions with the Pelicans last season, but he took a complementary role this time in another impressive team win led by James. Seven Lakers scored at least nine points, and LA committed a season-low eight turnovers while forcing 20. “We’ve been locking in defensively,” Davis said. “We had a slow start tonight, but we’ve been doing it on the defensive end. We want to keep that edge. We want to keep that mindset of being scrappy, being physical.” Brandon Ingram scored 17 of his 20 points in the first half against his former team for the Pelicans, who have lost five straight. Zion Williamson had 21 points and 12 rebounds after missing Wednesday's game against the Clippers due to the NBA's health and safety protocols, but New Orleans blew an early 15-point lead on its third stop on a seven-game trip. “There was a lot I wasn’t happy with, but over the last 30 minutes of that game, they were the far better team,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We played a good first 18 minutes, and then they turned up the defense and just dominated us at both ends after that.” Dennis Schröder had 12 points while sparking the Lakers with his aggressive defense, and Kyle Kuzma added 11 points and a season-high 13 rebounds. TIP-INS Pelicans: Lonzo Ball missed his LA homecoming with knee tendinitis. ... Eric Bledsoe scored seven points after being questionable with right eye irritation. ... JJ Redick converted a four-point play in the first quarter. Lakers: They've won 28 straight when holding their opponent under 100 points. ... Davis played despite lower back tightness. ... Alex Caruso had another outstanding two-way game, hitting three straight 3-pointers, adding four assists and posting a plus-28 in 18 minutes of play. GAME-CHANGER Los Angeles broke away with a 15-0 run late in the third quarter while forcing eight straight misses and three turnovers by New Orleans. All told, the Lakers made a 42-15 run in 15 minutes after trailing 70-67 late in the third. The Pelicans only scored 37 points in the second half.","401267347"
"Paul George knows he needed to get back to MVP form, especially after how last season ended for him. (1:24) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Kawhi Leonard had 27 points and six assists in three quarters, Paul George scored 26 and the short-handed Los Angeles Clippers manhandled the Sacramento Kings 138-100 on Friday night. The Clippers have won 15 consecutive road games against the Kings. Los Angeles hasn’t lost in Sacramento since March 19, 2013. The 138 points were the most the Clippers had scored since putting up 150 against Washington on Dec. 1, 2019, although coach Tyronn Lue seemed more pleased with his team’s defense. “We challenged our guys to be better defensively,” Lue said. “I thought we played the right way throughout the course of the game. The whole 48 minutes we played the game the right way and that was good to see.” Playing without guards Patrick Beverley (personal reasons) and Lou Williams (sore left hip), the Clippers led by eight at halftime and then broke the game open in the third quarter when they outscored the Kings 37-16. Leonard had 11 points during the blitz, including a jarring, one-handed dunk over Cory Joseph as part of a 17-2 run. Leonard sat out the fourth period as Lue emptied his bench. Los Angeles’ backups came up big all game to ease the absences of Beverley and Williams. Reggie Jackson started in place of Beverley and had 11 points, three assists and four rebounds. Marcus Morris scored a season-high 18 points, Terance Mann had a season-best 13 points and nine rebounds, and Luke Kennard scored 14. “Pat and Lou are a big part of our team. Missing them is definitely a lot, but we got other guys to step up,” Morris said. “T-Mann stepped up and Reggie stepped up. Kudos to them for staying ready and being ready when their number’s called.” Marvin Bagley III had 20 points and five rebounds for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes added 17 points and five rebounds. “That team just came and pushed us around,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “We have to understand as a group we have to be able to guard people and rebound when we get stops. Right now that’s something we have to figure out. It was evident tonight. They got what they wanted.” Serge Ibaka followed Leonard’s bucket with a backdoor feed to Kennard, and Mann’s dunk made it 99-69. Two nights after allowing Portland to match a franchise record for 3-pointers, Sacramento again struggled with its perimeter defense. The Clippers made seven 3s in the second quarter — three from George and four by Morris, one more than his previous season high. They finished 18 of 35 beyond the arc. MOVE IT, MOVE IT Lue lauded his team’s unselfishness as being key. Los Angeles had 29 assists, the sixth time this season the Clippers have had 28 or more. “When the ball’s hopping like that, everybody’s a part of it,” Lue said. MLK TRIBUTE In a nod to Martin Luther King Day on Monday, players for both teams wore black T-shirts with the phrase, “Now is the time to make justice a reality for all” on the front and “Honor King” on the back. TIP-INS Clippers: Morris shot 7 of 12 from the floor. … Williams sat out after playing nine minutes against New Orleans on Wednesday and not at all in the second half. Kings: With Hassan Whiteside nursing a sore hip, Chimezie Metu’s playing time has picked up as the backup center. A second-round pick of the Spurs in 2018 who is on a two-way contract with Sacramento, Metu played in back-to-back games for the first time this season and matched his career high of 10 points while pulling down eight rebounds.","401267348"
"Mason Jones finds a way to score the off-balanced bucket and draws the foul. (0:19) SAN ANTONIO -- — San Antonio couldn't match the intensity of the short-handed Houston Rockets for three quarters, yet a strong finish by the Spurs was enough to snap a four-game home losing streak. DeMar DeRozan scored 24 points, Dejounte Murray had 18 points and 10 rebounds and San Antonio rallied to beat an eight-man Houston squad 103-91 on Saturday. “We played our best defense in the fourth quarter,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “Which is a good idea.” After a lethargic effort in losing to Houston on Thursday, San Antonio crept along for three quarters in a rare afternoon start. Murray had seven points in the fourth quarter, including a breakaway dunk that put San Antonio up 97-85 with 3:18 remaining after stripping Mason Jones of the ball at midcourt. “We just fought hard,” Murray said. “We came in with the same game plan, but I think we started off real slow. We picked it up. The effort was there in the fourth quarter. We just stuck with it and won the game.” Houston center Christian Wood had 24 points and 17 rebounds, and Jones had a season-high 24 points in his first career start. Ben McLemore had a season-high 21 points on 4-for-7 shooting from 3-point range. No other player had more than seven points for the Rockets. Playing just its second game since trading away disgruntled star James Harden, Houston was on the brink of not having eight players available as required by the league. The Rockets only had seven healthy players after Sterling Brown was ruled out due to a lower leg injury, but Rodions Kurucs became eligible an hour prior to tipoff when the NBA approved the blockbuster trade involving Harden. Houston acquired Kurucs, Victor Oladipo and Dante Exum, along with several draft picks and draft swaps for the disgruntled Harden on Wednesday. Oladipo and Exum were not with the team, and the Rockets were without John Wall, Eric Gordon, Demarcus Cousins, Brown and three others due to injuries. Despite being short-handed, the Rockets had a 10-point lead in the first half. Houston built the advantage on 3-point shooting and finished 12 for 32 from long range. “The effort from the beginning of the game was not what we would have liked or what we could have hoped for, especially after the last game,” Mills said. “But lot of credit goes to them. Their intensity and ability to drive.” The Spurs were able to dominate the paint, with Jakob Poeltl finishing with 13 points and 11 rebounds. “We just focused in the fourth quarter, we really locked in and didn’t want them to get into the paint,” Poeltl said. TIP-INS Rockets: Brown was ruled out about an hour prior to game time. He had 23 points, seven rebounds and three assists in 36 minutes during Houston’s 109-103 victory on Thursday. … Wood entered the game averaging 23.1 points and 10.1 rebounds. He has had at least 20 points in nine of his past 10 games. … Kurucs’ first attempt and basket came when he broke to the rim for a layup off a behind-the-back pass from Wood with 5:41 left in the first quarter. Spurs: Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon remains out, along with reserve center Drew Eubanks, due to the league’s health and safety protocols. ... DeRozan was assessed a technical foul four minutes into the second quarter after punching the ball out of bounds after making a layup. DeRozan was upset no foul was called on Tucker, who defended him on the layup.","401267349"
"James Harden gets up shots before his first game with the Nets. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — James Harden and Kevin Durant needed a little while to remember how to play together again. Once they did, the Brooklyn Nets really got rolling — and they might still get to another gear when Kyrie Irving rejoins them. “The sooner we can be on the court together, it's going to be scary hours,” Harden said. They look pretty fearsome already. Harden delivered 32 points and a triple-double in his Brooklyn debut, Durant scored a season-high 42 points in his first game back with his former teammate, and the Nets showed off their potent potential in a 122-115 victory over the Orlando Magic on Saturday night. Harden had 14 assists and 12 rebounds after being cleared to play earlier in the afternoon after all the players in the blockbuster trade that brought him from Houston had completed their physicals. Harden also had nine turnovers and Durant had six, with some sloppiness while Harden got used to his new teammates. “Early on I felt like we all were overpassing, trying to make everybody comfortable,” Durant said, “and then he just got into his mode of being aggressive to score and that opened up the whole game for others.” Harden had no practice time with the Nets and sure didn't need it, becoming the first player in franchise history to have a triple-double in his debut. Durant made five 3-pointers in his 10th game back following an 18-month layoff after rupturing his Achilles tendon in the 2019 NBA Finals. He hiked his average to 30.7 points, which would be his highest since he scored a league-leading 32 per game and won NBA MVP honors for Oklahoma City in 2014. That was a couple years after he and Harden helped lead the Thunder to the NBA Finals and their new pairing could have similar possibilities. The Nets might still reach another level when they get back Irving, who missed his sixth straight game after leaving the team last week for personal reasons. “I think it’s going to be an adjustment for everyone, but it’s an incredible problem to have and something I think we’ll relish trying to decipher,” coach Steve Nash said. Nikola Vucevic had 34 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists for the short-handed Magic, who lost their fifth straight. They were much more competitive than the others, including a 124-97 loss in Boston on Friday, but didn't have enough answers for Durant or Harden. “I mean, they’re whatever, they're, two of the four, five best offensive players in the world,” coach Steve Clifford said. Harden didn't score until making a pair of free throws with 6.8 seconds left in the first quarter and didn't make his first basket until a layup with 10:07 remaining in the half. But his playmaking was on track from the start, pushing up the floor to find teammates rather than often dribbling down the shot clock in Houston. He got his shot going during an 11-point third quarter, capping it with a deep 3-pointer just before the buzzer to give Brooklyn an 84-83 lead. TIP-INS Magic: Clifford successfully challenged a foul called on the Magic with 8.6 seconds left and his team trailing by seven. He improved to 5 for 5 on coach's challenges this season. ... Terrence Ross scored 23 points. Rookie Cole Anthony tied his season high with 16. Nets: Durant has scored 25 or points in nine straight games, setting a new franchise record. ... Nash said F/C Nicolas Claxton, who has been out all season with a right knee injury, likely wouldn't return until later in the first half of the season, probably in February. CLOSING IN ON KYRIE? Nash said Irving was hopefully close to returning, but said no date has ben determined. He wants the point guard to have proper time to ramp up his activities accordingly following his layoff. He said Irving has been working out on is own and could do so with a group of players Sunday during a day off.","401267350"

"Jerami Grant does it all, blocking a shot on defense and then weaving through Heat defenders to score. (0:17) MIAMI -- — The Detroit Pistons had their most dominant quarter in nearly two years. And last season’s NBA Finals trip for the Miami Heat suddenly seems long ago. Jerami Grant scored 24 points, Derrick Rose had 23 off the bench and the Pistons — the team with the NBA’s worst record — came into Miami and beat the Heat 120-100 on Saturday night, sending the reigning Eastern Conference champions to a third consecutive loss. The teams meet again Monday in Miami. “I definitely think it was the most complete game we played so far,"" Grant said. Blake Griffin scored 15 for Detroit, which outscored Miami 38-19 in the third quarter. It was the biggest margin the Pistons outscored an opponent by in their last 331 quarters, going back to April 9, 2019. Bam Adebayo scored 28 points for Miami, which got 22 from Duncan Robinson, 16 from KZ Okpala and 12 from Goran Dragic. “We didn't play to ... the Miami Heat culture that we represent,"" Adebayo said. “I feel like we're letting not only us and our teammates down, but the staff, we're letting this organization down, the fans down. We're built on the culture. The culture is take a bunch of guys, counted out, overlooked, and you figure it out. Right now, we're not doing it."" Miami was without Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley (both coronavirus-related), Tyler Herro (neck spasms) and Meyers Leonard (shoulder). The Heat got six players back — including Adebayo, Okpala and Dragic — from the NBA’s health and safety protocols list after satisfying quarantines mandated after contact tracing showed they may be exposed. “These are the circumstances,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “It's not just for us. There are a lot of teams going through it."" The Pistons got a reminder of the virus-dominated world postgame. Moments after going into the locker room for what should have been a few minutes of joy, they got told to go for an extra round of testing — so they came back out, went across the court into a far corner of the arena to get those done. The Heat also were tested postgame. Those moves came after a week where the NBA postponed 12 games for virus-related reasons and put in tougher protocols with hopes of keeping players and coaches safer. “It's part of our new NBA,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “The only thing you can count on are the unusual things that happen during the day. ... It's not just about basketball. It's about lives."" The Pistons led by as many as 23, their biggest lead this season. Miami has trailed by at least 23 points in four of its first 11 games; that happened in four of 73 Heat regular-season games last season. Isaiah Stewart had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Pistons. TIP-INS Pistons: Rose returned after missing Detroit’s last two games with left knee soreness. ... Before Saturday, Detroit’s last quarter that was won by 19 or more was the fourth against Memphis in the next-to-last game of the 2018-19 season. The Pistons outscored the Grizzlies 36-14. Heat: Robinson got credited for what officially is his fifth career dunk, the first that happened at AmericanAirlines Arena. ... Okpala got his first NBA start. STRUGGLING HEAT Miami, which has used eight starting lineups in 11 games, is 4-7. Only seven of the team’s 33 seasons have started worse. MIAMI TIES The Pistons have plenty of Miami ties. They started former Heat guard Wayne Ellington, had Delon Wright — brother of Dorell Wright, a 2006 NBA champion with the Heat — come off the bench and have former Heat guard Rodney McGruder on the roster as well. Plus, rookie Saddiq Bey nearly signed with the Miami Hurricanes before choosing Villanova.","401267352"
"Ja Morant shows he's back to top form, making athletic plays throughout the game as he scores 17 points in the Grizzlies' 106-104 win over the 76ers. (1:50) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Ja Morant returned to the Memphis lineup after missing eight games with an ankle injury and scored 17 points, leading the Grizzlies to a 106-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. Morant, who sprained his left ankle Dec. 28 at Brooklyn, added six assists. Rookie Xavier Tillman added 15 points and Grayson Allen had 12 as the Grizzlies won their fourth straight game. “It felt good, starting with just being able to get back out there on the floor after being out almost three weeks,” Morant said. “I was really just itching to get back out there.” Shake Milton, who had 31 points in the Sixers win over Miami on Thursday, helped rally Philadelphia from a 13-point deficit in with a burst in the fourth quarter, scoring 15 of his 28 points in the period, while going 6 of 11 from the field in the frame. Tobias Harris added 21 points for Philadelphia, including six straight to pull the Sixers within 105-104 on a 12-footer with 1:25 left. But Harris stepped out of bounds in the closing seconds, turning the ball over. Tyrese Maxey missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer, and Memphis took the win. “It was just a very undisciplined, sloppy basketball game. Turned the ball over down the stretch the last two times,” Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said, adding: “Disappointing loss to me. Very winnable game, and just didn’t get it done.” Ben Simmons fell just short of a triple-double with 11 points, a season-high 16 rebounds and nine assists. The Grizzlies benefited from Morant’s return, while the Sixers played without center Joel Embiid, who was rested due to right knee pain. It was yet another game where Philadelphia was without one of its starters. “At the end of the day, we do need each other. … When we are together, the five starters, we complement each other,” Harris said. Neither team led by more than six points in a closely played first half. Harris led balanced scoring from Philadelphia with 10 points. Morant led Memphis with 12 points. Memphis stretched the lead to 11 points near the midway point of the third quarter and eventually held an 88-76 lead heading into the fourth. The win marked the eighth straight game Memphis has held an opponent under 110 points. “Over the last eight games, these guys have just really embraced the opportunity to get better on both sides of the ball,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said “Defensively, that’s a lot of credit to (the players).” TIP-INS 76ers: C Dwight Howard started his third game of the season in Embiid’s place. … Despite Embiid’s absence, Philadelphia had 11 blocks in the game, six in the first quarter, including three by Danny Green. Grizzlies: Have won seven straight home games in the series. Have not lost to the Sixers in Memphis since Dec. 26, 2012. … Counting the Brooklyn win when Morant was injured, the Grizzlies went 5-4 during his absence. … Brandon Clarke struggled in the first half, hitting only 1 of 9 shots. Dillon Brooks was 3 of 10 in the half. JA LOCKED IN The previous two games, the Grizzlies had hinted on Morant’s return, moving his status to questionable. But even before his return Saturday, he has stayed engaged while recovering from the ankle sprain. “He’s super locked-in on the sidelines, coaching from the sidelines,” Jenkins said. “So, we know his mind’s locked in. What he’s doing with his body to get back healthy, it’s been really impressive.” TOO MANY TURNOVERS Rivers was particularly bothered by his team’s turnovers. The 76ers committed 22 in the game. “If you play that way, you deserve to (lose),” Rivers said. “I would say of the 22 (turnovers), 15 were unforced. Just sloppy. Driving into traffic, cross-court passes, interior passes” that resulted in turnovers.","401267353"
"Damian Lillard lobs a pass from half court to Derrick Jones Jr., who finishes with a two-handed jam. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Damian Lillard scored 36 points and the Portland Trail Blazers rebounded from a first-half deficit to beat the Atlanta Hawks 112-106 on Saturday night. Enes Kanter added 12 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks for the Blazers, who have won five of their last six. Guard CJ McCollum left the game at halftime because of a left foot sprain, but coach Terry Stotts said afterward that X-Rays had ruled out more serious injury. “I think we should be proud of ourselves and the effort that we had in the second half,"" Lillard said. ”We know that first half wasn't good enough. This was a game we had to have."" Trae Young had 26 points and 11 assists, while Clint Capela added 25 points and 15 rebounds for Atlanta, which was playing the second of a back-to-back following a 116-92 loss at Utah a night earlier. Portland led 98-94 with just under six minutes left after trailing by as many as 16 points in the opening half. Gary Trent Jr.'s 3-pointer extended the lead to 101-96. After Capela's dunk, Trent hit another 3 and Lillard dished to Derrick Jones Jr. for the alley-oop to put the Blazers in front 106-98 with 3:53 left. Atlanta chipped away, getting within 106-104 on Capela's tip. After Lillard made free throws, Young's layup made it 108-106 with under a minute left. Carmelo Anthony missed a pull-up jumper from out front, but Young was called for an offensive foul on Lillard at the other end. After review, the call stood, and Lillard made free throws to close it out. “Tough loss. I thought they executed down the stretch. I thought the biggest area for us was just the fourth quarter lack of execution of our offense,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Defensively, we did a few nice things to speed the game up and try and take the ball out of Lillard's hands, but we just struggled down the stretch.” The Blazers (8-5) were playing in their first game without big man Jusuf Nurkic, who fractured his right wrist in the third quarter of a 111-87 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Thursday. Kanter, who started in his place, said the Blazers were playing for Nurkic. “It's just sad because what he was doing was just bringing so much to our team,” Kanter said. “He was a big part of our family.” Cam Reddish did not play for Atlanta (5-7) because of a knee contusion. Pierce said before the game he was just sore and hadn't had time to recover after Friday night's game. Young had back tightness going into the game but started. The Hawks had a 14-5 run to close the opening quarter up 38-34 then extended the lead to 52-36 on Young's 3-pointer. Portland rebounded, pulling within 62-59 on Kanter's layup but the Hawks went into the break ahead 66-59. Capela led Atlanta with 19 points, while Lillard had 19 for Portland. McCollum, who had 16 points in the first half, did not return for the second. It was unclear when he was hurt but it appeared that Capela stepped on his foot following a layup in the opening quarter. Rodney Hood's 3 pointer got the Blazers with 82-79 late in the third and Portland pulled into an 82-all tie with less that a minute left. Portland took an 88-86 lead on Gary Trent Jr.'s layup and Anthony's 3-pointer made it 94-90 with 7:33 left.

"Immanuel Quickley finds a cutting Obi Toppin, who flies toward the rim for the huge dunk. (0:20) BOSTON -- — Julius Randle scored 20 points with 12 rebounds and RJ Barrett had 19 and 11 on Sunday to help the New York Knicks snap a five-game losing streak and beat the Boston Celtics 105-75. Jaylen Brown scored 25 for Boston, which had the best record in the Eastern Conference after winning five in a row but suffered its biggest blowout and lowest-scoring output of the season. “I don’t believe that’s who this team is,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “We had a clunker. You try to have as few of those as you can. ... We just looked like we were in mud today.” All-Star Kemba Walker made his season debut after missing the first 11 games with a left knee injury but left in the third quarter with a rib injury. Fellow Celtics All-Star Jayson Tatum missed his second straight game with COVID-19. The Knicks led by as many as 11 in the first quarter and made it 15 in the second before scoring the first 10 points in the third quarter to open a 58-35 lead. The Celtics never got closer than 18 after that. “They’ve played extremely well short-handed, and dealing with a lot of tough stuff with guys being out,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “Sometimes when you get guys back, there’s another adjustment you have to go through. ... Getting Kemba back, there was an adjustment for them.” KEMBA BACK OUT Walker went to the locker room after taking a shot to the ribs while getting boxed out by Nerlens Noel in the third quarter. Walker said he simply got the wind knocked out of him. He did not return, but he already had played 20 minutes, which was his limit. Walker scored nine points on 3-of-13 shooting, adding three rebounds, four assists and three steals but committing five turnovers. He was 1 for 8 from 3-point range. “It felt really good to be out there. Really good. I almost forgot how it felt,” Walker said. “Free, which I haven’t been for a very, very, very long time. It feels weird not having pain, if that makes sense.” BENCH STRENGTH The Knicks had a 38-25 edge in bench scoring, led by Immanuel Quickley's 17 points and eight assists. “It’s just his craftiness,” Thibodeau said. “He’s got every shot you can imagine.” Reigning NCAA player of the year and No. 8 overall draft pick Obi Toppin added 12 points and five rebounds in 17 minutes — his most extensive action since injuring his left calf in the opener. He missed 10 consecutive games before returning on Wednesday. “He was terrific in training camp,” Thibodeau said. “To get an injury like he had, it’s not an easy thing to deal with — particularly for a guy going through the league for the first time.” TIP-INS Knicks: Thibodeau, who was an assistant on the Celtics team that won the 2008 NBA title, celebrated his 63rd birthday. ...

Boston's previous lowest scoring game was 93 points against Detroit on New Year's Day. The biggest blowout was a 28-point loss to the Nets on Christmas. ... Tatum has not played since Jan. 8.

"Luka Doncic comes alive in the first half, scoring 30 points as the Mavericks trail the Bulls 67-52. (1:52) DALLAS -- — Lauri Markkanen had 29 points and 10 rebounds, Garrett Temple scored 15 of his season-high 21 points in the second quarter and the Chicago Bulls ended a four-game losing streak with a 117-101 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday. Dallas star Luka Doncic passed Michael Jordan on the career list with his 29th triple-double, finishing with 36 points, 16 rebounds and 15 assists, including a behind-the-back pass to Willie Cauley-Stein for a dunk. Doncic is tied with Grant Hill for 15th place. The Slovenian sensation, who had 30 points at halftime, didn't get nearly enough help with the Mavericks missing five rotation players because of COVID-19 protocols and guard Tim Hardaway Jr. with a left groin strain. “Not having Hardaway hurts us,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “But we have other guys that can fill in and do the job defensively and play a role within the system.” Doncic had his European sidekick in Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 20 points, after both missed a loss at Chicago this month. But the 7-foot-3 Latvian was 0 of 7 from 3-point range as Dallas players not named Doncic shot 10% from deep (2 of 20). Markkanen, in his second game back after missing seven games because of COVID-19 protocols, was 10 of 19 from the field while recording season highs in points and rebounds. “I was a little short on my shot and trying to get my legs back,” Markkanen said. “Conditioning-wise, I feel pretty good. There was a stretch in the third quarter when I checked in and I felt like it was 20 seconds and I was gassed. Other than that little stretch, it was pretty good.” The Bulls, who lost all four games on their skid by four points or fewer, took control with a 40-point second quarter and didn't let their lead get under nine points in the second half. Zach LaVine, who had 21 first-quarter points in the earlier win over Dallas, didn't get his first bucket until the third quarter while going 1 of 8 from the field and making all eight free throws to finish with 10 points and 10 assists. “I thought he made great decisions and he played a tremendous floor game,” coach Billy Donovan said. “He didn’t really force anything. There was a lot of things we did today where I thought there was some growth from the last game.” Dallas guard Jalen Brunson, who scored a season-high 31 points when Doncic was sidelined by a quadriceps injury in Chicago, was listed as questionable on the COVID-19 list and didn't play. Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell were out again. Carlisle said he expected Brunson to be available Monday against Toronto. TIP-INS Bulls: After setting a franchise record with consecutive games with at least seven 3-pointers, LaVine missed all five shots from long range. ... The Bulls finished with six players in double figures. The other was Wendell Carter Jr., who had 12 points, seven rebounds and five of Chicago's 14 steals. Mavericks: During warmups for the first two of two straight games on MLK Day weekend, the players wore shirts that read on the front, “Now is the time to make justice a reality for all.” The back read, “honor KING.” ... Cauley-Stein and James Johnson were the other double-figure scorers for Dallas with 10 points apiece. HELP IN THE FOURTH The Bulls kept the lead in double digits throughout the fourth quarter thanks in part to Otto Porter Jr., who had 12 of his 14 points in the final period and finished with nine rebounds. Thaddeus Young scored 15 points, with four in the fourth. GAMES PILING UP If the schedule holds, the Mavericks are headed on another three-game road trip that will put them at 11 of their first 15 games away from home. After that, it's another back-to-back with a home game against Houston on Saturday. And that will be five games in seven days. “Right now we’re entering the most difficult stretch of schedule in Mavericks history,” Carlisle said.","401267358"
"Donovan Mitchell scores the first basket for the Jazz and it's an uncontested slammer. (0:16) DENVER -- — The game had a certain intensity — not necessarily playoff intensity, Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic cautioned, but definitely a tension. They always do when these two fierce Northwest Division rivals take the court. Reserve Jordan Clarkson scored 23 points, Donovan Mitchell added 18 and the Utah Jazz beat the Nuggets 109-105 Sunday night in their first meeting since a thrilling playoff series last season that Denver captured in seven games. “That kind of game,” Jokic said. “Intense. It was good basketball.” Rudy Gobert finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds in a contest in which Mitchell struggled with his shot, going 7 of 20 from the field. But Mitchell hit a clutch fadeaway with 1:01 remaining and with Denver staging a late rally. Mitchell also had seven assists as the Jazz won their fifth straight game. Jokic had 35 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, while Jamal Murray chipped in 30 — 24 in the first half — for the Nuggets. Murray averaged 31.6 points in the first-round playoff series inside the NBA bubble to help the Nuggets overcome a 3-1 deficit to knock off the Jazz. The Jazz took the lead for good late in the third quarter when Mike Conley stole the ball from Jokic and dished it over to Clarkson, who hit a 3-pointer. But the Nuggets hung around until end. Murray drained a 3-pointer with about seven seconds remaining to bring the Nuggets to within 107-105. Gobert sealed the win with a dunk. “It’s not always going to be sunshine and rainbows where we execute the game plan 110%,” Mitchell explained. “We went out there and for us, just asserting our will. Finding ways to win the game by any means necessary.” The 2020 first-round series between the two teams inside the NBA bubble turned into the Mitchell &amp; Murray Show, with both guards turning in electric performances. Mitchell averaged 36.3 points during the series and Murray countered with a pair of 50-point games. “I really feel that first-round matchup will go down as one of the better playoff series played,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “You had all the drama going on — we got down 3-1 and we come back and win. Within that, you have two young dynamic players, Murray and Mitchell, that put on an incredible show game after game after game.” This matchup had an entirely different look. The Nuggets no longer have Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig or Mason Plumlee. The Jazz had back Bojan Bogdanovic, who missed the playoffs due to wrist surgery. He was the X-factor in this contest, hitting five 3-pointers and scoring 17. “It's still the Jazz and the Nuggets. Whether you need to reference (the series) or not, your players remember,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Given the fact that it is the first time we have played them since then, I don’t know if it’s in the front of your mind, but it is certainly something you have thought about.” The Nuggets finished 40 of 100 from the field. They took 24 more shots than Utah. “Small details win the game between us and them,” Jokic said. TIP-INS Jazz: Utah went 15 of 37 from the 3-point line. ... Conley finished with 14 points and eight assists. Nuggets: F Michael Porter Jr. missed a ninth straight game due to the league’s health and safety protocols. ... Reserve P.J. Dozier had nine points. BUFFS SHOUTOUT Malone applauded the upset win by the Colorado women’s team over top-ranked Stanford down the road in Boulder on Sunday. The Buffaloes won 77-72 in overtime for the women’s first victory over a No. 1 team in program history. “Great win,” Malone said. JOKIC VS. GOBERT Don't ask Jokic about going up against Gobert in the middle. He doesn't see it that way. “I’m playing against the Utah Jazz,” Jokic said.","401267360"
"Zion Williamson racks up 31 points on efficient 13-of-15 shooting to lead the Pelicans past the Kings. (1:52) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Zion Williamson had 31 points and six rebounds, Steven Adams made a pair of clutch free throws with 17.9 seconds remaining, and the New Orleans Pelicans overcame a 43-point performance by Sacramento’s De’Aaron Fox and beat the Kings 128-123 Sunday night. Brandon Ingram scored 22 points, Eric Bledsoe added 21 and Adams had 12 points and 15 rebounds to help the Pelicans end a five-game losing streak. “We were just making pretty good plays, forcing them into shots that we wanted them to take,” Adams said. “Fox played really well. We had a problem with him, but other than that, we were just being super aggressive.” Fox, who was limited to 14 points in a 38-point loss to the Clippers two nights earlier, had a career-high point total and 13 assists for the Kings, who have lost eight of 10. New Orleans led by 19 points in the first half before the Kings made a late run. Marvin Bagley made a 3-pointer and Fox followed with a one-handed dunk that cut the deficit to 116-115. Adams and Williamson made two free throws apiece for the Pelicans and Bledsoe scored in the paint to make it 122-115. After the Kings scored on back-to-back trips down the court, Adams made two more free throws and JJ Reddick added a pair, helping the Pelicans hang on. Williamson fell one point shy of his season-high for scoring. The Pelicans’ big man made 13 of 15 attempts and spent much of the fourth quarter on the bench in foul trouble. “He finds his way to the rim regardless of the defense and he’s a good finisher,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “He probably should shoot twice as many free throws as he does. He’s not even getting calls and he’s efficient.” Bagley finished with 26 points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes had 16 points and seven rebounds. “I was very pleased to see us get our fight back tonight. That’s how we were playing earlier in the year and we were winning games,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “They made plays down the stretch and we missed some opportunities down the stretch.” Fox became the first player in the Kings’ Sacramento era to have 40 or more points and 10-plus assists in one game. Nate ‘Tiny’ Archibald was the last player in franchise history to accomplish that feat, doing it in 1973 when the team played in Kansas City and Omaha. “There’s more, offensively and defensively, that I’m able to do,” Fox said. “We lost on a career high (for me) so it doesn’t really matter.” DEFENSIVE UNDOING The Kings problems on defense continue. Over the last three games they allowed the Trail Blazers to match a franchise record for 3-pointers, then let the Clippers and Pelicans set season-highs for scoring. Sacramento has given up 122 points or more in eight consecutive games. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans was hit with a delay of game call coming out of halftime. … JJ Redick made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to end the first quarter. … Ingram went down hard while defending just before halftime. Ingram remained on his back for a few moments, and then got to his feet went to the locker room. He returned for the second half. … Lonzo Ball (knee) sat out a third consecutive game. Kings: Sacramento had as many assists (10) as it did rebounds in the first half. … The Kings closed the third quarter on an 18-4 run. … Buddy Hield has made at least one 3-pointer in 80 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NBA.","401267361"
"Domantas Sabonis collects an offensive rebound and flips up a reverse layup as the halftime buzzer sounds. (0:25) LOS ANGELES -- — Marcus Morris scored a season-high 20 points to lead seven players in double figures, and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Indiana Pacers 129-96 on Sunday night for their first four-game winning streak of the season. With sharpshooter Lou Williams sidelined, Morris came off the bench to hit four 3-pointers, tying his season-high. He was coming off an 18-point performance at Sacramento on Friday. The Clippers made 19 of 39 from long-range, outdueling the Pacers, who were 11 of 38. “I was wide-open,” Morris said. “If I can't make a wide-open shot, I'm in the wrong business.” Fellow reserve Luke Kennard added season highs of 20 points and five 3-pointers. Paul George also had 20 points. Kawhi Leonard had 17 points, seven rebounds and five assists for the Clippers. “I feel like our energy is way better this season,” Morris said. “Guys are buying in and enjoying playing the game.” Doug McDermott led the Pacers with 23 points, making five 3-pointers. Domantas Sabonis added 19 points and 14 rebounds. Indiana closed within two points early in the third before the Clippers put the game away. They outscored the Pacers 37-14 the rest of the quarter to lead 100-75 going into the fourth. Los Angeles made eight 3-pointers by six different players and Leonard scored 11 points. “They started making shots,” Sabonis said. “I feel like we left guys too open. We were throwing out a lot of different defenses and they caught on to the box-and-1 and it was harder for us to catch up.” The Clippers ran off 10 straight points early in the fourth to lead 110-81. Kennard had a 3-point play and George scored seven in a row. “Excited to see how far he can take it,” Morris said of George. “Been playing very well, unselfish, under control. He’s definitely playing MVP basketball.” Indiana had won two straight, but was idle since Thursday at Portland. The team's game at Phoenix on Saturday was postponed because of COVID-19 issues. That didn't stop McDermott from bursting out of the gate. He scored 13 of the Pacers' first 21 points. The Clippers hit five 3-pointers while outscoring the Pacers 35-12 over the end of the first quarter and start of the second to build an 18-point lead. Indiana closed strongly with a 20-10 run, including 10 by Sabonis, that left the Pacers trailing 61-55 at halftime. TIP-INS Pacers: Myles Turner was out with a sore right hand. ...

"Immanuel Quickley throws the lob up to Obi Toppin who flushes it home with two hands. (0:21) NEW YORK -- — R.J. Barrett scored 22 points and had 10 rebounds, and Julius Randle added 21 points and 17 rebounds to lead the New York Knicks to a 91-84 win over the Orlando Magic on Monday. Elfrid Payton chipped in with 12 points and rookie guard Immanuel Quickley added 11 for the Knicks, who improved to 7-8 with their second straight win Nikola Vucevic had 24 points and 14 rebounds for Orlando, which lost its sixth in a row and fell to 6-8. Aaron Gordon had 18 points and 17 rebounds while Terrence Ross added 19 points for the Magic. Perhaps the early start -- it was noon tip-off -- affected both teams because New York led 47-38 after a first half in which the Knicks only made 37 percent of their shots and Orlando hit 32 percent. New York’s lead grew to 68-54 after Obi Toppin’s alley-oop jam one minute into the fourth. The Magic rallied and went ahead 81-80 when Ross’ 28-foot heave beat an expiring shot clock. The lead lasted for all of eight seconds, as Randle tied the game with a free throw. On New York’s ensuing possession, Randle hit a floater during a run in which the Knicks scored nine straight points. TIP-INS Magic: The matinee marked a homecoming of sorts for Cole Anthony, the 15th overall pick in the draft. Anthony, who grew up in New York City and is the son of former Knick and current TNT analyst Greg Anthony, played his first game as a professional at Madison Square Garden. The 20-year old entered the game averaging 10.4 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. He finished with six points, five rebounds and one assist. “I think it’s what he wants,” Orlando coach Steve Clifford said before the game. “He’s a confident young guy. He’s handling it well."" Knicks: Fourteen games is a small sample size, but New York coach Tom Thibodeau is pleased with the play of third-year forward Kevin Knox, who came into the game shooting 43 percent from the field and averaging 7.8 points per game coming off the bench. Knox, who came into the season shooting 33.7 percent from 3, is connecting at a 44.2 percent clip so far in 2020-21. “I thought when he took good shots, he made them or they were in-and-out,” was how Thibodeau assessed Knox’s improved play. “He’s allowing the game to come to him. He put a lot of time into shooting this summer. He can do more than spot up.” SUCCESS New York improved to 23-12 all-time on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.","401267363"

"Bam Adebayo denies Jerami Grant late in the fourth quarter, putting the finishing touches on the Heat win. (0:27) MIAMI -- — The Miami Heat eventually showed up to a game already behind schedule. Bam Adebayo had 28 points and 11 rebounds and the short-handed Heat got their biggest comeback win of the season, rallying from 19 down to beat the Detroit Pistons 113-107 on Monday night to snap a three-game slide. “It was not pretty. It was ugly,"" Miami guard Goran Dragic said. “But we're happy."" Dragic scored 22 points for the Heat, who got 18 apiece from Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn. Miami was again without Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley (virus protocols), Tyler Herro (neck) and Meyers Leonard (shoulder). “In some ways it feels like two wins, just because we are persevering though a lot of different things without feeling sorry for ourselves or making excuses,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I really commend the way the guys have handled all of this.” Jerami Grant had 27 points for Detroit, but his layup that could have gotten the Pistons within three was blocked by Adebayo with 31 seconds left. Wayne Ellington made seven 3-pointers and scored 24 for the Pistons, who got 21 from Derrick Rose and 15 from Mason Plumlee. Detroit's Blake Griffin was shaken up in the final seconds and limped off the court after the final buzzer. He had five points in 36 minutes. The game was supposed to start at 3 p.m. Eastern; it started at 8 p.m., delayed by the NBA to allow time for COVID-19 tests to be processed. “We found out mid-morning when we already had our walkthrough, our breakfast and testing,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “So, it just changed the time that the bus left. ... We can’t even leave the rooms anyway.” Waiting all day didn’t seem to bother Detroit early. It was 11-2 when Spoelstra called his first timeout after three minutes, and 12-2 when the timeout ended. A review of a jumper by Ellington showed it was a 3-pointer, not a 2-pointer, and just like that the Pistons were up 10. Detroit’s lead was 28-9 after 7 minutes following another 3 by Ellington. The Heat chipped away, briefly held the lead late in the half, and used a 24-10 run to take a 12-point lead early in the fourth. “We knew they were going to come out better in the second half,” Ellington said. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit is one of two teams without consecutive wins this season. The other is Miami. ... Ellington got fouled twice on 3-pointers, making all three free throws on the first, missing after making the 3 on the second. ... Grant is the 12th Piston to score 20 points in at least 12 consecutive games. Heat: Miami has used nine starting lineups through 12 games, with Dragic starting Monday for the first time this season. Brooklyn and Cleveland have also used nine starting lineups; Utah is the only team to use only one. ... Dragic’s first assist was the 4,000th of his career. KING TRIBUTE As part of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration, a recording of the Black national anthem — “Lift Every Voice and Sing” — was played pregame, preceding “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The teams gathered at midcourt, holding a banner bearing King's words “I Have A Dream.” ROBINSON'S 100 Robinson has 326 3-pointers through his first 100 games. That's 76 more than any other player has managed in his first 100 games; Dallas' Luka Doncic had 250. SCHEDULE QUIRK The last five Heat-Pistons games have been in Miami. The last time Miami went to Detroit was exactly two years ago Monday. Miami will visit the Pistons once in the season’s second half.","401267366"
"Dejounte Murray drives to the bucket, but then kicks out to a wide-open Rudy Gay for a 3-pointer. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — LaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points, DeMar DeRozan had 20 points and 11 assists and the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 125-104 on Monday. Rudy Gay and Patty Mills came off the bench for 21 points apiece as the Spurs reserves outscored Portland backups 59-24. Reserve center Jakob Poeltl added 11 points and seven rebounds, six of which came on the offensive glass. “Their bench hurt us,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “The shooting off the bench, the second-chance opportunities. They really hurt us. They had 10 second-chance points in the fourth quarter.” Aldridge, playing against the team he spent nine years with, got things rolling for the Spurs. “He set the tone early,” Gay said. “He got to his spots and he knocked down his shots. Him knocking down shots and pulling out the big men kind of opens things up. It opens up cracks and DeMar slips through those cracks.” Aldridge scored eight points in the first quarter. “He didn’t catch and think about it,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “He was just determined to let it fly.” Between DeRozan and point guard Dejounte Murray, the Spurs also had two players with 11 assists apiece while the Blazers had just 20 total assists as a team. “They’re unselfish guys and they don’t really care who scores,” Popovich said of his two offensive conductors. “They just play the game the right way.” Damian Lillard led Portland with 35 points. Carmelo Anthony’s basket with 2 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter gave the Trail Blazers an 80-78 lead. The Spurs took over from there, later using an 11-0 run for a 95-82 lead early in the fourth period. Rodney Hood’s 3-pointer on the next Blazers possession after a timeout stopped that burst, but San Antonio kept pulling away. With his bench playing so well and extending the lead, Popovich elected stick with a bench-heavy unit to close out the victory. TIP-INS Spurs: The game was played on Martin Luther King Jr. Day — the NBA celebrates the holiday with a big slate of games every year. Popovich, who is often outspoken about matters outside of the game, called the civil rights leader a “modern founding father” and the “conscience” of the country. Blazers: After leaving Saturday night’s game against Atlanta with a sprained foot, guard CJ McCollum will be out at least another week, Stotts said. McCollum will be re-evaluated next week after MRIs showed the sprain. McCollum was averaging a career-high 26.7 points and five assists per game prior to the injury. Hood got the start in McCollum’s place, with Stotts citing his preference to bring Gary Trent Jr.’s scoring off the bench. Hood had a season-high 21 points in his first start since suffering a torn Achilles on Dec. 6, 2019. “The coaches and (Lillard) were telling me to be aggressive,” Hood said after the game. “I felt good about that and it did a lot for my confidence.” Lillard didn’t want to speculate too much after the game but he says he’s “not worried” about McCollum missing extended time.","401267367"
"Chris Paul shows off the handles before dishing it low to Deandre Ayton as he spins away from the defender and rattles the rim. (0:23) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Ja Morant had 17 points and 10 assists and took a key charge late as the Memphis Grizzlies won their fifth straight, beating the Phoenix Suns 108-104 on Monday. Morant assisted on Grayson Allen’s 3-pointer with 1:06 left to give Memphis a 101-98 lead, then scored on a drive with 30.8 seconds remaining. On the ensuing possession, Morant took a charge against Chris Paul to help maintain the Memphis lead. “Ja has a crazy good feel for the game,” said Brandon Clarke, who matched Morant’s 17 points. “I feel like those first three quarters, he’s just kind of like watching the defense, watching us, seeing what the defense gives him. “By the fourth quarter, he’s just kind of like already figured out everything with that, and he’s able to get in the paint, get his shot off, get his teammates shots.” Allen, who finished with 16 points, converted four free throws down the stretch to preserve the win. “We didn’t get stops. We didn’t execute,” said Paul, who finished with 16 points and seven assists. “I had six turnovers. This ain’t it. This ain’t it. ... We shouldn’t be losing this many close games like that.” Deandre Ayton led the Suns with 18 points and tied a season high with 16 rebounds, while Mikal Bridges had 17 points. Devin Booker added 12 points but struggled from the field, converting only five of his 21 shots. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said the Grizzlies tried to share the load of defending Booker. “I thought Grayson, in particular, did a really, really nice job,” Jenkins said. “We had a lot of guys switching on to (Booker) throughout the game. That’s just discipline team-wise.” The game — part of Memphis’ 19th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration — marked the first time Phoenix had played in a week after having three games canceled under the league’s health and safety guidelines. Monday’s game was a matchup of pieced-together lineups as both teams were dealing with injuries and the league’s health and safety protocols. Three players didn’t travel with the Suns, including Dario Saric. The Grizzlies had Jaren Jackson Jr. and Justise Winslow out with injuries and starting center Jonas Valanciunas entered the health and safety protocols after Saturday’s win over Philadelphia. In the end, the Suns were not able to hold the advantage in the final 2:39. After taking a 98-94 lead, Phoenix was outscored 14-6. Suns coach Monty Williams called Allen’s 3-pointer “a microcosm of the whole night,” adding: “Down the stretch, we had some shots, we just missed them.” TIP-INS Suns: With the absence of Saric, Damian Jones and rookie big man Jalen Smith, that left only Ayton and Frank Kaminsky in the low post for the Suns. “I’m just grateful to have those two guys,” Williams said. ... The Suns have played in two other MLK Jr. Day games in Memphis — 2007 and 2010. ... Cameron Johnson moved into the starting lineup for Jae Crowder, who started the first 11 Phoenix games. ... Cameron Payne, who missed the previous two games with a sprained right ankle, returned to action. Grizzlies: With Valanciunas unavailable, rookie Xavier Tillman made his first NBA start. “Me and my wife (Sunday) were in the car geeked and screaming (thinking) ‘No way this is happening,’” Tillman said. “When coach told me, I was kind of ready for it, hoping it’s going to happen. So, I was kind of prepared for it.”... Memphis shot 13 of 18 in the second quarter, including missing on one of six 3-pointers. COVID CHAOS With the cancellations around the league because of health and safety protocols, every game seems up in the air until tipoff. “For us, we just kind of take it moment by moment, day by day, not trying to look too far ahead,” Jenkins said. “We always prepare that we’re playing a game until we’re not.”","401267368"
"James Harden describes how different his and Durant's chemistry is now with the Nets than it was back with the Thunder. (0:56) NEW YORK -- — James Harden missed a jumper with a chance for the lead, tracked down the rebound and fired it out to a wide-open Kevin Durant. Plays like that are why the Brooklyn Nets will be such tough opponents after reuniting the multi-time scoring champions. Even when teams stop one superstar, another might be there waiting. “This is what they do. They wake up, come to the game and they score 30,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “If you’re not aggressive and you’re not locked in against them, they’re going to score 50.” Durant made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 36 seconds left, Harden had 34 points and 12 assists, and the Nets edged the Bucks 125-123 on Monday night. They are 2-0 since last week's acquisition of Harden, who is averaging 33 points and 13 assists in his new uniform. “We’re still trying to find our way and we’ve still got room to improve, but it’s a solid start,” Durant said. Durant finished with 30 points, nine rebounds and six assists to give the Nets their fourth straight victory in a game in which two of the East's best went toe-to-toe right down to a tense finish that ended when Khris Middleton missed a potential winning 3-pointer from the corner. “It’s a huge win for us,” Harden said. “This is our second game together and we haven’t had one practice.” Antetokounmpo had 34 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for Milwaukee, which had its four-game winning streak stopped. Middleton added 25 points and Jrue Holiday had 22. Harden had 11 points at halftime following his 32-point Nets debut, when he added 14 assists and 12 rebounds. But he picked it up in the second half and contributed to the biggest play of the game. He swooped in to grab the rebound of his own 3-pointer that was off with the Nets trailing by one and passed to Durant, who nailed the shot that made it 125-123. Durant could have put it away but turned it over on the Nets' next possession, but they held on when Middleton's shot was just off from in front of his bench. Kyrie Irving missed his seventh straight game after leaving the team for personal reasons, with coach Steve Nash saying he could return Wednesday in Cleveland. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee had its eight-game winning streak in Brooklyn snapped. ... Former Nets center Brook Lopez scored 15 points. Nets: Joe Harris scored 20 points and went 5 of 7 from 3-point range, the last with 1:05 remaining. ... Nash said the Nets would do little more than watch film and walk through some plays on Tuesday, but would try to have Irving work out on the court against some teammates to improve his conditioning after his layoff, which began Jan. 7. ... Durant was chosen as Eastern Conference player of the week after averaging 34 points, 5.3 rebounds and 8.0 assists in Brooklyn’s 3-0 week. He shot 61.3% from the field and 60% from 3-point range. He won the award 26 times in the Western Conference. TOUGH TESTS Both teams are playing last season's NBA Finalists this week. The Bucks host the NBA champion Lakers on Thursday, two nights before the Nets open a two-game series at home against Miami. The Bucks played against Luka Doncic in their last game before moving on to Durant and Harden in this one and LeBron James and Anthony Davis — practically an All-NBA team minus Antetokounmpo — in the next one. Coach Mike Budenholzer said the Bucks look forward to the competition. “I think whenever you play the best teams in the league, you always learn more about yourself and I think we’re constantly in that mode,” he said. “We want to be tested, we want to test ourselves, we want to keep our high standards, our high expectations and the best teams in the league do that to you.”","401267369"
"Luka Doncic uses fancy passing to set up Kristaps Porzingis nicely for two consecutive dunks as he penetrates in the lane. (0:26) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Kyle Lowry flirted with a triple-double on Monday night and the Toronto Raptors shut down Dallas star Luka Doncic for a 116-93 victory. Lowry had 23 points, nine rebounds and seven assists and Pascal Siakam scored 15 of his 19 points in the second half as the Raptors pulled away for their third straight victory. Chris Boucher added 21 points and OG Anunoby contributed 13 points, 11 rebounds and much of the defensive work against Doncic, along with Stanley Johnson. “I think what we do best is play team defense,” Johnson said. “It's pretty easy when you go out there and guard one guy with five guys.” Doncic, who was coming off a 36-point, 16-rebound, 15-assist triple-double in Sunday's 117-101 loss to Chicago, scored 15 points on 4-for-11 shooting and added seven rebounds and nine assists. “I thought he was frustrated,” Johnson said. “When you're tearing up the league like he is and then someone does what we did, it's frustrating.” Rick Carlisle, coaching a Dallas team missing four players, was ejected in the first quarter. “This is a very difficult planning situation, to try to prepare defensively in this kind of situation,” Carlisle said. “Come Wednesday, we'll do a better job of it.” Kristaps Porzingis led Dallas with 23 points and nine rebounds. The Mavericks shot 37.8% with 23 turnovers and lost their third straight. The game was tied 47-47 after a first half in which the Raptors shot 11.8% (2 for 17) from behind the arc and 19 for 32 (59.4%) from inside it. The second half was all Raptors. “It was nice to play well pretty much the entire second half,” said coach Nick Nurse, who mixed up the defense of Doncic. “We worked hard to limit his touches somewhat,” Nurse said. “He didn't seem to have the ball all the time like he does in some games ... and he kicked it out a lot, which is what we wanted hm to do.” Siakam's short jumper midway through the third quarter broke a 59-all tie and launched a 16-2 run that put the Raptors up to stay. Boucher and Norman Powell (17 points) led an early fourth-quarter rally that put the game away. Carlisle’s ejection came with 58.4 seconds left in the first quarter, just after Powell had converted a running shot in the lane after a Dallas turnover.

Porzingis had been called for a charge. But after looking at the video, the officials charged the foul on Toronto’s Aron Baynes, determining that Baynes had been inside the half-circle when drawing the contact.","401267370"
"Victor Oladipo makes his Rockets debut against the Bulls leading the team with 32 points, but they would still fall 125-120. (2:10) CHICAGO -- — Zach LaVine scored 33 points, and the Chicago Bulls overcame a strong effort by Victor Oladipo in his Houston debut, beating the Rockets 125-120 on Monday night. LaVine led seven Bulls players in double figures and added seven assists. He scored nine points in the closing minutes of the third to help send Chicago to the final quarter with a 93-86 lead. The Bulls made enough shots down the stretch to win for the second time in as many days after losing four straight by four points or fewer. “It's gonna take some time. But I see them fighting to get better,” coach Billy Donovan said. Lauri Markkanen finished with 18 points. The 7-footer from Finland nailed a 3-pointer in the closing minute to make it a six-point game, helping Chicago squeeze out a tight win after an easy victory at Dallas. And the Bulls hit 20 of 45 from beyond the arc. Oladipo looked good in his first game for Houston, setting season highs with 32 points and nine assists. The two-time All-Star was acquired from Indiana as part of the four-team trade that sent James Harden to Brooklyn last week after he said the Rockets weren’t “good enough.” Christian Wood scored 30 and grabbed nine rebounds. Eric Gordon added 21 points after missing back-to-back games because of tightness in his lower left leg. The Rockets lost for the fourth time in five games. “Our better days are ahead of us, definitely,"" Oladipo said. “Off the fly, we kind of just went out there and winged it a little bit. Not very much time to prep. Our better days are ahead. Everyone, just stay patient, including us.” HANGING ON The Bulls led most of the game, but Houston hung in until the end. Oladipo nailed a 3 to cut it to 114-111 with 1:50 remaining. LaVine answered with a finger roll layup for Chicago. Wood made a pair of free throws for Houston with just over a minute remaining. But Markkanen hit a 3 from the wing off a feed from LaVine after a driving Coby White passed out to the perimeter, making it 119-113 with 46.9 seconds left. “I think we're just taking good shots, moving the ball really well,” LaVine said. “Guys are stepping up and hitting shots. I think we have the right personnel for it this year, as well.” TIP-INS Rockets: Coach Stephen Silas took time to discuss with his team the sacrifices Martin Luther King made. He also mentioned the struggles his father, Paul, faced breaking into the NBA with the St. Louis Hawks in 1964, unable to go into certain restaurants and hotels. “I just wanted the players to hear my story when it came to Martin Luther King Day and really let them kind of marinate on the sacrifice that he gave for all of us,” Silas said. ... The Rockets were missing guards John Wall and Sterling Brown. Wall, a five-time All-Star, sat out his third consecutive game because of a sore left knee, while Brown (sore lower right leg) missed his second in a row. Bulls: The Bulls held out rookie forwards Patrick Williams (bruised right hip) and Otto Porter Jr. (strained lower back). Williams, the No. 4 overall pick in the draft, started Chicago's first 13 games.","401267371"
"Kelly Oubre knocks down a 3-pointer and is called for a technical foul as he blows a kiss to Montrezl Harrell, who tried to contest the shot. (0:23) LOS ANGELES -- — Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors are starting to make a habit of fourth-quarter rallies against teams from Los Angeles. Curry scored 26 points on Monday night as the Warriors rallied from a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers 115-113. “We kept our composure. The second unit was amazing both halves,” Curry said. “We got some momentum in the second half to give us a chance and carry us down the stretch. It was similar to the Clippers game. We've done it twice now, but want to get leads early.” Golden State trailed the Clippers by 22 in the third quarter on Jan. 8 before storming back for a 115-105 win. On Monday, the Lakers sprinted out to a 19-point lead in the first quarter and dominated the first 42 minutes. LeBron James’ 3-pointer gave the Lakers a 97-83 advantage early in the fourth before the Warriors battled back. They trailed 106-97 with 5:52 remaining before going on a 15-2 run that gave Golden State its first lead. Oubre had tied it at 108 with a driving layup and Draymond Green’s layup with 2:40 remaining gave the Warriors their first lead of the night. James had a chance to win it at the end, but missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer as the Lakers had their five-game winning streak snapped. According to Stats LLC, it is the first time in 284 home games that James and his team took a double-digit lead into the fourth quarter and lost in regulation. “I think we just had some tough breaks, some tough calls against us in the second half that slowed our pace down,"" said James, who finished with 19 points. ""We couldn’t get back into a rhythm.” The Lakers were 6 of 19 from the field in the fourth after shooting 53% from the floor the first three quarters. Golden State was 14 of 23 over the final 12 minutes as Curry and Eric Paschall each scored eight points. “We got outplayed in the second half. We got hesitant on the offensive end, and a little casual at certain points in the game,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. Paschall came off the bench to tie his season high with 19 points and Andrew Wiggins added 18 for Golden State, which has won 10 of its last 12 when playing on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. “The first half, we stunk it up. I like our fight and we started to get after it in the second. The second unit kept us in the game and the starters finished it,” Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. Dennis Schröder led Los Angeles with 25 points, including 14 in the first quarter as the Lakers led 34-15 with 1:14 remaining in the first quarter. Anthony Davis had 17 points and 17 rebounds. The Lakers have a seven-game losing streak when playing on the holiday. FRUSTRATING HOLIDAY James won a title against Golden State, but he still hasn't beat them on MLK Day. James lost three straight holiday games to the Warriors from 2016-18 when he was with Cleveland. He was injured and didn't play in 2019 when Golden State defeated Los Angeles. He is averaging 21.8 points in the four holiday games against the Warriors to Curry's 26. TIP-INS Warriors: Curry played in his 712th regular-season game, moving into fifth in franchise history and surpassing Alvin Attles. Lakers: Montrezl Harrell was 6 of 6 from the field and finished with 17 points. ... Kyle Kuzma had his second straight double double with 15 points and 10 rebounds. ... Davis had six assists in the first quarter, which is a career high for him in a single quarter.","401267372"
"Bol Bol drives to the rack and finishes in traffic with a massive one-handed slam. (0:25) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic was split in his opinion over which play stood out more. The candidates: Facundo Campazzo's backward, between-the-legs pass to Monte Morris for a layup, and Bol Bol turning  in a coast-to-coast dribbling clinic, punctuated by the 7-foot-2 center's slam. “Both are nice,” the Nuggets big man said. Fair answer. Oklahoma City had no answers for him. Jokic had 27 points and 12 rebounds before calling it an early night as Denver routed the Thunder 119-101 on Tuesday. Clean shaven and sporting a new buzz cut, Jokic also had six assists before taking a seat on the bench with the other starters for the fourth quarter. “He doesn't get a lot of credit as he should, maybe because he (isn't) flashy with the dunks,” said Morris, who had 15 points. “He's got a touch I've never really seen. He's definitely a future Hall of Famer.” The Thunder tried everything to stop Jokic, but he was a handful for Isaiah Roby, who was giving up four inches and 50 pounds. “Obviously, it’s a tough cover right now. But I don’t think it’s a long-term tough cover for him,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said of Roby. “This is a matchup that he should be able to handle long-term. We see him as that kind of player."" Paul Millsap had 13 points and 12 rebounds for the Nuggets, who have won six straight over the Thunder at home. Luguentz Dort kept the Thunder close early by scoring 15 of his 20 points in the first half. The Nuggets began to pull away in the second quarter and stretched it in the third before the Thunder made a little run to make things interesting. “I told our guys, ‘This is who we’ve been all season long. We get up. We build a lead. We get lackadaisical and we give the game back. Let’s not do that again,’” Nuggets coach Michael Malone recounted. They responded by building it back up to 26 and allowing Jokic and the rest of the starters to sit out the final quarter. It was a much-needed confidence boost for the struggling Nuggets (7-7), who advanced to the Western Conference finals inside the NBA bubble last season. So much so that former Nuggets coach George Karl posted on social media leading up to the game: ""It's early in the season to say this but the Nuggets game against the Thunder is a ‘must win’ for Denver.” “This definitely was a must-win,” Morris said. The Thunder played for the first time since an OT win over Chicago last Friday. Their game against Philadelphia on Sunday was postponed because the 76ers did not have the league-required eight available players to proceed because of contact tracing. TIP-INS Thunder: G Ty Jerome remains in Oklahoma City to rehab a sore ankle. ... The Thunder are 5-2 on the road this season and 1-5 at home. ... G Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 14 points and seven assists. Nuggets: F Greg Whittington had knee surgery Tuesday. He will be re-evaluated in four to six weeks. ... F Will Barton had 13 points and six assists. ... Denver outscored Oklahoma City in second-chance points 32-3. PROUD PAPA Thunder center Al Horford missed the game after he and his wife recently welcomed a new daughter, Nova. Daigneault wasn’t sure of a timetable on his return. “We’re really happy for him,” Daigneault said. FATHERLY ADVICE Malone keeps feeding the confidence of Morris. For that approach, Malone credits the sage advice once given to him by his father, longtime NBA coach Brendan Malone. “Some of the greatest advice he gave me as a young coach, the greatest gift I can give any of our players is confidence,” Malone said. “Monte knows he has my full confidence.” QUOATABLE Malone on getting Jokic to look for his shot more this season: “I locked him in my office one day, and I beat him with a pillow case filled with soda cans, and said, ‘You’ve got to score more.' ... He’s a great player. He’s playing at an MVP level.”","401267373"
"Zion Williamson scores 32 points with five rebounds, but the Pelicans fall to the Jazz 118-102. (1:59) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Donovan Mitchell had 28 points and seven rebounds, and the Utah Jazz beat the New Orleans Pelicans 118-102 on Tuesday night for their sixth straight victory. Mitchell also made four of Utah's 21 3-pointers. Jordan Clarkson added 18 points, six rebounds, and six assists, and reserve Joe Ingles scored 15 points. Rudy Gobert had 13 points, 18 rebounds, and three blocks. “The biggest thing is we’re shooting our shots,” Mitchell said. “We’re not passing up 3s.” Improved defensive play has keyed Utah’s surge on the perimeter, and it continued against New Orleans. The Jazz disrupted shots, crashed the boards, and sprinted up the court on numerous possessions to stay a step ahead of the Pelicans. “Defending creates those shots and defending keeps us in the game if they’re not going in,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. Zion Williamson scored 32 points for New Orleans, and Brandon Ingram had 17. The Pelicans trailed the entire second half after allowing the Jazz to make more than 20 3-pointers for the fourth time in six games. “We couldn’t stop them on anything,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “Obviously what stands out is the 21 3s. But they also didn’t have any trouble getting to the rim. So, you know, they got whatever they wanted we didn’t take anything away from them.” Williamson gave the Pelicans an early lift in the first half. He converted all five of his first-quarter field goal attempts and capped a 7-0 run with a layup that put New Orleans up 20-18. Mitchell matched his efficiency. He powered the Jazz offense in the first quarter, scoring 15 points while going 6 for 7 from the field. He converted a three-point play to punctuate an 11-2 run that gave Utah a 29-22 lead. Mitchell also had a key stretch in the second quarter. He scored and threw a one-handed wraparound pass as he was falling out of bounds out to Bojan Bogdanovic to set up another basket. The two plays bumped Utah back in front 55-49 before halftime. The Jazz carried that momentum into the third quarter. Utah made 3-pointers on four straight possessions to extend its lead to 73-55. Utah made eight total 3-pointers during the quarter. Clarkson and Ingles scored the final two on back-to-back possessions to push the Jazz lead to 91-69 heading into the fourth quarter. “They continued to put the pressure on us, breaking us down on the defensive end with their driving and kicking in,” Ingram said. “That’s usually just how they play.” TIP-INS Pelicans: Lonzo Ball returned after a three-game absence due to a knee injury. Ball finished with seven points, four assists, and three steals. … Williamson had back-to-back 30-point games for the first time in his NBA career. … New Orleans scored 22 points off 14 Jazz turnovers. Jazz: Ingles returned after a three-game absence due to Achilles tendon soreness. … Mike Conley had a team-high 10 assists. … Derrick Favors had nine points and seven rebounds in his first game against the Pelicans after spending last season in New Orleans. BUCKLING DOWN One game after giving up a season-high 23 offensive rebounds to Denver, the Jazz clamped down on the glass against New Orleans. The Pelicans had 10 offensive boards and scored 10 second-chance points. Utah finished with a 60-45 edge on total rebounds. The Jazz made rebounding a collective effort instead of simply trying to battle Williamson and Steven Adams one-on-one around the basket.","401267374"
"Kyrie Irving reflects on the first time he suited up against Kobe Bryant in the NBA. (1:51) CLEVELAND -- — Kyrie Irving needed some time. The new-look Nets will require some as well. Irving returned from his personal “pause” and scored 37 points in his first game with Kevin Durant and James Harden but Brooklyn's “Big 3” couldn't keep up with Cleveland's Collin Sexton, who scored 42 and led the Cavaliers to a 147-135 double-overtime win on Wednesday night. Sexton made four 3-pointers — most of them over Irving — and scored 15 points in the second OT. He dropped two 3s and fed Taurean Prince for another in a dizzying, 55-second span as Cleveland put it away. “He played out of his mind,” said Cavs forward Cedi Osman, who scored 25. “It was amazing.” While it was tough to lose, Irving was impressed by Sexton, who looked a lot like Irving on one of his scoring tears. '""Two overtimes for my first game back?"" said Irving, who played a career-high 48 minutes in his first game since Jan. 5. ”You gotta love NBA ball, though. I was smiling when Collin Sexton was making those shots."" Durant scored 38 points and Harden added 21 as Brooklyn's trio of superstars combined for 96 points in their first game together. But it wasn't enough to outlast Sexton, who missed Cleveland's last five games with a sprained ankle. The Cavs threw some exotic defenses at the Nets, who only got Irving back at practice on Tuesday and haven't had time to work on much. “Look, this is the first night,"" Brooklyn coach Steve Nash said. ""We seemed a little lost at times. We were a little flat and disjointed at times.” As Sexton knocked down one big shot after another in the second OT, players on Cleveland's bench tackled each other in delight. Prince, acquired in the four-team deal that brought Harden to Brooklyn, scored 17 in his Cavs debut and Larry Nance Jr. had 15. Sexton will forever be linked to Irving. He was selected by Cleveland with the draft pick the Cavs got from Boston in the trade for Irving in 2017. Like Irving, Sexton wears No. 2, and like Irving, he makes big shots. “I definitely accepted the challenge,” Sexton said. “I knew it wasn't going to be easy — because it's Kyrie.” Irving had missed Brooklyn’s last seven games, leaving on Jan. 7 to address some issues he didn’t specify while speaking with reporters Tuesday. Irving only said he needed space to work through some issues to find balance in his life. While he was away, the Nets rocked the league by pulling off the blockbuster deal for Harden, whose arrival has made Brooklyn the favorite to unseat Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference and a legit NBA title threat — maybe. Before the game, Nash admitted being “curious” about how his trio of superstars would align on the floor. “But I’m not in a hurry,” he said, stressing it may take time for Durant, Irving and Harden to figure things out. The Nets are indeed a work in progress. There were moments of sloppiness, miscommunication and even confusion as Brooklyn’s players tried to find some cohesion in just Harden’s third game. “We'll have good nights, great nights,” Irving said. “I'm excited for what's to come.” The Nets overcame a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter and tied it at 113-all on Irving's putback with 1:10 left. In the first OT, after Durant's free throws put the Nets up 127-124, Sexton hit a 3-pointer from up top over Irving with 1.2 seconds left. Durant's last chance, a contested 3-pointer at the horn, was short. The Cavs weren't intimidated by Brooklyn's firepower or flash. In the second quarter, Sexton ran back on defense and cleanly flicked the ball away from Durant as he was going in on a breakaway dunk. Irving's return to the Nets was also just his second game in Cleveland since he was traded by the Cavs after the 2017 season. Strangely, Irving had missed each of his team's previous visits to Ohio since his debut with the Boston Celtics four years ago. It was Irving's jumper late in Game 7 that helped the Cavs win the 2016 title, and the team saluted him with a video tribute in the first quarter. Many of the 2,000 fans in Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse stood and saluted Irving, who touched his chest and waved in appreciation. TIP-INS Nets: Harden added 12 assists and 10 rebounds. A prolific scorer and volume shooter, Harden didn't attempt a shot in the first quarter. ... Brooklyn made its first 10 shots, but let the Cavs scored 17 straight bridging the first and second quarters. Cavaliers: G Darius Garland remains sidelined with a sprained right shoulder. He could be back Friday. ... G/F Dylan Windler will return Friday after being sidelined since opening night, when he broke his left hand. SUPPORT TEAM While the Nets were initially caught off guard by Irving’s leave, the team is committed to helping him. Nash believes its his responsibility as Irving’s coach, and Brooklyn’s charge as his team, to do whatever it can to aid Irving “in all manners.” “It’s more important than basketball,” Nash said. “We can be a layer of protection for him.”","401267376"
"Luka Doncic slings a one-handed pass around two defenders to find Kristaps Porzingis wide open for a dunk. (0:18) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Kristaps Porzingis posted season-high totals of 27 points and 12 rebounds in leading the Dallas Mavericks to a 124-111 victory at Indiana on Wednesday night. Luka Doncic added 13 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists as Dallas snapped its first three-game losing streak in almost two years. The short-handed Pacers have lost two straight by double digits, their two most lopsided losses of the season. Malcolm Brogdon had 26 points and Domantis Sabonis finished with 25 points and 10 rebounds, giving him a franchise-record 14 in a row. Dallas took the lead for good on the final basket of the third quarter and pulled away with an 11-4 run in the fourth. The Mavericks were in control most of the night after using an early 15-3 run to take a 37-22 lead late in the first quarter. Indiana closed the deficit to 65-63 at the half, then took its first lead when Edmond Sumner's 3-pointer broke a 67-all tie early in the third. It didn't last long. Porzingis scored all of the Mavericks points in a 9-2 run and Dallas eventually extended the margin to 84-76. Again, the Pacers charged back, tying the score at 86 on Brogdon's second 3 of the game, taking an 89-88 lead on his next 3 and then making it 91-88 when Brogdon made a layup. But Dallas answered with a 13-3 run to make it 101-94 and gradually pulled away late to seal it. TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic appeared to hurt his left knee three times during the game.

HE'S BACK In their first home game since trading two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo to Houston for LeVert, the Pacers got a familiar face back on the floor — guard Jeremy Lamb. He made his season debut came with 55.8 seconds left in the first quarter. Lamb hadn't played since injuring his left knee Feb. 23, 2020. He was diagnosed with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, a torn medical collateral ligament and a fractured femur — the bone just above the knee. Lamb was perfect in the first half, going 4 of 4 from the field, including one 3 while making his only free throw. He didin't make another shot and finished with 10 points in 19 minutes. THEY'RE BACK, TOO Indiana played its first seven games with only a few dozen people sitting in the second deck of Bankers Life Fieldhouse. That's about to change. A small crowd of season-ticket holders were seated in the first and second decks. When Toronto plays in Indy on Sunday and Monday, the Pacers can have up to 1,000 fans in attendance and they could start increasing the capacity as early as next week. County health officials have said the Pacers can have up to 4,500 fans in attendance.","401267377"
"Joel Embiid scoffs at Marcus Smart's claim that he ""flails"" for calls. (1:11) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid has been the early season MVP for the Sixers. At this rate, the All-Star center could be in contention for a bigger prize. Embiid had 42 points and 10 rebounds, and Tobias Harris scored 22 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 117-109 win over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night. “It’s not sort of, it’s ‘for sure’ MVP-caliber,” Harris said of his teammate. Embiid is off to the best start of his career and topped 40 points for the second time in three games. He shot 12 of 19 from the floor (one 3-pointer) and was 17 of 21 from the free-throw line. He did it in 34 minutes and scored 20 points in a half (22 in the first) for the fifth time this season. “If they double, we’ve got way too many shooters for me to be able to kick it out,” Embiid said. “I can attack in a different style. It’s been working well.” Ben Simmons had 11 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Sixers. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 26 points and Marcus Smart had 25. Kemba Walker scored 19 points in his second game of the season after he missed the first 11 with a left knee injury. The Sixers fell short in their attempt to trade for James Harden and left Embiid to perform the heavy lifting for a franchise that needs at least one other elite scorer to make a serious run in the East. When the Celtics snapped a tie game in the third with a 9-0 run it was Embiid -- who else? -- who steadied the Sixers with a three-point play. “I’m not surprised at the level,” coach Doc Rivers said. “He’s just more talented than even I knew. I knew he was extremely talented, but he has so many more gifts.” Simmons was expected to develop into that true cornerstone star to pair with Embiid, only this season there has been more frustration than flashes of brilliance. Rivers has insisted he’s not worried about Simmons’ stats, but the Sixers need more than what he’s giving them. Simmons was whistled for two offensive fouls within 30 seconds late in the third and the Celtics ended the quarter with a 92-86 lead. Walker returned in the fourth — he played only 90 seconds in the third on a minutes restriction — and the Sixers had to run out a lineup without Embiid or Simmons early in the quarter. Shake Milton, making a case for top NBA sixth man, and Harris, whose three-point play gave the Sixers a 100-99 lead, kept it a game until Embiid and Simmons returned. Embiid checked in with 7:44 left and the Sixers holding that one-point lead. Down three, Embiid sank a fadeway to hit 38 points to pull the Sixers within one, grabbed a defensive board, drove to the hoop and was fouled. He sank both again in the clutch. “He’s going to score some, but 42 is too much,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “I thought not only did he score those points, he also handed the double (team) pretty well and on a couple of occasions, it led to 3-pointers.” Danny Green’s fourth 3-pointer of the game put the Sixers up 108-105 and they put away a Celtics team that swept them in the first-round of the playoffs last season. TIP-INS Celtics: F Jayson Tatum is out of health and safety protocol and could play Friday against the 76ers. ... C Robert Williams was cleared to play after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month. 76ers: G Furkan Korkmaz returned after missing several games with a left adductor strain. His reverse dunk in transition in the third quarter was the play of the game. ... Seth Curry and Vincent Poirier remained out for COVID-related reasons. ... F Mike Scott also sat out with swelling in his right knee. BIG FLOP Boston’s Marcus Smart said Embiid “flails and he gets the call. Meanwhile on the other end, we attack and we don’t get the whistles. It’s tough playing like that.” Embiid laughed off the accusation and said, “I’m sure he knows himself and knows his game, too. He does a lot of that.” FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES Rivers was invited to speak at a Joe Biden rally after the President used Rivers’ words in an October speech, calling for racial unity at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Rivers said he has been friends with Vice President Kamala Harris for nearly a decade and became “emotional” watching the inauguration. Rivers said he has talked and texted with Harris since the November election, but joked he’s not so sure he’ll be in her contacts in the immediate future. “I get a feeling starting today my texts may not go through anymore,” Rivers said, laughing. “I know they change phones as of today.”","401267378"
"Trae Young caps off a 38-point night with a 3-pointer in overtime as Hawks prevail over the Pistons. (0:25) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 38 points, John Collins had 31 and the Atlanta Hawks rallied to beat Jerami Grant and the Detroit Pistons 123-115 in overtime on Wednesday night. Grant had a career-high 32 points, including all of Detroit’s nine points in overtime, to continue his hot start to the season. But the Pistons fell to 3-11, the worst record in the Eastern Conference. Clint Capela had 27 points and a career-high 26 rebounds for Atlanta (7-7), the NBA’s first 25-25 game since Karl-Anthony Towns (27-27) on Jan. 12, 2019. The Hawks were short-handed. Forwards De’Andre Hunter (right knee soreness) and Cam Reddish (left knee contusion) were ruled out during pregame warmups. Reddish missed his third consecutive game. “I’m just happy we never gave up,” said Young, who had 10 assists. “We never gave up from beginning to end, no matter who was out there. We knew we were down a couple guys.” Young overcame a slow start. He had only six points in the first half after making only one of five free throws. He made 13 of 19 overall. Young scored 21 points in the third quarter, when Atlanta charged back after trailing by 14 points. After Young's three-point play cut Detroit's lead to 81-78, the Pistons scored the final 11 points of the period, including six by Grant. “We don’t come back in this game if Trae Young doesn’t turn into Trae Young down the stretch,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Grant set a scoring high despite making only six of seven free throws. “It’s not even conscionable think that he’s driving to the basket that much and not getting hit,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. After trailing 99-82, Atlanta rallied again in the final period. Capela's jam, set up by a pass from Young, tied the game at 106. Grant's last-second drive to the basket was blocked by Collins, forcing overtime. Capela's three-point play gave Atlanta a 116-113 lead it wouldn't lose. Young padded the lead with a 3-pointer. Capela posted Atlanta’s first game with at least 25 points and 25 rebounds since Dikembe Mutombo’s 27 points and 29 rebounds against Minnesota on Dec. 14, 1999.

"Bam Adebayo finds Goran Dragic in the corner, who knocks down the trey to increase Miami's lead. (0:18) TAMPA, Fla. -- — The Miami Heat were missing a lot of firepower Wednesday night. They did have Kendrick Nunn and a zone defense that the Toronto Raptors couldn't figure out Nunn scored 28 points and the injury-plagued Heat pulled away in the second half for a 111-102 win. Bam Adebayo had 14 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists for Miami, and Kelly Olynyk came off the bench with 15 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Despite missing four key players — including Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro, Avery Bradley and Meyers Leonard — the Heat (6-7) won their second straight. “I don't know what percentage of our scoring wasn't here tonight, but we have a lot of guys who can score 20 points,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “In this (injury) situation, either you put your tail between your legs or you rise to the occasion for your team.” Fred VanVleet had 24 points and nine assists for the Raptors (5-9), whose three-game winning streak ended. Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby scored 18 points each for Toronto, which shot 30.2% (13 for 43) in the second half and 39.8% (35 for 88) overall. “It seemed like we were stuck on 85 for a long stretch late in the game,” VanVleet said. “We'll have to get some better looks instead of shooting 3s all the time. When you don't make shots against a zone it has a snowball effect. They get more aggressive and it makes it harder.” After scoring Toronto's first seven points of the game, Kyle Lowry finished with eight points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Nunn, who had scored just 33 points all season before his 18-point game Monday night, came off the bench and shot 9 of 12 and grabbed eight rebounds in 35 minutes. Nunn scored on a layup and a 3-pointer to put the Heat up by 11 early in the second quarter, but Terence Davis scored twice during a 9-0 run that got the Raptors quickly back in it. Nunn hit two more 3-pointers and Olynyk scored eight points on a 21-9 Miami spurt in the third quarter, and the Heat took an 88-83 lead into the fourth quarter. Two straight 3-pointers by Goran Dragic gave Miami a double-digit lead in the closing minutes. “It's irrelevant what the (defensive) scheme is,” Spoestra said of the Heat's effective zone defense. “Our man defense was good as well. I was more looking to whether we were committed to multiple efforts and we had those tonight."" TIP-INS Heat: Herro missed a third game with neck spasms. ... Butler and Bradley missed their fifth straight games while in coronavirus protocol. Leonard sat out a fifth game with a shoulder injury. ... Adebayo entered the game as the only NBA player averaging at least 19.5 points, nine rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.2 blocks and one steal.

(0:21) HOUSTON -- — Deandre Ayton had season highs with 26 points and 17 rebounds and the Phoenix Suns beat the Houston Rockets 109-103 on Wednesday night to end a two-game skid. “He was a monster for us tonight,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. The Suns won for the first time since Jan. 9. Between the two losses, they had three games postponed because of health and safety protocols after playing at Washington. The Suns led by 20 points in the third quarter, but the Rockets used a couple of runs to get back in it. A jump shot by Devin Booker, who had 24 points, pushed the lead to eight with less than three minutes to go. But Houston scored the next six points, with four from Victor Oladipo, to cut it to 103-101 with 90 seconds left. Ayton made two free throws and Booker added two more to push the lead to 106-101 with 45 seconds to go. Oladipo made a pair of free throws for Houston, but a layup by Booker sealed the victory. Ayton was proud of the way the team responded after Houston cut the lead. “I did what I was supposed to tonight (and) as a whole team ... we really settled down and locked in at the end and closed the game out the way we should,"" he said. Oladipo and Eric Gordon had 22 points apiece for the Rockets. They have lost three of four since James Harden was traded to Brooklyn. Coach Stephen Silas said it's challenging to manage his roster with starters John Wall and Danuel House both out. “We’ve got to do what we can to win each game, but we’re dealing with a lot of different things,"" he said. “But mainly without those guys it’s stagger minutes and try to figure it all out.""

Ayton had two dunks and two of his career-high five blocks in that stretch. Cameron Payne raved about Ayton's work on defense. “Just to know he’s back there taking care of the dirty work for us is huge,"" he said. A dunk by Christian Wood soon after that ended a scoring drought of more than five minutes and was the start of a 9-0 run that got Houston within 101-95 with about three minutes left. The Suns used a 9-0 run to push their lead to 20 points with eight minutes left in the third. Gordon ended the run after that with a 3-pointer, which was the start of an 8-0 run by Houston that cut the deficit to 74-62.

"On Jan. 21, 2019, Klay Thompson set an NBA record of hitting 10 consecutive 3-pointers as the Warriors beat the Lakers 130-111. (1:59) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors brought it on both ends in their most complete game yet. They brought it for new Vice President Kamala Harris, honoring her Oakland roots. Curry had 26 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, and the Warriors beat the San Antonio Spurs 121-99 on Wednesday night wearing their old city of Oakland across their chests. Rookie James Wiseman added 20 points and six rebounds, and Draymond Green had six of the Warriors' 31 assists. Golden State made it consecutive impressive wins after erasing a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter of a 115-113 road victory against the Lakers on Monday. “I think it was our best game. It was the best two-way basketball game we’ve played all year,” coach Steve Kerr said. “Our defense was excellent, we put a lot of pressure on them, stayed really solid, made good rotations, rebounded well. And then at the other end when you’re forcing misses, offense becomes a lot easier, so we were able to get into a flow.” The Warriors debuted their “Oakland Forever” jerseys for Inauguration Day. Oakland native Harris was gifted one signed by Curry featuring a special congratulatory message from the two-time MVP and his urging to show it off in Washington. “Historical. These uniforms are pretty self explanatory,” Kelly Oubre Jr. said. Dejounte Murray scored 22 points for the Spurs, who had won the past three meetings with the Warriors and five of six. San Antonio was coming off its biggest win of the season, beating the Trail Blazers 125-104 at Portland on Monday. Four players ages 30 or older scored 20 points, the first time it has been done since 1998 by Houston. Andrew Wiggins, who has been dealing with a sore right knee, knocked down consecutive 3-pointers in the fourth quarter on the way to 18 points for the Warriors. Curry shot 10 for 17 and made four 3-pointers. The Spurs trailed 43-36 with 5:56 remaining in the first half, then Golden State subbed Curry and Green back in and went on an 18-4 run. “I thought we had a bad start. They jumped on us in the beginning of the game for whatever reasons and we never got back,” coach Gregg Popovich said. ""But if you shoot 4 for 33 from 3, your defense better be pretty perfect and it wasn’t.” OAKLAND FOREVER In a video the Warriors showed at halftime and also posted — Kerr called it “brilliant” and shared it widely — Harris promised to display the framed jersey in her White House office. “I will proudly, proudly display this. You always bring such joy and pride to me as a daughter of Oakland,” said Harris, sworn in earlier in the day on Capitol Hill. “This is really so very special, so thank you all, and I hope to see you soon. Go Warriors!"" While Golden State did hold a morning shootaround, Kerr found time to watch some of the inauguration, which he called “beautiful. ” “It’s a great day,” Kerr said. “It’s one of the reasons we’re wearing our Oakland jerseys tonight. We’re taking great pride in the fact that Kamala Harris is from Oakland and was inaugurated today as vice president. Just a huge day, obviously, in our nation’s history and for the Bay Area as well. So it’s great to be able to honor her and her big day by wearing this uniform.” MILLS' FANS Spurs reserve guard Patty Mills struggled in his latest Bay Area homecoming, shooting 3 for 11 and missing all seven of his 3-point attempts for just six points. Randy Bennett, Mills' college coach at Saint Mary's in the East Bay suburbs, loves following his former player's success from afar. “He’s having an incredible, incredible journey.

"Kawhi Leonard Eurosteps past Tyrese Haliburton, then dunks in Richaun Holmes' grill. (0:22) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points, Paul George added 19 and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Sacramento Kings 115-96 on Wednesday night for their season-high fifth consecutive victory. The Clippers handed the Kings a 38-point loss at their place last Friday. A new week didn’t change anything. Sacramento dropped its fourth in a row and sixth in seven games. George tied his career high with 12 assists to go with a team-high six turnovers. “I got to be better and take care of the ball a lot better, but for me, it’s fun,” George said. “It’s not going to be perfect, but I thrive being on the floor and trying to make my teammates better.” De'Aaron Fox scored 17 of his 25 points in the first half for the Kings. Glenn Robinson III added 14 points off the bench. Buddy Hield had 11 of his 13 points in the first half, when the Kings led by six. “We see the mistakes and see what needs to be done. Now it’s on us to fix it,” Robinson said. “We’re still remaining positive.” Ivica Zubac had 11 points and a season-high 12 rebounds in his new role coming off the bench this season instead of starting. “We got to keep pumping Zu. Zu just doesn’t know how dominant he can be,” George said. “You forget how young he is and he’s still a baby. He's got to own being the biggest guy on the floor.” The Clippers improved to 8-1 in games in which they've owned 20-point leads. “We're still trying to get better. That’s our mindset,” Leonard said. “We want to keep it moving. It’s the first leg of the season, we got to finish it out. We’re not satisfied.” The Clippers broke the game open with 34 points in the third quarter, when they had scoring runs of 9-0 and 13-0. Leonard and Zubac had five points apiece in the second spurt that helped send Los Angeles into the fourth leading 95-75. Leonard had 10 points and George seven in the third. The Clippers repeatedly got stops on the defensive end, which helped them score in transition. They shot 52% from the field and limited the Kings to 19 points in the period. “Those guys are doing a good job coming out with a defensive mindset,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said of his team. The Kings barely outscored the Clippers 21-20 in the fourth, but they never seriously cut into their deficit. “You could see when we do play the right way and move the ball, it’s believing in that the whole game and believing in each other,” Robinson said. TIP-INS Kings: They fell to 1-4 on the road overall, and have dropped four in a row away from home. ... DaQuan Jeffries (left ankle sprain), Jahmi'us Ramsey (left groin strain) and Hassan Whiteside missed the game.

"Anthony Davis comes down harshly on himself after the Lakers' win over the Bucks, explaining his offensive struggles and what he must do to get back in the groove. (1:01) MILWAUKEE -- — LeBron James says the results of last season's NBA awards voting didn’t provide extra motivation as his Los Angeles Lakers prepared to face Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks. He had more important things on his mind. James scored a season-high 34 points in the opener of a seven-game road trip, helping the Lakers beat the Bucks 113-106 on Thursday. He  finished second to Antetokounmpo in last year's MVP balloting. “It’s never been about individual (honors),” said James, a four-time MVP. “It’s all about the team success. That’s all that matters. ... I just want to play well and help our team versus any opponent. That’s what it’s all about.” Los Angeles (12-4) bounced back after blowing a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter of a 115-113 loss to Golden State on Monday night.  The Bucks (9-6) dropped their second straight. This game pitted the reigning NBA champion Lakers against a Bucks team that posted the league’s best regular-season record each of the last two years. It was the first time the Lakers had faced the Bucks since the 2019-20 awards voting, which also had Antetokounmpo finishing just ahead of Los Angeles' Anthony Davis in the voting for defensive player of the year. “That was last season, obviously,” said Davis, who had 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists. “No one brought that up or talked about it. Our motivation was not losing two in a row tonight. We were able to get that accomplished.” The Lakers shot 19 of 37 from 3-point range, with James going 6 of 10 and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope making 7 of 10. Caldwell-Pope had 23 points. Antetokounmpo had 25 points and 12 rebounds for Milwaukee, but he also committed nine turnovers. Jrue Holiday scored 22 points for the Bucks, and Khris Middleton finished with 20. “We've got to keep working, keep playing good basketball for longer periods of time, make shots, defend better, rebound the ball better,"" Antetokounmpo said. “Ultimately we've got to get better.” The Lakers were ahead 63-57 after a first half that featured seven ties and nine lead changes. The Lakers outscored Milwaukee 20-8 over the last 5½ minutes of the second quarter, including Caldwell-Pope’s 35-footer at the buzzer. “There were stretches where we were really good on both ends of the court,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We had a bad stretch, I felt like the last four or five minutes of the second quarter, on both ends of the court we were not good. We were not sharp like you need to be for 48 minutes.” Los Angeles stayed ahead throughout the second half. After trailing 98-87 with less than 7½ minutes left, the Bucks cut the deficit to 102-100 when Middleton drove the baseline and scored with 3:05 remaining. Caldwell-Pope answered by sinking a corner 3-pointer with 2:42 left. The Lakers' lead didn't drop below four points the rest of the way. TIP-INS Lakers: This game marked a return to Milwaukee for Lakers guard Wesley Matthews, who played for the Bucks last season. Matthews’ Wisconsin ties go beyond that; he went to high school in Madison and played college basketball at Marquette. Matthews scored six points. Bucks: This game was supposed to be the first of a back-to-back for the Bucks. That changed when the NBA postponed the Bucks’ Friday night home game with Washington  to an undetermined date. NBA officials said the game was moved “due to the number of unavailable players for the Wizards, contact tracing for other players on their roster, and the length of time preceding the game during which the team was unable to practice.”","401267386"
"After arguing whether Donovan Mitchell touched the ball last, Stan Van Gundy is given his second technical foul of the game and is ejected. (0:34) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Utah Jazz got off to a tough start. Then Donovan Mitchell and company pushed their way right past the New Orleans Pelicans. Mitchell scored a season-high 36 points, and the Jazz rallied to beat the Pelicans 129-118 on Thursday night for their seventh straight win. “Every chance I got, just kept putting pressure on the defense and getting to the basket,"" Mitchell said. ""I was able to get 13 quick and they focus on me so now the guys are open. Then guys are hitting shots, now they’re not worried about me anymore — just a mind game in the sense.” Mitchell went 6 for 8 from 3-point range in another efficient performance. “He’s picking his spots and he’s taking what the defense gives him,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""Early in the game, he really attacked the rim, was able to get in the paint ... then as the game progressed the defense dropped back.” Utah shot 50% (44 for 88) from the field after it made 50.6% of its shots during a 118-102 victory over New Orleans on Tuesday night. Mike Conley scored 20 points and Jordan Clarkson had 19 for Utah, which has the longest active win streak in the NBA. “There were games earlier in the season like Minnesota where we came out flat and if teams hit us first, we didn’t have a push-back like we do now,” Mitchell said. Zion Williamson scored 27 points and Brandon Ingram had 23 but the Pelicans couldn’t sustain the momentum of an almost perfect first quarter and a half. “Our pace offensively slowed down,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We didn’t play with much pace or force on the offensive end. We quit making shots. And defensively we really weren’t good the entire game.” Still, New Orleans led for a bit early in the second half. Eric Bledsoe made a jumper to make it 78-75 Pelicans right before the Jazz took over. Joe Ingles made a fast-break layup on a feed from Mitchell, capping a 21-2 run that lifted Utah to a 96-80 lead with 4:27 to play in the third quarter. “Our ability to turn up our energy level a couple notches, especially defensively, is making the difference,"" Conley said. “We really get after guys and we try to get in passing lanes and we try to just be a little bit more aggressive.” Frustration boiled over for the Pelicans. Coach Stan Van Gundy got a technical and then lost a challenge to overturn a foul. Minutes later, Steven Adams leapt off the bench to argue a call and earned a technical, and Van Gundy kept arguing and was ejected with 2:23 remaining in the period. Williamson’s leaner got the Pelicans within 100-94 early in the fourth quarter, but the Jazz used their precision passing and shooting to rebuild a comfortable margin. Ingram made all six of his shots, including four 3s, as the Pelicans tallied 43 points in the first quarter. It was the second-highest total for the first quarter in franchise history. The Pelicans led by as many as 16 before the Jazz grabbed a 70-69 edge at halftime. Both Mitchell (21 points) and Ingram (20 points) posted season highs for a first half. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson made his first 3-pointer of the season in the first period as part of the team’s season-best eight 3s in a quarter. ... Both teams had 27 assists, and the Pelicans shot 49.4% (42 for 85). Jazz: C Rudy Gobert had 12 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots.

"Steve Kerr says the crew chief told him that the second technical on Draymond Green was a mistake and the other referee thought he was yelling at him. (0:59) SAN FRANCISCO -- — RJ Barrett had a career-high 28 points and the New York Knicks matched their longest winning streak of the season at three games by beating the Golden State Warriors 119-104 on Thursday night. “We come into every game feeling like we should win the game or give ourselves a chance to win the game,” Knicks forward Julius Randle said. “We’re a good team and we’re playing a good team basketball game.” Stephen Curry scored 30 points with five 3-pointers but shot just 9 of 19 as Golden State lacked the same energy it had in a lopsided win against the Spurs a night earlier. It certainly didn't help that Draymond Green got ejected late in the first half on a disputed technical when he appeared to be yelling at teammate James Wiseman. “At halftime Ben Taylor came out and told me that it was a mistake, that John Butler didn’t realize Draymond was yelling at his teammate. He thought he was yelling at him,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of his conversation with the officials. “Obviously, Draymond is one of our best and most impactful players so it hurt us, but we were playing very poorly to that point anyway. So I'm not going to talk about the officiating, I'm going to talk about our poor play.” Randle added 16 points, 17 rebounds and nine assists to help New York build some much-needed momentum during this successful stretch to reach .500 (8-8) following a five-game losing streak. Randle had chances at a triple-double but fell just short. “You always want to try to get one if you can. I’m just happy we got the win,” he said. “I’ll take this any day.” Alec Burks returned from a 12-game absence with a sprained left ankle to finish with 11 points and six rebounds for the Knicks. Burks spent 48 games with Golden State last season before a trade to the 76ers. When he entered at the 4:49 mark of the first quarter, Warriors public-address announcer Matt Pitman offered, “Welcome back to the Bay, Alec Burks!” Andrew Wiggins had 17 points and nine rebounds, and rookie Wiseman contributed 15 points and eight boards for the cold-shooting Warriors, who made just 38.8% of their shots and went 9 for 38 on 3-pointers. “We’re not the team we were yesterday. We didn’t come with the same focus, so next game we’ve just got to bring it,"" Wiggins said. New York shot 7 of 11 from the floor to start the game, making four of its initial five 3s to build a quick 20-12 lead. The game featured a combined 55 personal fouls. “Draymond, we caught a break when he got thrown out,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. GREEN FACTOR Golden State dropped to 6-5 with its current starting lineup since Green returned from a foot injury. But given that Green was tossed with 1:04 left in the first half after his second technical foul, it didn't seem like a game he played — though he had three points and eight assists. Kerr doesn't even think Green is “in his best shape yet.” “We were a mess without him. I think Draymond is realizing how important he is to this team,” Kerr said. TIP-INS Knicks: Frank Ntilikina, limited to four games so far and missing his 12th straight with a sprained right knee, is still listed as day to day by Thibodeau, who said, ""doing a little more each day, so we’ll see how it goes.” ...

"Thaddeus Young goes coast-to-coast and makes a layup as the halftime buzzer sounds vs. the Hornets. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Zach LaVine is proving he can be an elite scorer in the NBA. But what Bulls coach Billy Donovan likes the most about the seven-year veteran is that he's raising the game of others and helping his team win. LaVine, who has established himself as Chicago's main scoring option, continued his strong and balanced play with 25 points, nine assists and six rebounds to lead the Bulls to a 123-110 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night. “I think he understands that he has to lift up the level of play of the team,” Donovan said. ""The sign of a great player is a player that makes everyone else around them better and I thought that he made some really great passes and got guys some open looks. Everybody knows he can score. Can he raise up the group around him?” LaVine, who had averaged 32.2 points over his previous five games, converted on 8 of 12 shots from the field and made all six foul shots. He repeatedly made the right plays, setting up his teammates for open looks while running the break and dishing out assists. “A little bit is me understanding that over the last three years, you cannot go by yourself,” LaVine said. “I think I took a step in the right direction in the offseason looking at how I can help my teammates get better. Trust and having guys healthy helps a lot. ... I am trying to read the game. We are creating a lot of open shots, so it has been good.” Lauri Markkanen chipped in with 23 points and Coby White added 18 points and eight assists as the Bulls won their third straight. “We all know he can score, but he's doing a good job of getting others involved,” Markkanen said of LaVine. “He's doing a really good job all around.” Gordon Hayward scored 34 points for the Hornets and Devonte Graham had a season-high 24 points, 22 of those coming in the first half. But the Hornets committed 20 turnovers, leading to 26 Bulls points, as they dropped their fourth straight. Hornets coach James Borrego said he needs more production beyond what he's getting from Hayward. “To say ‘Gordon, go save us every single night from start to finish,’ that’s not what we’re looking for,” Borrego said. “Other guys have got to step up and play better.” The Hornets trailed most of the game before cutting the lead to six with four minutes to go. But Markkanen slammed home an inside feed from Thaddeus Young and LaVine buried a 3-pointer from the left wing to push the lead back to double digits. SHARING THE BALL The Bulls finished with 33 assists. ""I think we are doing a good job of sharing the ball and taking the open looks,"" Markkanen said. ZELLER'S RETURN Hornets center Cody Zeller was back on the floor after missing the last four games with a broken bone in his left hand. Zeller didn't start, played 11 minutes and scored five points and had three rebounds. At times he looked out of sync with his teammates. “Moving forward, I’ve got to figure out rotations and what’s best for our ball club,” Borrego said. “It was good to have him back out there on the floor.” TIP INS Bulls: Shot 57% and scored 38 points in the paint in the first half. ...

Down one with 3.4 seconds remaining, the Pistons inbounded to Grant, who faked a handoff to Blake Griffin and then drove down the right side of the lane. Time clearly ran out before he laid the ball in, but he was also bumped by Houston's P.J. Tucker. Replays showed that contact also came after time expired, and after a review, the game ended with the Rockets holding on. “I tried to wait as long as I could before I fouled him,"" Tucker said. ""He got a little edge on me.” Grant scored 21 points for Detroit, which rallied from a 20-point second-quarter deficit and nearly erased a four-point gap late in the fourth. Griffin's 3-pointer with 29.9 seconds remaining made it 103-102, and the Pistons stopped Houston at the other end to set up Grant's final bid. Detroit coach Dwane Casey felt a foul could have been called earlier on the final play. Grant was pressured quickly after receiving the ball. “I thought he got fouled three times before he got to the rim,"" Casey said. Eric Gordon scored 20 points for Houston, which snapped a three-game losing streak. The Rockets were without John Wall and Christian Wood but had seven players score in double figures. “Everybody kind of played a role and did their job. It feels good,"" Houston coach Stephen Silas said. ""The crazy part is, if that foul had been point-one second earlier, then we wouldn’t feel so good, I guess.” It was an ugly first quarter for the Pistons, who turned the ball over nine times and trailed 34-21 at the end of the period. David Nwaba’s layup put Houston up 43-23 in the second. The Pistons, however, have been a bit more competitive this season than their league-worst 3-12 record suggests. They chipped away at the deficit and trailed 55-47 at halftime despite the fact that Griffin hadn’t scored yet. Grant’s 3-pointer put the Pistons ahead in the third, and they finished the quarter leading 81-77. TIP-INS Rockets: Wood, who went from Detroit to Houston in a sign-and-trade this offseason, missed the game against his former team with a sprained right ankle. Wall is dealing with left knee issues. Pistons: Wayne Ellington scored 18 points — all on 3-pointers — and was a big part of Detroit's comeback. ... Delon Wright also scored 18. ... Griffin finished with seven points and 10 rebounds. KEY SEQUENCE With Detroit down 97-95, Mason Plumlee secured a defensive rebound, but when he held the ball behind his head, Houston's Jae'Sean Tate ripped it away from him and drew a foul with 2:05 remaining. Tate made the first free throw and missed the second, but the Pistons were called for another foul on that rebound. Tucker's two free throws made it a five-point game.","401267390"
"Malcolm Brogdon drains a go-ahead 3-pointer with a few seconds left in the game. On the last possession, Evan Fournier's 3-pointer is no good, giving the Pacers a 120-118 win in overtime. (0:29) INDIANAPOLIS -- — When Malcolm Brogdon caught a pass from Doug McDermott on the right wing in the waning seconds of overtime, he didn't hesitate to launch the deep shot. “I like to take big shots,” Brogdon said. “My teammates and coaches trust me to take shots. I trust myself to take big shots. I knew where shot clock was, so I just shot the ball.” Brogdon hit the decisive 3-pointer with 2.8 seconds left in the extra period and calmly accepted his teammates' congratulations for lifting the Indiana Pacers to a 120-118 win over the Orlando Magic on Friday night. Evan Fournier’s 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer for Orlando. Brogdon led the Pacers with 23 points. Jeremy Lamb and Myles Turner each scored 22 points, and Domantas Sabonis contributed 18 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. Turner, who had missed the last two games with a right hand injury, started cramping in the fourth quarter. “It was frustrating not being out there in OT, but I think it was for the better,” Turner said. Fournier scored 26 points for the Magic. Nikola Vucevic had 24 points and 12 rebounds. “Both teams battled,” Vucevic said. “They just made one more play than we did. Evan made some big shots. His last shot went in and out.” The Magic went ahead 115-110 early in the overtime period. Brogdon appeared to tie it at 115 on a 3-pointer, but after a timeout, officials ruled he had stepped out of bounds. Indiana made the stops it needed down the stretch. Fournier missed a 3-point attempt with the Magic clinging to a one-point lead, setting up Brogdon’s big shot. Sabonis converted from in close to tie the game at 108 with 10.7 seconds left in regulation, and the Magic turned the ball over, sending it to overtime. “Our guys didn’t quit. They found themselves down in the fourth and found themselves down in overtime and kept coming back,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. “The game was full of highs and lows.” There were 17 lead changes and nine ties. Indiana’s 37-28 lead at the end of the first quarter was the biggest advantage for either team. Aaron Gordon said the Magic made too many key turnovers, including crucial one by him at the end of regulation. “That was rough,” Gordon said. “We had plenty of opportunities to win that game and we didn’t. We had it and we felt like we gave it away.” The Pacers scored 25 points off 14 turnovers, while Orlando scored just nine points off 10 Pacers turnovers. Gordon, who had 17 points and nine assists, sad it didn’t help that Orlando was 15 of 24 from the free-throw line. TIP-INS Magic: Michael Carter-Williams missed a ninth consecutive game with a left foot sprain. Pacers: Lamb played his second game since returning from a left ACL tear he suffered on Feb. 23, 2020.","401267391"
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Steve Nash try to diagnose what went wrong after the Nets fell to the Cavaliers for the second straight game. (0:49) CLEVELAND -- — Collin Sexton had 25 points and nine assists, Andre Drummond added 19 points and 16 rebounds and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Brooklyn Nets for the second time in three days, 125-113 on Friday night. The Nets played without superstar forward Kevin Durant, who was held out as a precautionary measure as he continues his comeback from right Achilles tendon surgery. Kyrie Irving scored 38 points and James Harden had 19 points and 11 assists for Brooklyn, which lost 147-135 in double-overtime to the Cavaliers in the debut of its high-scoring trio Wednesday. Durant scored 38 points and played 50 minutes in that game, so he was rested with another game Saturday. “I don’t want to overreact, but we need the guys to clean things up because we underperformed in two games,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. “People are excited to play against our team and will bring it every night. I feel like we need a little more and we have to take more pride in what we’re doing.” Jarrett Allen — acquired from Brooklyn in the Harden megatrade on Jan. 14 — scored 19 points and Larry Nance Jr. had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland, which has won three in a row and moved above .500 at 8-7. The Cavaliers outrebounded the Nets 50-29 and scored 70 points in the paint, maintaining a double-digit lead for the final 13 minutes. Taurean Prince, who also was dealt by Brooklyn, had 14 points off the bench. “We’re kind of learning on the fly because we haven’t had many practices, but we have to have constant effort,” Harden said. “Honestly, our problem isn’t offense. We’re not worried at all about offense. It’s our defense.” Irving scored back-to-back hoops to open the third, putting Brooklyn in front 64-61 before the Cavaliers answered with a 28-11 run to take the lead for good. Their largest advantage was 16 points late in the fourth. Cleveland point guard Darius Garland had 11 points after missing eight games with a sprained right shoulder. Sexton, who scored a career-high 42 points two nights earlier, collected 67 points and 14 assists in the sweep. “When we’re a whole, healthy team, we’re very tough to beat,” Drummond said. “These were great games for us. We have all the tools to be a great team.” Irving scored 18 points and Harden had 10 points and eight assists in the first half, but the Cavaliers held a 61-60 lead. The Nets started their 11th different lineup in 17 games, moving Jeff Green to a reserve role in favor of Bruce Brown. Brooklyn had won four in a row before arriving in Cleveland, where Irving spent his first six seasons. “This was two ugly losses,” Irving said. “I would have loved to get a win coming back to town. We have to figure it out, that’s it. No one else is going to do it for us. We just have to stay focused on making progress.” TIP-INS Nets: Harden and Irving share the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse record for points in a game with 55. Harden reached the mark with Houston on Dec. 11, 2019, while Irving did so with the Cavaliers against Portland on Jan. 28, 2015. … C Nicolas Claxton (right knee tendinitis) is expected to rejoin the team in February, while G Spencer Dinwiddie (right knee ACL tear) is out for the season after undergoing reconstructive surgery. Cavaliers: F Kevin Porter Jr., who was expected to be the sixth man, was traded to Houston for a future second-round pick. Porter was inactive for the first 14 games following a November arrest in Eastern Ohio. The second-year pro created a scene at the arena on Dec. 15 when he realized his locker had been given to newcomer Prince. “We’re moving forward with the group we’ve got,” coach J.B. Bickerstaff said.","401267392"
"Joel Embiid uses a stepback move to create space, then pulls up to knock down a 3-pointer in the face of Daniel Theis. (0:20) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid dropped a step-back 3-pointer and stated the shot was “nasty.” His game at MVP level, Embiid has avoided the flops that have dogged his career — putting up numbers as he dodged the claim he should be too big to flail. Embiid had 38 points and 11 rebounds, Tobias Harris scored 23 points and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Boston Celtics 122-110 on Friday night. “We've got a great group of guys and we're still learning how to play with each other,"" Embiid said. “We're only going to get better.” Seth Curry returned to the Sixers’ starting lineup following a seven-game absence because of a positive COVID-19 test and scored 15 points. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 42 points and nine rebounds and Marcus Smart had 20 points. Back at full health, the 76ers again played like a force in the East Embiid followed a 42-point outing in a win over Boston on Wednesday with another fantastic effort. Embiid, who said he had a sore back following a hard fall on his tailbone, made 14 of 15 from the free-throw line -- a familiar home after some mild criticism from Smart. Smart said Embiid “flails and gets the calls” after the All-Star center went to the line 21 times in his 42-point game. The Celtics shot just 20 free throws in that loss and none in the fourth quarter. Embiid laughed off the criticism and said Smart was just as theatrical when it came to trying to draw a foul. “Great actors know great actors,” 76ers coach Doc Rivers quipped before the game. Smart earned an A in histrionics early in the game when Embiid turned to throw an outlet pass after he saved the ball from going out of bounds. Smart hit the hardwood like a wrestler as Embiid’s elbow breezed by his face. Embiid patted Smart’s chest and they had a brief conversation as they walked off the court together headed into a timeout. The Sixers defense had waned as COVID-related absences wrecked the lineup over the past 10 days. The Sixers turned the ball over late in the second, forcing Rivers to pull down his mask and yell “wake up!” The Celtics took a 52-49 lead into the break. The Sixers woke up. Embiid scored 11 points in the third -- on the strength of 6 of 6 from the line -- and the Sixers outscored the Celtics 42-28 and grabbed the lead. The 42 points were the most in the Sixers scored in the third in almost two years. “He realizes he’s got guys that can help him be great,” 76ers guard Ben Simmons said of Embiid. “He’s talking a lot more. His leadership his grown.” Simmons converted a three-point play late in the fourth that snuffed a short Boston run, then picked off a pass and dunked for a 108-100 lead. Harris followed with a 3 and the two-game sweep was on. Simmons had 15 points and 11 assists. “I caught them falling asleep a few times and tried to make plays for my teammates,” Simmons said. The Celtics had no answers in the fourth as the Sixers improved to 8-0 with their regular starting lineup. “I’m disappointed in the way that we played in multiple big possessions in the fourth quarter,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “We have to be more detail-oriented. Everything has to be crisper. Everything has to be tighter. Everything has to be done to perfection when the other team is locked in.” TIP-INS: Celtics: Payton Pritchard, who had emerged as the first guard off the bench, suffered a sprained right knee and was helped off the court.

"OG Anunoby turns a steal into a dunk and then sinks a three as the Raptors pull away in the fourth quarter. (0:20) TAMPA , Fla. -- — Norman Powell scored 23 points, OG Anunoby added 21 and the Toronto Raptors recovered in the second half after blowing a 21-point lead to beat the Miami Heat 101-81 on Friday night. Pascal Siakam had 15 points, 14 rebounds and five assists for the Raptors, who never trailed on their way to avenging a 111-102 loss to the Heat on Wednesday night. “This was pretty much night and day,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said of his team's defensive effort. “We were definitely flying around on D. It's a good two-game scenario in that we learned a lesson. In the NBA, if you come out and you don't play, you're going to get beat.” Kendrick Nunn led the Heat (6-8) with 20 points, but the injury-riddled defending Eastern Conference champions made just seven of 31 3-point shots (22.7%) in losing for the fourth time in six games. Bam Adebayo had 14 points and eight rebounds. The Raptors (6-9) led 34-13 when Powell's layup completed an 18-2 run with 2:52 left in the first quarter. They were 8 of 11 on 3-point shots in the period. “I thought we did a good job of not getting stagnant. We kept moving, cutting, and we were able to make plays off that movement,” Powell said. Powell, starting in place of the injured Kyle Lowry, scored 19 points in the first half, and the Raptors survived another dose of Miami's confusing zone defense. “We would have had a really good offensive night, too, without all those turnovers,” said Nurse. Toronto shot 46% overall with 22 turnovers. Goran Dragic had two layups and a baseline jumper and Gabe Vincent added three layups in a 19-5 Miami run that opened the second half and tied it at 61. But Powell answered with a layup, launching a 12-0 Toronto run, and the Heat never recovered. TIP-INS Heat: Played again without F Jimmy Butler and G Avery Bradley (coronavirus protocol), G Tyler Herro (neck spams) and C Meyers Leonard (left shoulder strain). Raptors: Lowry did not play because of a toe infection. He tried to play through the injury Wednesday night and is hopeful of playing Sunday, Nurse said. ... Siakam played with a sore groin after a bad fall on Wednesday night. ... Powell averages 17.8 points and is shooting 55% in his four starts this season. RAPTORS ALMOST CENTERLESS Tuesday’s release of Alex Len left the Raptors with two centers. Chris Boucher is listed as a forward/center and starting center Aron Baynes, listed as a center-forward, played only 15.6 minutes per game before logging 23 minutes Friday night. “We didn’t see a need for a third center with Chris emerging,” said Nurse. “We’ve got a (roster) spot here and we’ll try to upgrade it with a biggerish-type player.” HEAT GOING THROUGH TOUGH STRETCH Miami coach Erik Spoelstra is trying to make the most of the many injury hits taken by his roster in the first 14 games of the season. Spoelstra stressed the minutes gained by younger players who would otherwise be watching. “We put this roster together based on (a next-man-up) identity,” Spoelstra said. “Because of all the missing parts this season ... this is good for all of our guys.”","401267394"
"Trae Young scores 24 of his 43 points on 3-pointers as the Hawks defeat the Timberwolves 116-98. (1:27) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Trae Young scored a season-high 43 points, Clint Capela had 13 points, 19 rebounds and 10 blocks, and the Atlanta Hawks topped the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-98 on Friday night. Young scored 25 points in the first half as the Hawks took a 19-point lead at halftime. He reached 40 points late in the third quarter with a step-back 3-pointer that put the Hawks up 84-59. ""I'm never going to be surprised when Trae's scoring 40 or 30 or 12 assists or whatever the number is,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. “He's learning. He's having fun with it.” Capela had six blocks in the first half as Atlanta held Minnesota to 43 points on 16-of-35 shooting. Hawks players on the bench stood and cheered when Capela picked up his 10th block in the fourth quarter, swatting away a shot by a driving Jordan McLaughin. Capela became the third player in Hawks history with 10 blocks in a game, joining Dikembe Mutombo and Josh Smith. “I've never seen 10 blocks in person,"" Young said. “What he did tonight was unbelievable. He's been doing this consistently for us. You've got to give credit where it's due. He's playing really well for us."" Second-year forward Cam Reddish returned after missing three games with a knee injury and added 15 points off the bench for the Hawks, who moved to 8-7. Malik Beasley was one of the few bright spots for Minnesota with 17 points. Naz Reid added 13 points, eight rebounds and four blocks. “There are some effort mistakes, too,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. “Those are ones we can’t have.” Minnesota has lost four straight and 11 of its last 12 after starting the season 2-0. The same two teams faced earlier this week when the Hawks beat the Timberwolves 108-97 in Atlanta despite a season-high 24 turnovers. Each team played a game in between meetings, with Minnesota dropping a home game to Orlando and Atlanta beating the Pistons at home. TIP-INS Hawks: Capela recorded his sixth straight double-double and his ninth overall this season. … It was the 13th 40-point game of Young’s career and first this season. Timberwolves: PG Ricky Rubio returned to action Friday after missing two games due to the league’s health and safety protocols. Rubio was the first player off the bench for Minnesota. … Jake Layman was the only player on the active roster who did not play in the first half Friday. REMEMBERING HANK AARON Pierce spoke extensively before Friday’s game about Hank Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player who died earlier Friday. Aaron, who spent 21 of his 23 years playing for the Atlanta Braves, spoke to the Hawks at a practice during Pierce’s first season as coach during the 2018-19 season. Before Aaron addressed the team, Pierce had a chance to speak 1-on-1 for a few minutes with Aaron. That conversation sticks with him to this day. “For me, as an adult, I met a hero, I met an idol, I met a star. It’s still an awe moment for me,” Pierce said. “I was mostly impressed with his humility, him feeling like it was an opportunity for him. Really it was an opportunity for us to listen to him, to listen to his stories, for him to explain in his own words what he went through leading up to breaking the (home run) record.”","401267396"
"Luka Doncic goes for 36 points, 11 assists and 9 rebounds in the Mavericks' 122-117 win vs. the Spurs. (2:10) SAN ANTONIO -- — Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks are learning to keep their cool when the game gets heated, and that proved meaningful against the San Antonio Spurs. Doncic had 36 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds and the Mavericks withstood a late rally to beat the Spurs 122-117 on Friday night. The Mavericks believe losing several games in the final minutes last season has helped their poise to start this season. “We’ve gotten a year older a year wiser,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “We spent more time working on it. Understating that’s a big part of where we want to go. The biggest thing is we kept our cool.” The Mavericks won their second straight after a three-game losing streak. The Spurs are 2-5 at home. San Antonio lost starting point guard Dejounte Murray in the opening minute. The severity of the injury is unknown, but Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said, “I think he is going to be fine,” following the game. DeMar DeRozan had 29 points for San Antonio, LaMarcus Aldridge added 26, and Keldon Johnson had 17 points and 14 rebounds. After trailing by as many as 18 points, the Spurs pulled to 113-107 with four minutes remaining on a turnaround left-handed hook by Aldridge. Two minutes later, DeRozan cut the advantage to 113-111 with a pair of free throws. “They were creating some confusion with switching and things like that,” Carlisle said. DeRozan made one of two free throws to pull the Spurs within 113-112. Doncic then made an 11-footer and then drove on the ensuing possession and assisted on Jalen Brunson’s 3-pointer. “I think the biggest thing is making better decisions,” Doncic said. “Give up good shots for better shots. I think that’s the key to the end of our games.” Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 21 points each for the Mavericks. Murray injured his left ankle on Porzingis’ 14-foot jumper 59 seconds into the game, appearing to get his feet entangled with the Mavericks’ center. Murray remained on the court briefly before quickly rising and limping directly to the locker room. Murray’s absence had a big impact on San Antonio’s perimeter defense in the first half. The Mavericks were 14 for 39 on 3-pointers, including 10 for 21 in the first half. Dallas entered the game averaging 12.6 3-pointers on 37.6 attempts. “Everybody fought,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said of the late rally. “If everybody had not fought being down by 18, we would have lost by 25 or 30. So everybody deserves credit for hanging in and continuing to compete and not get down.” TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic fell a rebound shy of his sixth triple-double of the season. In just his third season with the Mavericks, Doncic is the franchise leader in triple-doubles with 30. … Dorian Finney-Smith, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell and Josh Richardson were because of health and safety protocols. Spurs: Starting guard Derrick White missed his 11th straight game after fracturing his left second toe. … The Spurs trailed by 15-plus points for the fifth time this season. They have lost each of those games. ... San Antonio made seven 3-pointers in the first quarter tonight, which is one shy of its franchise record for a single quarter. … Tre Jones entered the game in the first quarter for the earliest action of his rookie season.

"Nikola Jokic passes the ball so quick you need to see the replay. (0:21) PHOENIX -- — Denver coach Michael Malone is a little exasperated with his players after 15 games. Sometimes the Nuggets look like one of the NBA's best teams. Sometimes they've looked awful. He's just thankful the good version showed up in time on Friday night. Nikola Jokic scored 31 points, Gary Harris added 19 and the Nuggets rallied to force overtime before beating the Phoenix Suns 130-126. The win pushed Denver above .500 for the first time this season at 8-7. “We’ve shown we can do it,” Malone said. “The challenge is to do it more consistently and as close to 48 minutes as possible.” Will Barton pushed the Nuggets ahead 124-123 with 1:37 left in overtime on a driving layup and Jamal Murray's 13-foot jumper put them up three points with 28.5 seconds left. Denver held on from that point, winning for the third time in four games to improve to 8-7 this season. Devin Booker led the Suns with 31 points but took a hard fall late in overtime and didn't play the final few possessions. Phoenix's offense looked discombobulated without its leading scorer on the floor and didn't score a field goal until the final seconds when it was too late. Suns coach Monty Williams said that Booker hurt his left hamstring and likely wouldn't play on Saturday night in the rematch between the two teams. Suns forward Deandre Ayton had 27 points and 13 rebounds, shooting 11 of 13 from the field. Mikal Bridges added 24 points and 10 rebounds and was 6 of 8 from 3-point range. Denver shot nearly 52% from the field and six players scored in double figures. Jokic added 10 rebounds and eight assists and was a big part of the reason the Nuggets poured in 80 points in the paint. “I didn’t do what I was supposed to do,” Ayton said. “They had 80 points in the paint tonight and that is on me. I have to be more of an anchor be more of a presence down low just to shut it down early.” The Suns had a 14-point lead at halftime but Denver sliced that deficit to 95-91 by the end of the third quarter. The Nuggets took their first lead since the opening minute when PJ Dozier made a driving layup with 8:33 left that made it 98-97. “They have been together for a while so they have been in a lot more game like that, (playoff-type) games like that,” Bridges said. “Credit to them but if we limit the turnovers, we have a chance to win it.” Jokic made a lay-up in the lane to tie the game at 114 with about a 1:07 left in regulation. Both teams had a couple chances to push ahead in the final minute but shots wouldn't fall. The Suns jumped out to a 68-54 lead at halftime. Booker had 19 points and Bridges added 17 after hitting all five of his 3-pointers. Chris Paul had 14 assists, which tied a franchise record for the most in a half. Jokic led the Nuggets with 16 points. TIP-INS Nuggets: F Michael Porter Jr. played for the first time since Dec. 29 after missing 10 games while in the league's COVID-19 health and safety protocols.

He had some great moves, great finishes around the basket as always,” teammate Mike Muscala said of Gilgeous-Alexander. “He makes the game easier for everybody on the court.” The Thunder were in catch-up mode most of the way before dropping their second straight and fourth in five games. They were just 14 of 42 from 3-point range and only got to the free throw line 13 times. “We had a bad start,” Dort said. “We had to talk to each other, pick it up, and play harder.” The Clippers grabbed control in the first half, scoring 36 points in the first quarter and 34 in the second on 63% shooting. They had scoring runs of 21-2 and 11-4 in the first.

But Leonard quickly put the Clippers ahead 91-75, running off six in a row. Muscala hit another 3-pointer that left the Thunder trailing by 13 going into the fourth. “Teams are going to make runs, regardless of it’s a top team or a young team,” George said. “You got to learn how to win in adversity and learn how to weather the storm.

The Kings made only three shots over the final six minutes but made up for it by going 7 of 8 on free throws down the stretch. “I felt like they kind of pushed us around a little bit in the first half and we were able to respond in the second,” Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. “That’s one of the top defensive teams in the league. A good game to get a win and get one in that fashion where we had to fight, fight, fight the whole game.” De’Aaron Fox added 22 points and seven assists for Sacramento, which had lost nine of its previous 11. Richaun Holmes had 10 points, 14 rebounds and matched his career high of six blocks. The Kings ended their skid by getting steady play across the board offensively and an improved effort on the defensive end. Sacramento also matched New York’s physicality, which helped swing the momentum in the second half. “What we have to understand is nobody’s coming to save us,” said Kings rookie Tyrese Haliburton, who had 16 points and four blocks. “We have to put pressure on the opposing team and match the physicality and show that we’re not going to shy away.” Julius Randle had 26 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. RJ Barrett added 21 points and seven rebounds. “This was a weird, weird game for us,” Randle said. “We started off slow, worked our way out of it and was up at the half. The third and fourth quarter was a little bit of a funk. I don’t even know what happened. The ball stuck a little bit.” New York’s offense also iced up late in the fourth quarter. The Knicks missed six of their final nine attempts over the last five minutes. “Obviously we didn’t finish well,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “I did like the fight in the fourth quarter to come back, but we didn’t close it out. It’s hard to win on the road if you’re not doing all the little things. The games keep coming. We have to improve.” TIP-INS Knicks: Alec Burks had nine points and five rebounds in 27 minutes in his second game back from an ankle injury that sidelined him for three weeks. … Thibodeau won a challenge in the third quarter to overturn a defensive foul call against guard Elfrid Payton. … New York went into the night averaging 96 points over its previous seven games. Kings: Sacramento set a season high with 14 blocks. … The Kings held a 15-0 advantage in fast-break points. … Marvin Bagley III fouled out with 55 seconds left to play. HELP WANTED Thibodeau noted that part of the problem came when the Kings double-teamed Randle in the post and he had trouble finding an open teammate to pass to. Randle agreed. “In the post they were coming right away,” he said. “It was a hard aggressive trap.” SHOT CLOCK SNAFU The game was delayed six minutes due to a shot clock malfunction immediately following Fox’s jumper 28 seconds into the first quarter. Players from both teams milled about the court during the delay, while Sacramento’s Buddy Hield chatted with the referees near the scorers table. TRIBUTE TO HAMMERIN’ HANK A video tribute to baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron played during a timeout in the first half. Aaron, the former home run king, died earlier in the day at the age of 86.","401267401"
"Reggie Miller surprises Steph Curry to congratulate him for moving into second place on the NBA's all-time 3-pointer list. (2:14) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Donovan Mitchell had 23 points, seven rebounds and six assists as the Utah Jazz routed the Golden State Warriors 127-108 on Saturday night for their eighth straight victory. Stephen Curry made five 3-pointers for the Warriors to give him 2,562 in his career — passing Reggie Miller for second place in NBA history. Ray Allen is first with 2,973. “That’s pretty dope,” Curry said. “We got our head beat tonight, but I was trying to still enjoy it. After I made the third one, I knew that was a big one, and then to make that fourth one in the third quarter was pretty special. Something I’ve been looking forward to for a very long time.” Mike Conley scored 17 points and hit five 3s for the Jazz, who led by 30 at halftime and opened a 40-point bulge early in the fourth quarter. Bojan Bogdanovic had 14 points, seven rebounds and a career-high eight assists. Rudy Gobert added 11 points and 14 boards as six Utah players scored in double figures. Curry finished with 24 points, seven rebounds and seven assists to lead Golden State. Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman each scored 13. Utah shot 52% from the field in the first half. The Jazz had 18 assists on 28 baskets before halftime while committing only four turnovers. They finished with 28 assists. “It’s something we really love doing,” Mitchell said. “That’s what's special about this team. We love to make the extra pass.” The Jazz scored baskets on each of their first five possessions to sprint out to a 14-0 lead and made eight 3-pointers in the first quarter. Conley and Royce O’Neale each drained a trio of 3s in the period. “Utah came out on fire,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “They executed their offense beautifully.” Golden State trailed from start to finish. “Our first four possessions we got some decent looks and missed them,” Curry said. “Then they came down, 3-3-3-3, and the rest is history after that. Our identity has to be getting stops — at least making them take difficult shots and trying to get some momentum that then flows into the offensive end.” Golden State found some footing behind Curry, after missing nine of its first 10 shots. Curry scored four baskets and assisted on five others to help the Warriors cut the Jazz lead to 36-28. Overall, the Warriors made 12 of their final 15 shots in the quarter. Golden State could not build on that momentum during the second period, though. The Warriors simply could not figure out how to slow down the Jazz as they closed the first half on a 24-8 run. Conley and Mitchell punctuated the decisive spurt with consecutive 3s, giving the Jazz a 77-47 halftime lead. The Warriors made just six baskets in the second quarter. “We want to defend collectively,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “I think our guys are seeing it collectively. It’s not one guy’s job. Every guy has to do the job.” Utah went up 115-75 on a 3-pointer from Jordan Clarkson with 10:05 left. DROPPING IN Miller and his son, Ryker, joined the Warriors’ postgame Zoom call to congratulate Curry. Miller praised Curry for putting in countless hours to become such a sensational outside shooter. Curry revealed how he’s tried to emulate Miller with how he shoots and moves off the ball. He also said growing up around the game as the son of an NBA player helped him develop the right habits to become an effective shooter. “I have a certain style of playing the game that I love and … I love to put the work in,” Curry said. “And that’s something that I hope people understand.” TIP-INS Warriors: Curry passed Miller, who had 2,560 3-pointers, with his first basket of the third quarter. ... Kevon Looney made his second 3 of the season in the third. … Golden State had 30 assists on 42 baskets. Jazz: Bogdanovic matched his previous career high of seven assists, set in 2016, by halftime. He had a season high of three assists coming into the game. … Mitchell has shot 50% or better from the field seven times in the last eight games. … Utah outrebounded Golden State 69-41, and eight players made a 3-pointer. “When we’re going on both ends, we’re a tough team to play against,” guard Joe Ingles said.","401267402"
"Joel Embiid tallies 33 points and adds 14 rebounds as Philadelphia edges Detroit 114-110. (1:53) DETROIT -- — Joel Embiid had 33 points and 14 rebounds, and his two free throws with 7.2 seconds left helped the Philadelphia 76ers seal a 114-110 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. Ben Simmons added 20 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for the 76ers, and he made a couple big free throws of his own in the final minute. Philadelphia is atop the Eastern Conference but didn't push its lead over the last-place Pistons into double figures until early in the fourth quarter. That was when Dwight Howard's dunk put the 76ers up 99-88. Detroit trailed 110-108 after Jerami Grant made a 3-pointer with 28.5 seconds left, but Simmons calmly made two free throws to push the lead to four. “I have the confidence to step up and knock it down,” Simmons said. “Especially late game.” Delon Wright's layup made it 112-110, but Embiid closed the game out with his free throws and finished 12 of 17 from the line. Wayne Ellington scored 17 points for the Pistons, who led 63-61 at halftime and kept the game competitive despite being without Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose. “I loved the effort, I loved the togetherness guys played with,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""We continue to do that, good things are going to happen.” Embiid scored 80 points in his previous two games, both wins over Boston. He said he had a sore back following a hard fall on his tailbone in Friday's game against the Celtics, but he was able to play, and the Pistons had all sorts of trouble stopping him. Embiid scored 21 points in the first half, keeping the 76ers within two even though Detroit outscored Philadelphia 27-6 from beyond the arc through two quarters. TIP-INS 76ers: Howard received a technical foul in the second quarter, evidently for complaining to officials after his shorts appeared to be torn. Pistons: Ellington went 4 of 6 from 3-point range and is 24 of 41 from long distance in the past five games. ... Griffin sat out to manage a left knee injury, and Rose was out with left knee soreness. SOLID NIGHT Simmons hasn't been great from the line in his career. Last season, he shot 62%, and the previous two seasons were worse than that. He was 10 of 12 on Saturday, however. “Just having that confidence to knock those free throws down in a close game is big right now,"" teammate Tobias Harris said. Philadelphia went 30 of 38 as a team.","401267403"
"Kyrie Irving and Bam Adebayo attempt to swap jerseys after the game, but a member of the Heat security team pulls Adebayo away. (0:25) NEW YORK -- — Brooklyn's three superstars were just enough to overcome Bam Adebayo's brilliant individual effort. Kevin Durant scored 31 points, Kyrie Irving took over late and had 28 and the Nets overcame Adebayo's career-high 41 points to beat the Miami Heat 128-124 on Saturday night. James Harden finished with 12 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds as the Nets won for the first time with their Big Three playing together. They lost consecutive games with dismal defensive efforts in Cleveland and barely got enough stops to hold off a short-handed Heat team that had been limited to 81 points by Toronto a night earlier. “It’s not every day you see this collection of guys playing together in NBA history, so we want to take full advantage of that,” Irving said. Irving helped pull the Nets through with 12 points in the final 5:48 after the Heat had erased nearly all of an 18-point deficit. Joe Harris added 23 points and seven 3-pointers for Brooklyn, but the Nets needed Irving's 18 points in the final quarter of a game they had largely controlled. “All three of those guys, they’re just so damn skilled. Off the dribble, their shooting ability, their ability to see open players, and that’s why they're three of the best in this business,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “And those are shots that only great players can manufacture.” Goran Dragic scored 19 points and Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson each had 18 for the Heat, who remain without Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro. Adebayo also had nine assists while blowing past his previous best scoring night of 30 points. “I wish we’d gotten the W; 40 don’t mean nothing unless you got the W, for real,” Adebayo said. Durant was 5 for 5 and scored 13 points in the third quarter, with the last of his three 3-pointers in the period making it 96-80. Adebayo beat the buzzer with a jumper, than Miami opened the fourth with a 13-0 run to get within 96-95. “We were up 20 points throughout, 16, 14 going to the fourth quarter, so we were in good shape. But we’ve got to put together four quarters of great basketball,” Durant said. Irving, Harden and Durant quickly combined for eight straight points but Adebayo kept coming, and the Nets needed a couple of clutch baskets from Irving and late free throws to pull it out. Harris had four 3-pointers and 12 points in the first quarter. The Nets were ahead 60-42 with a little more than two minutes left in the half, but Miami trimmed it to 66-56 on Adebayo's 3-pointer just before the buzzer. Harden didn't make a basket until the fourth, threatening to go without one in a game for the first time since he left Oklahoma City. He finally attempted his first shot with 0.7 seconds left in the first quarter and was fouled behind the arc, making all three free throws for a 36-25 lead. TIP-INS Heat: Moe Harkless started at forward but exited in the second quarter with a bruised left thigh after banging legs with a Nets player along the baseline. He hadn't even played in the series opener against Toronto and got only six minutes Friday. Nets: Jeff Green scored 11 points. ... The Nets came in averaging an NBA-best 121.5 points at home. THE SHIRT OFF HIS BACK Irving and Adebayo have been friends for years but that means little during the coronavirus pandemic. Irving was trying to get Adebayo’s pink-and-blue Heat jersey after the game before security intervened, as new NBA initiatives try to keep opposing players separated to stop the spread of the virus. “Oh, he definitely wants it,” Adebayo said. “I’m going to send him one on my own time.” Irving was fined $50,000 recently for not wearing a mask during an indoor gathering and said he was trying to stay out of trouble. “I just want to follow NBA protocols,” he said. LINE THEM UP Miami used its 11th different starting lineup in its 15th game, while coach Steve Nash sent out a different first five for the 12th time in Brooklyn's 18 games. Part of that is because of player absences and part because he is still experimenting following the Harden trade, which he may still need to do before settling on his preferred starters. “I'm not sure we’re there yet,"" Nash said. ""It might be ideal to be there but I don’t know that we are, so I don’t want to commit to that yet.”","401267404"
"Anthony Davis emerges from his offensive slump against the Bulls, producing 26 points on 10-of-12 shooting from the field and 2-of-2 from 3-point range in the first half. (1:58) CHICAGO -- — Anthony Davis missed seeing his family members in the stands. They would have witnessed quite a performance had they been allowed in the arena. Davis dominated with a season-high 37 points against his hometown team, LeBron James added 17 points and 11 rebounds and the Lakers beat the Chicago Bulls 101-90 on Saturday. The defending NBA champions improved to 9-0 on the road and a league-best 13-4 overall. And this one never was in doubt. Davis scored 26 points in the highest scoring half by a Laker this season as Los Angeles grabbed a 63-33 lead. The seven-time All-Star shot 14 of 21, nailing two 3-pointers, and grabbed six rebounds. “It's tough. Usually, when I come home I get to see my family,” he said. “They come to the games and support me. Being in the Western Conference my entire career so far, I only come home once during the season. I miss seeing them in the stands and coming out and cheering me on, supporting me. That was different.” James, coming off a season-high 34-point outing in a win at Milwaukee two nights earlier, had six assists and six turnovers. And the Lakers won their eighth in a row against Chicago. The Bulls had won three in a row and matched a franchise record by scoring 115 or more in seven straight games. But against stingy Los Angeles, they struggled, particularly in the early going. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 21 points and 10 rebounds. Coby White added 14 points and seven rebounds. “The first half, we just did not play to our identity like we had been trying to play to,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I thought we penetrated and we charged too much. We didn't find open people when they were there. They were really coming in and protecting the paint. We had some turnovers, gave up some offensive rebounds. The first half, it wasn't who we've been.” DOMINANT START The Lakers held off the Bulls 117-115 in Los Angeles two weeks earlier with Davis and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missing the game because of injuries. Los Angeles wasted no time taking control in this one. Davis came in averaging 21.1 points — down five from last season. But he set the tone as the Lakers raced out to a 20-6 lead. He scored 13 of Los Angeles' first 16 points, with three dunks in that stretch. “We want to make sure we're playing through him as much as possible,” coach Frank Vogel said. “We have a lot of new guys on this team, so there's been times early in the season where myself and even AD has been trying to get other guys comfortable. We knew this week, the beginning of this trip, was a time to really start having him be more assertive.” Davis also made two 3-pointers late in the half, including one in the closing minute to make it 61-31. And after Chicago's Coby White hit a pull-up jumper, Dennis Schroder drove for a layup to bump the lead back to 30. The Bulls went on a 14-2 run late in the third quarter to pull within 79-66. But back-to-back baskets by Davis made it a 17-point game heading to the fourth. TIP-INS Lakers: Davis' previous season high was 34 points against San Antonio on Jan. 1. He scored a career-high 59 for New Orleans at Detroit on Feb. 21, 2016. ... The Lakers were 4 for 19 on 3-pointers after tying a season-high by making 19 of 37 against Milwaukee. ... F Jared Dudley (sore right calf) remains a “game or two” away from returning from an injury that has kept him out the past seven, Vogel said. Bulls: Chicago shot 39 about percent from the field and made 8 of 25 3-pointers. ... Coach Billy Donovan said C Wendell Carter Jr. (quad) is improving, though he's not sure if he'll be available Monday against Boston after missing the past two games. “He's made progress. He is feeling better,” Donovan said. ... The Bulls also held out Otto Porter Jr. after he played the previous night at Charlotte.","401267405"
"Josh Okogie slips a pass behind his back to Jarred Vanderbilt for a two-handed jam. (0:18) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Naz Reid scored 20 points to lead a balanced offensive effort and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the New Orleans Pelicans 120-110 on Saturday night. Anthony Edwards scored 18 points and Jared Vanderbilt set career highs with 16 points and 11 rebounds for Minnesota, which snapped a four-game skid. Jarrett Culver and Malik Beasley each scored 16 points, and Jordan McLaughlin added 11. Brandon Ingram led New Orleans with 30 points. Eric Bledsoe added 28 and Zion Williamson finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Pelicans, who have lost three straight and eight of their last nine. Minnesota center Karl-Anthony Towns missed his fourth straight game after testing positive for the coronavirus on Jan. 15. The Timberwolves are 2-9 without Towns in the lineup this season. “We have a lot of good players, talented players,” guard Ricky Rubio said, “but it’s a team sport. You can have a guy or two have huge nights, but you need everyone playing the game the right way to win.” After trailing by a point at halftime, Minnesota used a 16-3 run to pull ahead. Reid and Vanderbilt each scored four points, and the Pelicans called a timeout after Beasley went coast to coast with for a layup that gave the Timberwolves a 75-69 lead. Vanderbilt capped the run by tipping in a missed shot to put Minnesota head by 10. Bledsoe finally broke through for New Orleans when he put back his own miss, but Culver countered with a 3-pointer and an 82-71 Timberwolves lead. The Pelicans went 4 1/2 minutes without a field goal over that stretch, missing 11 straight shots from the floor. Even after hitting its final two shots of the quarter, New Orleans shot 5 for 24 and missed all four of its 3-pointers in the third. The Pelicans also committed 21 turnovers, which the Timberwolves converted into 20 points. That left New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy questioning his team’s effort. “I certainly will take my share of the blame, but we talked after the game, some guys are going to have to take some personable responsibility,” Van Gundy said. “You can’t have the guy you’re guarding playing harder than you on a regular basis.” The Timberwolves pushed their lead to 18 midway through the fourth and kept New Orleans at arm’s length the rest of the way. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans wrapped up a six-game road swing with at 1-5 record. The Pelicans have played the sixth-toughest schedule in the NBA. Timberwolves: Reid’s 20 points matched his career high. ... The Wolves just missed having eight players in double figures. Rubio scored 9 points and added 7 assists, while Josh Okogie also had 9 points to go with 5 steals. PANDEMIC PROBLEMS In addition to Towns, Minnesota forward Juancho Hernangomez was sidelined after a positive coronavirus test. Meanwhile, guard D’Angelo Russell (rest) also sat out, leaving the Wolves without their top two scorers (Towns and Russell) and top two rebounders (Towns and Hernangomez). QUOTABLE “The formula we talk about is defend, rebound and take care of the ball, and tonight the answers to that were no, no, and none,"" Van Gundy said.","401267406"
"DeMarcus Cousins backs down his defender and shakes the rim on the one-handed slam. (0:16) DALLAS -- — Eric Gordon scored a season-high 33 points, DeMarcus Cousins had his best game for Houston with 28 points and 17 rebounds and the Rockets beat the Dallas Mavericks 133-108 on Saturday night. John Wall had seven points and eight assists after missing five straight games with right knee soreness. It was the first game for Wall since the James Harden trade. The Rockets were without a key piece of that deal as Victor Oladipo rested a sore right quadriceps. Luka Doncic scored 26 points while sitting the entire fourth quarter with the game out of reach. The Slovenian star was again without European sidekick Kristaps Porzingis, who rested his surgically repaired right knee as the Mavericks finished five games in seven days by completing their second back-to-back in that stretch. The Rockets were also playing on a second consecutive night for the first time this season and won both to improve to 3-3 since the Harden trade. “It was a very complete game for us on both ends of the floor, especially on a back to back,” coach Stephen Silas said a night after a 103-102 victory at Detroit. “Really good trip for us.” Houston never trailed as Cousins opened the scoring with a three-point play and scored eight points in the first three minutes. Cousins matched his most points since a torn Achilles tendon ended his final season with New Orleans in 2017-18. Gordon was 6 of 9 from 3-point range as the Rockets shot 43% (16 of 37) from beyond the arc. Cousins, who came in shooting 26% overall and 24% from long range, was 9 of 15, including 4 of 8 from 3. “My thing is the shot quality,” Silas said about Cousins. “He works conscientiously on his 3-point shot. I knew it would come around. We just had to make sure he was getting good, quality shots. He did that tonight.” The Rockets led 70-59 after the highest-scoring half against Dallas this season. The Mavericks pulled within 74-71 early in the third quarter before Houston finished the quarter on a 30-12 run. “We don’t have any excuses,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “The energy was a factor. We were able to get it up in spurts, but weren’t able to sustain it. They had more juice.” TIP-INS Rockets: Wall played 21 minutes when coach Stephen Silas said he would watch his minutes closely and make sure he didn't play long stretches. ... David Mwaba scored a season-high 18 points, and Mason Jones had 16. Mavericks: Tim Hardaway Jr., who was 0 of 12 from the field in the most recent Dallas loss against Toronto, missed all five shots in the first half before going 4 of 8 after halftime and finishing with 15 points. ... Doncic had eight assists and five rebounds. ... Boban Marjanovic matched Hardaway with 15 points, and Trey Burke had 13. SITTING PORZINGIS Carlisle said the Mavericks figured they would rest Porzingis given it was their seventh game in 11 days since the 7-foot-3 Latvian made his debut after the offseason surgery. Carlisle left little doubt Dallas was upbeat about Porzingis’ progress. “He’s doing exceptionally well,” Carlisle said. “It was a decision we talked about a lot, and that was one reason he didn’t get downgraded until later in the day. Things are in a really good place.” HOMECOMING, SORT OF Silas was back in Dallas after the first-year Rockets coach spent the past two seasons as an assistant with the Mavericks. But it wasn’t much of a homecoming. First of all, Silas’ family made the move from Dallas to Houston the day before the game, “so we missed each other.” Even if his family had still been in town, Silas wouldn’t have been able to see them because of COVID-19 protocols. “Obviously, being here, a place that’s so close to my heart but no fans and you’re not allowed to even shake their hands or hug,” Silas said. “Yeah, we’re going to Dallas, but it’s on a back-to-back and there’s no fans and I can’t even take a walk on the Katy Trail (near the Mavericks’ arena). It's a downer.”","401267407"
"Off the rebound, JaMychal Green throws up a shot in wild fashion and the Nuggets' bench loves it. (0:25) PHOENIX -- — There was extra basketball played in Phoenix for a second straight night and it was all Jamal Murray's fault. The fifth-year Nuggets guard has done some of the finest work in his NBA career against the Suns and the good times lasted deep into Saturday evening largely because of his clutch shooting. Murray's difficult, off-balance 3-pointer at the end of regulation forced overtime  and Denver outlasted Phoenix 120-112 in two overtimes. Nikola Jokic scored 29 points and grabbed 22 rebounds while Murray added 26 points. “This felt like a playoff game,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “Playing the same team, starters playing in double OT, you ask a lot of your starters and they deliver.” It was the second straight impressive win for the Nuggets, who have won eight of their past 11 games. Denver won 130-126 in a single overtime Friday after rallying from a 14-point halftime deficit. Saturday's game was even more entertaining with the two teams trading last-second, game-tying 3s. Murray hit his while falling out of bounds with Deandre Ayton in his face as time expired in regulation. Phoenix's Jae Crowder responded with a 3-pointer with 0.7 seconds left in the first overtime to send the game deeper into the night. By comparison, the final minutes were boring. The Nuggets scored the first five points of the second overtime and never trailed. The Suns played without All-Star guard Devin Booker for the first time this season. Averaging a team-high 22.9 points, he hurt his left hamstring Friday. Jokic scored 12 of his 29 points during the two overtimes. Michael Porter Jr. came off the bench to score 14 points and grab 11 rebounds. “I was feeling good,” Jokic said. “When you’re playing, you’re feeling good ... It’s after the game when you feel it.” Chris Paul hit a 15-foot jumper with 12 seconds left in regulation to put the Suns ahead 98-95 but Murray responded with his clutch 3-pointer. The 6-foot-11 Ayton had a hand right in his face, but the ball splashed through the next anyway. Murray came into the game averaging 20.8 points against the Suns in his career, which is his most against any team. The first overtime was just as tight as the fourth quarter. Jokic made a smooth move in the post to get past Frank Kaminsky, making a layup while being fouled with 28 seconds left. He made the free throw to put the Nuggets up 104-102. The Suns had a chance to take the lead when Abdel Nader was fouled on a 3-pointer from the corner, but he missed two of three free throws. Jokic's two free throws put Denver ahead 106-103 before Crowder responded with a 3 with 0.7 seconds left to tie it and force even more basketball. It was Crowder's sixth 3-pointer of the night. Crowder and Paul led the Suns with 21 points each. Paul also had 13 assists. Cam Johnson scored 19 points but didn't play in the final minutes because of muscle cramps. “We did play very hard, put it out there,” Johnson said. “It is frustrating, very frustrating.” Suns coach Monty Williams said it was hard to be mad about his team's effort. He added that he felt his team — playing without Booker — got tired in the final minutes and couldn't quite finish. “I was just unbelievably proud of how they competed tonight,” Williams said. “We could have mailed it in coming off a tough one.” The Nuggets got a big boost from their bench, which added 52 points. Ayton had 15 points and eight rebounds in the first half as the Suns pushed to a 61-58 halftime lead. Paul had 12 assists before the break, one day after tying a franchise record with 14 assists in the first half.

Suns: F Dario Saric and F/C Damian Jones were both out because of COVID-19 health and safety protocols. ... Rookie Jalen Smith played in his first game since Dec. 26. The No. 10 overall pick out of Maryland had five points in the first half. Smith missed nearly a month with an ankle injury and then spent time on the COVID-19 list. ...

"Fred VanVleet takes the contact and somehow gets the shot to fall from mid-range. (0:20) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Toronto coach Nick Nurse knew needed somebody to replace the scoring void left by two missing All-Stars. OG Anunoby delivered with jab after jab Sunday. He scored a season-high 30 points, grabbed eight rebounds, defended well and made three of four free throws in the final minute to give the surging Raptors a 107-102 victory over the Indiana Pacers. “I think it comes with opportunity, really,” coach Nick Nurse said. “We had a couple of guys (Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam) who are a good percentage of our offense out, so it’s going to shift somewhere. Tonight it shifted to OG.” Thanks largely to Anunoby’s strong game and a solid supporting cast, the Raptors have won two straight and five of their last six. Plus, they maintained their dominance over the Pacers, who have lost six straight season series to Toronto. Anunoby, the former Indiana University star, was the key. He went 9 of 16 from the field, 4 of 6 on 3-pointers and 8 of 10 from the free-throw line and he excelled defensively, too, helping to hold Domantas Sabonis, Indiana's All-Star forward, scoreless in the second half. “They played good individual defense and played really well in the gaps,” said Myles Turner, who led Indiana with 25 points and six blocks. “I would say he (Anunoby) was aggressive, chose his spots well, got downhill and got to the free-throw line. He had a good night.” The Pacers played catch-up most of the game after falling behind midway through the second quarter. Toronto, with the help of Anunoby, extended the lead to 58-47 at the half. Indiana finally regained the lead briefly in the fourth quarter, twice. But the Raptors broke an 82-all tie with an 8-0 run and when Indiana tied the score again with 1:07 to play, Anunoby made three of four free throws. Toronto scored the final five points to hand Indiana its third loss in four games. “They played hard, that’s for sure,"" Nurse said. “I've really got to compliment the whole group there.""

"Jaylen Brown goes for 33 points in 19 minutes as the Celtics cruise past the Cavaliers 141-103. (2:09) BOSTON -- — Jaylen Brown scored 20 of his 33 points in the third quarter and the Boston Celtics snapped their three-game losing streak Sunday night by cruising to a 141-103 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Kemba Walker added 21 points, Daniel Theis scored 17, Carsen Edwards had 15 and Marcus Smart had 12 for Boston, which posted a season high in points in a half, taking a 73-51 edge into intermission. Brown played just 19 minutes. “We needed a win,” Brown said. “We lost three in a row. Being back on our floor, we wanted to make sure we came out with great intensity and we did.” Collin Sexton led Cleveland with 13 points, far below his team-leading average of 26.8 per game, as the Cavaliers' three-game winning streak ended. Coming off impressive back-to-back victories over the Brooklyn Nets in which they scored 147 and 125 points, respectively, the Cavaliers were simply never in this one. Boston pushed the ball out on the fast break, getting several easy looks that it converted while the Cavaliers missed 10 of their initial 13 shots. “I thought our defensive intensity was good for most of the game and I thought our offense fed off of it,” Boston coach Brad Stevens said. Brown made it look easy in his limited playing time. He's scored 25 or more in four straight games, the longest stretch of his career. “He’s in a great rhythm scoring,” Stevens said. Behind Smart’s 10 points and Brown’s nine, the Celtics shot 60% and pulled to a 38-21 lead after the opening quarter. They pushed it to 41-21 on Walker’s 3-pointer on the first possession of the second quarter. “We can't get complacent. We won three games in a row,"" said Cleveland guard Jarrett Allen, who scored 12 points. “We came out flat, almost like we expected to win. We have to come out hungry.” The Celtics used a 15-0 spree to pull ahead 96-59 on Walker’s 3-pointer from the left wing that sailed through the net as he was falling to the floor with 6 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. It came a possession after Brown nailed a 3 from directly in front of Cleveland’s bench. From there, both coaches gave ample playing time to their reserves. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Sexton had scored 20 or more points in 15 straight games. ... Andre Drummond had 11 points and five rebounds, his second time this season falling short of a double-double. ... F Kevin Love missed his 13th straight with a strained calf. Celtics: Rookie guard Payton Pritchard was sidelined with a Grade 1 right MCL sprain he sustained in the last game. ... No starter played more than 27 minutes. ... Like they did before the previous two games, the players huddled with their arms around each other during the national anthem. ... Stevens had a one-word answer after when asked if Walker would play Monday in consecutive games: “No.” Walker has been working his way back from a left knee injury that delayed his start to the season. TATUM'S RETURN Jayson Tatum has been cleared to play Monday night against the Chicago Bulls, Stevens said. Tatum missed his fifth straight game Sunday due to COVID-19 protocols. HE LOOKS FAMILIAR Boston C Tristan Thompson spent his first nine seasons with Cleveland before signing as a free agent with the Celtics during the offseason.

"Kawhi Leonard caps a 34-point performance with a two-handed jam to put the game away. (0:41) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 34 points and the Los Angeles Clippers beat Oklahoma City 108-101 on Sunday for their seventh consecutive victory and second straight over the Thunder. Serge Ibaka added 17 points. At 13-4, the Clippers are tied with the Lakers for the best record in the NBA. Leonard's total was one off his season high to go with nine rebounds and eight assists. He had 31 points in LA's 14-point win over the Thunder on Friday night. “On a night when we weren’t making shots, it was a good, tough, grind-out win for us,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “Kawhi had it going so we played through him a lot, especially in the second half. We had to ride him pretty hard just so we could continue to keep the lead.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 23 points against his former team, and George Hill added 22 points. Oklahoma City has lost three in a row and five of six. “It was a huge improvement from the first game,” forward Isaiah Roby said. “We came out with a lot more fight this game.” Hill hit three straight 3-pointers for the Thunder after they trailed by 17 in the fourth. Reggie Jackson turned the ball over and Luguentz Dort fed Gilgeous-Alexander for a dunk that capped 11 consecutive points and cut their deficit to 102-96. Leonard dunked to stop the Thunder's run. Gilgeous-Alexander dribbled inside and scored, getting the Thunder back within six. Oklahoma City was forced to foul in the closing seconds and Jackson made 4 of 6 free throws to close it out. “He did a great job of just getting us the lead,” Jackson said of Leonard. “They were loading up on Kawhi and Paul. They did a great job of attacking.” The Thunder hung around in the third, cutting their deficit to 72-67. But Leonard hit a 3-pointer and another basket, quickly restoring the Clippers' lead to double digits. They were bolstered by Jackson's 10 points, including eight in a row, after he started the second half. “We’re playing team basketball and sharing the ball,” Leonard said. “We're having some breakdowns defensively, but we’re staying positive.” The Thunder fell behind by 17 points in the first half and rallied to close within eight three times in the second quarter. Leonard hit a 3-pointer that sent the Clippers into halftime leading 56-45. TIP-INS Thunder: For the first time in 16 games — all starts — Dort failed to make at least one 3-pointer, missing six attempts. He still leads the team with 34. Mike Muscala extended his own such streak, making 1 of 9, and is second on the team with 27 3s. ... Oklahoma City finished 7 of 35 from long-range and dropped to 1-7 against the West. Clippers: Paul George, who finished with 11 points, sat out the final five minutes because of hamstring tightness. ... Patrick Beverley was limited to 13 minutes because of right knee soreness. ... The bench was 11 of 33 in the game, with Lou Williams missing 8 of 9 shots. ... Marcus Morris sat out because of illness.","401267411"
"The Hornets turn defense into offense as a steal on one end leads to a flush by P.J. Washington. (0:16) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — With the game on the line, the Charlotte Hornets got the ball right where they had worked on in practice a day earlier. Gordon Hayward delivered — just as he did most of Sunday night. Hayward broke a tie by converting a layup with 0.7 seconds left and scored 39 points in Charlotte’s 107-104 comeback victory over the Orlando Magic. Hayward beat Evan Fournier off the dribble and made the left-handed layup after Orlando’s Terrence Ross tied the game at 104 with a 3-pointer with 8.7 seconds to play. “We put him at the top of the floor with 8 seconds to go and he made a play,” Charlotte coach James Borrego said about Hayward, who made 15 of 25 shots and 5 of 8 3-pointers for his fourth 30-point game of the season. “That’s what great players do. He’s been in that situation before, he knew what he was trying to get to and he executed. These are scenarios that we worked on all this week.” Charlotte ended a four-game losing streak, overcoming a 14-point deficit. Down the entire second and third quarters, the Hornets opened the fourth with a 25-4 run — making nine of their first 14 shots. Orlando missed 12 of its first 13 shots in the period. “It’s a resilient win and this is a resilient group,” Borrego said. Miles Bridges added 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting. “When Gordon is firing I guess everybody is firing,” Bridges said. “If he’s going then that gets everybody else into it. And he finds his open teammates, too.” Once 6-2, the Magic lost for an eighth time in the past nine games. Orlando and Charlotte will play again on Monday night. Nikola Vucevic topped 10,000 career points early in the night and scored 22 points in the game. He added 13 rebounds for his 12th double-double of the season. Evan Fournier had 21 points and six assists, while rookie point guard Cole Anthony added 14 points and six assists. “Obviously we have to play the same brand of basketball that we did during the first three quarters and not mess up easy things,” Fournier said. The Magic were without forward Aaron Gordon because of hip and back soreness. Gordon, who had averaged 16 points, 11.7 rebounds and 8.7 assists in his previous three games and had taken on some of the team’s playmaking following the season-ending injury to Markelle Fultz, is the latest blow to a Magic team that has already lost 83 player games to injury. Orlando led by as much as 13 in the first half and by as much as 14 late in the third period, but it had trouble pulling away because of how well Hayward played offensively. Hayward made eight of his first 12 shots, including three 3s, and scored 19 first-half points. “I’m just trying to help us win basketball games,” Hayward said. “I have good teammates who are putting me in position to be successful. It’s been fun playing with this team, I’m excited and happy to be here in Charlotte.” TIP INS Hornets: Not only do Charlotte and Orlando know each other well from playing four times a season, but there is also plenty of crossover on the coaching staffs. Charlotte coach James Borrego was a Magic assistant from 2012-15 and he was 10-20 as the franchise’s interim coach at the end of the 2014-15 NBA season. Magic head coach Steve Clifford and most of his staff led the Hornets from 2013-18 prior to arriving in Orlando. Magic: Magic coach Steve Clifford is six-for-six in Coach’s Challenge instances this season. … Orlando tied a season high with 17 3-pointers. Who are the free agents for the next two years? We have the lists. Center Andre Drummond is now a free agent and can sign with a contending team after reaching a buyout with the Cavaliers.","401267412"
"Rudy Gay flies in for the tip-in, but many Wizards call for basket interference, including Russell Westbrook. (1:01) SAN ANTONIO -- — Washington struggled offensively and suffered some communication breakdowns defensively in crucial situations, but Wizards coach Scott Brooks could forgive those lapses. After being unable to play for two weeks, Brooks and the Wizards were simply happy to be back on the court. Patty Mills scored 21 points, Lonnie Walker IV added 16 and the San Antonio Spurs used their depth to beat Washington 121-101 on Sunday night in the Wizards’ first game since Jan. 11. “This whole season for us has been weird,” Brooks said. “Definitely, I don’t think I will ever go through anything like this again. It all happened after one game after another. We can’t keep dwelling on it, we have to put it behind us. We got the first game in. I’m glad we did that.” The Wizards had their previous six games postponed because they did not have enough eligible players due to the league’s COVID-19 protocols. Washington was playing for the first time since beating the visiting Phoenix Suns 128-107. Brooks said the Wizards only began practicing within the last three days and had to use video monitors on the bench to show their offensive sets to recently signed players like Alex Len. The Wizards still had six players ineligible against the Spurs, including Rui Hachimura. Washington faded down the stretch as Brooks primarily used an eight-man rotation. “It’s not normal,” said Bradley Beal, who led Washington with 31 points. “I just got done getting tested after the game, so it’s not normal. We are doing a lot of things on the fly. It’s just the next-man-up mentality.” The Spurs used a balanced attack to take advantage of the Wizards’ lack of activity. San Antonio had 27 assists and finished with a 20-3 advantage in fast-break points. “Sharing the ball, competing, following the game plan and trying to take advantage,” Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray said. Murray, who missed the second half of Friday’s loss to the Dallas Mavericks with a sprained left ankle, had 11 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his second career triple-double. LaMarcus Aldridge added 15 points, Devin Vassell had 14 points and Keldon Johnson 13 for San Antonio. Jerome Robinson scored 16 points for Washington. Russell Westbrook had nine points, eight rebounds and six assists in 25 minutes. “I think all of our guys are going to have to get back in NBA rhythm,” Brooks said. “It’s been totally taken away from us.” TIP-INS Wizards: Hachimura, Deni Avdija, Davis Bertans, Troy Brown Jr., Ish Smith and Moe Wagner all missed the game due to the league’s health and safety protocols. ... Choosing not to reveal any names, Brooks said several players have begun working out and should return soon. “They probably will not come on this road trip, but will be back soon,” he said. ... Point guard Cassius Winston was still wearing his medical mask upon entering the game for Westbrook in the first quarter. Someone from the bench yelled at Winston, who apparently forgot he had his mask on. He quickly took it off and tossed it toward the bench. Spurs: Vassell is the first Spurs rookie with four or more 3-pointers in a game since Gary Neal in 2011. Vassell is also the sixth Spurs player with at least four 3-pointers in a game this season. Mills heads the list with four such games, followed by Walker with two. Vassell, Johnson, Aldridge and Rudy Gay each have one. ... Murray collected his 1,000th career rebound in 202 games with the Spurs. He has 21 games with 10-plus rebounds in four seasons.","401267413"
"De'Andre Hunter winds up for a dunk, but Giannis Antetokounmpo sends it flying. (0:18) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 14 rebounds and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Atlanta Hawks 129-115 on Sunday night to snap a two-game losing streak. Antetokounmpo had eight assists, finishing two shy of a triple-double. Bobby Portis added 21 points, and Khris Middleton had 19 for Milwaukee. De'Andre Hunter led Atlanta with a career-high 33 points. John Collins had 30 points, but the short-handed Hawks saw their three-game winning streak end. The Hawks were without two key starters, leading scorer Trae Young (back spasms) and center Clint Capela (sore right hand). Rajon Rondo replaced Young in the starting lineup. Rookie center Onyeka Okongwu made his first career start. Atlanta's lineup changes, announced during pregame warmups, were jolting for both teams. “We actually did our walkthrough for Atlanta yesterday,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We spent a lot of time on Trae Young. He’s one of the elite young players in the league, but you have to adjust.” Hunter and Collins attempted to fill the scoring void left by Young's absence. Collins sank six of nine 3-pointers. Hunter made 13 of 21 shots from the field. “He was just trying to get us going,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said about Hunter. “You see the ball go in and you get the feel a little bit and we needed every bit of it.” The Hawks missed Capela's defense and rebounds. The Bucks outscored the Hawks in the paint 60-30 and had a 51-38 advantage in rebounds. Pierce called a timeout after Milwaukee took a 9-2 lead. The substitution of Solomon Hill for Okongwu didn't help as the Bucks quickly extended the lead to 10 points at 16-6. Milwaukee's lead was 24 points at 58-36 in the second quarter. The Hawks narrowed the deficit in the third period. Okongwu's block of a shot by Bobby Portis set up Hunter's apparent 46-foot 3-pointer as the buzzer sounded to end the third period. Following a lengthy review, officials ruled the shot came after time expired, leaving the Bucks with a 94-83 lead entering the fourth quarter. “I think in the third our intensity was pretty low,” said Jrue Holiday, who had 15 points. “I feel like if we had come out in the third and just threw a haymaker at them, the game would have been different and we could have been up by 30.” TIP-INS Hawks: Danilo Gallinari had 17 points. ... Young had a heating pad strapped to his back as he watched from the Hawks bench. ... Okongwu had four points in his starting debut, which came after only three appearances as a reserve. ... Rondo had seven points and six assists. ... Capela was coming off his first career triple-double, including a career-high 10 blocks, Friday night in a victory over Minnesota. Bucks: Budenholzer wasn’t happy to see the Bucks allow the Hawks to top 30 points in each of the final three periods. “We need to be a lot better defensively,” Budenholzer said. BACK ON TRACK Milwaukee rebounded following consecutive losses to the Nets and Lakers. “It was good to get that feel back, that feel of winning,” Holiday said. “We had a tough couple of games.” CRAIG RETURNS Bucks forward Torrey Craig wore a clear facemask in his return after missing nine games with a fractured nose suffered on Dec. 27 at the New York Knicks. He had four points in 13 minutes. “It was just good for him to get some minutes ... just start to find his way in a game setting,” Budenholzer said. “Certainly he’s somebody that we really value.”","401267414"
"Damian Lillard shows off his dribbling skills and sinks a 3-pointer for the Trail Blazers vs. the Knicks. (0:18) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Damian Lillard had 39 points, including six 3-pointers, and the rested Portland Trail Blazers jumped out early against the New York Knicks on the way to a 116-113 victory on Sunday night. Anfernee Simons added 16 points off the bench for the Blazers, who led by as many as 25 points before seeing their advantage slip away in the final quarter. Rookie Immanuel Quickley scored 31 points off the bench and Julius Randle added 25 for the Knicks. Quickley's 3 pointer got the Knicks within 96-91 with 7:13 left. But Robert Covington's layup and Lillard's 3-pointer put Portland up 101-91. Randle's layup narrowed it to 106-98 with 2:39 to go. Quickley hit three free throws to make it 106-102 with 1:33 left. After Mitchell Robinson's dunk with 19 seconds left, former Knick Carmelo Anthony made a pair of free throws to extend Portland's lead to 112-106. Quickley dished to Robinson for an alley-oop dunk to narrow New York's deficit to 114-111 with 10 seconds left, but in the end, the Knicks couldn't catch up. “If you watch the games around the league, it happens every night,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said about watching the lead dwindle. “There are teams every night that are up 20 points, 15 points and the lead evaporates in some way. As a coach you don't want it to happen, obviously, but the biggest thing is managing it when it does happen.” The Blazers (9-6) were still adjusting to the loss of guard CJ McCollum with a hairline fracture in his left foot. Rodney Hood started in McCollum's place for the second game. Portland was also without big man Jusuf Nurkic because of a right wrist fracture. Despite being short-handed, the Blazers were well-rested after a pair of scheduled games last week against Memphis were postponed because of coronavirus protocol and contact tracing among the Grizzlies. “It was the kind of game we needed to play, especially with CJ and Nurk being out,” Lillard said. “That second group, they came out and they were sharp, they were making shots, the ball was moving. We were active in our zone. It was the way we needed to play.” Portland's last game was a 125-104 loss to the San Antonio Spurs last Monday. The Knicks (8-10) were without Reggie Bullock because of a sore neck. Frank Ntilikina, who has been out since Dec. 29 because of a sprained right knee, was available but did not play. Austin Rivers returned after missing two games with a sore right Achilles. Lillard was hot at the start, scoring 10 points as the Blazers built an early 19-11 lead. Portland was up 37-24 after the opening quarter. Portland led by as many as 22 points in the first half, going into the break with a 70-50 advantage. Lillard led all scorers with 18 points and was 3 for 3 from 3-point range — passing Chauncy Billups for 16th on the all-time list for made 3s. The Knicks rallied in the third quarter, pulling within 82-69 on RJ Barrett's layup. They outscored Portland 27-19 and went into the final period trailing 89-77. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said Lillard was a challenge. “He's seen just about every type of defense and he doesn't stop moving. If you get it out of his hands he'll fly back to it,” Thibodeau said. “He's a terrific player.” TIP INS Knicks: It was the third of a four-game trip. ... The Knicks went into the game with the league's second-best defensive rating. ... New York was coming off a 103-94 loss at Sacramento on Friday. ... Randle fouled out with 16.6 seconds left. Trail Blazers: Lillard was 11-for-11 from the free thrown line. He has broken his own franchise record (64) for consecutive free throws made. He now has 66. DADDY DAME: Lillard announced on Instagram that he and his fiancee welcomed twins on Thursday. He wrote “Just call me Daddy Dame from now on.” The couple already has a toddler, Damian Jr. “Obviously I've had Dame Jr. almost three years now, and I think, well I don't think, I know that the thing I enjoy the most is being his dad and going home to him every night and being around him every day. That's something that I think has allowed me to be a better player, because I don't take wins and losses home.”","401267416"
"After being T'd up for a foul on Ben Simmons, Josh Jackson throws the ball to the ref in frustration and is ejected as he's assessed another technical foul. (1:37) DETROIT -- — Delon Wright scored a career-high 28 points and Wayne Ellington had another impressive shooting night for Detroit, leading the Pistons to a 119-104 victory over the Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia 76ers on Monday. Jerami Grant scored 25 points for the Pistons (4-13), who still have the NBA's worst record but took advantage of Joel Embiid's absence. The Philadelphia star was out with back tightness. Detroit acquitted itself well in this two-game mini-series with the 76ers. Philadelphia needed a big game from Embiid to prevail 114-110 on Saturday night. The Pistons never trailed in the rematch. Ellington scored 20 points, shooting 6 of 9 from 3-point range. It was his fifth straight game with at least four 3s, tying a team record set by Joe Dumars in 1998-99. “I had Ray Allen and Dirk Nowitzki and some guys like that,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""He’s right in that class as far as a shooter’s concerned.” Ellington is 30 of 50 from beyond the arc in his last six games. “We’re going to keep giving him the ball,"" Wright said. ""He’s a great shooter. He helps our offense flow.” Tobias Harris led Philadelphia with 25 points, but the 76ers (12-6) never made much of a run after the Pistons controlled the early going. Detroit's Josh Jackson was ejected in the fourth quarter, but Philadelphia couldn't take advantage. Sixers coach Doc Rivers wasn't panicking about the loss. “We didn't play well tonight. This was a very winnable game in my opinion, we just didn't win the game,” Rivers said. “I'm not going to overdo it right now. Way too early. ... I like our team. I like how we're playing overall."" There were five technical fouls in the game. Detroit took an early 17-4 lead and was still ahead 64-50 at halftime. The third quarter came and went without the lead getting any tighter than seven, and it was never closer than nine in the fourth. ""We want to make this our normal thing,"" Wright said. ""We don’t want to celebrate a win. We want to continue to get wins and build on it.” TIP-INS 76ers: Rivers and C Dwight Howard received technical fouls in the second quarter. Pistons: Derrick Rose (left knee) missed the game. ... Detroit came in averaging a league-high 44.1 bench points per game. The Pistons had only 29 on Monday. MISSED CHANCE Jackson and the Philadelphia bench were both called for technicals with 8:06 remaining in the fourth — the 76ers' technical was announced at the arena as being on Mike Scott, who wasn't even active for the game. Then, 33 seconds later, Jackson was called for an offensive foul and a second technical, meaning he was ejected. The foul was ruled a flagrant, so after all that, Philadelphia had three free throws and the ball. Ben Simmons missed two of the free throws and Harris missed the other, leaving the 76ers still down 99-85.","401267417"
"Late in the fourth quarter, Myles Turner blocks Norman Powell's shot.  A little later on, he gets the ball and finishes with a dunk. (0:26) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon spent Sunday night searching for answers. By Monday night, he had found them. A little more than 24 hours after playing his poorest game of the season, Brogdon scored a career-high 36 points, flirted with a triple-double and accounted for the final seven points as the Pacers pulled away from Toronto 129-114. ”I was on the phone with coach (Nate Bjorkgren) late last night, trying to figure out how to make adjustments. I was really angry after last night's game,” Brogdon said. “I was incredibly locked in today. We both love the game, we both think about the game all the time and we both hate losing. It drove me crazy until we were able to get back on the court tonight."" The difference showed. Brogdon didn't just score, he found open teammates, played defense and helped spur the decisive fourth-quarter flurry. He finished with nine assists and seven rebounds, Jeremy Lamb matched his season high with 22 points and Myles Turner scored 11 of his 21 points over the final 8 1/2 minutes when the Pacers finally put it away. And they did all that despite missing All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis for the final three quarters. He left with a bruised knee in the first half. Sabonis didn’t return. But with Brogdon leading the charge, Sabonis' absence didn't matter. “I thought he came out with a focus,"" Bjorkgren said. “He was in attack mode the entire evening.” Toronto was led by Fred VanVleet's 25 points and six rebounds. Norman Powell scored 24 points as the Raptors rallied from a 70-60 halftime deficit to finally reclaim a 102-100 lead on Kyle Lowry's go-ahead dunk with 9:46 left in the game. It didn't last long. Goga Bitadze tied the score, Turner broke the tie by making 1 of 2 free throws and then fueled the decisive 12-4 run with his late scoring flurry. Indiana went 14 of 17 from the free-throw line in the fourth quarter and wound up with its highest free-throw attempt total (45) in nearly a decade. “It was hard to play anything (defensively),"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “All we did was a parade to the free-throw line. You can’t play defense when every time they touch the ball it’s a foul."" TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry scored 12 points. He needs two more to join DeMar DeRozan and Chris Bosh as the only players in franchise history to score 10,000. ... VanVleet made three more 3-pointers to extend his franchise-record to 49 consecutive games with a 3. .... OG Anunoby had 10 points and reached double figures for a career-best ninth consecutive game. ... All-Star Pascal Siakam missed his second straight game with swelling in his left knee. Nurse said he would be examined when the team returns home Tuesday. Pacers: Turner also had 10 rebounds and three blocks despite playing with a fractured right hand. ... Bitadze and Aaron Holiday each scored 10 points. ... Lamb added seven rebounds. ... Bjorkgren, who spent the previous two years on Nurse's staff, got his first NBA win against his former mentor. Bjorkgren's head-to-head record against Nurse is 4-5 including seven matchups in the G League. DOUBLE TROUBLE Sabonis' franchise-record streak of 16 consecutive double-doubles to open the season ended unceremoniously after he had 11 points, three rebounds and two assists in the first 11 minutes. The All-Star is one of just six players since the ABA-NBA merger to start the season with 15 straight double-doubles. Bjorkgren said the injury occurred when Sabonis and Lowry banged knees and that Sabonis would be examined again Tuesday. QUICK EXIT When Lowry was called for a technical foul and subsequently ejected with 47 seconds left to play, he didn't stick around long.

(0:27) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Orlando Magic rookie point guard Cole Anthony is getting more comfortable the more he plays in the NBA. Anthony’s comfort level showed Monday night when he posted a career-best scoring performance and outplayed fellow rookie guard LaMelo Ball. Anthony scored a career-best 21 points and got plenty of help from center Nikola Vucevic’s 13th double-double of the season as the Magic defeated the Charlotte Hornets 117-108 to snap a two-game slide. “We keep playing like that we can be a pretty good team,” said Anthony, who made 8 of 12 shots and 4 of 5 3-pointers. “Every single time I step out there, I feel like I’m getting more comfortable playing with every dude on the team. … I’m just going to keep getting more comfortable, but I’ve got a long way to go.” Orlando wasted a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter a night earlier in a loss to the Hornets. On Monday, Orlando led by as many as 20 points in the third quarter and took an 11-point lead into the fourth before Charlotte made a charge and got within seven — but no closer. Vucevic scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. “Our shotmaking was great tonight and we made a bunch of 3s, which always helps,” said Vucevic, who made 4 of 7 3-point shots. “We were able to hold on at the end."" Orlando made a season-best 19 3-pointers, including seven in the third quarter. Evan Fournier hit five 3's and scored 19 points. Aaron Gordon, who missed Sunday’s loss with hip and back soreness, returned Monday and finished with 12 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. Anthony, the No. 15 pick in the November NBA draft, scored 10 points and made two 3-pointers in a third period that saw Orlando surge ahead by as many as 20. Ball, the No. 3 pick, finished the game with nine points and four assists, but missed all five of his 3-point shots. Gordon Hayward, the hero of Charlotte’s 107-104 win a night earlier with his 39 points and a game-winning layup, finished with 24 points, as did Terry Rozier. Devonte Graham had 21 for Charlotte, which lost to the Magic for the fifth time in six meetings. The Hornets made just 11 of 38 3-point shots and were outscored 68-46 in the middle two quarters. “We had good momentum going into halftime and for whatever reason we came out flat in the third quarter,” Charlotte coach James Borrego said. HISTORY MADE For the first time in NBA history, two female officials — Natalie Sago and Jenna Schroeder — worked the same game. Schroeder and Sago worked with veteran official Sean Wright on Monday. The only controversy of the night involving the referees came with 1:46 to play when Anthony was called for a blocking foul and Magic coach Steve Clifford challenged the call. The challenge was unsuccessful — a first in seven tries this season by Clifford. TIP-INS Hornets: Borrego said he will continue to evaluate his center rotation now that Cody Zeller is back after missing four games with a broken bone in his hand. Bismack Biyombo started his 16th game on Monday, while Zeller made one start. … Hayward’s last-second layup a night earlier was the sixth game-winner of his career in the final five seconds. Magic: Clifford admitted that he is worried about the extended minutes his players are seeing because of injuries and the compacted schedule, stressing, “We’re in unchartered waters. This is Year 21 (in the NBA) for me and I’ve never been involved in a schedule like this. Their bodies can only take so much sometimes.” … The Magic unveiled plans for the AdventHealth Training Center, a 130,000-square-foot facility that will include two practice courts, training and recovery facilities, physical therapy and hydrotherapy capability, sports science and nutrition facilities, as well as state-of-the-art audio-video and imaging technology.","401267419"
"After being denied the opportunity in their previous matchup, Kyrie Irving and Bam Adebayo take full advantage of the opportunity to do a quick jersey exchange after the end of their game. (0:18) NEW YORK -- — Kevin Durant wasn’t making shots. James Harden was barely taking them. That sent the Brooklyn Nets into a defensive struggle, and the NBA’s highest-scoring team handled it well until their superstars showed up. Harden and Durant each scored 20 points despite three relatively quiet quarters, and the Nets broke away with a big run in the fourth to beat the Miami Heat 98-85 on Monday night. Kyrie Irving added 16 points for the Nets, who completed a sweep of the Heat in two games that couldn't have been more different. Brooklyn won 128-124 on Saturday, then took the rematch despite barely topping its lowest-scoring game of the season. “I think our defense held tight the whole game,” Durant said. “Once we were able to start making some shots there in the fourth, we were able to pull away. But our defense won us this game for sure.” Harden had only 10 points and five shots through three, then scored 10 more in the 18-2 spurt that turned a tie game into a 96-80 lead. The NBA's assists leader finished with eight, but struggled to search for his own shot until changing his mentality in the fourth. “Just being aggressive,” he said. “I think I wasn’t very aggressive throughout the course of the game.” Durant shot just 4 for 17 through three, then hit two 3-pointers in the fourth, the latter snapping a 78-all tie and igniting the big run. Bam Adebayo had 26 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a strong follow-up to his career-high 41 points Saturday. But outside of Goran Dragic's 21 points, there was little else for a short-handed Heat team that is without Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley because of health and safety protocols. Tyler Herro, Meyers Leonard and Maurice Harkless are injured. But it looked for a while as though they could pull it out anyway, shutting down a team that came in averaging 120.3 points per game until midway through the final period. “Their talent just took over at the end,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I love the way our guys competed.” The Nets were 4 for 21 (19%) in the first quarter, missing all 10 3-pointers in their lowest-scoring period of the season, which ended with Miami leading 21-15. The second quarter was slightly easier on the eyes — and rims. Miami took a 45-41 edge into halftime, going just 4 for 19 on 3s but doubling the Nets' makes after they went 2 for 17. TIP-INS Heat: Adebayo beat the buzzer to end the third quarter with a 3-pointer that gave Miami a 71-70 lead. He also made a 3 as time expired to end the first half Saturday, followed by a long jumper in the final second of the third quarter. ... Duncan Robinson was 1 for 10, all from 3-point range. Nets: Durant missed his first six 3-point attempts before sinking one in the third quarter. He finished 3 for 12 behind the arc and has scored 20 points in every game this season. ... The Nets have won five straight at home. KYRIE AND KOBE Irving arrived at the arena wearing a No. 8 Kobe Bryant Lakers jersey. In a video posted by the Nets, he pulled his jacket open for a full view of the jersey, saying: “You know who I was rocking tonight. Come on, it’s obvious.” The Nets were scheduled to play at the Knicks last Jan. 26, hours after the helicopter crash that killed Bryant. Irving left the arena, too distraught to play following the death of his friend. HARDEN'S ADJUSTMENTS Harden had just two baskets, both in the fourth quarter, during Saturday's game. He then took only two shots in the first half Monday in another passive performance. But coach Steve Nash said before the game he wasn't worried about the three-time scoring champion as he adjusts to his new team. “Would I like James to be more aggressive? Yes. Will he be more aggressive in time? I think so,” Nash said. “I think once he gets more comfortable with his teammates, when he gets in better shape, when he’s adapted to this whole new environment, we’ll see an improved James scoring the ball.""","401267420"
"LeBron James responds to whomever it was chirping at him after a missed shot at the end of third quarter. (0:43) CLEVELAND -- — Back home, LeBron James kept the Lakers perfect on the road. James went on a scoring tear in the fourth quarter, getting 21 of his 46 points with a variety of dazzling shots and plays only he seems to make, leading Los Angeles to a 115-108 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. James' first game in Ohio in more than two years couldn't have gone much better. “Home cooking,” said James, who got a meal made by his mom, Gloria. “It felt good to be back in my haven.” Anthony Davis added 17 points as the defending NBA champions improved to 10-0 away from home. The win for Los Angeles came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant's tragic death in a helicopter crash. James' outburst in the fourth was reminiscent of something Bryant might do as well, and it was fueled by him wanting to shut up a member of Cleveland's front office group sitting in the socially-distanced front row across from the Cavs' bench. When James was short with a 3-pointer at the end of the third quarter, the unidentified Cavs executive celebrated. “I felt he was a little too excited about seeing me miss,” James said playfully. “I knew I had another quarter and the fourth quarter is my favorite. It's a good thing for him I only come here once.” Over the final 12 minutes, James made 9 of 10 shots, posing to hold his form after draining a 34-foot 3-pointer just before the 24-second clock expired to put the Lakers ahead 103-98. James followed that with a step-back 3 and then drained a fadeaway turn-around jumper in the corner before shaking his head at Cleveland' bench. “When he's playing like that, it's fun to watch,” Davis said. “When he had what 19, 17 in the first? It’s over. ... He wasn't missing. He was everywhere on the floor.” Andre Drummond scored 25 and added 17 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who were blown out by 38 on Sunday in Boston. Cedi Osman added 20 points and Collin Sexton 17 for the Cavs. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said before the game that he wanted his team to “scrap” and that's exactly what the Cavs did — until James took over the way he did in Cleveland for 11 seasons. “When a guy is doing what he did, he's hard to deal with,” Bickerstaff said. “We've all seen that.” While still a homecoming for James, this one felt very different. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, there were only 2,000 fans inside 18,000-plus-seat Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, which was known as Quicken Loans Arena when James led the Cavs to the 2016 NBA championship and ended a 52-year title drought in Cleveland. The sparse crowd welcomed him warmly and the building was dotted with plenty of fans wearing James' purple-and-gold LA jersey. It was only James' second trip back to Cleveland since he left the Cavs for the second time as a free agent after the 2018 season. Last year's game was cancelled by the pandemic. After dusting off his pregame chalk toss, a ritual he started with the Cavs and only breaks out these days for special occasions, James dropped four 3-pointers and scored 17 in the first quarter. HONORING KOBE On Tuesday, the Lakers' family will have painful memories awakened by the loss of Bryant, whose passing shook their organization, the NBA and sports world. The 41-year-old Bryant died while traveling with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, from one of her basketball games. Knowing that Bryant's anniversary will be emotional for everyone, Lakers coach Frank Vogel is giving his players the day off to allow them to better manage their grief and honor their late teammate Bryant “how they see fit.” “It's not a day remembrance like his birthday,” Vogel said. “It's more of a somber-tone-type-of-day.” The Lakers are spending the night in Cleveland before flying to Philadelphia — Bryant's hometown — on Tuesday. They play the 76ers on Wednesday. OLD FRIEND Bickerstaff first met Bryant at a summer camp while they were in high school. When Bickerstaff walked onto the court, he noticed none of his teammates had matched up defensively against Bryant, so he said, “I’ll take him.” Bickerstaff claimed he held his own that day and his admiration for Bryant grew in the years to come. “He changed the game for the next generation,” Bickerstaff said. “His will to win was second to none. His commitment to his craft was second to none.” TIP-INS Lakers: C Marc Gasol picked up three fouls in the first 3:02. ... James will one day have his No. 23 jersey retired in Cleveland — and Miami and Los Angeles. He's the Cavs' career leader in games played, points, rebounds, assists, steals, 3-pointers made, free throws and more. Cavaliers: The Cavs were missing forward Larry Nance Jr., who sprained his right wrist against the Celtics. Nance leads the league with 2.3 steals per game. ... F Kevin Love (calf) and G Matthew Dellavedova (concussion) are the only players left on Cleveland's roster from the '16 title team with James and both missed the game with injuries.","401267421"
"After missing five games due to the NBA's health and safety protocols, Jayson Tatum returns and drops 24 points in the Celtics' win over the Bulls. (1:40) CHICAGO -- — The toughest part of having COVID-19 for Jayson Tatum wasn't the headache, the high temperature and chills he experienced. Those symptoms went away after the first night. Most difficult was the mental toll. “It was tough, especially your initial reaction once you find out,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s panic. But you definitely worry because of everything you read about it and hear, how many people it’s affected and how many people didn’t make it."" Tatum scored 24 points after missing five games, Jaylen Brown had 26 and the Boston Celtics beat the Chicago Bulls 119-103 on Monday night. “The first four days or so, for lack of a better word, it bothered me,"" Tatum said. “It was on my mind. I was thinking, do I feel OK, do I not feel OK? Can I smell this? Does my chest hurt? Or am I just overthinking?” Tatum said he felt a bit tired in the first half. But he got a second wind. He made three 3-pointers and had five assists over 31 minutes in his first appearance since Jan. 8. Brown had another solid game following his 33-point outing in Sunday’s romp over Cleveland. Daniel Theis scored 19 points and Marcus Smart added 13 while tying a career high with 11 assists as the Celtics won their second straight. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 30 points and shot 6 of 10 on 3s. But he also committed six turnovers, giving him 13 in the past two games. Lauri Markkanen scored 18. Thaddeus Young just missed a triple-double with 16 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, but the Bulls dropped their second in a row after three consecutive wins. “They're all going to need to learn how to win,"" coach Billy Donovan said. “I wish I could snap my finger or pour something on it to make it just happen. But it doesn't work that way. Unfortunately, before you win, there's generally a lot of suffering.” TAKING CONTROL Smart scored 13 and Brown and Tatum added 11 points each as the Celtics grabbed a 60-50 halftime lead. Theis' alley-oop dunk and layup in the final 30 seconds sent Boston to the locker room up by 10 and set off an 18-2 run. Brown scored seven as the Celtics reeled off the first 11 points in the third quarter. Tatum answered a hook shot by Young with a 3-pointer to make it 74-52, and the Celtics withstood a few pushes by Chicago to come away with the win. TIP-INS Celtics: G Kemba Walker was held out.

"Steph Curry's 3-point attempt bounces off the rim, but James Wiseman rises up for the putback dunk. (0:22) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Sure, Andrew Wiggins had a little extra juice for this one. Stephen Curry scored 36 points with seven 3-pointers, Wiggins took it to his old Timberwolves team for 23 points, and the Golden State Warriors beat Minnesota 130-108 on Monday night after coach Steve Kerr shook up his starting five. Facing the Timberwolves for the first time since his trade last February, Wiggins showed a steadiness that was missing at times when he played in Minneapolis. He drove the lane for pull-up jumpers, dunked, hit from long range, made three steals, blocked three shots and grabbed all six of his rebounds on the offensive glass. “It's all good playing against my former team. They still have some guys left, so it was good to see them, catch up and compete,"" Wiggins said. “It's all love for those guys. It's part of the business.” Curry shot 11 for 21 overall and 7 of 12 from deep as the Warriors avoided their first three-game losing streak of the season. “Thankfully we made some timely shots to open up the game and built up momentum,” Curry said. Malik Beasley scored 30 points with four 3s to lead Minnesota, which fell behind early with poor shooting and failed to gain any momentum from snapping a four-game losing streak Saturday. Curry has 2,569 career 3-pointers after he passed Reggie Miller for second place in NBA history in Saturday's road loss to the Jazz. Ray Allen is first with 2,973. Miller offered a congratulatory message on the big screen Monday during a first-quarter timeout. Golden State delivered a far better start after falling behind 14-0 to the Jazz and trailing by as many as 40 in the 127-108 defeat at Utah. “They played like a team that had just come off a tough loss,” Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. “That’s a team with a championship pedigree and championship standards. You know they were going to have that. They really forced us into a couple tough stretches, early in the game and late in the game.” D'Angelo Russell was held out in what would have been his first matchup against his former Warriors team because of a bruised right quadriceps muscle. Russell played 33 games for Golden State last season before the trade that brought Wiggins to the Bay Area. “Well, last year was a complete mess for our team and our organization with all the injuries. We were fortunate to be able to sign D'Angelo,"" Kerr said. “D'Angelo was a really productive player for us. He shot the lights out, had some big games."" NEW LINEUP Kerr mixed it up by starting Kevon Looney at center instead of rookie James Wiseman to improve the defense with a more veteran unit. “We got off to a really good start and that’s what I was hoping for,” Kerr said. Kerr spoke to Wiseman earlier in the day, and the No. 2 overall draft pick handled it well. He will slide into Looney's role coming in midway through the first and third quarters. “He understands it’s not a demotion by any means, it’s simply a part of his development,"" Kerr said. Wiseman dunked on a putback off a missed 3 by Curry midway through the third. “I look at it as a learning experience,” Wiseman said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jarred Vanderbilt took a hit to the eye when fouled by Draymond Green at the 5:34 mark of the third, then Green got hit with a technical. ... Minnesota hasn't won on the Warriors' home floor since a 124-117 overtime victory on April 5, 2016. ... Ricky Rubio shot just 1 for 8 but dished out 11 assists. ...

The Timberwolves are 2-10 without Towns in the lineup this season — one of those wins a 120-110 home victory Saturday night against the Pelicans. Warriors: Golden State totaled 45 bench points, with everybody but rookie Nico Mannion scoring. The plan is for second-round pick Mannion to go to Orlando for the G League bubble along with Jordan Poole and Alen Smailagic, who is getting close to being able to practice as he works back from surgery for a meniscus tear in his right knee. “It's something I think could be very productive for all of them,” Kerr said.","401267426"
"The Thunder withstand the scoring of Damian Lillard and the Trail Blazers to pull out a 125-122 win on the road. (2:14) PORTLAND Ore. -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points, Mike Muscala added 23, and the Oklahoma City Thunder snapped a three-game losing streak with a 125-122 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. Damian Lillard, who had scored 30 or more points in his last three games, had 26 points and 10 assists for the Blazers. Anfernee Simons had 26 points off the bench and Enes Kanter added 13 points and 22 rebounds. After Portland pulled close in the third quarter, Hamidou Diallo's floater from out front put the Thunder up 105-98 with just over eight minutes left in the game. Diallo's layup extended Oklahoma City's lead to 111-100. Carmelo Anthony's 3-pointer got Portland within 117-111 with 3:25 left, but Darius Bazley answered with a 3 for the Thunder. Lillard hit a 3-pointer with 5.5 seconds left to get Portland within 123-120, then made another 3 to narrow it to 124-122 with 1.5 seconds left, but the rally fell short. “I think for most of the game we brought good energy, everybody. And we stuck to it,” said Muscala, who finished with a career-high six 3-pointers. “I think in the third quarter we came out a little bit flat but we did show that we really played together on both sides of the ball.” Both teams were playing the second of back-to-backs. The Thunder fell 108-100 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday, while the Trail Blazers downed the New York Knicks 116-113. The Thunder continue to miss Al Horford, who has been out since the birth of his daughter on Jan. 15. The team was also without George Hill, who sprained his right thumb and is day-to-day. Theo Maledon started in Hill's place. Portland was without Robert Covington because of a concussion. The Blazers were already missing starters CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic because of injuries. “Top to bottom I thought our energy, our competitiveness, our pace and the thrust we played with was sustained throughout the game,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “Everyone who touched the court tonight brought that type of edge.” Luguentz Dort's driving layup put the Thunder up 32-15 in the opening quarter. The Blazers responded with a 17-2 run to pull within 34-32 after Simons' floater. Muscala's 3-pointer stretched Oklahoma City's lead to 55-43 midway through the second quarter. Trent made a 3-pointer at the buzzer to pull Portland within 69-60 at the break. Lillard opened the second half with a 3-pointer before Trent's 3 tied the game at 72, but the Blazers could not pull in front. The Thunder led 94-91 going into the final quarter. Anthony's jumper briefly gave the Blazers a 95-94 lead, but it was short-lived. “Our attention to detail was poor,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “Our first-half defense was pathetic, there's no excuse for that.” TIP INS Thunder: It was the fourth of a five-game trip. .... It was the first of three games between the Thunder and the Blazers. Last season, the teams split 2-2. ... Muscala's 3-pointer early in the game was the 300th of his career.

Lillard hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer that won the game and clinched the series over Oklahoma City in five games. Photos of the new shoe — which features Thunder colors — were revealed on social media ahead on Monday night's game. Lillard hinted he wasn't trolling Oklahoma City and that Adidas was creating shoes to recognize all its players that have 50-point games. “I think I’ve had other games to choose from,” he said. “I’m ready to let that moment go, so that’s why I think I would have liked it to be a different game, because I don’t want it to come off as I’m just living in the moment from two years ago.

(0:23) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 38 points and the Atlanta Hawks beat the depleted Los Angeles Clippers 108-99 on Tuesday night, ending the Clippers’ seven-game winning streak. The Clippers were without three starters. Leading scorers Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were ruled out due to health and safety protocols. Guard Patrick Beverley missed the game with right knee soreness. “It’s tough. It’s just how this year is going to go,” said Los Angeles center Ivica Zubac, who noted the Clippers had not been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic before this week. “We were lucky to have everyone so far, but it is what it is,"" Zubac said. ""We’ve got to adjust. It’s going to be this type of season for everyone and we’re not the exception.” Reggie Jackson led the Clippers with 20 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. Serge Ibaka had 15 points. De’Andre Hunter had 22 points for Atlanta. Clint Capela collected 13 points and 19 rebounds. Three free throws by Young gave the Hawks a 95-85 lead. Jackson’s three-point play trimmed the advantage to 101-96, but Kevin Huerter answered with his third 3-pointer of the fourth period. Ibaka had 13 first-half points to help the Clippers to a 48-43 lead at the break. Young’s 14 points in the third quarter sparked the Hawks’ second-half surge. “I think we just upped our intensity and just played a little bit harder,” Young said. “For us, coming into the game we weren’t necessarily locked in from the beginning. ... We just need to do a better job of attacking the first half the same way we do the second.” Teams are not allowed to reveal if players in the health and safety protocol have tested positive for COVID-19. Contact tracing and inconclusive test results also could place players in the protocol.

"John Wall and Russell Westbrook give their sides as to what happened when they were issued a double technical foul in their game Tuesday. (0:56) HOUSTON -- — On a minutes restriction because of a sore knee, Houston's John Wall had to wait until the seven-minute mark of the fourth quarter to re-enter Tuesday night's game against his former team. When he finally checked in, it didn't take long for him to put a punctuation mark on a solid performance by the Rockets. Wall scored 24 points to help Houston to a 107-88 victory over Russell Westbrook and the Washington Wizards. Wall had 15 points and four assists by halftime, including a left-handed layup that came after a nifty behind the back move and put Houston up 53-45 in the second quarter. He cooled off in the third, but got going again in the fourth to secure the win in his second game back after missing five with a sore left knee. Houston was leading by six when Wall re-entered the game. He scored five quick points before finding Victor Oladipo in the corner near the Washington bench for a 3-pointer to make it 93-79. “I was itching to get back in in the fourth quarter,"" he said. “I wanted to play, especially against my old team. And we kind of separated ourselves right there."" Wall was selected by Washington with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 draft and spent his entire career with the Wizards before he was traded to Houston in December for Westbrook and a future first-round pick. He insisted he didn't think he had anything to prove against the Wizards. But he did admit that he's having a great time with his new team after a rocky ending to his tenure in Washington. “I haven’t played in two years so this is fun,"" he said. “To be somewhere where you’re wanted, that’s the most important thing. I never want to be anywhere where I’m not wanted and I feel like this organization wanted me here and they’ve shown nothing but love and trust for me since Day One."" Washington coach Scott Brooks was impressed by Wall’s performance after watching him work his way back from injury over the past two seasons. “I’m happy for him,” Brooks said. “I’m not happy that he won tonight, but I’m happy that he’s back. He fought hard ... to come back and I hope he has a healthy year.” Wall said Tuesday's game wasn't too emotional but that he expects to feel more when he returns to Washington later this season. He added that he's tired of talking about his former team and doesn't want to discuss the Wizards again until that game on Feb. 15. The Wizards called a timeout after Houston's 8-0 run, and Wall yelled and jumped as he looked at the opposing bench before bounding back to the Houston side. Wall and Westbrook were both given technical fouls soon after that when they jawed at each other as Westbrook prepared to shoot free throws after being fouled by DeMarcus Cousins. Bradley Beal made a 3-pointer with about 3½ minutes left to trim Houston's lead to 10, but Wall hit a 3 seconds later and Cousins, who had 19 points and 11 rebounds, added two free throws to make it 99-84. “We made some critical mistakes and didn’t make some shots (to) close out the game,"" Brooks said. Oladipo and Eric Gordon added 20 points apiece to help the Rockets to their third straight win. Beal scored 33 points to give him at least 25 in each of his 12 games this season, extending a franchise record. Westbrook, who spent one season in Houston, had 19 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds. TIP-INS Wizards: Were missing six players because of health and safety protocols. ... Robin Lopez had 10 points. Rockets: Christian Wood missed his third straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... Danuel House had two points and a rebound in his return after missing four games with back spasms and seven because of health and safety protocols. STARTING TO MESH Tuesday was the first game that Wall and Oladipo played together after Oladipo, who came to Houston in the James Harden trade, sat out for rest on Saturday night. Coach Stephen Silas said the offense was a bit disjointed for much of the game while the two adjusted to playing together, but he thought they began to mesh in the fourth quarter. “The fourth quarter was good,"" Silas said. “They were figuring out how they can make each other better and play to each other’s strengths. ... It’s a work in progress for sure.""","401267429"
"Jordan Clarkson rainbows a pass high to Rudy Gobert, who finishes with a two-handed reverse dunk. (0:21) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Utah Jazz leaned on their tough defense to keep their win streak alive. Rudy Gobert had 18 points, 19 rebounds and four blocked shots, and the Jazz beat the New York Knicks 108-94 on Tuesday night for their ninth consecutive victory. “We did a lot of good things that didn’t show up on the scoreboard,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “People talk about winning ugly and tonight ugly was pretty.” Royce O’Neale scored a career-high 20 points, helping Utah overcome a quiet night for Donovan Mitchell. Mike Conley had 19 points, seven rebounds, and five assists. Mitchell finished with nine points on 3-for-15 shooting. Austin Rivers scored 25 points for New York — all in the first half. Julius Randle had 18 points and 10 rebounds, and R.J. Barrett scored 17 in the Knicks’ third straight loss. New York made just 12 total baskets in the second half on the heels of shooting 55.8% from the field before halftime. The Jazz made numerous hustle plays and forced the Knicks to settle for one tough shot after another. By the fourth quarter, New York’s offense was thoroughly bottled up. The Knicks scored only 13 points over the final 12 minutes. “We knew right from the start, Utah’s playing as well as anyone in the league,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “And so I thought our aggressiveness to start the game was very good. And then we didn’t sustain it for 48 minutes. And that’s something we’re still working toward.” The Jazz trailed by as many 15 points in the first half, but grabbed the lead for good when they opened the fourth quarter with a 20-3 run. O’Neale punctuated the key stretch with three straight baskets, giving Utah a 100-84 lead with 5:19 remaining. “We kept our focus on the defensive end,” Gobert said. “We didn’t worry about the missed shots. All of the sudden, we got stops and the shots started falling. Utah endured a cold spell on offense during the first quarter. The Jazz missed 12 of their first 14 shots and shot 2 of 13 from the perimeter during the period. They made only six baskets in the first 12 minutes. Rivers scored 18 of New York’s first 21 points in the second quarter. His flurry of baskets stopped a Jazz rally. After Utah cut the deficit to 36-32 on back-to-back layups from Joe Ingles and Gobert, Rivers made three 3-pointers to fuel a 12-2 run that extended the Knicks’ lead to 48-34 midway through the quarter. Rivers went 10 of 10 from the field during the first half, including five 3-pointers. He had a limited impact after halftime once Utah made a point of taking him out of the offense. “In the second half, they became more physical, they took the fight to us,” Rivers said. “And it just kind of fell apart. They just kept their foot on the pedal, and we weren’t able to get it back. This was the toughest loss of the trip.” Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic rallied the Jazz, combining for 22 points during the third quarter. Conley made four baskets, assisted on a pair, and hit four free throws during the quarter. Bogdanovic hit a pair of 3-pointers. TIP-INS Knicks: Alec Burks made his second start of the season and his Knicks career. He finished with nine points and seven rebounds. ... Rivers went 0 of 4 from the field after halftime. ... New York held Utah to two fast-break points. Jazz: Mitchell, Conley, and Bogdanovic combined to go 1 of 19 from the field in the first half. … Utah finished with just six turnovers. … Mitchell finished with a season-high eight rebounds. CAREER NIGHT In his fourth season, O’Neale is averaging a career-best 7.9 points while shooting 45.7% from the field. His burgeoning offensive game is no surprise to teammates who have witnessed the time he has put in to make a greater impact on that end. “This is the Royce we all know,” Mitchell said. “He’s a dog. He’s going to go out there and work.”","401267430"
"Domantas Sabonis gets the ball and finishes with a left-handed dunk for the Pacers. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — When his MRI came back negative after taking a shot to the knee earlier this week, Domantas Sabonis told Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren there was no way he was going to rest and let his teammates down. “I don't like sitting out,"" Sabonis said. ""I woke up today and I felt good. I did my shooting time and I was like, ‘I can play.’ I would have felt worse if I didn't play.” Sabonis powered through with a bruised knee, getting 22 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to lead Indiana past the Charlotte Hornets 116-106 on Wednesday night. He came into the game listed as questionable but finished 9 of 10 from the field. “The toughness that he showed to step foot in that game after taking that knee-to-knee (on Monday), that toughness goes a long way,” Bjorkgren said. Doug McDermott scored a season-high 28 points — three shy of his career-high — Malcom Brogdon had 25 points and Justin Holiday chipped in with 19 points for the Pacers, who have won three of four. Terry Rozier had 20 points for the Hornets, who have dropped six of seven. Sabonis bruised his knee during a collision with Toronto’s Kyle Lowry on Monday night and had an MRI on Tuesday that showed no damage. He was on his game from the start, continuously making the right plays and finding teammates like McDermott on cuts to the basket and making the most of his shot selection in and out of the paint. Indiana had 34 assisted baskets. “He’s a willing passer. When the ball is in his hands, he's going to make the right play,” Bjorkgren said of Sabonis. “He took 10 shots and had double-digit assists. He will continuously make the right play.” Said Brogdon: “Along with Joker (Nikola Jokic), he's one of the best passing bigs in the league.” The Pacers led by 36-19 after the first quarter. “We’re trying different lineups now,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “That was a new group out there tonight. It was a poor first quarter. It wasn’t just the first group, it was the second group as well.” TIP INS Pacers: Outscored Charlotte 50-42 in the paint. ... Holiday fouled out with 48 seconds left. Hornets: Cody Zeller returned to the starting lineup and had 10 points and 14 rebounds. Zeller missed four weeks with a broken hand and had come off the bench the last three games. ... This opens a stretch with 12 of 14 games at home. ... With the Hornets struggling to win there is growing pressure for Borrego to start rookie LaMelo Ball, who had eight points and five assists in 22 minutes. SLOWING DOWN HAYWARD Indiana limited the red-hot Gordon Hayward to 16 points on 6-of-14 shooting from the floor. The Pacers (11-7) pushed their coverage to Hayward, who came in averaging 30.5 points over his past four contests and having made 58.1% of his shots from the floor, including 61.5% from 3-point range. “The way he’s playing, teams are going to tilt their defense toward him,"" Borrego said. ""We know that. He knows that, too. He’s been in this league for a while. He’s seen different coverages. I’ll continue to look for ways to free him up.”","401267431"
"Andre Drummond throws down a vicious lefty jam over Mason Plumlee to put an exclamation mark on the Cavaliers' win over the Pistons. (0:22) CLEVELAND -- — Collin Sexton scored 29 points and Andre Drummond had 23 points, 16 rebounds and five steals against his former team, powering the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 122-107 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. Taurean Prince added 16 points and rookie Isaac Okoro had 10 points and a season-high six assists to help the Cavaliers snap their two-game losing streak and move back to .500. Cleveland forced 22 turnovers, turning them into 30 points. “Our main goal is to beat up a team and wear them down,” said Drummond, who spent his first 7 1/2 seasons with the Pistons. “We did a great job of that tonight. We just tried to play aggressive the whole game and force them to make mistakes. “We got stops and just played our game. That’s really what happened.” Jerami Grant scored 26 points and Mason Plumlee had 15 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high eight turnovers for Detroit. The Pistons have the worst road record in the Eastern Conference at 1-7. Drummond made a bank shot midway through the fourth quarter to give Cleveland its largest lead of the night at 108-89. The Cavaliers went ahead for good at 72-69 on a Darius Garland 3-pointer in the third. “The 22 turnovers are a bad recipe and I take responsibility for that,” Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. “Against Philly (a 119-104 win Monday), we played beautiful basketball, but tonight I didn’t think our focus or understanding of passing was there.” Cleveland, which had seven players score in double figures, shot 54% from the field and made 11 of 21 3-pointers. Garland had 14 points, and Cedi Osman and Jarrett Allen scored 10 apiece. “The second half was a clear vision of what we want on the floor,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “We shared the ball and we made plays to make each other better on both ends of the court.” Detroit guard Derrick Rose returned after missing two games with a sore left knee, scoring 13 points in 19 minutes off the bench. Wayne Ellington had 17 points and Delon Wright scored 11 points and dished out seven assists. The Pistons have committed 46 turnovers in two games against the Cavaliers, both losses. They made a season-high 24 in a 128-119 double-overtime defeat on Dec. 26. “I don’t think they were necessarily forced,” said Grant, who made 10 of 10 free throws. “I think, more or less, it was us trying to do too much with the basketball.” “It's hard to stop (Cleveland) when they get going,” Rose said. “We've got to play smarter. That's all it is.” Cavaliers power forward Larry Nance Jr. was unavailable for the second straight game after spraining his right wrist at Boston on Sunday. SIMILAR STRATEGY Casey is encouraged by Cleveland’s development, specifically mentioning Sexton and Garland. The Cavaliers are seventh in the East after finishing with the second-worst record in the NBA last season. “A couple of years ago, Cleveland was where we are now,” Casey said. “They’re an exciting up-and-coming team, like we want to be.” TIP-INS Pistons: F Blake Griffin (left knee) and G Killian Hayes (right hip) were inactive. Griffin is not playing in back-to-back games for precautionary reasons. … Rookie G Saben Lee was assigned to the G-League in a procedural move. “Saben would have been inactive with Derrick (Rose) back, so this will save days on his two-way contract,” Casey said. Cavaliers: Garland made his first start since returning from a sprained right shoulder on Jan. 22. The second-year pro missed eight games, but Bickerstaff said he is no longer on a minutes restriction. … F Kevin Love (right calf strain), G Matthew Dellavedova (concussion) and rookie F Lamar Stevens (abdominal strain) were inactive.","401267432"
"Richaun Holmes absorbs contact and finishes a tough layup down low for the Kings vs. the Magic. (0:22) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Sacramento Kings guard Buddy Hield mixed up his game beautifully on Wednesday night, calmly hitting spot-up 3-pointers, sinking midrange jumpers and dishing the ball when the Orlando Magic blitzed him with double teams. Kings’ coach Luke Walton insisted that it was just the kind performance from Hield that Sacramento needs to see more of going forward. Hield scored a season-best 29 points by making 10 of 17 shots and 7 of 12 3-pointers as the well-rested Kings beat the Magic 121-107. “I thought it was his most consistent game this year, for sure, and maybe since I’ve been (with the Kings),” Walton said. “Both sides of the ball, he was making good decisions, knocking down shots when we needed shots made and getting off the ball when they were blitzing him. We need that because it’s a tough league to win in. To get that type of play from him will give us a much better chance.” Sacramento was playing for the first time since Friday after two games were canceled because of COVID-19 protocols with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Kings proved themselves to be rested and ready in taking apart the Magic for their second road victory of the season. The Kings led by 11 in the first period, by 17 before halftime and by as much as 22 in the second half of the wire-to-wire victory. The Magic never got closer than 10 in the second half in dropping to 4-5 at home this season. “We didn’t have great energy, I’d say, at either end of the floor,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. “We have a good enough team to have a good season, but we need everybody every night. There’s not a lot of room for error and we can’t have five guys play well and four guys not or six and three. That’s not easy, but that’s the way it is.” Harrison Barnes scored 21 points and made 3 3s for Sacramento, which shot 48.9% from the floor and made 14 of 33 3-pointers. Sacramento center Richaun Holmes had 20 points and 12 rebounds for his third double-double of the season, while Marvin Bagley III recorded his sixth double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds. De’Aaron Fox added 16 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. Hield’s dynamic shooting performance was the third time this season that he’s made at least six 3-pointers in a game. His 29 points points topped the 26 he had on Jan. 13 in Portland — a game where he made eight 3s. He was 7 for 12 from behind the arc on Wednesday. “Buddy is an important part of our team and when he gets it going like he had it tonight, we’re very, very difficult to guard,” Holmes said. “He does a lot for our team. To see him get rolling like that and come away with the win, it was great.” Magic center Nikola Vucevic made 11 of 18 shots and scored 26 points — his 14th game of the season with at least 20 points. Evan Fournier added 25 points, while Terrence Ross chipped in 16 points off the bench. Aaron Gordon struggled through the night with three points in 26 minutes. He missed eight of his nine field goal attempts. Rookie guard Cole Anthony, who scored a career-best 21 points in Monday’s defeat of Charlotte, made just 2 of 9 shots and scored seven points on Wednesday. TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento’s streak of consecutive quarters without allowing 30 points ended at seven when the Magic reached 30 in Wednesday’s fourth quarter. … Walton said the team’s first trip East brought up some new challenges for his team. Walton: “The road trips we’re pretty used to, but it’s the protocols that have taken some getting used to. The players had to have their first (COVID-19) testing done by 8:30 AM. So, as you’re trying to adjust to time zones, you still have to get up and do that so that the players can get the tests back before the game. Things like that are what we’re getting used to.” Magic: Orlando came into Wednesday as the NBA’s hottest shooting team from 3-point range over the previous three games — 17.7 makes a night on 47% shooting — but it made only 10 of 26 attempts on Wednesday.","401267433"
"Kyrie Irving goes up-and-under before spinning in a layup high off the glass. (0:29) ATLANTA -- — Kevin Durant scored 32 points and James Harden had 31 to lead a productive effort for Brooklyn's big three scorers, and the Nets beat the Atlanta Hawks 132-128 in overtime on Wednesday night. Harden added 15 assists and eight rebounds. Kyrie Irving scored 26 points for Brooklyn. Harden, acquired from Houston on Jan. 14, started slowly before scoring 16 points in the second period. It was an indication he is finding his place in the Nets' offense after not scoring more than 21 points in any of his previous four games. “That’s who he is,” Irving said. “We just want him to come into this group and not think so much about fitting in, but just be who he is.” Trae Young had 28 points and 14 assists for Atlanta. Cam Reddish scored a season-high 24 points while John Collins and De'Andre Hunter each had 21 points. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce described the game as “playoff basketball.” “That’s a good test for our guys against a really good team, a team that’s going to be there at the end at some point,” Pierce said. “I thought we were there. We had a couple miscues that we can learn from.” Durant's dunk gave the Nets a 127-121 lead in the extra period. After Young made one of two free throws to trim Brooklyn's lead to 129-126, Durant's turnover with 40 seconds remaining gave Atlanta an opening. Hunter missed a long jumper that would have tied the game. Harden stretched the lead by sinking two free throws with 4.6 seconds remaining. “Tonight was a great win,” Harden said. “We stuck with it in four quarters and overtime.” After scoring only two points in the opening period, Harden passed up a scoring opportunity on the Nets' first possession of the second quarter. He then looked toward the Nets bench, gestured in a shooting motion and then nodded as if to confirm he should have taken the shot. Harden made a 3-pointer to spark his scoring spree. The Hawks called a timeout about three minutes into the period after Harden's step-back 3 over Kevin Huerter. TIP-INS Nets: Coach Steve Nash is looking forward to more practice time with the start of a three-game road trip. The game at Atlanta opened a stretch of 10 of 13 games on the road. “It’s a great opportunity for us to keep rolling,"" Nash said. “We’ve played so many games in a short period of time. We have a stretch now where we have a little bit of breathing room between games."" Hawks: Clint Capela had 11 rebounds, his 14th consecutive game with at least 10. ... G Rajon Ronda (left ankle sprain) was held out. ... There was a pregame moment of silence for former Hawks beat writer Sekou Smith, who was 48 when he died on Tuesday due to COVID-19. Smith covered the Hawks for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution before working for Turner Sports for NBA TV and NBA.com. JUST MISSED Harden missed a 3-point attempt with less than a second remaining in regulation. “I was trying to create some separation and get off a shot,” Harden said. “I thought it was pretty good, just a little bit too long.” BREAKOUT FOR CAM Reddish (right Achilles tendon tightness) returned after missing one game. He also has missed games with a recent bruised knee and has struggled with inconsistent production before emerging with a strong performance against the Nets despite the difficult assignment of defending Durant. “Cam was great,” Pierce said. “We needed what he brought tonight, a downhill attacking mentality. ... He didn’t force anything.”","401267434"
"Bol Bol entertains the Nuggets with an unreal, one-handed jam a day before they take on the Heat. (0:20) MIAMI -- — The Denver Nuggets might not want this road trip to end. The Miami Heat cannot get Jimmy Butler back quickly enough. Nikola Jokic had 21 points and 11 rebounds and the Nuggets won their fifth straight, building a 25-point halftime lead and beating the Heat 109-82 on Wednesday night. Michael Porter Jr. scored 17 points, JaMychal Green added 15 and Jamal Murray had 14 for Denver, which improved to 4-0 on its five-game road trip — the first four-win trip for the Nuggets since December 2013. A win Friday in San Antonio would give Denver its first 5-0 trip since January 2012, and the Nuggets have won 10 of 13 since since a 1-4 start. “When we were 1-4, there was no panic,"" Murray said. “It's five games in. ... Turned things around pretty quick."" Butler watched from the Miami bench, significant since Wednesday’s game was the first in more than two weeks where he could be with his team. He's now missed the last nine Heat games because of virus-related protocols. The Heat are 2-7 in this stretch without him and have dropped four straight. Herro (neck spasms) missed a seventh consecutive game, Dragic was out with a groin strain, and Kendrick Nunn led Miami with 17 points. The Heat got Avery Bradley back for the first time in nine games; he, like Butler, was out in accordance with the NBA’s virus protocols. “It was great to see the guys, everybody, even though everybody wasn’t available,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Bradley had eight points in 18 minutes. “Even though we came up short tonight, felt great to be back out there,” Bradley said. Denver led 58-33 at the half, the Nuggets’ biggest halftime lead this season and biggest in a road arena since holding a 31-point lead at the break in Chicago on March 21, 2018. The Heat missed 15 3-pointers in the first quarter — an NBA record for an opening period, and a team record for any quarter. Denver’s lead was down to seven early in the fourth, but back-to-back 3s by Porter and Green got the Nuggets’ edge back to 13 and another 3 by Jokic made it 94-74 with 5:35 left. “That team was missing Jimmy Butler, Goran Dragic, Tyler Herro, a lot of their top players,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “I don’t know if we’re as good as we played tonight and I know they’re a hell of a lot better than they played.” Bam Adebayo scored 15 for Miami. TIP-INS Nuggets: Guard P.J. Dozier (right hamstring strain) missed the game and the Nuggets are bracing for it to be a multi-game absence. ... The 33 points allowed by Denver in the first half was not only a season best, but it was nearly 24 points below the Nuggets’ average through the first 17 games. Heat: Wednesday was the start of a six-game homestand for Miami. After that, the Heat play eight of their next nine on the road. ... Duncan Robinson’s first 3-pointer was the 400th of his career, including playoffs. He’s the 12th Heat player to make that many. TRIBUTES The Heat held a pregame moment of silence to commemorate Tuesday being the one-year anniversary of Kobe Bryant’s death and last week’s death of Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron.

"After Anthony Davis puts the Lakers ahead with 11 seconds to play, Tobias Harris answers with the game-winner as the 76ers prevail. (1:16) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid tried to dunk on LeBron James and instead his back slammed on the court. James’ push of the 76ers big man got him hit with a flagrant 1 and Embiid cried foul. He wanted the King tossed. “That’s a very dangerous play,” Embiid said. “I guarantee if that was me I would have probably been ejected from the game.” James stuck around -- long enough to watch Tobias Harris stick it to the Lakers. Harris swished a jumper with 3 seconds left, ending the Lakers’ 13-0 run and sending Philadelphia to a 107-106 victory over Los Angeles on Wednesday night. The James-Embiid flagrant took center stage in a game between teams that entered with the best records in their conferences. The 76ers lead the East at 13-6 and the Lakers are 14-5 in the West. “Some people think we haven’t played anybody,” Harris said. “For us, we wanted to go against the champs. We wanted to see where we’re at.” Philly was nearly on the losing end. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit a 3-pointer with 1:05 left that pulled the Lakers to 105-104. James hit Anthony Davis for the go-ahead basket with 11.2 seconds to go for a 106-105 lead and cap that run. Harris -- who campaigned for an All-Star nod -- saved the Sixers on a shot over Alex Caruso. Harris scored 24 points. Embiid had 28 and Ben Simmons had 17 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. James scored 34 points and Davis had 23. “It didn’t go our way but I loved our fight,” James said. Embiid, the All-Star center off to the best start of his career, drove down the baseline for an attempted right-handed dunk when James pushed him in flight. Embiid crashed hard on his tailbone, immediately grabbed his back and writhed on the court in pain as James simply looked down and walked past him. After a short video review, James was hit with a flagrant 1 -- “unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent” -- and Embiid sank both free throws. Embiid was quickly hit with his own flagrant when his elbow connected with Davis’ face on a drive to bucket. Embiid has a history of back issues and sat out Monday’s loss at Detroit with back tightness. He sat alone on a cool-down seat behind the basket for nearly the first 5 minutes of the fourth quarter. Embiid returned and threw his hands in the air in celebration when he buried a shot that gave the Sixers a 10-point lead. Embiid said James’ foul should have been a flagrant 2 -- an automatic ejection. “Clearly, he wasn’t the same after that as far as his movement,” coach Doc Rivers said. The Lakers suffered their first road loss of the season in 11 games. TIP-INS Lakers: Coach Frank Vogel was a diehard 76ers fan growing up in New Jersey and eventually spent one season as an assistant coach in the 2004-05 season. His trips to Philly are usually a big homecoming but the pandemic sidelined those plans. Vogel said he hasn’t seen his parents since he had dinner with them during the Lakers’ last visit to Philly. He said the 76ers’ 1983 NBA championship and the Charles Barkley-Allen Iverson years “were a big part of my upbringing.” 76ers: Simmons moved into 13th on the NBA’s career triple-double list with 31. REMEMBER KOBE The Lakers played in Philadelphia for the first time since Jan. 25, 2020, when James passed Kobe Bryant for third place on the NBA’s career scoring list. Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people were killed the next morning in a helicopter crash. A year and a day after Bryant’s death, the Lakers played for the first time since the grim anniversary and bowed their heads during a brief video tribute and a moment of silence for Bryant. Embiid was a teen in Africa when he first got hooked on basketball watching Bryant and wore sneakers Wednesday emblazoned with photos of Kobe and Gianna on one side and the 2, 8, 24 uniform numbers on the other. YOU AGAIN Green and backup center Dwight Howard played key roles in the Lakers’ championship last season. Green landed in Philly through a trade and Howard signed a one-year deal. “I miss those guys,” Vogel said. “They were two guys that really starred in their roles. It’s so necessary in a championship run. We don’t win a championship without those guys.”","401267436"
"Donte DiVincenzo throws down a monstrous poster dunk late in the fourth quarter of the Bucks' win. (0:32) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists, and Donte DiVincenzo sparked a five-point sequence in the fourth quarter that helped the Milwaukee Bucks pull away for a 115-108 win over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night. The Bucks (11-6) were leading by just three points after a dunk by DiVincenzo, who followed with a steal and then drew a flagrant foul on Kyle Lowry while driving to score again. DiVincenzo paid the price for his big play. “That’s significant contact to Donte’s head,” said Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer, who thought a Flagrant 2 should have been called. “He was able to play through it, but we’ll see how serious it is.” Nobody appreciated DiVincenzo’s play more than Antetokounmpo. “It was huge,” he said. “He had the dunk, he had the steal and they hit him in the face. But he was playing the right way. He really helped us tonight.” After DiVincenzo made the two free throws, the Bucks took the ball out of bounds and Bryn Forbes nailed a 3-pointer to put the Bucks up 92-84 with 9:54 left. That helped the Bucks hold off the Raptors (7-11) down the stretch despite a 14-point scoring burst by Lowry and a two-minute stretch in which Antetokounmpo sat out after getting hit in the face. Norman Powell led the Raptors with 26 points, the fourth straight 20-plus game for Powell in his seventh start of the season. “It looks like he’s found a groove,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said, “and it’s translating to both ends of the floor.” Fred VanVleet, the Raptors’ leading scorer, had 10 points and 10 assists after a scoreless first half. Khris Middleton, who finished with 24 points and 10 rebounds, closed the first half with a 3-pointer to put the Bucks up 63-54, the largest lead for either team until 3-pointers by D.J. Augustin and Bobby Portis stretched Milwaukee’s lead to 11 midway through the third quarter. Toronto scored the final nine points of the third and took an 84-83 lead on Yuta Watanabe’s lane runner early in the fourth. The Bucks came in as the NBA’s No. 1 shooting team at 49%, and made 10 of their first 14 shots before Antetokounmpo went to the bench with 4:33 left in the first quarter. They shot 43% for the game. TIP-INS Bucks: Brook Lopez had his fifth straight double-figure scoring game, finishing with 21 points on 8-of-11 shooting. Raptors: Played without F OG Anunoby, who missed his first game of the season with a strained left calf. ... VanVleet is the only Raptors player to have started all 18 games. ... Pascal Siakam started after missing two games with a swollen left knee and had 11 points and nine rebounds in 35 minutes. 10,000 POINTS FOR LOWRY With a 3-pointer in the first minute, Lowry joined DeMar DeRozan (13,296) and Chris Bosh (10,275) as the only players to score 10,000 points as a member of the Raptors. Lowry scored another 3,732 points in stints with Houston and Memphis. The only other active NBA players to score 10,000 with their current team are Golden State’s Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, Portland’s Damian Lillard, Washington’s Bradley Beal, and Antetokounmpo, who exceeded the 11,000-point mark on Sunday. Lowry finished with 21 points and six rebounds. He has scored 10,019 points for Toronto. FAIR WEATHER TEAMS? Since facing each other in the Eastern Conference finals 20 months ago, the Bucks have met four times -- in Toronto, Milwaukee, Walt Disney World and Tampa. “That’s weird,” noted Budenholzer. “They’re such a great team and organization, and their fan base and city are so unique. To play them here in Tampa, obviously the warm weather is good, but yeah, weird is a good word.”","401267437"
"The Pelicans put the game out of reach as Brandon Ingram tosses it up to Zion Williamson for the jam. (0:18) NEW ORLEANS -- — With Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram each having their highest-scoring games of the season, there was only so much Washington's Bradley Beal could do in response. Ingram and Williamson each scored 32 points and New Orleans beat the depleted Wizards 124-106 on Wednesday night. “Brandon and Zion were both very unselfish,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said with a nod to Ingram's eight assists and Williamson's willingness to pass instead of forcing shots when the defense collapsed on him. “That’s something that those guys want to do,"" Van Gundy said. ""They helped their teammates win and they still put up big numbers.” Beal, the NBA's leading scorer, almost single-handedly kept the reeling Wizards in striking distance with 47 points. “I try to come out and play with energy every night. Whatever it looks like at the end, it looks like,” Beal said. ""I don’t come out and say I want to score 50 tonight. ... That doesn’t happen. A lot of the (stuff) I’m doing, I’m in awe of it half the time, too.” Washington got as close as eight points in the middle of the fourth quarter before the Pelicans pulled away in the final five minutes, highlighted by Williamson's soaring dunk of Ingram's lob from behind the 3-point line. Ingram finished with a season-high seven 3-pointers on 12 attempts, making all five he attempted in the second half. “I got a little rhythm and I just took the shots they gave me,” Ingram said. Williamson did most of his scoring in the paint and added eight free throws to help New Orleans win for just the second time in 10 games. “We both know we're great players,” Williamson said of himself and Ingram. “But if we're going to take it to that next level, we've got to start running off some wins."" Eric Bledsoe scored 18 points and Steven Adams grabbed a season-high 18 rebounds for New Orleans, which never trailed and made 17 3-pointers. “My teammates taking all those 3s really opened up the game for me and it just really worked out,"" Williamson said. Garrison Mathews scored 15 points and Robin Lopez had 14 for Washington, which played without guard Russell Westbrook and lost for the sixth time in seven games. New Orleans led by as many as 26 when Ingram's 15-foot pull-up made it 74-48. But Beal willed Washington back into the game. Beal's 24 points in the third quarter — during which he made four of five 3-point shots — helped the Wizards cut it to 94-80 by the end of the period. “The winning spirit that he has is critical to our future success,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. “To go through it now and still not give in is huge. It’s huge for me. It’s huge for our staff and it’s huge for our team going forward. We know that we’re going to be healthy and everything’s going to be much better when we have our entire group.” TIP-INS Wizards: Westbrook, the Wizards' second-leading scorer, was scratched for rest after playing a night earlier in Houston. However, Brooks did not rule out playing Westbrook on back-to-back nights later this season. ... Washington also was missing six players because of health and safety protocols. ... Brooks elected to give 6-foot-8, 216-pound Jordan Bell his first start of the season in an effort to match up better with the size of New Orleans' frontcourt. Bell had 11 rebounds and four points. Pelicans: Adams has now had at least 16 rebounds in a game twice this season. ... Guard Lonzo Ball did not return to the game after checking out late in the second quarter. The club said he had a sprained ankle. ... Reserve guard Josh Hart had eight rebounds, his ninth time this season with at least that many. HARD FOUL The Wizards' Alex Len was called for a flagrant foul early in the fourth quarter when he grabbed Williamson by the shoulder with his left hand and right bicep with his right hand and pulled the Pelicans star to the floor as he tried to drive toward the hoop. Williamson was briefly in a prone position before getting up with a smile. Len wound up fouling out with 5:38 left.","401267439"
"Kemba Walker tries to drive as Dejounte Murray comes up with a steal and dunk at the other end. (0:25) SAN ANTONIO -- — DeMar DeRozan scored 21 points, Keldon Johnson had 18 points and 10 rebounds, and the San Antonio Spurs held on to beat the Boston Celtics 110-106 on Wednesday night. LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points, Dejounte Murray had 11 points and 11 rebounds and San Antonio won its second straight home game. “It just shows what we’re capable of as a team,” Johnson said. The Celtics’ projected starting five of Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Daniel Theis played together for the first time this season. Tatum had 25 points, Brown added 24, and Smart and Walker had 14 apiece. Their balanced output was not enough as Boston had its two-game winning streak end. “It’s been an interesting season,” Brown said. “We’ve had guys out, guys hurt. We are just trying to put everything together. Tonight wasn’t our best night.” The Spurs have defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, Clippers and now the Celtics, but have struggled with allowing big leads early and also with giving away leads late. Both happened Wednesday against the Celtics. “We held on,” DeRozan said. “They made a run. We weren’t scared by it.” After DeRozan hit a pair of free throws to give the Spurs a 103-101 lead, Theis’ dunk tied the game with 40 seconds remaining. After San Antonio regained the lead on DeRozan’s eight-foot jumper, Murray had a breakaway dunk off a steal to give the Spurs a 107-103 lead. “Big-time players make big-time plays,” Johnson said. “DeRozan made a clutch shot and DJ made a clutch play and dunk.” The Spurs rallied after giving up a double-digit lead in the second half. San Antonio made 14 of its last 15 shots in the first half during a 29-6 run. Lonnie Walker IV had nine points in the run and closed with 14 points. A pair of 3-pointers by Aldridge tied the game and gave the Spurs their first lead at 46-43 since the opening seconds of the game. Three days after setting a season high for points in the third quarter against Cleveland, Boston came within four points of matching the mark in outscoring San Antonio 37-21 to open the second half. Tatum and Brown combined for 22 points in the quarter. “The zone kind of threw us out of our rhythm,” DeRozan said. San Antonio had a season-high 20 turnovers, including five during Boston’s 13-1 run to close the third. “It hasn’t been our problem this year, but tonight it was,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. TIP-INS Celtics: Boston played its second game against the West and first since beating Memphis 126-107 on Dec. 30. … Boston is 5-3 when using a starting lineup of Tatum, Brown, Smart, Theis and Tristan Thompson. … Boston is 0-3 this season when it trails entering the second half. Spurs: Popovich said starting guard Derrick White will return this weekend after missing 13 straight games. White fractured his left second toe in his season debut after sitting out the preseason and the team’s first four games following surgery on the same toe for a different injury. “He had contact again today. We’re just being conservative, I guess,” Popovich said. “He probably could go out there tonight. He wants to go out there tonight. We opted to wait until the weekend. You’ll see him this weekend.” … Aldridge joined Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki as the only players in league history with 19,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, 1,000 blocks and 200 3-pointers.","401267440"
"Darius Bazley grabs a rebound and drives downcourt and to the basket for a dunk. (0:19) PHOENIX -- — Chris Paul reminded the Oklahoma City Thunder what they were missing after trading him during the offseason. Then the Thunder turned around and reminded the Phoenix Suns and Paul why they're a team that appears on the rise. Al Horford had 21 points and 11 rebounds, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander also scored 21 points and Oklahoma City rallied to beat Phoenix 102-97 on Wednesday night. Paul scored a season-high 32 points in his first game against Oklahoma City since the trade. The 10-time All-Star played well during his only season with the Thunder, averaging 17.6 points and 6.7 assists. He had one of his best games this season at Oklahoma City’s expense on Wednesday. The point guard shot 12 of 21 from the field and scored 13 points during a seven-minute stretch in the fourth that accounted for a big chunk of the team’s offense. But the young and improving Thunder hung close throughout the fourth and rallied in the final minutes. Lu Dort made a 3-pointer with 2 minutes left that put Oklahoma City up 96-95 and the Thunder didn’t trail again. “Defensively, our mental focus was very good,” Horford said. “I was really happy with how into it we all were. We continued to get stops down the stretch and get rebounds.” It was a see-saw game that featured Phoenix blowing a 17-point lead in the first half and Oklahoma City coughing up a 13-point lead in the second half before the Thunder locked down with defense in the final possessions. Gilgeous-Alexander added eight assists and seven rebounds. “It was a 48-minute game,” Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. “We didn’t start great. They had a rough second quarter and then we just stayed the course.” Paul had a chance to tie the game with about 10 seconds left on a 3-pointer, but missed badly for an airball. “We are just not playing well enough right now,” Paul said. “I am not saying we are not good enough. We are just not playing well enough right now.” Phoenix played without All-Star guard Devin Booker, who missed his second straight game with a sore hamstring. The Suns have lost three straight. Jae Crowder added 17 points for Phoenix, which shot just 38% from the field. “Until this team understands consistency for four quarters we are going to feel like this a lot,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “We can try to get everybody to feel sorry for us. It ain't going to work. We've got to be consistent. This is on us, period.” Oklahoma City took advantage of some cold shooting from Phoenix — which missed 16 straight 3-pointers during a stretch — and took a 59-46 lead early in the third quarter. The Suns eventually shook loose from the slump and pulled within 73-71 heading into the fourth. The Suns jumped out to a 32-17 lead in the first quarter after getting 17 points from their bench. But the offense collapsed in the second and they scored just 10 points while missing all 11 3-point attempts. That helped the Thunder grab a 45-42 halftime lead. TIP-INS Thunder: Horford was back in the lineup after missing six straight games because of personal reasons. ... Veteran guard George Hill didn't play because of a sprained thumb. Suns: Backup guard Cameron Payne missed didn't play because of a sore foot. ... Forwards Dario Saric and Damian Jones both missed the game because of the league's health and safety protocols but were on the bench. WILLIAMS RETURNS Williams was on the bench for the Suns after missing the past two days of practice because of personal reasons. “I don’t like missing days,” Williams said pregame. “It’s not part of my career over my time in the league. I haven’t missed days. So that’s always hard for me, but there’s just certain things in my life that I have to attend to. I may have to do it a few more times going forward, but I certainly appreciate the level of concern and respect for my privacy. At the right time, I’ll let everyone know what’s going on, but for now it’s a private matter.”","401267441"
"Rudy Gobert keeps his strong game going with a pair of dunks in the third quarter vs. the Mavericks. (0:26) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Playing without leading scorer Donovan Mitchell didn't slow down the Utah Jazz. Utah never trailed in a 116-104 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night. The Jazz overwhelmed the Mavericks on both ends of the court on their way to their 10th straight victory and the NBA overall lead. Rudy Gobert led the way with his best all-around performance of the season. He finished with 29 points and 20 rebounds – both season highs – and had three blocks and three steals. Gobert’s dominance around the basket took Dallas out of it early and the Mavericks could never get back on track. His effort ultimately helped Utah pass the Lakers — losers in Philadelphia on Wednesday – for the NBA’s best record at 14-4. “It’s probably the first time since I’ve been here that I’ve seen that much focus from everyone in this locker room,” Gobert said. “I really feel like we’re playing for something bigger and we’re on a mission.” Jordan Clarkson added a season-high 31 points off the bench. Joe Ingles chipped in a season-high 21 points — on seven 3-pointers — and eight assists for Utah. He matched his career high with the seven 3s, falling one shy of tying the franchise record. Mitchell was sidelined for the first time this season after he entered the NBA concussion protocol. Ingles made his first start of the season in Mitchell’s place. The Jazz shot 53.7% from the floor and made 14 3-pointers through the first three quarters. “It’s just a really fun group to play with,” Ingles said. “We play for each other. There’s no egos involved. It’s not as unsalvagable as people think.” Luka Doncic scored 30 points for the Mavericks. Tim Hardaway, Jr. added 19 points and Kristaps Porzingis 18. Dallas lost its third straight game. “We’re just not ourselves right now,” Doncic said. “We’re gonna have to pick it up and be way better than this.” Dorian Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson returned to the Mavericks’ starting lineup after both players missed nine games apiece due to COVID-19 healthy and safety protocols. Dwight Powell also returned after an eight-game absence. Utah got an early boost on offense from Ingles and Gobert. Ingles made a pair of 3-pointers and assisted on two other baskets to help the Jazz stake out a 23-12 lead. Both assists were on baskets from Gobert, who had 10 points in the first quarter. The Jazz expanded their lead to 32-17 late in the first quarter following three straight baskets from Clarkson that capped a 9-0 run. Then, Clarkson scored 13 of Utah’s first 16 points in the second quarter. His final basket in that stretch put the Jazz up 48-27. “The first half was the was the killer,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. “We didn’t come out with enough force, enough disposition, enough energy. They were great and we did not play well.” Utah led by as many as 25 points in the third quarter, going up 98-73 on a step-back 3-pointer from Clarkson. The Jazz never let the Mavericks draw closer than 12 points the rest of the way. Utah coach Quin Snyder credited the team’s success to playing with energy and communicating well on both ends of the court from the opening tip. “We want to be unselfish, help each other on both ends of the floor,” Snyder said. “The game can be simple if you let it be.” The teams will complete a two-game set in Utah on Friday night. TIP INS Mavericks: Hardaway needs to make two 3-pointers to reach 1,000 career made 3-pointers. He made four 3s against the Jazz. … James Johnson had a season-high four blocked shots. … Dallas went 0 of 6 from 3-point range in the first quarter. Jazz: Derrick Favors sat out with lower back soreness. … Seven of Ingles’ eight assists were on Gobert’s baskets. … Gobert scored his most points in an NBA game since getting 35 points in a 108-101 victory over New York in March 2017. FINISHING STRONG During their 10-game winning streak, the Jazz have trailed for a total of 57 seconds in the fourth quarter. New York held a one-point lead to start the fourth in its 108-94 loss on Tuesday before Clarkson helped Utah take the lead for good with his first basket of the quarter. QUOTABLE “It’s just a crazy feeling and crazy vibe that we have and that we preach here. The ball doesn’t stick. We’re all just playing off energy and synergy.” – Clarkson on what has driven Utah’s rise to the top of the Western Conference after a 4-4 start.","401267442"
"Steph Curry goes 1-on-1 with Jaden McDaniels and drains the unreal jumpshot. (0:34) SAN FRANCISCO -- — James Wiseman hardly felt he had to prove something to the team that didn't draft him. The rookie center came off Golden State's bench to score a career-high 25 points, dazzling opposite No. 1 pick Anthony Edwards in a matchup of last year's top two draft selections, and the Warriors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 123-111 on Wednesday night. Edwards, who like Wiseman is just 19, also scored 25 points for his second-highest NBA total. Wiseman, however, said he wasn't looking to show anything to the Minnesota brass who chose Edwards instead. “I really wasn’t motivated by that factor,” Wiseman said. The big man dunked, knocked down all three of his 3-point tries and shot 9 for 14. He also blocked two shots, not fouling four times while going straight up to utilize his 7-foot frame. ""That was one of my best games defensively,"" Wiseman said. His maturity and impressive learning curve continues to amaze coach Steve Kerr. “I’ve tried to picture myself at 19 putting up with everything that he’s had to put up with. It’s remarkable,” Kerr said. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 20 points while playing through foul trouble for Golden State. Stephen Curry added 16 points, eight assists and six rebounds as the Warriors won their ninth straight at home against Minnesota to sweep a two-game series. Andrew Wiggins delivered a big game Monday against his old Timberwolves team and scored another 19 points on 8-for-13 shooting Wednesday. Curry struggled with his shot and finished 6 for 17 from the floor and 4 of 11 on 3-pointers after scoring 36 points in Monday night's 130-108 rout of Minnesota. The Timberwolves worked to get Curry out of sync but couldn't do it consistently. “You can’t just do it sometimes. We’ve got to be an every-possession team,” coach Ryan Saunders said. For a second straight game, Kerr stuck with his new-look starting lineup featuring veteran big man Kevon Looney — and Wiseman in a reserve role. Looney grabbed a season-best 10 rebounds. Damion Lee scored a season-best 17 points and hit four 3s to go with three steals. Edwards had his second game with 20 or more points, shooting 9 for 19 with a season-high five 3-pointers. Malik Beasley also scored 25. Naz Reid added 19 points for Minnesota but went down hard midway through the fourth quarter after blocking a shot by Oubre before returning late. D'Angelo Russell missed both games against his former team because of a bruised right quadriceps muscle. Russell played 33 games for Golden State last season before the trade last February that brought Wiggins to the Bay Area. OFFICIAL INJURED The game was down to two referees after Scott Twardoski got hurt, the Warriors said. SMITH REMEMBERED A photo of Sekou Smith and tribute to him was shown on the big screen.

"The Pistons put on a balanced team attack as they take down the Lakers 107-92, making this Los Angeles' first two-game losing streak of the season. (2:20) DETROIT -- — LeBron James made his first seven shots from the field and looked plenty capable of leading the Lakers to a victory with Anthony Davis sidelined. Then James tried to become more of a facilitator — and he never really regained that scoring groove. James scored just two points after halftime, and the Detroit Pistons handed Los Angeles its second straight loss, 107-92 on Thursday night. Davis sat out because of a right quad contusion. “I think early on I got it going, and then I still at the end of the day, still got to get my teammates involved,” James said. “I definitely missed some shots that I know I’m accustomed to making."" Blake Griffin scored 23 points for the Pistons, who are having a strange week that has included wins over the 76ers and Lakers but a loss to Cleveland in between. “I thought we were really good,” Griffin said. “I was proud of the way everybody played.” James had 22 points and 10 assists. The Lakers lost by a point at Philadelphia on Wednesday night, and now the defending champions are on their first losing streak of any length since before last year's playoffs. Detroit led by one before Griffin's 3-pointer with 6:54 remaining started a 16-0 run. The Lakers went nearly seven minutes without scoring. “I don’t know if we ran out of gas,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""We just didn’t have a great rhythm that second half in any way.” Wayne Ellington added 20 points for the Pistons. James was questionable because of a left ankle sprain, but he looked fine at the outset, scoring 14 points in the first quarter. James made four 3-pointers in the first half, but so did Ellington, and the Pistons only trailed 58-56 at the break. TIP-INS Lakers: Kyle Kuzma scored 22 points and Talen Horton-Tucker contributed 13. ... James went 1 of 12 from the field after making his first seven shots. Pistons: Detroit made all 13 of its free throws. ... Mason Plumlee had 17 points and 10 rebounds. UPS AND DOWNS The last three Detroit games — a win over Philadelphia on Monday, a loss to Cleveland on Wednesday and the game against the Lakers on Thursday — were decided by exactly 15 points. The Pistons caught a break when Joel Embiid of the 76ers was out Monday, and again when they missed having to face Davis, but this rebuilding team can use some reasons for optimism. Besides, the Lakers are still tough as long as James is in the lineup. “They’re experienced, they know how to play,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""But it’s good for us to get that confidence and to reinforce what you’re preaching.” TORRID STRETCH Ellington finished 6 of 9 from 3-point range and is 40 of 67 from long distance in his last eight games. Ellington became the eighth player in NBA history to have at least seven straight games with four or more 3s. “He just single-handedly spaced our floor on offense, when you have to give that much attention to somebody,"" Plumlee said. ""Coach always draws up a good first play to get him off, he hits it and then it’s like the rest of the night that team is worried about him coming off pin-downs. Then now, he is getting some cutting baskets because they are so worried about him coming off the screen. It just changes the dynamics of your offense.”","401267444"

Nicolas Batum scored 18 points and the Clippers used a 20-2 run in the third quarter to help fuel what became a 109-105 victory over the short-handed and reeling Heat on Thursday night. Lou Williams had 17 points for the Clippers, who were again without Kawhi Leonard and Paul George because of the league’s virus protocols and Patrick Beverley with right knee soreness. “Big win for us tonight,"" Batum said. The Clippers won despite trailing by 18 early, the franchise’s biggest comeback win since rallying from 31 down to beat Golden State in a playoff game on April 15, 2019. “We just continue to keep playing, kept fighting, kept competing, just trying to play the right way,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. Tyler Herro returned after missing seven games with neck spasms and scored 19 points for Miami, which dropped its fifth straight and is 6-12 after going to the NBA Finals last season.

"Frank Kaminsky passes inside to a cutting Mikal Bridges for the layup. (0:16) PHOENIX -- — The Frank Kaminsky-Abdel Nader connection isn't the first thing — or the second or third thing — that opposing teams are usually concerned about when facing the Phoenix Suns. But for one night, the two backups were unstoppable in the fourth quarter and helped the Suns snap a frustrating three-game losing streak. Nader scored 16 points, Kaminsky nearly had a triple double with 12 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists and Phoenix pulled away in the second half to beat the Golden State Warriors 114-93 on Thursday night. Suns coach Monty Williams was particularly pleased with the way the backups played, which was a big reason the team had 34 assists on 41 made baskets. “That’s the kind of basketball we want to play,” Williams said. “That’s the level I’m going to hold the guys to. 34 assists, the ball movement, the player movement, that’s who we are. The balance was much better tonight.” Phoenix turned a five-point halftime advantage into an 85-71 lead by the end of the third. The Suns have struggled to hold leads over the past few weeks but didn’t have a problem Thursday, pulling ahead 100-81 after Nader hit back-to-back 3s on passes from Kaminsky. “Frank’s been amazing, making the job way easier for guys like myself,” Nader said. “A big man with his head up and making those passes is huge.” The Suns did some of their best work when the bench was in the game but the starters were solid too. All five of them scored in double figures and Mikal Bridges led the team with 20. Deandre Ayton added 12 points and 13 rebounds in 23 minutes. The Suns moved back above .500 at 9-8. The Warriors fell to 10-9. Stephen Curry led the Warriors with 27 points on 10-of-20 shooting, including 5 of 10 from 3-point range. Andrew Wiggins had 16 points, and Eric Paschall 12. Golden State shot just 38% from the field, going 29% from 3-point range. “We are still looking for consistency at both ends,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “Our defense is up and down and our offense is up and down. Hence the season is up and down.” Phoenix built a 14-point lead by late in the first quarter but Golden State pulled to 52-47 by halftime. “I thought we had every opportunity to have it,” Kerr said. “We hung in there the first half. Shots weren’t going in but we battled and we were right in the game at halftime. It just slipped away from us. I thought Phoenix executed better than we did.” NO TRIPLE DOUBLE FOR FRANK With a big lead in the final minutes, the Suns were mostly concentrating on getting Kaminsky his first career triple double. It didn't work out, but Kaminsky was still proud of the way the bench played. “Energy is contagious,” Kaminsky said. “It starts with our bench and you try to play as hard as you can, bring energy and tonight it worked.” TIP-INS Warriors: Kelly Oubre Jr. had four points and four rebounds in his first game against his former team. He shot just 1 of 11 from the field. Oubre was part of the trade with Oklahoma City that brought Chris Paul to the desert. Oubre was then traded to the Warriors about a week later.

"Christian Wood pulls off a Eurostep on his way to the poster dunk late in the first half. (0:24) HOUSTON -- — Victor Oladipo scored 25 points and the Houston Rockets shook off a terrible first quarter and held on late to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 104-101 on Thursday night. The Rockets were down by 20 points in the first quarter before using a big second to take the lead and hold on down the stretch for their fourth straight victory. “The guys have grit and they’re determined,"" coach Stephen Silas said. “The adversity part is something that we’ve been talking a lot about. I think earlier in the season adversity would hit and we would succumb to that adversity. But tonight... we put forth the right energy to overcome it."" A driving layup by Oladipo extended the lead to 101-98 with 26.2 seconds to go and Gary Trent Jr. missed a layup on the other end. Christian Wood made one of two free throws about 10 seconds later, before Anfernee Simons cut the lead to one with a 3-pointer with 3.1 seconds remaining. Eric Gordon made two free throws with 2.1 seconds to go and Simons missed a shot at the buzzer to give Houston the win. Wood finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds in his return after missing three games with a sprained right ankle. John Wall had 20. Wall said things are much better in Houston now the drama surrounding James Harden's desire to be traded is over. Harden was traded to Brooklyn on Jan. 13. “It was kind of hard to play through that and find a chemistry,"" Wall said. “And once we made the trades happen and we got the team that we wanted and the guys that wanted to be here and once we all committed to what we wanted to do, we were going to be a good team. Everybody has something to prove."" Damian Lillard had 30 points and nine assists for Portland, and Trent added 23 points and tied a career high by making seven 3-pointers. “We couldn’t close it out,"" Trent said.

"LaMelo Ball throws the inbounds pass off of Domantas Sabonis' back to run out the clock as the Hornets escape with a 108-105 win vs. the Pacers. (0:20) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — P.J. Washington knows he is going to have to have a bigger impact if the Charlotte Hornets hope to make a run at the postseason. The Hornets forward stepped up his game Friday night with 19 points and nine rebounds as Charlotte avenged an earlier loss to Indiana with a 108-105 win over the Pacers. Terry Rozier scored 19 points and Devonte Graham added 14 points and 10 assists as the Hornets bounced back from a 116-106 loss to the Pacers two nights earlier. “He's definitely the X-factor,"" Graham said of Washington, who plays the five-spot for the Hornets when they go to a smaller lineup. ""Coach (James) Borrego has been on him non-stop just about being aggressive and coming out with that hunger.” Washington, who came in averaging 12.6 points, was apparently listening to Borrego. He was aggressive early, hitting his first seven shots, including three 3-pointers. That helped spread the Pacers' defense and open up the passing lanes for the Hornets, who finished with a season-high 35 assists and shot 50.6% from the field. “We are a real unselfish team and we like playing together,” Graham said. Domantas Sabonis led the Pacers with 22 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, nearly duplicating the triple-double he had on Wednesday night. Malcolm Brogdon scored 21 points and Myles Turner had 20 points. The Hornets led by nine in the fourth quarter before the Pacers battled back and took the lead with three minutes remaining on a one-handed turnaround jumper from the baseline by Turner, who beat the shot clock. The lead changed hands a few times before Rozier knocked down a 3-pointer from the left wing and Graham buried a transition 3 to put Charlotte up by five. Brodgon cut the lead to three on a driving layup. After a Charlotte turnover, the Pacers had a chance to tie, but Brodgon's 3-point try bounced off the back of the rim with 6 seconds left and the Pacers couldn't get the rebound. “We didn’t really establish our defense,” Turner said. ""It seemed like every time we missed a rebound, they would convert a 3. It was the multitude of rebounds and stops that we missed” TIP INS Pacers: Doug McDermott had 11 points in 17 minutes after scoring 28 against the Hornets on Wednesday night. Hornets: Ball had the highlight of the game in the third quarter when he leaped to grab a missed layup by Graham and dunked hard over Sabonis. ... The Hornets shot a season-best 61% in the first half to build a 64-60 lead at break. ... Charlotte held Indiana to 45 points in the second half. BALL'S EFFORT Rookie LaMelo Ball, who has been struggling, came alive with 16 points, seven assists and six rebounds as the Hornets won for the second time in eight games. Ball was 0 for 6 from 3-point range and had five turnovers, but still managed to make an impact in other ways, including a highlight reel dunk over Sabonis on an offensive rebound. “I thought he came in, he gave us great minutes with his pace and energy,"" Borrego said. ""Our pace picked up when he came in.” SPLITTING TIME This is the third time the Pacers have played the same team in back-to-back games this season as part of the NBA's new COVID-impacted schedule — and every time they have split the series. “I was just fine with the scheduling the way it was and our players are continuing to stay safe and following the NBA protocols and the rules and they’re very determined,"" Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. ""They don’t make any excuses about anything – about not being able to leave the hotel or being around people. They’re following the rules. They’re doing a good job of that. We were together here for a few days out on the road, it’s a lot of time to bond together as a team. We fought tonight. We just got beat.”","401267448"
"Paul George discusses being placed with Kawhi Leonard in the NBA's health and safety protocols for four days due to contact tracing. (0:21) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Curious how sharp Kawhi Leonard and Paul George would be in their first games back following five-day layoffs, the Los Angeles Clippers didn’t have to wait long for answers Friday night. The superstar forwards combined for 35 first-quarter points and both delivered thunderous dunks over Orlando players later in the first half in the Clippers’ 116-90 victory over the Magic. George had 26 points, nine rebounds and five assists, and Leonard added 24 points after they missed two games because of NBA contact tracing protocols. George attacked the rim and soared high over center Nikola Vucevic for a dynamic dunk in the first quarter. Leonard beat Aaron Gordon off the dribble in the second period and jammed to bring his teammates on the nearby bench to their feet in the second quarter. Clearly, both superstars were back for a Clippers team that beat Orlando for a 14th consecutive time — a winning streak that dates to Nov. 6, 2013. “Both … it was a tie. We both a great one,” George said when asked which dunk was better between him and Leonard. “I’m just going at the rim with force, using my athleticism until my athleticism is gone. I’ve still got a little left in the tank.” Leonard and George both played 28 minutes and were rested early in the fourth quarter after the lead ballooned to as much as 27 points. Leonard made 8 of 15 shots, had a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first half and passed to Reggie Jackson for another buzzer-beater at the end of the third quarter. George made 10 of 19 shots and 3 of 9 3-pointers. The Clippers were a plus-27 with George on the floor and a plus-23 with Leonard. “I was super relieved that we were both healthy, first and foremost,” George said. “We had been playing so well that it was unfortunate that we had to take the hiatus, but safety is first.” Serge Ibaka added 13 points and nine rebounds for a Clippers team that is 13-2 this season when leading at halftime. Orlando scored the first 11 points of the second half to get within three, but the Clippers outscored the Magic 28-11 the rest of the third period to take a 90-71 edge into the final period. “On a night where guys were a little tired, just having their presence was huge and that was big for us,” Clippers coach Ty Lue said of the firepower provided by George and Leonard following Orlando’s brief third-period run. “They were just making plays for everybody else and making the game easy.” Once 6-2, Orlando lost for a 10th time in the past 12 games. The Magic’s frustrations showed in the third period when Vucevic and coach Steve Clifford were hit with technical fouls just seconds apart for arguing with referee Aaron Smith over a non-call. Terrence Ross led the Magic with 24 points off the bench. Vucevic, Orlando’s most consistent player all season, finished with just 10 after hitting only four of 13 shots. Orlando shot 36 percent from the floor. “(The Clippers) are terrific and they played well,” Clifford aid. “Their superstars are two of the, whatever, 8-to-10 best players in the league and they played like it. That makes it hard.” TIP INS Clippers: The start was moved to 8 p.m. by the NBA to allow for more time for players’ COVID-19 tests to be finalized and evaluated. The NBA has already had to postpone 22 games thus far — 21 of them coming since Jan. 10. ... Patrick Beverley missed his third straight game with a sore knee. Magic: Vucevic has potentially put himself in position to be an All-Star again by greatly improving his 3-point shooting. After making just seven 3s in his first five NBA seasons, Vucevic has steadily made more 3-pointers each of the past five years. He came into Friday having hit 52 of 117 3s — easily the most among NBA centers. ... Michael Carter-Williams, who hoped to play Friday, re-injured his sprained left foot in practice Thursday.","401267449"
"The Wizards' Russell Westbrook is ejected from the game vs. the Hawks after receiving his second technical foul. (0:59) WASHINGTON -- — The jawing and the chippiness kept accumulating in a game Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce called “messy” and “wild.” So did the technical fouls — nine total — and ejections — three in all, including for Russell Westbrook and Rajon Rondo, as Atlanta held NBA scoring leader Bradley Beal to a season low in points, and Trae Young’s 41 helped the Hawks top the Washington Wizards 116-100 Friday night. “Just need to stay focused,” Atlanta's Danilo Gallinari said. “Personally I don’t have all that energy to spend on technicals and talking to refs and stuff.” Westbrook, who matched Beal with 26 points and repeatedly traded words with Rondo, blamed himself for getting tossed in the fourth quarter. Rondo waved goodbye as Westbrook left. “I can't allow myself to stoop down to anybody’s level. It's not my character,” the past NBA MVP said. “I take full responsibility with all of that. I don’t agree with the second tech, but that’s neither here nor there.” Wizards coach Scott Brooks also thought Westbrook should have been called for a personal foul there, saying that if “you’re going to call that, you might as well call them early in the game.” But referee Mark Ayotte said a technical was warranted because Westbrook pushed Rondo, calling it physical taunt. Young scored 18 in the fourth quarter to hold off a comeback by Washington, which trailed by as many as 23 in the third but got within 10 in the final period. ""He just gives us multi-layered, multi-level, attack mentality,"" Pierce said. The subject of trade speculation, Beal came in averaging 35.4 points for a last-place Wizards team that has been short-handed because of COVID-19 issues, recently had a half-dozen games in a row postponed and is now 3-12. But with Cam Reddish playing tough defense, Beal missed all eight attempts from 3-point range Friday and entered the fourth quarter with just 13 points. “I just didn’t have it going,” Beal said. “I told the guys I gave them nothing. I’ve got to be a lot better."" He drew one of the six techs whistled on Washington, which lost center Robin Lopez in the second half after he got two back-to-back. “Just too many techs — on both sides,” Beal said. The Wizards are 0-4 since returning from a series of postponements that left them without a game for 13 days. Six players tested positive for COVID-19, and another three were sidelined after contact tracing. Rui Hachimura, Davis Bertans and Moe Wagner returned Friday. Brooks expects Deni Avdija, Troy Brown Jr. and Ish Smith to be back for Washington's next game. “We understand that nobody’s going to feel sorry for us,” Beal said. “We’ve got to dig ourselves out of this hole.” TIP-INS Hawks: De'Andre Hunter left in the first half with an injured right knee. ... Clint Capela's 14 rebounds gave him 14 straight games with at least 10. Wizards: Westbrook's four assists raised his total to 7,394 and moved him past Maurice Cheeks (7,392) for 13th on the NBA career list. T 'EM UP! Westbrook and Rondo were separated by an official and both assessed technical fouls with a minute left in the first half. Beal got a tech in the third quarter, upset after no foul was called when he took a hard fall at the offensive end. Soon after, he was jawing back-and-forth with Rondo, who was on the Atlanta sideline and not in the game at the time. ... Lopez was out of the game in the third quarter when Beal was called for a delay of game before attempting a free throw. A medical mask pulled down below his nose and mouth, Lopez said something to an official that prompted his one-after-the-other techs.","401267450"
"Immanuel Quickley connects on a trio of 3-pointers and celebrates by swimming on the court. (0:46) NEW YORK -- — Rookie guard Immanuel Quickley scored 25 points off the bench, leading the New York Knicks to a 102-81 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night. Quickley was one of five players to score in double figures for New York, which snapped a three-game losing streak. R.J. Barrett scored 24 points, Julius Randle finished with 16 and Austin Rivers 13. While New York appeared to get back on track, Cleveland lost for the third time in four games. Darius Garland scored 24 points, Collin Sexton added 17 and Jarrett Allen 15. “We just didn't bring it tonight,” Garland said. New York’s defense proved troublesome for Cleveland, which was held to a season low in points. After a sluggish opening 12 minutes, the Knicks went into the half with a 47-33 lead. New York outscored the Cavaliers 28-16 in the second quarter and limited Cleveland to 6-of-19 shooting from the field. For the game, New York held the Cavaliers to 34.9% shooting. “We harp on being one of the top defensive teams in the league,” Quickley said, later adding the Knicks are “trying to get in the playoffs this year.” The last time New York qualified for the playoffs was in 2012-13. While Cleveland was misfiring, the Knicks built on their advantage. New York ended the third quarter on a 12-1 run, highlighted by Quickley’s 3-pointer with 0.5 seconds left that extended the lead to 72-55. Quickley’s alley-oop to Nerlens Noel for a one-handed slam with 8:29 left in the fourth allowed New York to stretch the lead to 19 at 84-65. “He's always been good,” Barrett said of Quickley. “He's playing hard. He's making plays.” TIP-INS: Cavaliers: Entering Friday's game, the Cavaliers ranked second in the NBA with a 1.21 points per possession in transition, and their 59.1% field goal accuracy in transition leads the league. Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff pointed to his small unit as a reason for his team’s success in transition. “They’re fast,” Bickerstaff said before the game. “That gives us an opportunity to play in transition in the broken floor. They can space the floor. We have guys who can shoot it. And then especially when you put guys who can attack the rim like our bigs can in pick-and-roll, and you give them more space that’s beneficial for us.” Knicks: Prior to the game, New York head coach Tom Thibodeau paid homage to John Chaney, the legendary Temple University coach who died Friday. Thibodeau was an assistant with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1994-95 and 1995-96 and grew to admire Chaney. “I got to know him a little bit,” Thibodeau said. “He was just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” ... Thibodeau said Frank Ntilikina is “getting there,” as the third-year guard recuperates from a sprained right knee. Ntilikina, who suffered the injury in the Knicks’ 95-86 win over the Cavaliers in Cleveland on Dec. 29, is averaging 4.5 points in four games this season, and is scheduled to become a restricted free agent at the end of the season. “He’s moving well in practice,” Thibodeau said. ... The Knicks held a moment of silence for Harthorne Wingo, who passed away on Jan. 20 but whose death became known Tuesday. He was 73. Wingo played for New York from 1972-76, and was a member of the franchise’s last championship-winning team in 1972-73.","401267451"
"Kyle Lowry is tossed from the game to the surprise of Kyle Lowry and several other members of the Raptors. (0:51) TAMPA, Fla. -- — The Sacramento Kings are starting to feel things going their way. “Things are turning in the right direction,” Harrison Barnes said after scoring 26 points Friday night in Sacramento's 126-124 victory over the Toronto Raptors, the Kings' third straight win. “There's some joy in being in these games and winning, but there's no time to sit back and relax. We have to keep that edge and keep hustling.” De'Aaron Fox added 24 for the Kings, who haven't lost since Jan. 20. Their scheduled six-game Eastern swing has been reduced to four games by a couple of postponements, and they have won twice in Florida. Buddy Hield had 22 points and Hassan Whiteside came off the bench with 16 points and nine rebounds for the Kings (8-10) in his second game back after missing four games with a hip injury. “That was huge,” Barnes said of Whiteside's 20-minute contribution. “He's still getting his legs underneath him but he gives us a different look, puts pressure on the defense.” Sacramento shot 55% overall to offset nine fourth-quarter turnovers. Pascal Siakam scored 32 points for the Raptors (7-12). Fred VanVleet had 26 points and six assists. “We didn't play well enough in the first half, and you don't do that in this league,” said Siakam, whose drives got most of the Sacramento frontcourt in foul trouble and got him 14 free throws. “We did a pretty good coming back but you can't get behind like that.” Barnes scored 13 points in the first quarter, nine during a 17-2 run that carried into the second quarter and left Sacramento with a 17-point lead. The Kings led 68-58 after a first half in which they shot 54.8%. Sacramento led by 18 at one point and by double digits throughout the second half until Yuta Watanabe's 3-pointer brought the Raptors within seven with 6:02 remaining. A layup by Watanabe got the Raptors within one with 1:08 left, but Tyrese Haliburton answered with a 3-pointer for Sacramento, putting Toronto into a fouling mode in the final 44 seconds.

"The Pelicans offense was firing on all cylinders as they controlled the entire game against the Bucks en route to a 131-126 win. (2:10) NEW ORLEANS -- — With the mercurial Lonzo Ball looking more engaged, aggressive and accurate from the perimeter, the New Orleans Pelicans looked as capable against elite competition as they have all season. Ball highlighted a season-best 27-point performance with seven 3-pointers and the Pelicans held off a furious Milwaukee rally to beat the Bucks 131-126 on Friday night. “It’s just about staying aggressive and staying true to the work I put in,” said Ball, who also had eight assists. “I knew it was going to turn around sooner or later.” Now the question is whether the Pelicans can sustain it. “It's just a lot more fluid, a lot more guys in rhythm and we get better quality shots,” Ball said. “So, we got to kind of use tonight as a blueprint.” Brandon Ingram scored 28 points, and Zion Williamson had 21 points, nine rebounds and a career-best seven assists to help New Orleans prevent the Bucks from erasing a 28-point deficit during the game's final 17 minutes. “I never felt like the win was in doubt,"" Williamson said. “We responded well. ... When everybody is playing with high confidence, it’s great for the team and it gives us multiple scoring threats.” Eric Bledsoe also hit seven 3s and scored 25 for the Pelicans, who combined to make 21 from deep. Steven Adams grabbed a season-high 20 rebounds. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 38 points and 11 rebounds, and former Pelican Jrue Holiday scored 22 for Milwaukee, which trailed nearly the entire game, usually by double-digits. “Hats off to them. They were hitting everything and from 3,” Holiday said. “Contested shots, open shots, just were making shots. They came to play.” The Pelicans appeared firmly in control when Ball's jumper made it 93-65 with 4:35 left in the third quarter. “I do think the first 30 minutes of the game showed the possibilities at least of what we can be,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “Granted, we were making a lot of shots. But for 30 minutes, we even guarded pretty well. Then we didn’t guard at all in the last 18 minutes.” Khris Middleton's turnaround jumper began a head-spinning 20-3 Milwaukee run during a span of 3:08 late in the third period. Antetokounmpo hit a 3 and capped the surge with a spinning dribble for a layup while he was fouled. “I kind of like the way we came out in the second half,” Antetokounmpo said. “We were hungry and it’s a thing that we've got to do for a longer period of the game.” Milwaukee's deficit was down to single digits when Pat Connaughton's layup made it 98-89, but the Pelicans scored the last five points of the quarter, including Nicolo Melli's 3 as the period ended, to stem the tide. After that, the Pelicans kept their lead around 10 points until less than two minutes remained. The Pelicans, who came in having won just two of their last 10 games, shot 57.1% in the first 24 minutes, including 12 of 21 from 3-point range. They led 47-28 after Nickeil Alexander-Walker made a layup over Brook Lopez and high off the glass, then intercepted Antetokounmpo's pass and drove straight back in for a dunk. Bledsoe, who came to New Orleans as part of a multiple-team trade sending Holiday to Milwaukee, hit five of his first six 3-point shots and had 17 points before halftime. Pelicans reserve guard Josh Hart made all four of his shots in the second quarter, three from deep. The Bucks struggled just to make open shots in the first half, hitting 37%, while also turning the ball over eight times. TIP-INS Bucks: Middleton finished with 16 points, as did Lopez, while Donte DiVincenzo had 10 points. ...

HONORING HOLIDAY The approximately 1,400 fans in attendance bellowed a familiar, elongated “Jruuuuue,” when Holiday was introduced as a Milwaukee starter. It was the same way fans in New Orleans greeted Holiday during the previous seven seasons. During an early timeout, a tribute was shown on the video board honoring Holiday's play and community service while he was in New Orleans. He and his wife, former international soccer star Lauren Holiday, notably donated more than $5 million to support Black-owned businesses seeking help during the pandemic. The video drew enthusiastic applause. “If there’s one thing I know about New Orleans, it’s that they love the players that embrace the city and try to make this home for them,” Holiday said. ""That’s what I tried to do. I love the city.” QUOTABLE “If you miss as many shots as I do, you better bloody do something else,"" Adams said about his game-high rebounding, which came two days after his 18 rebounds in a win over Washington.

"Tobias Harris shows no mercy as he puts Jaden McDaniels on a poster late in the fourth quarter. (0:20) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Joel Embiid racked up 37 points and 11 rebounds in 27 minutes, leading the Philadelphia 76ers to a 118-94 victory over the depleted Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. Tobias Harris added 17 points and 11 rebounds for the 76ers (14-6), as the Eastern Conference leaders cruised away after a five-point halftime lead on the worst team in the Western Conference. Embiid went 16 for 18 from the free throw line, as a Timberwolves team missing centers Karl-Anthony Towns and Naz Reid was no match. Coming off a win on Wednesday over the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, when Harris hit the go-ahead jumper with 3 seconds left, the Sixers avoided the type of letdown that has dogged them in the past. “I thought Joel posted deeper in the second half. We were waiting for them to trap, and they didn’t, so we just kept going to him,” Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said. Embiid was a game-time decision due to back tightness, but the smooth-moving 7-footer sure didn't show much sluggishness as the 76ers beat the Wolves (4-14) for the seventh straight time. “You’ve got to keep pushing, I want us to build momentum,"" Embiid said. ""We've got to keep winning these games, every single one of them, and nights like tonight can help in the long run where I don't have to play 30 minutes or more.” The 76ers could use more production from Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Danny Green, who shot a combined 4 for 13 from the floor in the first half, but that wasn’t necessary on this night. The three-time All-Star Embiid, who entered the evening fourth in the NBA in scoring, had his ninth 20-point half of the season, tied for the most in the league. He finished 10 for 19 from the floor. “It’s just dominance on his part. I think he’s figured it out, and he’s done such a good job of creating plays for other guys out of the post,” Harris said, later adding: “It's a pleasure to be out there on the floor with him.” With Towns out for the seventh straight game due to COVID-19 protocols and Reid sidelined for the first time by a wrist injury, Ed Davis took the big man spot for Minnesota with a four-guard lineup featuring rookie Anthony Edwards (15 points) in his first career start. This was the 10th different starting lineup used by coach Ryan Saunders in 18 games. “We knew what we were up against, how physical they are even when you’re at a full roster,” Saunders said. Malik Beasley led the Timberwolves with 22 points, and D'Angelo Russell added 14 points on just 3-for-11 shooting after a three-game absence due to a quadriceps injury. Davis did his best, and the Wolves scrapped their way through the first half to keep the score close until Embiid took over in the third quarter, but playing this short-handed they were never going to keep up with 18 turnovers. “We don’t play in our system enough. I think we kind of get away from it when things start going bad,” Russell said. TIP-INS 76ers: Harris had his second double-double of the season. ... Mike Scott missed his seventh straight game with knee swelling. Timberwolves: The last time Minnesota beat Philadelphia was here on Nov. 17, 2016, the only win over Embiid. ... Jarrett Culver missed his second straight game with a sprained ankle, and Juancho Hernangómez was sidelined for the eighth consecutive game due to COVID-19 protocols. That left the Wolves without three of their top six scorers and four of their nine most-used players. AT THE LINE Embiid leads the NBA in free throw attempts and makes, and this was his fifth game of the season with 16 or more tries. “A lot of people I guess call it flopping and all that stuff, but the way I see it is just about being smarter than your opponent,” Embiid said.","401267454"

It was his third triple-double since joining the Nets two weeks ago. He said the process of working with Irving is coming along. “We’ve just got to find that balance of when to be aggressive and when to make plays,"" he said. ""I think even with our aggressiveness, we’re still playmakers. I think throughout the course of the game, we did a really good job of getting our guys involved, but then being aggressive and scoring the ball as well. Nothing really changes, even when KD is in the lineup as well.” Theo Maledon, a 19-year-old rookie, scored 24 points and was perfect on six shots from 3-point range for the Thunder. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points and Hamidou Diallo added 18 for Oklahoma City. The Nets led by nine at the end of the first quarter, then scored the first 10 points of the second to take a 46-27 lead and forced the Thunder to call a timeout. The Nets kept it going after the interruption, scoring five more points before the Thunder got on the board in the quarter. It took the Thunder nearly 3½ minutes to score in the period. “We were active on both ends of the floor,” Harden said. ""Coaches drew up a beautiful game plan and we executed on both ends of the ball. We like to see carryover and these last few games, we’ve been carrying over. We’ve been playing well.” The Nets led 76-59 at halftime -- their season high point total for a first half and the most the Thunder have allowed in any half this season. Harden had 17 points on 6-for-8 shooting before the break. Brooklyn made 15 of 23 shots in the third to take a 115-94 lead into the fourth quarter. “It was tough to defend them,” Oklahoma City's Al Horford said. “We were never able to make up the lead they built.” TIP-INS Nets: Shot exactly 15 for 26 from the field in both the first and second quarters. ...

"DeMar DeRozan hits a 3-pointer then gets an and-1 layup to go down on the next Spurs' possession. (0:29) SAN ANTONIO -- — Gregg Popovich likes what he sees from San Antonio’s youthful roster and that’s a huge compliment from a coach who rarely gives any to his team. DeMar DeRozan had 30 points and 10 assists, Dejounte Murray scored 26 points and the Spurs beat Denver 119-109 on Friday night to snap the Nuggets’ five-game winning streak. “Of course, I liked it. They did a good job,” Popovich said. “Denver is one of the toughest teams to guard. They have such great movement. They are so well coached. They are consistent night after night in what they do, and we were able to show some pretty darn good grunt and aggressiveness, good activity. ""After the first quarter we did a good job on the boards, so it’s a good step for us."" San Antonio held Denver to 23 points in the final quarter for its third straight victory, all at home. The Spurs and the Nuggets are both 11-8, but San Antonio is fourth in the Western Conference. While two-thirds of the season remain, it’s progress for a franchise that missed the playoffs last season for the first time in 22 years. “The biggest thing for Pop is to be patient and to trust for us to be professionals,” guard Patty Mills said. Mills had 17 points and Keldon Johnson added 18 points for San Antonio. Nikola Jokic had 35 points and 10 rebounds, and Jamal Murray added 20 points for Denver. The Nuggets had not lost since falling 109-105 to the Utah Jazz on Jan. 17. “Overall, hell of a road trip,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “(Finishing the road trip at) 4-1, going home. The schedule is unforgiving.” Dejounte Murray poked the ball away from Jamal Murray and scored a contested layup over Jokic to give the Spurs a 113-103 lead with 3:08 remaining. It marked the second straight game Murray had a late steal against the opposing point guard. “That has been his constant through his time here in San Antonio and in the NBA,” Mills said. “His ability to junk things up defensively with his length.” San Antonio built a 10-point lead midway through the second quarter and regained it two minutes into the third. The Spurs used mid-range jumpers and drives to establish both leads, finishing with 54 points in the paint. Denver responded each time behind its stars, Jokic and Murray. After taking just two free throws compared to 17 from the Spurs in the first half, the Nuggets had 18 free throws in the second half. TIP-INS Nuggets: Malone said he expects Murray to play Sunday despite Denver’s point guard injuring his right hip after crashing into a stanchion near the Nuggets’ bench with 8:49 left in the fourth quarter. Murray tumbled after charging at and fouling Mills on a 3-point attempt. Murray exited the game shortly after and spent several minutes stretching and jogging to test the hip in the team’s tunnel before returning to the game with 5:29 remaining. … Denver had won three straight against San Antonio. … The Nuggets were a franchise-best 7-2 on the road through nine games entering Friday. … JaMychal Green had three points and seven rebounds after collecting 15 points and 10 rebounds against Miami on Wednesday.

"Luka Doncic calls the Mavericks' performance vs. the Jazz terrible and says it looks like the team doesn't care. (1:05) SALT LAKE CITY -- — With different players taking turns leading the offense, the Utah Jazz aren’t just winning — they are winning big. This time it was Bojan Bogdanovic’s time to shine. Emerging from a shooting slump, Bogdanovic scored 17 of his season-high 32 points in the third quarter and the Jazz completed a sweep of the Dallas Mavericks with a 120-101 victory on Friday night to run their NBA-best winning streak to 11. “Just this morning coaches said they want me to shoot more, to be aggressive, but it’s sometimes it’s hard when you’re struggling and you don’t see the ball getting through the net,” Bogdanovic said. “I’m trying to be myself trying and be aggressive no matter what percentage I’m shooting.” Even without Donovan Mitchell, who missed his second game in the concussion protocol, the Jazz (15-4) had little resistance from the Mavericks as they posted their 10th win by double digits in their streak. “This is a very special group. It starts with our stars, Rudy (Gobert) and Don, two of the most unselfish stars you’re going to find in the league, and that kind of just trickles down to every player on our roster. We just sacrifice for each other,” said Mike Conley, who scored 22 points. Luka Doncic scored 25 points and Jalen Brunson had 13 for the Mavericks (8-11), who have lost four in a row. “Terrible … I would say right now it’s looking like we don’t care, honestly, if we win games or not. We just got to have more energy and more effort,” Doncic said. Joe Ingles hit back-to-back 3-pointers in the first quarter from nearly the same spot to pass Hall of Famer John Stockton, who had 845, and become the franchise leader in 3-point field goals made. The Jazz ran out to a 37-11 lead late in the period. “They’re playing together,” coach Quin Snyder said. “We obviously all realize the whole can be greater than the sum of the parts. Everybody wins when the guys are elevating one another.” Bogdanovic, who is shooting less than 37% beyond the arc after three straight seasons above 40, is finding his groove after offseason wrist surgery. He made a season-best seven 3-pointers on 11 attempts. “It makes us a lot better when he’s aggressive like that,” Conley said. Jordan Clarkson had 18 and Gobert added 17 points and 12 rebounds for his eighth consecutive double-double. Seldom-used Juwan Morgan had career highs of 12 points, seven rebounds and three steals. Morgan even made a pair of 3s as Utah’s long-range shooting comes from just about everyone but Gobert. The Jazz have made 319 3-pointers this season -- more than any team in NBA history through 19 games. The victory marked the fifth time Utah has made 20 3-pointers in a game. Weakened by multiple injuries and virus absences this season, the Mavs acknowledged a lack of chemistry after Wednesday’s loss to Utah but also said they just aren’t playing hard enough. Again, the Mavericks were a step slower to loose balls and rebounds through the game. “I thought we played harder. We just didn’t play well at the beginning. Look, the offensive rebounds they got -- that was a big, big problem. And that is attention to detail. That was not good,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. The Jazz held the Mavericks to 3-of-19 shooting and a season-low 12 points in the first quarter. In one stretch, the Jazz stole the ball on three straight Dallas possessions. By halftime, the Mavericks cut the lead to 61-45 on the strength of Doncic’s 17 first-half points. TIP-INS Mavericks: The Mavericks held a lead for 19 seconds in this game after not leading at all in Wednesday’s game. … Kristaps Porzingis picked up his fifth foul early in the third quarter. … Dallas was outrebounded 56-40. Jazz: Mitchell was announced as the recipient of the offseason NBA Cares Community Assist Award in recognition of his continued efforts to advance social justice and champion education. … Favors missed his second game with lower back soreness. … Gobert, who is barely making half his free throw attempts this season, made seven straight.","401267457"
"Zach LaVine puts the Bulls up by five with a late 3-pointer. (0:26) CHICAGO -- — Damian Lillard hit a fadeaway 3-pointer as time expired to give the Portland Trail Blazers a 123-122 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night. Lillard finished with 44 points on eight 3-pointers. It appeared the Bulls had the game in control after Coby White made a pair of free throws to give them a 122-117 lead with 11.5 seconds left. Lillard came down and hit a long 3-pointer with 8.2 seconds to play. Following the inbounds, the Blazers trapped Zach LaVine in the corner and forced a jump ball with 6.2 seconds left. Gary Trent Jr. was able to control the jump ball over the athletic LaVine. Lillard picked up the loose ball and fired a 3 from near the sideline to win it. “I think this one is special because in these situations, where we are down five with I think 11 seconds left, those are moments where the winning team thinks they have the game pretty much wrapped up and the opposing team is discouraged,” Lillard said. “(The coaching staff) will all tell you I am the most ambitious person in the world. They take me out when we're down 10 with 15 seconds left and I am coming out of the game (ticked) off. In my head, I play out every situation how we can somehow come out on top. This is special because it usually never works out how I see it in my head.” Blazers coach Terry Stotts knows Lillard will always give the Blazers a chance with his no-quit attitude. “I know what Dame is going to give you. He's going to give his effort. He never quits. No matter how far we are down he always believes we have a chance to win, and that attitude, that confidence is infectious,” Stotts said. After blowing a 20-point lead in the first half and losing to Chicago at home, the Blazers followed that up by blowing a 19-point lead in the third quarter. Lauri Markkanen and Tomas Satoransky brought the Bulls back with back-to-backs 3s to give Chicago a 103-101 lead with 7:58 left in the game. LaVine's 3-pointer with 32.1 seconds left to put Chicago up 120-115. Chicago coach Billy Donovan thought the jump ball was called too quick by referee Dannica Mosher. “It was about as quick as a jump ball as I’ve ever seen. You can’t challenge that. I didn’t think it was a really good call at that point and time,” Donovan said. “Listen, we have to be stronger in those situations. I could’ve helped a little more by possibly calling a timeout to advance the ball.” Enes Kanter had 22 points and 11 rebounds for Portland, which is 5-3 on the road. Trent finished with 18 points. Lillard extended a 64-53 halftime lead with eight quick points. He hit consecutive 3s, the second from 33 feet, to give the Blazers a 75-58 lead with 9:34 left in the third quarter. He finished with 15 points in the quarter. “He put the whole teams on his shoulders and did his thing,” Kanter said. Markkanen scored 31 points and LaVine had 26 for the Bulls. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Robert Covington was back in the starting lineup after missing two games with a concussion. Bulls: Thaddeus Young just missed a triple-double. He finished with eight points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists. Bulls: Chicago is 2-6 at the United Center.","401267458"
"LaMelo Ball tees up Miles Bridges, who loads up for a one-handed alley-oop finish. (0:18) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — LaMelo Ball has been bringing energy all season for the Charlotte Hornets off the bench. Now he may get a chance to do it as a starter. The rookie point guard made the most of his increased playing time Friday night following a first half ankle injury to starter Terry Rozier, scoring a career-high 27 points to go along with nine assists and four steals as the Charlotte Hornets handed the Milwaukee Bucks their second loss in two nights, 126-114. The Hornets outscored the Bucks by 37 when Ball was on the court, and he was difference maker in the game's final 6:09 in which Charlotte outscored Milwaukee 16-4. Hornets coach James Borrego said Ball's energy was “infectious.” “That is what makes his special, he just loves the game,"" Borrego said. “He has a great joy for his teammates and playing the game. ... The guys love playing with him and they play with more joy when he's in there. I want to coach with more joy because of him.” Ball senses the impact he has on his teammates. “I definitely feel that, even at a young age playing basketball, just getting the ball and getting out and going kind of affects people’s games, so they all do it,"" Ball said. Said teammate Miles Bridges: ""He just makes everyone around him better.” It was the second straight night the Bucks were victimized by a member of the Ball family. LaMelo's older brother, Lonzo, scored 27 points on seven 3-pointers on Friday night to lead the Pelicans to a 131-126 victory. Borrego said he will wait to see how severe Rozier's ankle injury is before making a decision on if Ball would start Monday night at Miami. Gordon Hayward added 27 points, Malik Monk had 18 and Cody Zeller chipped in with a career-best 15 rebounds for the Hornets, who beat the Pacers and Bucks on back-to-back nights. Giannis Antetokounmpo nearly had a triple-double, finishing with 34 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists for the Bucks. The two-time MVP appeared to bang knees with Miles Bridges with about seven minutes to play but remained in the game. “I think he kind of just knocked knees, so knee-to-knee,"" said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. ""He was obviously able to play. We’ll see how he feels in the morning, see how sore he is and hope for the best” Jrue Holiday had 21 points, and Khris Middleton 18 for the Bucks, They fell to 11-8. Ball was clutch down the stretch on both ends of the court. The Hornets led by two with less than three minutes to play when Hayward intercepted a Antetokounmpo and delivered a look ahead pass to Ball, who twisted his body to avoid having his shot blocked, scoring and drawing the foul. On Milwaukee's next possession Ball came up with a steal and fed Devonte Graham for a 3-pointer and soon the Hornets led by double digits. “Their activity, their hands, they created a few turnovers and they were obviously able to turn some of those turnovers into some baskets and they just out-executed us down the stretch the last two or three minutes,” Budenholzer said. TIP INS Bucks: Antetokounmpo was just 10 of 18 from the free throw line. Hornets: Terry Rozier left the game with a sprained right ankle in the first half and did not return. If Rozier can't play in Charlotte's next game, LaMelo Ball is expected to get his first NBA start. ... Ball was 9 of 9 from the foul line. 3-POINT DEFENSE After falling behind 20-10 to start the game, the Hornets caught fire from long range. Behind Hayward and Monk, Charlotte made 15 of its next 17 shots, including eight 3-pointers, as part of a 41-11 run. It was the second straight night the Bucks have allowed 21 made 3-pointers. “Have pride, keep your man in front of you, don’t allow them to have easy looks,"" Antetokounmpo said. “Don’t allow them to get easily to the free throw line. Rebound the ball. Make sure when we miss or make shots, you got to box (out). The little things add up in 48 minutes and then you’ll have the result of being good on defense. But if you let the guy shoot an open 3 then let somebody go backdoor, let somebody get offensive rebound then throw it to the 3-point guy so he can knock down the 3, all that builds up and you have a bad night.”","401267459"
"Late in the second quarter, Victor Oladipo knocks down 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions. (0:29) NEW ORLEANS -- — Christian Wood scored 27 points and the Houston Rockets extended their winning streak to five games with a 126-112 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday night. Victor Oladipo scored 20 points and John Wall added 15 for Houston, which shot 48.9%, led by 18 at halftime and did not allow the Pelicans to get within eight after that. “We’re moving in the right direction, for sure,"" said Rockets coach Stephen Silas, whose team has clawed back to .500 after a 4-9 start. ""Now it seems like we’re pulling together on the defensive end especially, creating good offensive off defense, moving the ball and kind of doing the things that I envisioned us doing as a group.” Wood, who played for New Orleans during part of the 2018-19 season, shot 11 of 13, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range. Oladipo and Wall each hit four 3s for Houston, which went 20 of 46 from deep. “It starts with us defensively,"" Wood said. ""Once our defense started rolling, I felt like our offense started rolling. Guys started hitting shots, now we’re making extra passes. It’s great for us when we play like that.” Zion Williamson had 26 points for the Pelicans, who looked sluggish at times after scoring 131 points in a victory over Milwaukee a night earlier. “It’s one thing if a team’s hitting shots,"" Williamson began. “But when they’re playing harder than us and hitting shots, we’re not even giving ourselves a chance."" Brandon Ingram and Eric Bledsoe each scored 15 for New Orleans, which came in having won two straight. Williamson hit three baskets during a 14-1 Pelicans run in the third quarter that briefly cut Houston's lead to 86-78. But an unusual play soon after helped Houston take control for good. Jaxson Hayes was called for a flagrant-1 foul for stepping into Cousins’ landing space as the Rockets’ power forward came down from a missed 3. Cousins landed on Hayes' foot before falling to the floor. He got up and made two of three free throws, and the Rockets made it a 5-point possession on Jae'Sean Tate’s 3, which put Houston up 94-80. Houston's lead eventually ballooned to 24. ""To me, defend, rebound, take care of the ball, and 90% of the time you’ll at least have a chance coming down at the end,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We’re not defending and we’re sporadic when taking care of the ball. Well, it’s going to be hard to get any kind of consistency. It just is.” TIP-INS Rockets: Former Pelican Eric Gordon scored 14 points and Tate finished with 13 points and nine rebounds. ... The Rockets combined for 32 assists, nine by Wall. “Guys are passing up good shots to get great shots,” Silas said. “The selflessness of the group is shining through and it's a result of the roster that we have and the style of play that we have.” Pelicans: Nickeil Alexander Walker scored 13 and Hayes 10. ... Steven Adams left with a right calf injury which Van Gundy said did not appear serious. ... First-round draft choice Kira Lewis Jr. saw action in his eighth game this season in the fourth quarter. He scored 10 points in 10 minutes, hitting both 3s he took. ... JJ Redick did not play for a second straight game despite being healthy. PIVOTAL STRETCH The Pelicans led by as many as 11 when Williamson’s 3 made it 35-24 late in the first quarter. New Orleans was still up 10 when Hayes threw down a reverse, two-handed alley-oop dunk on a fast-break lob from Josh Hart early in the second quarter. But the Rockets began scoring seemingly at will. They scored 48 in the second quarter alone, the most points the Pelicans have ever allowed in that quarter of a game. The Pelicans’ last lead evaporated on Oladipo’s 3 with 5:36 left in the second quarter, which tied it at 46. That basket marked the beginning of a 32-11 run to close out the half. Oladipo hit three more 3s during that span, during which Wood hit two from deep, with Wall and Sterling Brown each hitting one. Nothing embodied the Pelicans’ defensive slippage more than the final play of the half. With only seconds left, New Orleans didn’t pressure the ball in the backcourt, so Oladipo let the inbound pass roll across half court without burning any time off of the clock before picking it up and hitting an uncontested left-wing 3 to give the Rockets a 75-57 halftime lead.","401267460"
"Richaun Holmes puts up a desperation shot at the horn, but Bam Adebayo gets a fingertip on the ball to secure the Heat's 1-point win. (0:37) MIAMI -- — Jimmy Butler returned, and made sure the Miami Heat got back to their winning ways. Butler scored a season-high 30 points after missing 10 games because of the NBA’s virus-related protocols, including the go-ahead layup with 42.1 seconds left, and the Heat defeated the Sacramento Kings 105-104 on Saturday night to end a five-game losing streak. “You simply cannot put a modern-day analytic to Jimmy’s will to win,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “He was not going to let us lose, no matter what it took.” Butler played 34 minutes, finishing with eight assists and seven rebounds. “We're going to build off of this,"" Butler said. “So much to get better at, but we can do it. We're going to turn this around."" De’Aaron Fox scored 30 for Sacramento, 17 of those coming in the fourth. Buddy Hield had 18 for the Kings — including a steal that he turned into a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:44 left, putting the Kings up 104-103. Butler had the night’s final score, though, and the Heat escaped. “Great player,"" Sacramento's Harrison Barnes said. “He definitely gives that team a different look, a different lift."" Sacramento had a last-ditch chance at the end, but Richaun Holmes' jumper got deflected by Miami's Bam Adebayo. Butler had a big say in that play as well, helping force the ball out of Fox's hands with a double-team. “They made a big-time play at the end,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said of the Heat. Adebayo had 18 points and 13 rebounds for Miami, which got 15 points from Tyler Herro and 14 from Duncan Robinson. Kelly Olynyk scored 11 for the Heat, who were still without Goran Dragic and used their 14th lineup in 19 games this season. Marvin Bagley scored 17 for Sacramento, which was playing its third game in four nights and saw its three-game winning streak snapped. Barnes scored 11 for the Kings. Butler scored 20 points by halftime, 14 of them coming in the second quarter. The Heat trailed most of the first half, briefly held the lead late and went into intermission down 59-57 after Tyrese Haliburton beat the halftime buzzer with a 3-pointer. Miami outscored the Kings by nine in the third, taking an 84-77 lead into the final period and led nearly the entire fourth — until Hield's late 3, but Butler ensured Miami's slide would finally end. “We've just got to go out there and do our job,"" Butler said. “It starts now."" TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento was 5 for 11 from the foul line, while Miami was 22 for 26. ... When the Kings fell behind by 10 early in the fourth quarter, it was the first time they faced a double-digit deficit in their last four games.

They were 27-5 in their building last season. TESTING ISSUES Herro revealed postgame that he learned a housemate has tested positive for COVID-19; he got that news at halftime. And Miami didn't play Kendrick Nunn because he was awaiting a COVID-19 test result when the game started. Nunn was cleared by the second quarter and could have played, but Spoelstra elected to not use him. O CANADA Olynyk’s first basket gave him 5,000 career points, making him the fourth Canadian-born player to hit that NBA milestone after Andrew Wiggins, Rick Fox and Tristan Thompson. Denver’s Jamal Murray will be next; he’s 36 points away. Steve Nash, the two-time NBA MVP and now Brooklyn Nets coach -- generally considered the best Canadian player ever -- was born in South Africa. BUDDY BALL Hield extended the NBA’s longest active streak of games with a 3-pointer to 85, four shy of matching Dana Barros for the fourth-longest in league history. The record belongs to Golden State’s Stephen Curry, who had one in 157 consecutive games.","401267461"
"Kemba Walker misses a jumper at the buzzer and the Lakers hang on to beat the Celtics 96-95. (3:28) BOSTON -- — The Lakers started off their season-high, seven-game road trip by winning three of four before Anthony Davis was sidelined with an injury. He returned just in time to help his team avoid a third straight defeat. Davis had 27 points and 14 rebounds in his return to the lineup and Los Angeles hung on to beat the Boston Celtics 96-95 on Saturday night when Daniel Theis missed a follow shot at the buzzer. LeBron James finished with 21 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in the first meeting of the season between the longtime rivals. Montrezl Harrell added 16 points for the Lakers, who lost in Detroit on Thursday when Davis rested a bruised right quadriceps. “For me, personally, it's getting back in attack mode,” Davis said. “Being aggressive. Crashing the offensive glass. Being in the paint. All those types of things. Everything that I did tonight.” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said the energy was completely different with Davis back on the floor. “He’s built up. He’s getting into that mode right now. He’s starting to pick it up. The injury set him back a little bit. ... But we want him to be assertive. And when he’s assertive on both sides of the ball, we’re very difficult to beat."" Jayson Tatum finished with 30 points and nine rebounds for the Celtics. Jaylen Brown added 28 points. Boston has lost five out of its last seven. The Celtics played the final 10:28 of the game without Marcus Smart, who was helped off the court with what the team said was a left calf strain following a collision with Harrell underneath the basket. Harrell tipped in a missed layup and stepped on Smart’s foot as he came down. Smart crumpled to the court. He was helped to his feet but couldn’t put any pressure on his leg as trainers carried him to the locker room. An MRI is planned for Sunday to get an extent of the injury. The Lakers surged following the injury. James broke an 85-all tie with a 3-pointer with 5:25 to play. The lead grew as high as 96-89. But a pair of free throws by Kemba Walker, a jumper by Tatum and turnover by James gave the Celtics life with 39 seconds remaining. Boston got the ball out of a timeout to Tatum, who got a floater to go in to cut the deficit to 96-95 and set up the final exchange. Walker knocked away Davis' jumper and then missed a jumper on the other end. Theis swooped in but couldn't get the follow to fall. “I like the shot that we got,"" Brown said of Walker's jumper. “We’ll take that 10 out of 10 times.” Smart’s injury was the latest blow to a Boston lineup that was playing with its projected starting lineup of Smart, Walker, Tatum, Brown and Theis for just the second time this season. Walker missed the first 12 games of the season recovering from a procedure on his left knee and Tatum missed multiple games earlier this month with COVID-19. The Celtics recovered from an uneven start and outscored the Lakers 29-19 in the third quarter to take a 78-71 lead into the final period. Boston gave the Lakers plenty of different looks on defense, including sending multiple double-teams at Davis and using a double-big man lineup that featured Theis and Robert Williams III. Theis played some of his best minutes of the season, contributing on both ends of the floor. It included a put back dunk over Davis in the third quarter. But the Lakers' reserves outscored their counterparts 35-15. They did it with a shortened group that featured only Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, Talen Horton-Tucker and Alex Caruso. “I like the energy that they had,"" Vogel said. ""We’ve got a lot of depth, so we’ll continue to use it.” TIP-INS Lakers: Davis scored 18 points in 16 minutes in the first half. … Played without Kostas Antetokounmpo (right knee tendinitis) and Jared Dudley (sore right calf).

Chris Paul scored 16 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter and had 12 assists to help the Suns rally to beat the Dallas Mavericks 111-105. Deandre Ayton had 18 points and 17 rebounds, and Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder each scored 14 points. The Suns trailed by 15 with six minutes to play in the third quarter. “There’s obviously a comfort in having a guy like that with the ball, knowing that his intention is to make a play for the team,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said about Paul, acquired from the Oklahoma City Thunder in November, ""It could be for him to get a shot or someone else, but I think the game is a bit slower for him down the stretch. I don’t know what that is, a gene, or he just has it.” The Suns played their fourth straight game without All-Star guard Devin Booker. He's sidelined by a strained left hamstring. The teams will meet again in Dallas on Monday night. Dallas wasted a terrific performance by Luka Doncic, who scored 18 of his 29 points in the third quarter, including eight straight in a 12-0 run after the teams were tied at halftime. The Mavericks dropped their fifth consecutive game. It's their longest losing streak since dropping seven straight in March 2019. They've also lost four straight at home. “We had some loose possessions, we had some poor defensive possessions and they got the momentum back,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. “It just a really disappointing one ’cause of how hard our guys fought. But Phoenix hung in and, and they made plays and they were able to do what they had to do to get the momentum back. We’ve just simply got to do better.” Phoenix countered Dallas’ third-quarter run by scoring the first eight points of the fourth to take an 85-82 lead. The Mavericks played without Kristaps Porzingis, who sat out the second game of a back-to-back. Dallas’ two remaining big men, Willie Cauley-Stein and Dwight Powell, each fouled out. Cauley-Stein had 14 points and nine rebounds in 30 minutes, Powell eight points and two rebounds in 18 minutes. After Cauley-Stein’s tip-in at the halftime buzzer tied it at 55, Cauley-Stein hit a short jumper and Dorian Finney-Smith scored on an alley-oop pass from Doncic to put the Mavericks ahead 59-55. Doncic then scored the next eight points to put Dallas ahead 67-55 with 8:07 to play in the third. TIP-INS Suns: Ayton was sidelined for part of the first half with a left shoulder injury. … Williams said he expects Booker to return soon but wouldn’t specify a date. Mavericks: Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 19 points. He made three 3-pointers, giving him 1,001 for his career. ... Dallas shot a season-high 53% from the floor. TOP DRAFTEES MEET AGAIN Ayton and Doncic were the first and third draftees, respectively, in 2018, with Doncic then winning the 2018-19 Rookie of the Year award and being named first-team All-NBA last season. But Ayton holds the upper hand in head-to-head meetings, winning seven of eight vs. Dallas while missing two games. Doncic, having played in all 10, is 3-7 against the Suns.","401267463"
"Ja Morant drives to the hoop, dribbles behind his back, pivots and drains the basket. (0:26) SAN ANTONIO -- — The Memphis Grizzlies were eager for a fight after being idle for 12 days due to health and safety protocols surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. They got one. Ja Morant had 19 points and 11 assists, and the Grizzlies beat the San Antonio Spurs 129-112 on Saturday night for their sixth straight victory. “I would say it was a good team win,” Memphis guard De’Anthony Melton said. “We got four or five dudes in double figures. We definitely needed something like this coming off a two-week span. “It just shows our team fight. No matter what’s out there, we’re just going to continue to fight.” The Grizzlies were playing for the first time since Jan. 18 after having five games postponed primarily due to contact tracing issues. Memphis shot 56% from the field and had seven players score in double figures. Melton had 20 points, and former Spurs forward Kyle Anderson finished with 16. Reserves Gorgui Dieng and Desmond Bane added 15 points apiece. “For us to stay locked in and continue to do the things that we need to do to win just shows the work of this whole organization,” Morant said. The teams remain in San Antonio for the finale of a two-game set Monday. Spurs guard Derrick White had 18 points in his return from a 14-game absence due to a toe injury. Dejounte Murray scored 15 points, and LaMarcus Aldridge had 14. San Antonio had won three in a row, including a 119-109 victory at home against Denver on Friday. “Everybody plays back-to-backs, and it probably showed a little bit on us.” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “But everybody goes through it, you just have to play. We got outplayed tonight, that’s the bottom line.” The Spurs attempted to rally from a deficit that grew to 18 points, but the Grizzlies responded aggressively on defense each time. After Morant had the ball stolen, Anderson picked off a pass from Patty Mills that led to a dunk by John Konchar for a 104-92 lead two minutes into the final quarter. Memphis had seven steals and San Antonio committed 14 turnovers. After San Antonio pulled within six with seven minutes left, Melton drained a 3-footer to extend the lead to 109-100. Playing without injured forwards Jaren Jackson and Justice Winslow, the Grizzlies still outscored the Spurs 56-42 in the paint. When the Spurs tried to protect the interior, the Grizzlies responded by going 17 for 35 on 3-pointers. “We just got guys that can play, very versatile guys that play multiple positions,” Anderson said. “Coach (Taylor Jenkins) gives confidence to the guys to take those shots.” TIP-INS Grizzlies: C Jonas Valanciunas was active but did not play after missing Monday’s game while in the league’s health and safety protocol. Valanciunas is expected to play Monday against San Antonio. ... Reserve PG Grayson Allen is in the league’s health and safety protocols and is not with the team on this road trip. ... Morant had 44 points and nine assists in the Grizzlies’ season-opening 131-119 loss to the Spurs on Dec. 23. Spurs: DeMar DeRozan was assessed a technical foul two minutes into the second half after getting tangled up with Dillon Brooks. ... Aldridge collected his 3,000th rebound with the Spurs, joining Tim Duncan, David Robinson, George Gervin, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili as the only players in franchise history to accomplish the milestone. … The Grizzlies scored 51 points on 3-pointers, which is the second-most the Spurs have allowed this season. The Jazz had 63 points on 3s in a 130-109 victory Jan. 3. Who are the free agents for the next two years? We have the lists. Center Andre Drummond is now a free agent and can sign with a contending team after reaching a buyout with the Cavaliers.","401267464"
"Klay Thompson and Draymond Green don't hold back while talking about Rodney McGruder causing a scene after the Pistons played the Warriors. (1:37) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Stephen Curry scored 28 points, knocking down six 3-pointers, and the Golden State Warriors raced to an early lead on the way to a 118-91 rout of the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. Kelly Oubre Jr. added 18 points as Golden State executed the way coach Steve Kerr has hoped for on both ends — starting with a focus on rebounding that produced a 53-49 advantage on the boards. Now, the Warriors must strive to do it consistently and against the NBA's top-tier teams. Curry shot 11 for 17, including 6 of 8 from deep, and Golden State found a far better offensive groove after shooting just 38% in Thursday's 114-93 loss at Phoenix — including 29% from 3-point range (11 for 38). “I thought we were on edge in a good way,” Kerr said. ""The other night we were embarrassed. We got away from who we are."" Jerami Grant led Detroit with 18 points, and Josh Jackson came off the bench to score 17. The Pistons, similar to Golden State, are trying to gain momentum but couldn't build off a big win two nights earlier with a cold night shooting. At 5-15, they have the second-worst record in the Eastern Conference. Detroit was coming off a 107-92 home win over the Lakers on Thursday — a game with 15 lead changes and eight ties — having scored the exact same number of points in a 122-107 loss at Cleveland a night earlier. “We just couldn’t find a rhythm. Their guys were making shots,” Jackson said. “We just didn’t have the energy and intensity that we normally have. I’m confident that we’ll find it.” Golden State has won nine of 11 at home against the Pistons, who pulled off a 111-104 win in their first visit to Chase Center last Jan. 4. Because of testing protocols, the Pistons did more of a walk-through without a morning shootaround. Finding a flow is tough for every team, Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. “I think it’s a byproduct of the season we’re going through, all the protocols, the unusual rhythm of the season,” Casey said. ""A situation where it’s abnormal, it carries over to the court.” THOMPSON ON THE MIC Injured Warriors Splash Brother Klay Thompson, sidelined for a second straight season and this time recovering from surgery for a torn right Achilles, worked the broadcast as a guest analyst. And Curry got to hang with his pal late with the game in hand. “He’s always very entertaining with his dry wit. I’ll be listening,” Kerr said. ""When I watch the tape of the game I will definitely have the volume up.” CANCEL THE FLIGHT Jordan Poole is headed to the G League bubble Sunday but his 16 points had teammates pulling for him to stay. They yelled “Cancel the flight!” Kerr shared. ""I think my teammates wanted to sign a petition for me to stay,"" Poole said. “We'll see.” TIP-INS Pistons: Went 3 for 12 to begin the game compared to 9 of 13 by the Warriors to fall behind 21-10. Detroit managed only 17 assists, shooting 9 of 36 from 3-point range. ... The Pistons are 1-8 on the road and 0-2 vs. the Western Conference. Warriors: Eric Paschall missed the second half with back spasms. ... Curry and Brad Wanamaker had seven assists apiece, and Draymond Green added six as Golden State finished with 34. ... Rookie No. 2 draft pick James Wiseman came off the bench for the fourth straight game and contributed 11 points and nine rebounds. ...

"Nikola Jokic drops 47 points, grabs 11 rebounds and dishes out five assists as Denver snaps Utah's 11-game winning streak. (2:27) DENVER -- — Jamal Murray tossed the ball at Michael Malone in mild disgust. Will Barton urged Nikola Jokic to keep scoring until he reached 50 points. Jokic’s teammates wanted him to reach the mark much more than he did. He was just happy Denver ended Utah’s 11-game winning streak. “Hopefully, I’m going to score when we need it. It’s just a game,” Jokic said. “The main thing is just win the game. I’m going to score however much I need just to win the game.” Jokic matched his career high with 47 points and the fast-starting Nuggets beat the Jazz 128-117 on Sunday to end the NBA’s longest winning streak of the season. Jokic was 17 for 26 from the field, hit all four of his 3-point attempts, made 9 of 10 free throws and had 12 rebounds and five assists. He scored 33 points in the first half. With the game in hand he went to the bench, unconcerned he was three points from hitting 50. “I told him a couple of minutes before go get 50 but you know him, he don’t care about that kind of stuff,” Barton said. “He’s just playing basketball, being aggressive, being who he is. We definitely wanted the big fella to get 5-0 tonight.” Barton added 18 points, and Murray had 16 to help the Nuggets win for the sixth time in seven games. Utah lost for the first time since Jan. 6 at New York. Bojan Bogdanovic led the Jazz with 29 points, and Donovan Mitchell had 13 in 31 minutes after missing two games while in concussion protocol. Denver hit all eight of its 3-point attempts and shot 80% in the first quarter. The Nuggets kept it going in the second, going 13 of 24 from the field and finishing 15 of 17 from long range in the first half to take a 79-54 halftime lead. “We didn’t play our best, that’s what hurts, especially the way we played the last two games against Dallas,” Mitchell said. “To have that performance and they come out and they shoot 15 of 17, that’s what hurts the most.” The lead was 86-58 with 8:11 left in the third quarter when Utah made a big run. The Jazz hit eight 3-pointers and outscored Denver by 18 to get to 99-91. “We cut the lead to single digits but you give yourself a difficult hill to climb and a small margin of error and you have to be almost perfect,” coach Quin Snyder said. JaMychal Green had all nine of his points in the fourth quarter when the Nuggets got the lead back to 20. Jokic matched his career high with a layup with 2:05 left and took a seat with 1:39 remaining to the disappointment of his teammates. “I’m oblivious. I have no idea at that point Nikola has 47,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “Jamal was kind of breaking my chops about that and I love the fact that he’s thinking about his teammate.” TIP-INS Jazz: Derrick Favors had seven points and six rebounds in his return. He missed the previous two games because of soreness in his lower back. ... Utah outscored every opponent but one by double digits during the 11-game winning streak. The only close game was a 109-105 victory over Denver on Jan. 17. ... The winning streak was the team’s longest since a 12-gamer Feb. 11-Mar. 10, 2009. The franchise record is 15 in 1996. Nuggets: G Gary Harris (left adductor strain) didn’t play after the first quarter. He didn’t attempt a shot in 8:45 of court time. ... Set season highs with the 43-point first quarter and 79-point half. MUSIC CITY Mitchell shot just 3 of 12 from the field in the loss but said he had no issues with the concussion that kept him out of the previous two games. “They started blasting music loud as hell at the start of the game so I think I’m fine,” he said. “I feel good, just trying to get my rhythm back. That’s the biggest thing, but no real effects at all.”","401267466"
"Furkan Korkmaz drains jumpers on back-to-back possessions to put the 76ers ahead of the Pacers. (0:32) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Doc Rivers threw a changeup at the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night. It turned out to be the perfect call. With his team trailing by 16 early in the fourth quarter, the Philadelphia 76ers coach switched to a zone defense — throwing off the Pacers and fueling an incredible closing run that ended with the Sixers rallying for a 119-110 victory. “We were calling it our John Chaney matchup zone and it was great,” Rivers said, referring to the trailblazing Temple coach who died Friday. “What it did was stop their movement. You miss a couple 3s early in a zone in the NBA and it becomes tough all of a sudden."" Indiana never figured it out or recovered — even with All-Star center Joel Embiid sitting out for Philadelphia because of a sore back. Instead, the 76ers outscored the Pacers 31-6 over the final eight minutes to earn their sixth win in seven games. Tobias Harris led Philadelphia with 27 points and eight rebounds. Furkan Korkmaz added 17 points, including the two biggest baskets of the game — a 17-footer with 2:30 to play that finally gave the 76ers the lead and a 19-footer on the ensuing possession to make it 109-106. But Harris thought this one was all about Philadelphia's surprise defense. “Probably five minutes and I’m not kidding,” Harris said when asked how much time the 76ers had spent talking about zone defense this season. “It was in preparation for another team. But it got us talking out there and defensively and that’s something we always say on defense. We’ve got to communicate more.” For the Pacers, it was a crushing blow. Malcolm Brogdon scored 25 points and Domantas Sabonis had 21 in a game they dominated for almost 3 1/2 quarters. Indiana seemed to be cruising when Aaron Holiday’s basket with 8:16 to play made it 104-88. But the Pacers only netted one more basket — and the 76ers took control. “It’s really about not getting stops. That’s the most frustrating thing,” Brogdon said. “I just think we didn’t get stops.” TIP-INS 76ers: Ben Simmons had 21 points, seven assists, six rebounds and four steals. ... Dwight Howard had 11 points and 15 rebounds off the bench. ... Philadelphia was 8 of 26 on 3-pointers. ... Assistant coaches Dan Burke and Popeye Jones returned to Bankers Life Fieldhouse for the first time since Indiana's offseason coaching change. Burke and Jones worked on the staff of former coach Nate McMillan for several seasons.

Holiday scored a season-high 17 points and T.J. McConnell had nine points and eight assists against his former team. ... Sabonis had eight rebounds, only his second game this season without a double-double. ... The Pacers were 10 of 28 on 3s. They had won three straight in the series. LATE SCRATCH Embiid missed his fifth game of the season after landing hard on his back in Wednesday's victory over the Lakers. The 76ers star played through the injury and had 37 points and 11 rebounds in Friday's win over Minnesota. Rivers said Embiid was still sore from the hard landing. HONORED Indiana held a moment of silence before the game in honor of NBA reporter Sekou Smith, who died Wednesday from COVID-19. He was 48.

"Kawhi Leonard meets Julius Randle at the basket with a big block and Paul George converts the block into a jumper. (0:27) NEW YORK -- — Not even the NBA's leading defensive team could slow down the surging Los Angeles Clippers. Kawhi Leonard scored 28 points and the Clippers rang up the highest point total of the season against the New York Knicks on Sunday, winning 129-115 for their 10th victory in 11 games. The Clippers shredded the NBA leaders in fewest points per game allowed to break away after leading by one at halftime. Even playing without two starters, they surpassed the 102.7 points per game the Knicks had been allowing with their first basket of the final quarter and kept pouring it on in their third straight victory. “We’re just a pretty good offensive team,” Paul George said. “We share the ball, we move it, we look for the open man, we emphasize passing up good shots for great ones and I think we do a pretty good job of doing that,"" he said. Reggie Jackson added 18 points and George had 17 for the Clippers, who made 17 3-pointers and shot 54% overall against a Knicks team that led the league in that category as well while improving to 16-5. “It’s been a good ride so far and I think we’ve got something special going on over there,” Clippers forward Marcus Morris said. Julius Randle had 27 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks. Rookie Immanuel Quickley added 25 points and RJ Barrett added 23, but scoring wasn't the problem for a Knicks team that had been limiting opponents to 42.6% shooting. “I thought offensively it was good. Defensively it’s not what we would have liked,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. The game's start time was moved up four hours by the NBA to 1 p.m., though neither that nor the Knicks' good early shooting seemed to bother the Clippers. New York made eight of its first 10 shots and led for a good part of the first half before the Clippers took a 66-65 edge into the break. Los Angeles came back from the locker room with seven straight points and didn't slow down the rest of the third quarter. Leonard and Jackson each scored 10 points in the period, when the Clippers made five 3-pointers and scored 35 points, taking a 101-91 lead to the fourth. Quickley scored eight straight points to cut a 10-point lead to 105-103, but the Clippers answered with nine in a row to open a 114-103 advantage on Leonard's basket midway through the period. An 8-0 run later in the fourth made it a 15-point game. TIP-INS Clippers: Nicolas Batum sat out with a left groin injury. Patrick Patterson started and scored 13 points, going 5 for 5 from the field with three 3-pointers. ... Lou Williams’ 250th career game with at least five assists off the bench surpassed J.J. Barea for the most such games in NBA history. Knicks: The Knicks' previous high for points allowed was 121 to Indiana in their season opener. ... Reggie Bullock, who missed the last three games with a sore neck, returned to the starting lineup and scored eight points. ... C Nerlens Noel was scratched shortly before the game with a sore left groin. GET IN THE GAME Thibodeau supports Dennis Smith Jr.'s request to play for the Knicks' G League affiliate to get some needed work. The former lottery pick acquired two years ago in the deal that sent Kristaps Porzingis to Dallas has appeared in just three games this season. “His attitude has been very positive. He’s worked hard in practice,” Thibodeau said. “I think it’s a great tool. It’s an opportunity for him to play in games, which I think is very important also, so I’m glad he’s approached it that way and I know he’s looking forward to it. So I think it’s good for him and it’s good for us.”","401267468"
"Coming off a steal, the Raptors work the ball to Terence Davis, who drives in past multiple defenders to finish with a jam (0:17) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Pascal Siakam has been getting to the rim and it's paying off for the Toronto Raptors. Siakam had 30 points and 10 rebound, leading the Raptors to a 115-102 win over the Orlando Magic on Sunday night. Siakam had his second straight 30-point game and the Raptors snapped a three-game losing streak. “I've been feeling a little better, and I've been focusing on doing the things that make my body feel good, and living with the results,” said Siakam, who had been nagged by injuries early in the season. “That's been working for me in the last few weeks. I've been healthy. I've been taking the right shots and the shots are going to fall.” Kyle Lowry had 12 points and 14 assists, and Aaron Baynes aded eight points and 16 rebounds for the Raptors. Uta Watanabe came off the bench and hit all three of his 3-pointers on the way to 11 points. Rookie Cole Anthony led Orlando with 16 points. Nikola Vucevic added 15 points and 14 rebounds for the Magic, who have lost 11 of 13. Magic forward Aaron Gordon left the game in the third quarter with an ankle injury after scoring 14 points. Orlando shot 40% for the game and the Magic's only lead came at 3-2 after a 3-pointer by Gordon. The Raptors led 58-44 after a first half in which Orlando shot 36% and Vucevic scored only three points. A couple of 3-pointers by Terence Davis helped Toronto stretch the lead to 16 points in the third quarter. Davis scored 12 points in his second start of the season. Anthony and Vucevic did most of the scoring on a modest run that helped Orlando cut the gap to eight early in the fourth quarter. But Watanabe nailed a 3-pointer and the Raptors pulled away. “I'm getting an opportunity and I'm doing my job to help the team win,” said the 26-year-old Watanabe, who has averaged 19 minutes over the last five games. “I've never had an opportunity like this and I can't take it for granted.” TIP-INS Magic: A lane runner by Evan Fournier was Orlando’s only 2-point field goal in the first 11 minutes. ...

DEFENSIVE DIFFERENCE The Raptors were 15-5 after 20 games last season, and 34-15 at the end of January in a season in which they gave up an NBA-low 106.5 points per game. “After the long (2019) playoff run, we came back and picked up right where we left off,” Nurse said. “We came back last year and we were way ahead of schedule defensively, and we’re probably a good chunk behind it this year.” Toronto has given up an average of 116.7 points in 12 losses. ROSS IN RELIEF Terrence Ross, the Raptors’ first-round draft choice in 2012, has not started a game for since Nov. 25, 2017. He has come off the bench in his last 172 games for the Magic. “He’s so comfortable in his role and he plays starter’s minutes, finishes every game,” explained Magic coach Steve Clifford. “He gives us a better chance to be balanced.”","401267469"
"Stephen A. Smith and Baby Stephen A. aren't seeing eye-to-eye about the Nets' status in the East after a heartbreaking loss to the Wizards. (2:21) WASHINGTON -- — Wizards coach Scott Brooks envisioned something like this when Washington acquired Russell Westbrook from Houston for John Wall and a draft pick. It took more time than expected because of a nagging injury, but maybe things are starting to look up for the team with the worst record in the NBA. At least for a night, they sure did. Bradley Beal and Westbrook hit 3-pointers in a wild 3.8-second sequence in the final seconds to help the Wizards stun Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets 149-146 on Sunday night. Westbrook had 41 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, and NBA scoring leader Beal had 37 points. In the fourth quarter, Beal had 22 points and Westbrook had 15. Durant, second in the NBA in scoring, also had 37 points. “Russell willed this game,” Brooks said about Westbrook, who has only played in 10 of 16 games due to a quad injury. “This is what he does. He can do it every night. He doesn’t shoot the ball well every night but he doesn’t take nights out.” With Washington down 146-141, Beal hit a 3-pointer with 8.1 seconds left. Garrison Matthews deflected Joe Harris’ inbounds pass to Westbrook and he made a 3 with 4.3 seconds left for a 147-146 lead. “It was a dumb mistake on my part,"" Harris said about the inbounds pass that led to the go-ahead basket. It was epic collapse from a team hoping to contend for an NBA title but the Nets did get a great look to force overtime. Kyrie Irving found Timothe Luwawu-Carbarrot under the basket with 2.9 seconds left, but his layup attempt spun around the rim and failed to drop. Beal added two free throws with 0.7 seconds left as the Wizards broke a four-game losing streak and improved to a still NBA-worst 4-12. “I couldn’t guard a stick today,” Irving said. “They were going right around me, and I was getting frustrated, but they kept attacking.” Harris scored a career-high 30 points, and Irving had 26 for Brooklyn which led by as many as 18. The Nets had won four in a row. James Harden sat out because of a thigh contusion, the first game he has missed since being traded from Houston to Brooklyn on Jan. 13. “It’s not looking great defensively for our team, giving up that many points,” Durant said after Washington shot 51.9% for the game. Westbrook has set season scoring highs in consecutive games. He entered the game averaging 18.9 points, his lowest output since his second season in 2009-10. “That’s part of leadership,” Westbrook said about playing hard every time out on the court. “It’s a part of my responsibility as a leader to bring it every single night. I take pride in that because I don’t think that everybody does that in sports.” The Wizards are 1-4 since resuming play after a 13-day layoff that included six postponements due to COVID-19 related issues. TIP-INS Nets: Bruce Brown started with Harden out and finished with three points in 32 minutes and picked up a technical in the fourth quarter after some words with Westbrook. Westbrook also was called for a technical. ... Jeff Green scored a season-high 23 points, but Brooklyn fell to 8-3 when Green reaches double figures. Wizards: Brooks picked up a technical in the first quarter. ... Beal had just 11 points in the first half. … Davis Bertans was 3 for 12 on 3-pointers and finished with 11 points…Washington’s bench outscored Brooklyn’s 50-41 HARDEN HOPEFUL Nets coach Steve Nash said Harden’s injury wasn’t too severe and that Sunday’s absence was precautionary with the hope that it’s just a one game scratch for the former MVP. Harden missed out on facing Russell Westbrook for the first time since they were teammates in Houston last season. Harden, Westbrook and Durant were all teammates in Oklahoma City for three seasons from 2009-10 to 2011-12. OLD TIMER Westbrook has missed six games while trying to ease his way into the season but was also out while the Wizards team was unavailable due to COVID-19. Brooks is happy that Westbrook has been caution in his approach. “I’m glad because he is an old man now,” Brooks joked about the 32-year-old guard. “He needs to be smarter.”","401267470"
"Malik Beasley throws a baseball pass and hits Anthony Edwards in stride for a powerful slam in transition. (0:22) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Malik Beasley scored 23 points and rookie Anthony Edwards finished with 23 in his second straight start as the Minnesota Timberwolves held on to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 109-104 on Sunday night. D’Angelo Russell added 19 points for Minnesota, which snapped a three-game losing streak and won for just the third time in 17 games. The Timberwolves used their 3-point shooting to overcome a dominant game inside by Andre Drummond and Cleveland. The Timberwolves connected on a season-high 16 3s, converting 40% from beyond the arc. “They’re big; 72 points in the paint is a lot,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “I liked a number of things that these guys did and I thought that was a definition of a team win. But you can’t be satisfied because games come quick and we run it back tomorrow.” Drummond had 25 points and 22 rebounds — his third 20-20 game of the year — and the Cavaliers scored a season-high 72 points in the paint. Collin Sexton added 16 points as Cleveland lost for the fourth time in five games. The Cavaliers had a season-high 19 turnovers, resulting in 29 points for Minnesota. “There’s been instances these last two games, in my mind, that we have not played to the standard of being the most competitive team and the most selfless team on the floor,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “I think that was the case for a lot of tonight. I thought we got to a place where we built a lead and we got away from being who we are.” With Karl-Anthony Towns and backup center Naz Reid out due to COVID-19 and a wrist injury, respectively, the Wolves had no match for Drummond inside. Going to the big man early allowed Cleveland to build a double-digit advantage as Drummond bullied his way to the rim against Minnesota’s smaller defenders. Drummond had 10 points and six rebounds in the first quarter, while the Cavaliers shot 70% from the field in the quarter. The Wolves closed the gap to 61-55 at halftime on a pair of 3s by Russell and Beasley, and then took control early in the third. The tantalizing scoring ability of Edwards, the No. 1 pick, was on display with 11 points in the third. Edwards was aggressive, getting to the rim with a variety of spin moves and driving layups. He also shot 4 of 7 from long range. “Twenty-three points from a 19-year-old rookie is fantastic,” Saunders said. “But we’re not asking them to do that every night. We’re just asking him to continue to grow and he’s doing that.” Russell hit a 3 to put Minnesota ahead 95-90 and walked to the bench with both arms raised following a Cleveland timeout. Cavaliers forwards Larry Nance and Cedi Osman stood near where Russell shot, arguing about defensive coverages. The Wolves held Cleveland to 18 points and 30.4% shooting in the fourth. “We had each other’s backs tonight,” Beasley said. “I heard a lot of talk, more than usual. In the paint in the second half, we made an emphasis of let’s not let them squash in the paint. We executed on the defensive end tonight.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: With three points early in the game, Drummond became the fifth active player with 9,000 points and 8,000 rebounds in his career, joining LeBron James, Dwight Howard, Tyson Chandler and LaMarcus Aldridge. Drummond began the day as the only player this season with at least 300 points and 250 rebounds. … Darius Garland had 17 points and five assists. Timberwolves: Reid missed his second straight game with a right wrist sprain. Saunders said Reid worked out before the game and was a game-time decision. Towns’ absence stretched to eight games since testing positive for COVID-19. … Juancho Hernangomez also missed his eighth straight game while in the league’s health and safety protocols. Jarrett Culver has missed the past three games with a left ankle sprain. … Guard Jaylen Nowell tied his career-high with 12 points off the bench. HOBBLED BUT EFFECTIVE Sexton left the game in the second quarter and appeared to aggravate the left ankle sprain that caused him to miss five games. He went down awkwardly after a jump shot and hopped away, but stayed in the game momentarily. He later went to the locker room before returning and working on the ankle with a trainer near the bench. Sexton played 32 minutes in his seventh game back since missing time with the injury. STILL SCORING Kevin Love missed his 18th game this season with a right calf strain, but had some news of his own to announce. Love took to Instagram to announce his engagement to Kate Bock, a Canadian model who has appeared in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Love wrote, “’Souls tend to go back to who feels like home.’ My Fiance´. The Joy of My Life,” on Instagram.","401267471"
"Jarrett Allen demands space as he takes the inbound pass and smashes it through the hoop. (0:18) CLEVELAND -- — Collin Sexton scored 26 points and Jarrett Allen had a season-high 23 points and 18 rebounds, leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 100-98 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves and a split of their home-and-home series on Monday night. Darius Garland had 19 points and 11 assists for the Cavaliers, who had lost four of their last five games, including a 109-104 decision at Minnesota the previous evening. Allen blocked five shots and made 9 of 14 free throws in his initial start since being acquired from Brooklyn as part of the James Harden mega-trade on Jan. 14. “That was just unacceptable what happened last night for the Cleveland Cavaliers with our effort,” Allen said. “We play with energy and we give it all on the court. That’s what we’re all about and we showed that tonight.” D’Angelo Russell scored 18 points and No. 1 overall draft pick Anthony Edwards had 13 points in his third start for the Timberwolves. Minnesota dropped its eighth straight on the road and is 2-8 overall since Jan. 13. “We’ve got to be better,” Edwards said. “They were playing tough defense, but we’ve just got to be better. That’s it.” Cleveland held a 98-91 lead with 19 seconds remaining, but the Timberwolves pulled within two after Russell buried a 3-pointer and Malik Beasley scored in the lane. Taurean Prince made two free throws with 3.9 seconds left to extend the Cavaliers’ advantage to 100-96, making Naz Reid’s layup just before the buzzer irrelevant. “We could get anything we wanted in the paint tonight, so we wanted to attack with our bigs as much as possible,” Garland said. Cleveland played without center Andre Drummond (sore lower back), who leads the NBA in rebounding at 15.1 per game. Drummond had 25 points and 22 boards in the opener of the back-to-back set. “We had an opportunity to close it out a couple of times and we let them back in, but we didn’t fold,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. Minnesota started the fourth with an 11-1 run, taking its first lead since the first quarter at 78-77 on a putback by Jaylen Nowell. Cleveland answered with six straight points and did not trail again. Edwards is averaging 17.0 points and 4.0 rebounds in 30.0 minutes since being moved into the starting lineup on Jan. 29. “There are changes in the way teams guard me, but it’s still basketball,” Edwards said. “It really doesn’t make any difference to me.” TRENDING UPWARD Timberwolves F Juancho Hernangomez was active for the first time since Jan. 13, but did not play. The fourth-year pro missed eight games because of the NBA’s health and safety protocols, and is still working on his conditioning. “It’s an ongoing process because you want to take care of your guys when they come back,” coach Ryan Saunders said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: C Naz Reid (right wrist sprain) returned after missing two games, scoring 12 points in 13 minutes off the bench. ... C Karl-Anthony Towns (COVID-19) was inactive for the ninth straight game and G Jarrett Culver (left ankle sprain) missed his third in a row. Cavaliers: F Larry Nance Jr. (right wrist sprain) did not dress for the third time since initially being hurt Jan. 24 at Boston. Nance had 24 rebounds over Cleveland’s previous two games, but shot 2 of 12. ...

"LeBron James acknowledges he misses the interaction with fans and isn't sure the spectators should have been removed from the game. (1:03) ATLANTA -- — There weren't many fans in the stands, but enough for LeBron James to get in some jawing along the sideline. He didn't mind a bit — especially after the Lakers closed out a nearly two-week-long trip with another victory. “Fans in the stands is just better,” James said with a smile. Anthony Davis scored 25 points and James dominated down the stretch as the Lakers held off the Atlanta Hawks 107-99 on Monday night. During the fourth quarter, James got into a brief verbal confrontation with a female fan who pulled down her mask to make a point. The referees halted the game and called in security officers, who appeared to eject the fan from State Farm Arena. There was a socially distanced crowd of 1,341 for the lone Atlanta visit by the reigning NBA champions. James said it was no big deal. In fact, he didn't think the fan should've been tossed. “At the end of the day, I'm just happy fans are back in the building,” he said. “I missed that interaction. I need that interaction.” The Lakers took control with a 16-0 run bookended around the end of the third period and the beginning of the fourth. Atlanta rallied, closing to 98-97 on Trae Young's 3-pointer. But James responded with a 3 of his own from the top of the key, came up with a huge block at the other end on Clint Capela, and finished off the Hawks with a fast-break layup off a pass from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. James tacked on four straight free throws to seal the victory. He finished with 21 points after managing only nine through the first three quarters. Young led the Hawks with 25 points and 16 assists. Atlanta has struggled to close out games. Seven of its 10 losses are by single digits, most of them going down to the last few possessions. “It's tough,” said John Collins, who added 22 points for the Hawks. “We knew is would come down to the small things, the execution late in the game. It's just frustrating to lose like that. It was a hard-fought game. The one thing we can take away is we can play with anybody.” Los Angeles went 5-2 while playing seven road games in 12 days, certainly looking like the fresher team in the closing minutes against the Hawks. Atlanta appeared to be taking control, ripping off eight straight points late in the third for a 76-70 lead. But the Lakers stifled that run, scoring the final five points of the period, and followed with an 11-0 outburst to start the fourth quarter. James and Kyle Kuzma hit 3-pointers and Alex Caruso finished off the spurt with a dunk, pushing the Lakers to the first double-digit lead for either team to that point. In a brutal start to the fourth, the Hawks missed three straight shots, Danilo Gallinari committed two turnovers, and Bruno Fernando was whistled for an offensive foul. Davis went 10 of 14 from the field for the Lakers. Montrezl Harrell added 19 points, while James had nine assists. CARUSO'S ROLE Caruso again had the best plus-minus rating on the Lakers, who outscored Atlanta by 13 points while he was the court. Undrafted out of college, the fifth-year guard has claimed a bigger role in the playing rotation with his contributions at both ends of the court. He had eight points, two assists and two steals in nearly 25 minutes of playing time. “He's one of our best players,” coach Frank Vogel said. “That's the simplest way to put it. He typically moves the needle in a positive direction.” TIP-INS Lakers: Extended their streak to 31 straight victories when holding an opponent below 100 points. ... Los Angeles has won eight of its last nine meetings against Atlanta. ... James extended his NBA record streak of double-digit games to 1,017 in a row. Hawks: De'Andre Hunter missed the game after undergoing a non-surgical procedure on his right knee. It's not known how long the second-year player will be out. ... Atlanta also was missing rookie C Onyeka Okongwu (left Achilles soreness). ... Capela picked up his third foul with 9:57 left in the second quarter and spent the rest of the half on the bench.","401267473"
"LaMelo Ball shakes Duncan Robinson and then feeds Cody Zeller for a dunk that gives the Hornets a lead in overtime. (0:22) MIAMI -- — Malik Monk had the best scoring game of his career, and the Charlotte Hornets got a comeback they won’t soon forget. Monk came off the bench to score 36 points and make nine 3-pointers, Devonte’ Graham added 24 points and the Hornets rallied from a 10-point deficit in the final 2:47 of regulation to beat the Miami Heat 129-121 in overtime on Monday night. The 36 points was a Hornets' reserve record, one better than the 35 that Graham had against Indiana on Nov. 5, 2019. “I was ready, and I was just locked in,"" Monk said. Monk sent the Hornets to OT by making a 3-pointer with 16.6 seconds left, and Charlotte never trailed in the extra period. Cody Zeller had 19 points and 12 rebounds, Gordon Hayward scored 19 and LaMelo Ball finished with 14 points and seven assists for Charlotte in his first start. “It’s been a resilient group all year,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “We never dropped the sword. Our mentality is to keep fighting to the end. Down 10 with two-plus minutes to go, nobody hung their heads.” Jimmy Butler scored 25 points and Bam Adebayo added 23 for Miami, which got 19 from Max Strus. The Heat used a 24-7 run to turn a seven-point deficit into a 10-point lead late in the fourth, then gave up 28 points in the final 7:47. “At the end of the day, if you have a double-digit lead you have to find a way to get stops and finish it off,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “We weren't able to do that."" The Hornets made 21 3-pointers, tying the third-most in franchise history. They also set a season-high for points and topped the 30-assist mark for the ninth time this season. Duncan Robinson had 16, while Tyler Herro and Kelly Olynyk each scored 11 for Miami. Herro’s status was in question because someone he lives with tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday. But Herro was cleared to play Monday afternoon, which indicates that the housemate likely got a false positive and returned multiple negative tests since. “We have to get stops. That's the bottom line,"" Adebayo said. “You can play as much offense as you want, but you have to get stops."" TIP-INS Hornets: Ball got the first start of his career for Charlotte because Terry Rozier missed the game with a sprained right ankle. ... Charlotte hadn’t won consecutive games in Miami since 2007. ... The Hornets could be down another starter. PJ Washington left in the third quarter; the initial diagnosis was a sprained right foot. Washington finished with six points in 24 minutes. Heat: Strus’ previous career-high was 12. ... Meyers Leonard was not with the team Monday; he was getting his injured shoulder checked by a doctor. He hurt his ankle Feb. 3, 2020 and between that and the shoulder issue has appeared in eight of Miami’s 65 games since. MARCH 11 MEMORIES It was the first game between the teams since March 11, the night the NBA suspended last season because of the pandemic. “In some ways it feels like forever ago and then I walked into this building and it feels like yesterday. ... Things have never been the same since. Hopefully we’re back there soon,” Borrego said. NOTHING HAPPENED Olynyk had a 3-pointer blocked in the second quarter, the ball ricocheted off Hayward’s head, Olynyk got it back, Herro missed a 3, Adebayo got that rebound, lost the ball and it eventually wound up back with Olynyk — who made a 3. Except it didn’t happen; the NBA replay center ruled a few minutes later that Olynyk’s made 3 was after the shot clock expired.","401267474"
"RJ Barrett flies high past Zach LaVine for the dunk. (0:24) CHICAGO -- — Lauri Markkanen scored 30 points, Zach LaVine added 17 of his 21 in the second half and the Chicago Bulls beat the New York Knicks 110-102 on Monday night. Markkanen delivered another blistering performance coming off a season-high, 31-point outing. The 7-footer from Finland made six 3-pointers. “We all know Lauri's extremely talented,"" LaVine said. ""We're seeing his full game right now."" LaVine hit a 3 and two free throws during a game-ending 10-2 run. Coby White scored 13, including a tiebreaking 3. Thaddeus Young added 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. The Bulls bounced back from a gut-wrenching loss to Portland on Saturday, when the Trail Blazers’ Damian Lillard delivered a buzzer-beating, fadeaway 3. Chicago won for just the third time in nine home games this season. The Knicks have dropped five of six. They lost for the second time in two days after giving up a season-high 129 points to the Los Angeles Clippers. Julius Randle had 23 points. Alec Burks scored 18 for New York, and rookie Immanuel Quickley added 16. “We fought hard, we played well in the second half,” RJ Barrett said. “We put ourselves in a position to win the game.” FINAL RUN The Bulls were leading 100-97 when Burks hit a 3 for New York with just under a minute remaining. White then nailed one from the corner to put Chicago back on top. After a timeout, Randle lost the ball. Markkanen got the steal, leading to a 3 by LaVine. Garrett Temple added two free throws with 10.7 seconds remaining to make it 108-100. “We moved the ball,” Markkanen said. “We got good looks. I think it all started from defense. We were getting stops. That helps our offense.” As for his turnover, Randle said that was more on him than the defense. “I just got to slow down,” he said. “They played the play pretty good. I tried to get into some secondary actions with our guards. They kind of blew those plays up. I just tried to go quick with the clock, but just got to take my time and read it. It wasn't (anything) that they did.” TIP-INS Knicks: New York made 6 of 29 3-pointers. .... C Nerlens Noel (sore left groin) scored eight points after missing Sunday’s game. ... Coach Tom Thibodeau said F Kevin Knox is out of the rotation for now because the team is fully healthy. Bulls: Chicago shot 11 of 34 from beyond the arc. ... F Otto Porter Jr. played 18 minutes after being listed as questionable because of back spasms. Coach Billy Donovan said he “progressed in a positive way” at shootaround. SETTLING DOWN The Bulls called a timeout 50 seconds into the game after turnovers by White and Markkanen. But they steadied themselves after that. Markkanen was particularly good in the first half, scoring 23 points and hitting 5 of 7 3s as the Bulls grabbed a 59-55 lead. He made a 3 to cap a 14-2 run in the first quarter that gave Chicago a 10-point lead. He also hit a reverse layup and buried another 3 as part of a 7-0 spurt late in the second quarter that put Chicago up by six before Randle hit two free throws for New York in the closing seconds. Markkanen hit one from beyond the arc on Chicago’s first possession of the second half, and his feed to LaVine for a dunk in transition made it 72-61 about 4 1/2 minutes into the third quarter. SERIES-LY SPEAKING The two teams are scheduled to meet again at the United Center on Wednesday. And count Thibodeau as a fan of these baseball-style series. “Hopefully, it’s here to stay,” he said. The NBA implemented the setup with two teams playing consecutive games in the same city to reduce travel in the COVID-19 era. “I think it makes a lot of sense in terms of cutting down travel,” Thibodeau said. “I think the quality of play is better. And it also gives you that preparation that is similar to the playoffs. I think there are a lot of benefits. It’s good for the fans. It’s good for everyone.”","401267475"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo scores 18 points and hands out six assists in the Bucks' 134-106 win over the Trail Blazers. (1:30) MILWAUKEE -- — Jrue Holiday scored 22 points, Bobby Portis added 21 and the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a two-game skid by trouncing the Portland Trail Blazers 134-106 on Monday night. The Bucks pulled ahead for good midway through the first quarter and led by as many as 39 points early in the fourth period. “Obviously we really, really needed this win really, really bad,” Portis said. ""We didn’t want to drop three in a row. Us getting this win tonight was big.” Milwaukee went 21 of 42 from 3-point range and shot 55.2% overall. That represented a reversal of fortune for the Bucks, who had been lit up from long range during their three-game road trip. The Bucks went 1-2 during that stretch and allowed at least 21 3-pointers in each of those games. “Tonight they came out with an edge,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “They took a first punch from Portland. Portland made some shots in the first quarter, but our offensive execution, our unselfishness, our playing with each other was really at a high level.” Holiday shot 10 of 14 and had seven rebounds and six assists. Portis shot 9 of 13 and had eight rebounds. Nassir Little led the Blazers (10-9) with 30 points – 2 1/2 times the second-year pro’s previous career high of 12. “It was a bright spot for tonight, for sure,” Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “He shot the ball really well. (Little's) had a tough go the last few months. It was good to see him get out there and see the ball go in the basket, get some extended run.” Milwaukee sizzled from the start of the night to take command. The Bucks shot 18 of 26 overall and 8 of 10 on 3-point attempts in the first quarter to grab a 46-36 lead. In the closing seconds of the first quarter, Portis grabbed a loose ball off a mishandled Portland inbounds pass and dunked before the buzzer. Milwaukee extended that lead to 79-56 by halftime. The Bucks shot 59.2% overall and were 14 of 22 from 3-point range in the first half. The Bucks remained in control the rest of the way. “Tonight we played with swag, played with grit, played with fire,” Portis said. “And I think that's kind of contagious for the whole team.” Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 18 points. Khris Middleton made all four of his 3-point attempts and scored 17. D.J. Augustin went 4 of 6 from beyond the arc and had 13 points. Bryn Forbes was 3 of 5 on 3-point attempts and also had 13. Damian Lillard scored 17, Anfernee Simons had 15 and Enes Kanter added 10 for Portland. “We knew it was a tough game coming in,” Lillard said. ""I watched their previous few games and they had not been playing the best. Coming back to their home floor, you had to expect they were going to come out and try to have a much better effort and get things turned around at home.” TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Derrick Jones Jr. missed a second straight game with a sprained left foot. Stotts says he’s hoping Jones will be able to play at some point during this four-game road swing. The Trail Blazers also were missing guard C.J. McCollum (hairline fracture in his left foot) and center Jusuf Nurkic (fractured right wrist), who have been out since mid-January. Bucks: By ending this brief skid, the Bucks avoided suffering their ninth loss of the season in their 20th game. Last season, the Bucks didn't lose for the ninth time until their 61st game.

"De'Aaron Fox shakes and spins his way through defenders before getting the underhanded layup to fall. (0:18) NEW ORLEANS -- — De'Aaron Fox scored 38 points, including 17 straight Sacramento points during the final 7:07, and the Kings rallied from 10 down in the fourth quarter to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 118-109 on Monday night. “Just trying to do whatever it takes to put us on top and sometimes it’s hitting another gear in the fourth (quarter),"" Fox said. “When it’s time to make plays, you’ve got to be ready.” Harrison Barnes scored 24 points and Richaun Holmes had 17 points, 10 rebounds and six blocks for the Kings, who won for the fourth time in five games. New Orleans led 97-87 after rookie guard Kira Lewis stole the ball from Barnes and set up Nickeil Alexander-Walker's transition 3-pointer. But the Kings responded with a 16-3 run that began with 3s by Barnes and 2016 Pelicans first-round draft choice Buddy Hield. Fox capped the surge with a 3 that gave Sacramento a 101-100 lead and then finished off New Orleans with another 14 points. Kings coach Luke Walton said his club wants Fox to “take over the game” late, adding, “It makes the coaching job a lot easier on the sideline when he’s doing that down the stretch. ... It gives the guys so much confidence.” Fox wound up outscoring New Orleans by himself in the fourth quarter, 17-15, highlighting his outburst with ball fakes and a spin on penetrating drives that left defenders flat-footed before he finished fluidly near the rim. “That’s just being in the gym, being creative,"" Fox said. ""I got stronger, which allows me to do some things and finish through contact.” But Fox noted that his late scoring only mattered because of the Kings' fourth-quarter defense. Holmes played a role in that, blocking shots by Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart during the pivotal final period. Ingram scored 20. Hart and Zion Williamson each scored 17, and Hart also grabbed 13 rebounds for the Pelicans, who lost their second straight at home and fell for the 10th time in 13 games. “No matter who we put out there, we’re trying to win and right now it’s not working,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""It’s frustrating to everybody. Frustrating to fans, frustrating to our players, frustrating to everybody in our organization, and probably most frustrating to me because it’s my responsibility, ultimately, and I’m not figuring out a way to get it done. But we’re going to keep working at it.” Willy Hernangomez, who had appeared in three of New Orleans' previous 18 games with a total of 12 minutes on the court, played a season-high 28 minutes because of Steven Adams' calf injury. The first-year Pelican reserve center made the most of it, scoring 13 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. The Kings had to play most of the second half without Marvin Bagley, who received his second technical foul of the game with 10:18 left in the third quarter while gesticulating angrily after being called for a foul on Williamson. Bagley had 10 points before his ejection. TIP-INS Kings: Hield finished with 16 points but missed 11 of 15 3-point shots. ... Tyrese Haliburton grabbed 11 rebounds. ... Sacramento reserves combined to score just 13 points. ... The Kings turned the ball over 20 times, leading to 25 Pelicans points. ... Holmes' six blocks matched a career high done twice before within the past month. Pelicans: Eric Bledsoe scored 14 points and Ball 12. ... Adams, who is day to day with a left calf injury that occurred Saturday, was late scratch shortly before tipoff. Jaxson Hayes started in his place with Hernangomez the first center off the bench. ... Hayes committed his third foul in the middle of the second quarter and was subbed out for the remainder of the half, which meant more playing time for Hernangomez. ... Lewis, New Orleans' first-round pick out of Alabama, played 15:37 and finished with two points to go with one assist, one rebound and one steal. OFFICIAL EXPANATION Whan asked about Bagley's ejection, Walton said he ""didn’t think Marvin deserved to be tossed.” James Capers, the officials’ crew chief, said Bagley had an “overt reaction that went beyond the heat of the moment” when he received his second technical foul. Bagley's first, Capers said, stemmed from “a profanity-laced statement directed towards the official.”","401267477"
"John Wall bounces a pass inside to Jae'Sean Tate for the basket down low. (0:23) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Eric Gordon scored 25 points and the Houston Rockets hit an NBA record-tying 11 3-pointers in a 48-point first quarter, cruising to a 136-106 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night. John Wall scored the first eight points for the Rockets and finished with 18 points, six rebounds and five assists. Christian Wood also scored 18 and added 11 rebounds in Houston's sixth straight victory. Even though the Rockets had been rolling, coach Stephen Silas talked to them about getting off to better starts. “We have a coachable group, we have a mature group who want what’s best, not just for them but everybody in the group,” Silas said. “It’s good to know when we focus on something, whether it’s playing better defense or rebounding … or getting off to a better start like we did tonight, we do it.” Gordon, Wood and Victor Oladipo all had 10 points in the first 12 minutes and the Rockets led by as many as 26 in the first half. It was the second straight game the Rockets had a 48-point quarter. The Rockets were 11 for 14 from beyond the arc in the opening quarter. They finished 28 for 52 (53.8%) from 3. “When you’re able to move the ball like that, you’re unpredictable,” Gordon said. “It’s tough to scout to slow us down when we’re playing like that, moving the ball, guys are taking the right shots. As long as we’re playing like that, I’ll take our chances over anybody.” Gordon was part of a Rockets bench that scored 68 points – half of the team’s output. Oklahoma City (8-11) led 4-3 before the Rockets went on a 17-0 run and never looked back. Houston (10-9) led 73-54 at the half, the second straight game the Thunder had given up more than 70 points in the first half and third straight half teams had reached that total. They allowed Brooklyn 76 points in the first half and 71 in the second half last Friday night in a 147-125 loss. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 19 points for the Thunder. The teams will have a day off before meeting against in Oklahoma City on Wednesday. TIP-INS Rockets: Had a pair of four-point plays by Danuel House Jr. and Gordon in the first quarter. The duo combined for nine three-point baskets off the bench. GOOD TIMES Silas was asked if he was able to have fun in his first year as a head coach or if the job’s responsibilities prevented him from enjoying the results. “I’m having a blast,” Silas said. “I’m not going to wait 20 years to be a head coach and not have fun doing it. Even when times are hard or shaky as they were at the beginning, I’m going to have fun.” Who are the free agents for the next two years? We have the lists. Center Andre Drummond is now a free agent and can sign with a contending team after reaching a buyout with the Cavaliers.","401267478"
"Devin Booker sinks a contested 3-pointer in the closing moments to give the Suns a 109-108 win over the Mavericks. (0:41) DALLAS -- — Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams gladly confessed that he junked his plan to carefully monitor Devin Booker’s minutes down the stretch with his All-Star guard playing for the first time since Jan. 22. Booker hit a 3-pointer with 1.5 seconds left in his return and the Suns rallied past the Dallas Mavericks for the second straight game, winning 109-108 on Monday night. Booker finished with 24 points, 20 in the second half, and 31 minutes. He went into the game ranked 12th in the NBA averaging 35.7 minutes per game before being sidelined with a left hamstring strain. “I imagine if I’d have taken Book out, that would have been the first time you’d seen a player knock a coach out on the sidelines,” Williams said. The Suns trailed by 11 with 4:48 to play in the third quarter before winning their third straight, including a 111-105 victory at Dallas on Saturday when they trailed by 15 late in the third quarter. The Mavericks dropped their sixth in a row, their ninth loss in their last 11 games and their fourth straight defeat at home. Luka Doncic missed a 27-foot shot at the buzzer. Booker took a pass on the winning basket from Chris Paul, who finished with a season-high 34 points to go with nine rebounds and nine assists. Deandre Ayton had 10 points and 17 rebounds for his seventh double-double in his past eight games. Doncic led the Mavericks with 25 points following a slow start in which he scored only two points in the first quarter on free throws. Josh Richardson scored a season-high 24 points and Kristaps Porzingis added 19, 14 in the second half, after sitting out Saturday’s game. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said his team was aware it had a foul to give on the Suns’ winning possession. “We didn’t take it. That falls on me,” Carlisle said. “There’s not going to be any finger-pointing.” TIP-INS Suns: Ayton scored only two points in the second half. … Phoenix has won six straight against Dallas going back to last season in the Orlando bubble. Mavericks: The return of Maxi Kleber after missing 11 games in the health and safety protocols gave Dallas a full roster without any injury designations for the first time since Dec. 4, 2019, a span of 425 days. … Porzingis and Kleber started together for the first time this season in the Mavericks’ 12th starting lineup. MANAGING PORZINGIS’ MINUTES Carlisle said he’s getting closer to routinely playing Porzingis in back-to-back games. Porzingis has played back-to-backs only once in three opportunities since being activated three weeks ago coming off October knee surgery. “Let me be clear, he wants to play in all of these games,” Carlisle said. “It really bothers him.” Dallas’ next back-to-back will be this Wednesday and Thursday, at Atlanta and home against Golden State. The next one after that will be Feb. 22-23, home games against Memphis and Boston.","401267479"
"Ja Morant leads the Grizzlies in transition and flings a no-look pass to Brandon Clarke for the dunk. (0:19) SAN ANTONIO -- — Gorgui Dieng scored 19 points, Brandon Clarke had 18 and the Memphis Grizzlies routed the San Antonio Spurs 133-102 on Monday night to extend their winning streak to seven games. “We’ve got a lot of depth,” Memphis guard Tyus Jones said. “I think that was one of the things going into the year that we looked at. You’ve got to use that to your advantage night in and night out. It’s a long season.” Jones had 11 points a career-high 14 assists. All 10 Grizzlies who played had at least one assist. Kyle Anderson and De’Anthony Melton added 17 points each and Ja Morant had 13 points and eight assists as Memphis won its second straight game after a 12-day layoff due to the league’s COVID-19 protocols. Keldon Johnson had 25 points and 11 rebounds for San Antonio, which has dropped two straight after winning its previous three. The Spurs pulled their starters and key reserves midway through the fourth quarter with the Grizzlies up 111-90. “They were just tougher in so many ways than we were,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “In a 48-minute game, I’d say that probably in the third quarter we looked like we looked lately for about six minutes. But, other than that, they sliced us and diced us and deserved the wins, for sure.” Memphis had nine players score in double figures as it completed a two-game sweep at San Antonio. After shooting 56% from the field in Saturday’s 129-112 victory, Memphis matched that percentage Monday and also shot 50% on 3-pointers. “They are continuing to understand that being unselfish as a team is going to set you up for success as an individual and the team up for success,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. It was the fifth straight game the Grizzlies have had at least five players in double figures. “We just play together, that’s all,” Dieng said. “We share the ball. We don’t care who scores.” Dieng and Melton were part of a 62-41 advantage in bench points for Memphis. Just as they did in Saturday’s game, the Grizzlies bullied the Spurs defensively and outworked them offensively. Memphis held a 62-32 advantage in the paint despite being without key frontcourt players Jaren Jackson Jr., Jonas Valanciunas and Justise Winslow. Jackson and Winslow are injured and Valanciunas just recently completed health and safety protocols. “I feel like it just shows how deep we are with our roster,” Morant said. “We have a lot of guys that can produce on the floor. Missing the guys who are hurt is kind of tough, but we have to have the next-man-up mentality.” DeMar DeRozan had 14 points and LaMarcus Aldridge scored 12 for San Antonio. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Morant tweaked his left ankle in the final seconds of the third quarter after missing a runner in the paint. Morant tumbled over and grabbed at his ankle after getting tangled up with someone while backpedaling on defense. He limped off the court as time expired but waved away any assistance and returned to the lineup to start the fourth. ... Valanciunas was seated on Memphis’ bench was not in uniform. ... The Grizzlies shot 58% from the field in the first half and had 18 assists on their 28 field goals. Spurs: After scoring a season-low five points on 2-for-6 shooting Saturday, DeRozan was 6 for 12 in the rematch. ... Derrick White collected his 500th career rebound in his 155th game. He joins Alvin Robertson and Willie Anderson as the only players in franchise history with 1,500 points, 500 rebounds and 500 assists in their first 155 games with the team.","401267480"
"De'Anthony Melton flings the pass in transition to Dillon Brooks who powers up and jams in the two-handed dunk. (0:19) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Just two days removed from a humbling home loss in which Indiana squandered a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter, the Pacers looked to right that wrong against the NBA's hottest team. This time, building a substantial lead proved to be enough. Domantas Sabonis had a season-high 32 points and 13 rebounds as the Pacers beat Memphis 134-116, snapping the Grizzlies' seven-game winning streak. “We were just playing loose out there,” Sabonis said. The Pacers built a double-digit lead early and kept adding to it, finishing with a season-high point total. The sooner they could get back on court after Sunday's inability to finish against Philadelphia, the better. “It was important, especially after last game,” Sabonis said of seizing control. “We felt like we gave it away.” Sabonis made 11 of his first 12 shots and had a double-double (24 points, 11 rebounds) by halftime. He recorded his 14th double-double in 16 starts. “This team has a ton of fight in ‘em,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. “They play for each other. I’ve never questioned that.” Malcolm Brogdon added 23 points and Myles Turner 22 for the Pacers (12-9). The Grizzlies entered with the NBA's longest active win streak and ended up one victory shy of matching the franchise record of eight straight wins set four times, most recently in 2015. The lethargic visitors were playing for the third time in four days on the road. But the team's leading scorer for the season, Ja Morant, blamed himself after finishing with just 10 points, half of his average. “I have to be extremely better,” Morant said. “I feel like I was a no-show. We can't have that.” The Pacers started strong and led by as many as 15 points, on the way to a 37-27 edge after one period. The 37 points were a season high for the first quarter. The Pacers kept the pressure on, building a 71-50 lead at halftime. The 71 first-half points were another season high. “We just didn't have it tonight,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. Dillon Brooks led Memphis with 25 points. The Pacers' Jeremy Lamb finished with 19 points. He has scored in double figures in seven of eight games after starting the season late due to injury. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Had another streak end at four games with at least seven players scoring in double figures. They had six in double digits. ... Are 6-2 on the road, 3-5 at home. ... Ja Morant is one of just two players averaging 20 points, seven assists, and shooting at least 50% (Nikola Jokic). Pacers: Improved to 5-5 since trading All-Star Victor Oladipo. ... Turner leads the NBA with 70 blocked shots, 17 more than the next player. ... Are No. 1 in points in the paint with an average of 54.4.","401267482"
"Fred VanVleet gets surprised by his teammates in the locker room after he set a franchise record with 54 points in a game. (0:21) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Fred VanVleet set a franchise record with 54 points and hit a career-best 11 3-pointers as the Toronto Raptors beat the short-handed Orlando Magic 123-108 on Tuesday night. VanVleet made 11 of his first 12 attempts from 3-point range. He finished 17 of 23 from the field and 9 for 9 at the free throw line to surpass the previous Raptors record of 52 points scored by DeMar DeRozan against Milwaukee on Jan. 1, 2018. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the most points in an NBA game for an undrafted player — eclipsing the 53 scored by Hall of Fame big man Moses Malone on the exact same date 39 years earlier. “Unbelievable and I’m very humbled and honored to be in the same sentence with both of those guys,” said VanVleet, who took a video call from DeRozan in the Toronto locker room after the game. “It’s just a special night on a lot of different levels. I’m trying to enjoy it for now, but it’s not a championship or anything like that. It was a good game for me. I’ll enjoy the love for a couple of hours and get ready for the next one.” The fifth-year guard out of Wichita State easily topped his previous high of 36 points set last season by scoring 17 in the first quarter, 11 in the second, 18 in the third and eight more in the fourth before being lifted after the outcome was decided. He added three rebounds, three steals, three blocked shots and two assists. Toronto was plus-20 in his 37 minutes on the floor. VanVleet’s previous best for 3s in a regular-season game was seven. He made eight in a playoff game last year against Brooklyn. “I thought early on that the ball was coming off his hands so easily and the deep shots looked like there was hardly any effort,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “There was something that was making them fly off so comfortably. Wherever he shot them from it seemed like a free throw line attempt, effort-wise.” Toronto, which entered second in the NBA in 3s and attempts per game, connected on 20 of 46 shots from beyond the arc. Once 2-8, the Raptors won for the seventh time in 11 games. They beat the reeling Magic for a second time in three nights and for the seventh consecutive time over the past three seasons. Norman Powell had 23 points for Toronto, and Kyle Lowry posted a triple-double with 14 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Orlando, which has lost 12 of 14, tried almost every guard on its roster against the 6-foot-1 VanVleet with little to no success. He had three 3-pointers from at least 30 feet and hit a trio of catch-and-shoot 3s in transition. “I knew after my first (3-point) shot went in I was going to shoot the ball well,” VanVleet said. “I just tried to keep my foot on the gas and my teammates did a great job of finding me and screening for me. Once I hit like the fifth one, I knew it would be a good night for me.” The 26-year-old VanVleet equaled the franchise scoring record on a basket with 4:45 to play and then set the new mark on a layup with 3:46 left. “He legit was like, `Ya’ll keep playing,’” Lowry said. “It wasn’t forced to him; it was in rhythm and in the flow of the game. He’s just a hard-working, young kid from Rockford, Illinois, and everyone knows how I feel about him. He’s just a winner.” Nikola Vucevic had 21 points and 18 rebounds for the Magic. Evan Fournier scored 12 of Orlando’s first 14 points and finished with 21. Rookie guard Cole Anthony added 16 points and seven rebounds. TOWN HALLS The Magic will host the first of four virtual town halls featuring guard Michael Carter-Williams, coach Steve Clifford, CEO Alex Martins and Chief Diversity Officer Esu Ma’at on Wednesday as the franchise celebrates Black History Month. The town hall will focus on the state of diversity, equity and inclusion within the Magic staff, and fans are invited to join. “It’s an opportunity for us to keep the conversation going and bring awareness,” Clifford said. TIP-INS Raptors: Missed their first six shots and fell behind 11-0, but responded by making seven of the next nine — including five straight 3s — to take a 23-18 lead. … Powell started after missing two games with a bruised quadriceps. OG Anunoby, who was listed as a game-time decision, missed his fourth straight game with a calf strain. … Lowry’s hip check to the right knee of Orlando forward Aaron Gordon on Sunday was upgraded to a Flagrant 1 foul by the NBA on Monday. Clifford denounced the play on Tuesday, saying, “At any level of basketball there’s no place in our game for that. You can end a guy’s career, you can end his season, just like what happened last year (with Lowry fouling Gordon). He’s a terrific player, but it’s an unfortunate play.” Lowry was booed by fans during pregame introductions. Magic: Orlando was without Gordon, who severely sprained his left ankle later in Sunday’s game against Toronto. Gordon is expected to miss more than a month. … With the Magic already minus power forwards Jonathan Isaac, Al-Farouq Aminu and Gordon because of injuries, the team welcomed the return of rookie Chuma Okeke. The 2019 first-round pick played for the first time since Dec. 31, when he sustained a bone bruise in his left knee and missed the next 16 games. He made his first four shots Tuesday and scored 10 first-half points for the first double-digit scoring night of his career.","401267483"
"Paul George voices his displeasure about getting just one free throw attempt in the Clippers' loss to the Nets. (1:00) NEW YORK -- — Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and James Harden relished a chance to test themselves against the NBA's best. The Los Angeles Clippers left Brooklyn impressed — and eager for another shot at the Nets. Irving scored a season-high 39 points, including eight straight in the fourth-quarter run that sent Brooklyn into the lead for good, and the Nets beat the Clippers 124-120 on Tuesday night. Durant added 28 points, Harden had 23 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds, and the three stars scored all the points in the decisive 13-0 spurt. The Nets held on from there to snap the Clippers' three-game winning streak. “We just matched it tonight,"" Irving said. ""We knew that they were going to bring it, so it was just an exciting game. It was great competition for the top players in the world, some of the top players in the world to go against each other on TV.” Kawhi Leonard scored 33 points and Paul George had 26 for the Clippers, who entered with the NBA's best record and lost for just the second time in 12 games. They had a five-point lead midway through the fourth before Durant hit a 3-pointer. Irving followed with one of his own, then made a basket and another 3. Harden finished off the spurt with a 3, making it 110-102 with 4:10 to play. “I thought there was a stretch there where we played great defense, were in their face and it was almost like each one of them took a turn making a shot,” George said. “They’re just tough. They're tough to guard.” The Clippers got it down to one in the final seconds before Irving's free throws closed it out. They host the Nets on Feb. 21. “It was a fun matchup,"" George said. ""Look forward to doing it again.” The Nets bounced back from an embarrassing defensive performance, when they gave up 48 points in the fourth quarter Sunday in a 149-146 loss to Washington, which has the fewest wins in the league. Looking good defensively promised to be difficult against a Los Angeles team that came in leading the NBA in 3-point percentage. The Clippers finished 15 for 36, right at their average of 41.7%, but Irving hit six behind the arc and the Nets got the stops they needed for their sixth straight home victory. “Once we get that down pat defensively, you’re talking about blowing teams out,” Harden said, “because offensively we’ll continue to figure it out. Defensively, we have to figure it out. That’s what it has to be in order for us to be playing at the end.” The Clippers made nine of their first 11 shots and raced to a 12-point lead. The margin was still 11 with under 3 1/2 minutes left in the half, but the Nets closed with a 12-2 spurt to trail just 58-57 at the break. TIP-INS Clippers: Nicolas Batum returned after missing a game with a groin injury and scored 21 points. ... One of Tyronn Lue's assistants is Kenny Atkinson, who was the Nets' coach for 3 1/2 seasons before they made a change in March just before the season was suspended. Lue chuckled and offered a “no comment” when asked if he thought the game meant extra to Atkinson, who is from New York. Nets: Brooklyn had scored 30 or more points in nine straight quarters before being held to 24 in the first. ... Nets coach Steve Nash thought it was “probably too soon” to expect that center Norvel Pelle, signed last week, could make a contribution, but added “we can’t say that forever.” MUST-SEE TV The Nets played their 10th game since acquiring Harden on Jan. 14. YES Network, which televises the Nets locally, said viewership was up 69% from then, from an average of 72,000 viewers to 122,000. The two most-viewed games globally on NBA League Pass this season have come since Harden's acquisition. The Jan. 21 game against Cleveland when the Big Three played together for the first time was first followed by the Jan. 16 game when Harden made his Nets debut against Orlando.","401267484"
"Royce O'Neale puts an exclamation mark on the Jazz's win with a huge putback dunk in the final minute. (0:18) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Utah regained energy on offense and defense in the closing minutes after squandering a huge lead in the fourth quarter. Donovan Mitchell scored 32 points to lead the Utah Jazz to a 117-105 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday night. Mike Conley added 20 points and Bojan Bogdanovic chipped in 18 for Utah, which reclaimed the NBA’s best record with the Los Angeles Clippers loss to the Brooklyn Nets earlier on Tuesday. Royce O’Neale tallied 12 points and 13 rebounds. The Jazz (16-5) won their ninth straight home game. Jerami Grant scored 27 points to lead Detroit and Josh Jackson added 22. Mason Plumlee totaled 17 points and 14 rebounds for the Pistons. Detroit (5-16) lost its second straight game. The Pistons trailed by as many as 28 points in the first half before rallying late in the fourth quarter. Jackson, Grant, and Plumlee scored baskets on three straight possessions to fuel a 10-1 run that cut Utah’s lead to 109-105 with 2:06 left. Bogdanovic slammed the door on a further rally with back-to-back corner threes, giving the Jazz a 115-105 lead with 48.6 seconds to go. “The biggest thing is being able to withstand that push,” Mitchell said. “They made a hell of a run and we made a hell of a counter.” Detroit, who has wins over the Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers in its last five games, narrowly missed on being a giant killer yet again. “We put ourselves in position to win against one of the best teams in our league again, so that’s all we can ask for right now at this stage of our program,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Mitchell and Conley each scored a pair of baskets on the first four Jazz possessions and it helped Utah build up a 24-9 first quarter lead. The Jazz capitalized on poor shooting from the Pistons. Detroit missed 12 of its first 16 shots and trailed by double digits for much of the quarter. The Pistons went nearly five minutes during the first quarter without scoring a basket before Grant’s jumper with 2:08 left in the quarter ended the drought. Things did not improve for the Pistons on either end of the court in the second quarter. Detroit trimmed the deficit to 45-33 on Plumlee’s tip dunk. Utah quickly ripped off a 9-0 run to keep the Pistons from pulling within single digits. Bogdanovic scored back-to-back 3-pointers to spark the brief spurt. The Jazz then scored on seven straight possessions to extend their lead to 69-41 later in the quarter. Utah hit eight free throws during that stretch to pull away from Detroit. “Sometimes when you build a big lead like that, the whole narrative becomes, “what happened?' because you didn’t win by 30,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “These are NBA teams. They’re good teams. There’s going to be runs. The big thing for us is to make that hard.” The Pistons made a big push in the fourth quarter before coming up short. The next step, Plumlee said, is playing with the same energy for 48 minutes. “I hope we can play like that for a full game, all four quarters,” Plumlee said. “It’s nothing spectacular. I just think it’s the fundamentals of getting back on defense, competing, and playing for the next guy. It’s not super complicated.” TIP-INS Pistons: Blake Griffin shot just 2-of-9 from the field in the first half and shot 4-of-13 overall. He ripped his jersey in half in frustration as he left the court at halftime. … The Pistons outscored the Jazz 20-8 in second-chance points and 22-10 in Fastbreak points. … Detroit went 18-of-20 from the free-throw line.

"Jaylen Brown can't be denied on the break as he throws down an explosive one-handed dunk. (0:20) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Jayson Tatum had 27 points in picking up the offensive slack for Boston without injured Marcus Smart, and the Celtics withstood another scoring spree by Stephen Curry to beat the Golden State Warriors 111-107 on Tuesday night. Curry scored 38 points with seven 3-pointers and joined late Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain as the only Warriors to score 17,000 points for the franchise. Andrew Wiggins' layup with a minute to go for Golden State made it a three-point game, but Tatum converted a pair of free throws with 49.6 seconds left and Curry missed a contested 3 moments later. Jaylen Brown, back in the Bay Area where he starred as a college player at California in Berkeley, drove through the lane for an emphatic, one-handed slam that put the Celtics up 106-96 with 4 minutes left. Curry's three-point play at the 3:17 mark made it a seven-point game. Brown wound up with 18 points and 10 rebounds as Boston snapped a two-game skid with its fourth straight victory against Golden State, ending the Warriors' three-game home winning streak. Curry, who upped his NBA-best 3-point total to 96, has 17,011 points in his 12 seasons. Chamberlain scored 17,783 in six seasons with the club. “Curry keeps you uncomfortable all game long,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Curry’s 3-pointer with 1:03 to go in the third quarter got his team within 81-80. He also had 11 rebounds, eight assists and three steals. The two-time MVP counted on his lesser-known supporting cast of Juan Toscano-Anderson and Kent Bazemore in a matchup of teams each missing a key player. The Warriors’ already-depleted front-court rotation took another hit Tuesday. Rookie No. 2 draft pick James Wiseman is sidelined with a sprained left wrist he hurt during a rout of Detroit on Saturday night. Golden State then lost starting center Kevon Looney to a sprained left ankle that kept him out during the second half. He is expected to miss a couple of games. “This was a fluke. He just got his foot on the floor and rolled the ankle,” coach Steve Kerr said. Boston outscored Golden State 28-17 in the second quarter for a 52-all tie at halftime. Toscano-Anderson hit a 3-pointer with 4:07 left in the third to keep the Warriors within 72-66. He finished with 16 points to match his career high with his first double-digit scoring outing this season and third of his career. “Okayyy Juan!” tweeted Sydel Curry-Lee, Curry's sister and the wife of Warriors guard Damion Lee. Two-way player Toscano-Anderson joked how, like in a movie, not everybody can be a star. “We’re all on the same page on what’s expected of Juan,” he said. ""I'm just trying to establish myself in this league and string together good games."" ON THE BOARDS The Warriors have put a priority on rebounding and Kerr has insisted it comes down to focus. Golden State was outdone on the boards 51-36. “They killed us on the glass in the second half. That really was the difference in the game,” Kerr said. MISSING SMART Boston played its first game since Smart went down with a torn left calf muscle in the fourth quarter of a 96-95 loss to the Lakers on Saturday night. Smart, expected to miss two to three weeks, was out for the final 10:28 on Saturday after he was helped off the court following a collision with Montrezl Harrell beneath the basket. Harrell tipped in a missed layup and stepped on Smart’s foot as he came down. QUOTEABLE Stevens: “As a fan of the NBA, I missed watching Steph and Klay (Thompson) last year.

"Joel Embiid thinks he is dribbling out the clock, but LaMelo Ball pokes the ball away and then knocks down a 3-pointer. (0:23) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers overpowered the Charlotte Hornets — again. Embiid had 34 points and 11 rebounds, and the 76ers beat the Hornets 118-111 on Wednesday night for their fourth straight win. Tobias Harris scored 26 points and Ben Simmons added 15 points and nine assists for the 76ers, who stretched their winning streak against the Hornets to 14 games, tied for the longest active streak in the NBA. The Clippers have also won 14 straight against the Magic. Almost every time the 76ers needed a bucket, they went to Embiid — and more often than not, he responded with mid-range jumpers or by getting to the foul line. The Eastern Conference player of the month finished 11 of 18 from the field and was 9 of 10 from the foul line. Hornets forward Miles Bridges said Embiid is “unguardable"" right now. “I don’t think there is anybody in this league that can guard him when he’s hitting shots from 3 and especially when he’s in the post,"" Bridges said. ""We tried to send double teams and he was hitting turnaround fadeaways. It’s tough, that’s why he’s the top MVP candidate right now, and he’s playing at a very high level. It’s tough to stop him.” Gordon Hayward and LaMelo Ball each had 22 points for the Hornets, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Hornets coach James Borrego said earlier in the day on local sports talk radio that he expected his team to come out with plenty of energy knowing their history against the 76ers. Instead, Charlotte shot 22.7% from field in the first quarter and fell behind 30-13. The 76ers stretched the lead to 26 in the third quarter before the Hornets started to get hot from beyond the arc and battled back to cut the deficit to seven with two minutes left. But Danny Green knocked down a 3 from the right corner and Simmons added a driving layup to keep the Hornets at bay. “You’ve got to give them credit, they’re a heck of a defense,"" Borrego said. “Obviously, they’ve given us trouble over the years defensively with their length and size. … They give us nothing easy at the rim, they take away a lot of our pick-and-roll game, our spread game.” HARRIS' EURO STEP MOVE Harris said he's been working on his Euro step, and he broke it out against the Hornets on one drive. “Just getting downhill and making good decisions when I'm there,"" Harris said. ""The next thing is drawing more contact and fouls when I'm down there. And I have been looking for ways to do that.” SIMMONS IN THE POST The 76ers used Simmons in the low post at times, particularly coming out of timeouts. That allowed him to use his court vision and pass out of double teams and find teammates for open looks. “We’re adding it in for sure,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""You have to pick your poison. If you’re doubling Ben, you’re asking for trouble with his passing ability.” HORNETS SYNERGY Borrego likes the synergy that Ball and Bridges have developed together as they continue to combine for highlight reel alley-oop dunks. On one fast-break possession, Ball fed Bridges a behind-the-back pass which he finished with a windmill dunk. “I think they play off each other very nicely,” Borrego said. “Especially Miles’ ability to roll and play in transition with LaMelo is important for us and they’ve hit it off.” TIP INS 76ers: It wasn't much of a homecoming for Charlotte native Seth Curry, who played 16 minutes in the first half and did not attempt a shot. He took three shots in the second half and missed them all. ... Harris was 9 of 9 from the foul line. Hornets: Ball got his second NBA start with Terry Rozier still out with a sprained ankle. Forward P.J. Washington (foot) also sat out with Bridges getting the start. ... Held to a season-low 42 points in the first half. ... Borrego got his first technical foul of the season in the third quarter. ... Devonte Graham had 18 points but struggled from 3-point range (2 of 11).","401267487"
"Paul George finds an opening down the middle and lifts off for a one-handed dunk. (0:22) CLEVELAND -- — Paul George missed the first two games of the Los Angeles Clippers' long road trip. He barely missed anything in the finale. George drained 8 of 9 3-pointers and scored 36 points, Kawhi Leonard added 24 and Los Angeles found enough energy on tired legs to end a six-game road swing with a 121-99 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night. Just 24 hours after dropping a tight game in Brooklyn that had an NBA Finals vibe, the Clippers bounced back by making 20 3-pointers to avoid losing two straight for the first time this season. They are the only team in the league not to drop two in a row. George said the 124-120 loss to the Nets — he scored 26, but missed 13 shots and took just one free throw — inspired his performance against the Cavs. “I had some good looks, and I just told myself that if I got the same open shots, I would knock them down,” George said. The Clippers started the trip down two All-Stars as both George and Leonard were sidelined by COVID-19 protocols. They sat out games in Atlanta and Miami, but now that they're back, a team with title aspirations is gaining confidence. “We're getting better,” coach Tyronn Lue said after his team's 4-2 trip. “We've got some things we've still got to get better at. We've still got a long way to go.” George went 13 of 20 from the field and Los Angeles made 20 of 34 on 3s, outscoring Cleveland 60-12 from behind the arc. George banked in a 32-footer at the horn to end the third, capping his 16-point quarter that gave the Clippers a 14-point cushion heading into the fourth. “I didn’t know he was 8 of 9 from 3,” Lue said. “But I knew he was shooting the rock.” The Cavs were hanging around and only down 10 when the Clippers went on a 12-0 run that featured 3s by George and Lou Williams that ended any hopes of a Cleveland comeback. Collin Sexton scored 27 and Darius Garland 23 for the Cavaliers, who played well in spurts but couldn't stop the Clippers' 3-point barrage. “Paul George had more 3s than our team,” Garland said. “I don't think we're going to win many games shooting just 2s."" TIP-INS Clippers: Ivica Zubac had 16 rebounds. ... Dropped their first five 3-pointers and went 6 of 9 from deep in the first quarter. ... Los Angeles went 4-2 on the trip is 11-2 in its last 13 overall. ... Lue has known Sexton for years and is not surprised by the guard's quick rise to stardom. “He's a hard worker,” said Lue, who was fired six games into Sexton's rookie season. “When I was here we had to kick him out of the gym because he was doing too much.” Cavaliers: F Larry Nance Jr. missed his fourth game with a sprained right wrist. Nance came back after sitting out two games, but aggravated the injury. ... F Kevin Love is getting closer to playing after being sidelined for months with a severe right calf strain. He's finally doing individual basketball activities. The five-time All-Star has played just 46 minutes this season. “He was moving around and looks good,” coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “He says he feels good. Obviously, we’re going to be intelligent about how we bring him back."" TY GAME The final stop on the Clippers’ trip was also a special one for coach Lue, who guided the Cavaliers to the NBA title in 2016. It was his first visit to Cleveland as a head coach, and he received a nice ovation when he was introduced before the game. “What we did will always be in my heart,” Lue said, adding he stays in touch with several players from that team. “It was just a magical year, so that bond will never be broken.”","401267488"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo shows off how he can get his teammates involved, as he posts a triple-double of 21 points, 10 assists and 14 rebounds in the Bucks' rout of the Pacers. (0:45) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo didn't play at all in the fourth quarter and still had a triple-double while helping the Milwaukee Bucks roll to a lopsided victory. The reigning two-time MVP had 21 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in the Bucks' 130-110 rout of the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night. Antetokounmpo shot 7 of 8 from the floor and 7 of 8 from the line. “He's playing really, really unselfishly,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “He's seeing things and making the right read and the right passes. I just think he's in a great place mindset-wise. He's aggressive and attacking when it's needed. He's finding his teammates and finding opportunities for everybody else when it's needed.” Over his last two games, Antetokounmpo has shot a combined 15 of 19 from the floor and hasn't attempted a 3-pointer. Antetokounmpo is making just 28% of his 3-point attempts this season. Antetokounmpo completed his third triple-double of the season in the final minute of the third quarter when he got his 10th assist, setting up Bobby Portis for a corner 3-pointer that capped a 10-0 run and gave the Bucks a 34-point advantage. Milwaukee led by as many as 40 in the fourth quarter over a Pacers team that had beaten the Memphis Grizzlies 134-116 one night earlier. “We just didn't come out with enough urgency on both ends,” Pacers forward Doug McDermott said. “It's something we've got to clean up. We've got to come out with that mindset that just because we played the night before doesn't give us an excuse to kind of lay an egg.” Milwaukee never trailed and shot 21 of 48 from 3-point range in its last home contest before beginning a six-game trip. The Bucks have gone 42 of 90 on 3-point attempts over their last two games. The Bucks have made at least 20 3-pointers in five of their 21 games this season. Before this season, the Bucks had made as many as 20 3-pointers in a game just four times in franchise history. Bryn Forbes, who scored 20 points and shot 4 of 7 from beyond the arc, said the Bucks' exceptional long-range production is a credit to their passing abilities. “I think there's a lot of guys that don't get credit for their ability to facilitate and pass the ball,” Forbes said. “It helps us get easy shots and open shots, which boosts the percentage up a lot.” Indiana’s Domantas Sabonis scored a career-high 33 points and had 12 rebounds and six assists, delivering a big performance for a second straight night. Sabonis had matched a career high with 32 points Tuesday against the Grizzlies. The Bucks had balanced scoring. Portis scored 18, Donte DiVincenzo 16 and Khris Middleton 12. Jrue Holiday and Brook Lopez scored 11 points each. Justin Holiday had 15 points for the Pacers. McDermott had 13, Malcolm Brogdon 12 and Aaron Holiday 11. TIP INS Pacers: Center Myles Turner played through a sore right shoulder that left him questionable, but he had just three points, two rebounds, two steals and one block in 23 minutes. Turner entered the night averaging 14.5 points, 6.9 rebounds and a league-high 4 blocks. Bucks: Milwaukee assigned three players to NBA G League teams earlier in the day. They assigned Jordan Nwora to the Salt Lake City Stars and Sam Merrill to the Memphis Hustle while transferring two-way forward Mamadi Diakite to the Lakeland Magic. The Bucks’ own G League affiliate, the Wisconsin Herd, opted against participating in the league’s modified season.","401267489"
"Kristaps Porzingis, not realizing he is supposed to inbound the ball, runs onto the court with the ball and doesn't get called for it. (0:16) ATLANTA -- — Luka Doncic scored 27 points and dished out 14 assists as the Dallas Mavericks snapped a six-game losing streak, defeating Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks 122-116 on Wednesday night. Kristaps Porzingis added 24 points and 11 rebounds for the Mavericks, including a crucial tip-in of a miss by Doncic with 32 seconds remaining that helped Dallas hold off a furious Atlanta comeback. Winning was a big relief for the Mavericks. “It wasn't perfect,” Doncic said. “But we got the win, and that's all that matters to me. We were so happy after the game. It's been a tough stretch.” Doncic clearly won the individual matchup between two of the NBA’s brightest young stars, who are forever linked after being dealt for each other in a blockbuster trade during the 2018 draft. With Dallas players hassling him the length of the court and coming at him with frequent double-teams, Young needed a late flourish to reach 21 points on 8-of-18 shooting. He had nine assists and four turnovers. “They were denying Trae the ball from pretty much the second we inbounded it,” said Kevin Huerter, who also had 21 points for the Hawks. “They made it tough on him.” Doncic had no such issues against the Hawks. He got plenty of help from his teammates — six Dallas players scored in double figures — and continually earned trips to the foul line, where he finished 10 of 10. Doncic came up just two rebounds shy of another triple-double. After a game that was tight for three quarters, the Mavericks pulled away at the start of the fourth and held on to snap their longest losing streak since a seven-game skid from March 2-14, 2019. Tim Hardaway Jr. pushed the margin to double digits for the first time all night with a pull-up jumper that gave the Mavericks a 95-85 lead with 10:14 remaining. Doncic pulled off another of his dazzling plays to help extend the margin. He stripped the ball from Cam Reddish and led a fast break, brushing off Hawks center Clint Capela with a crossover and hesitation at the 3-point line, accelerating toward the hoop before dishing off to Porzingis cutting down the lane for the dunk. John Collins led the Hawks with 35 points and 12 rebounds. Atlanta keeps struggling at the most crucial points of the game. Nine of their 11 losses have been by less than 10 points. “That's been out Achilles heel a little bit,” Collins said. “We've got to continue to work on it as a young team.” PORZINGIS PLAYING TIME The Mavericks have been careful with Porzingis' minutes, still mindful of the knee injury he sustained in last year's playoffs. The 7-foot-3 Latvian wants coach Rick Carlisle to be a little more generous with the playing time — especially in the first quarter. They've talked about an expanded role. “I feel it's best to play the whole first quarter,” Porzingis said. “Especially coming back from an injury. It's hard to get into a rhythm playing four minutes here, five minutes there.” NO FREEBIES Collins turned in a big night without a single trip to the foul line. “I honestly feel like with how athletic I am, it's hard for the referees to judge what's a foul, what's not a foul,” he said. “It says my game is real. To do it without getting to the line, those are all real buckets.” TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas also snapped a seven-game losing streak in Atlanta. ... The Mavs have won three of five games against the Hawks in the Doncic-Young rivalry. ... Hardaway had another big game against his former team with 22 points, including five 3-pointers. He came in averaging 21.5 points in seven games since leaving the Hawks in 2017. Hawks: Capela extended the NBA's longest active streak of games with at least 10 rebounds to 17 in a row before halftime. He finished with 14 boards. ... Capela's double-digit rebounding streak is the longest by an Atlanta player since Dwight Howard’s 19-game run in 2017.","401267490"
"Bradley Beal goes into his bag of tricks to get through a pair of Heat defenders and then converts at the rim with a lefty finish. (0:21) MIAMI -- — Say this much for the Washington Wizards: They’re resilient. And the Miami Heat haven't been. Bradley Beal scored 32 points and the Wizards rallied from a 13-point, second-half deficit to beat the freefalling Heat 103-100 on Wednesday night. Deni Avdija added 13 for Washington, which pulled off this comeback just three nights after digging its way out of an 18-point hole to beat the Brooklyn Nets. The Wizards — who had their season suspended for nearly two weeks because of virus issues in January — held Miami to 32 points in the game’s final 23 minutes. “We've gone through a lot. ... We fought and we kept fighting,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. “And that's what we're going to do. We're not happy with our win total. We're going to keep competing."" Rui Hachimura and Davis Bertans each scored 11 for Washington (5-13). The Wizards got to their hotel around 4 a.m. Wednesday, then woke up less than five hours later for their first COVID-19 test of the day and still had enough energy to win. “It's encouraging to win the game with defense,"" Bertans said. Tyler Herro scored 20 points for Miami, which fell to 7-14 after making the NBA Finals last season. Jimmy Butler had 19 and Bam Adebayo scored 17. “There's some points in the game that you can't even explain,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Look, everybody's disappointed. Everybody's uncomfortable. We all — staff and player alike — we want to be better than what we've shown."" Beal has scored at least 25 points in all of his 17 games this season, the fifth player to start a season on such a streak and the first since Rick Barry did it in 25 straight to begin the 1966-67 campaign. The Wizards were without Russell Westbrook, who has yet to play the second game in a back-to-back this season. Miami led by 10 at the half, just the third double-digit intermission lead for the Heat this season. They turned the other two into blowout wins. Not this one, even against a Wizards team that came into the night allowing an NBA-worst 121 points per game. “Things aren't going according to plan,"" Heat guard Duncan Robinson said. It was 68-55 when Herro opened the third quarter with a 3-pointer, and then not much of anything went right the rest of the way for the Eastern Conference champions. They missed 11 consecutive shots in the third quarter, then went 0 for 4 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final 56 seconds. “We just have to be better,"" Spoelstra said. “It's as simple as that."" TIP-INS Wizards: It was only 50 degrees in Miami when the Wizards landed early Wednesday, the coolest temperature greeting a team arriving to play the Heat since January 2019. ... The two highest-scoring games of Garrison Mathews’ career have both been against Miami, a 28-pointer in December 2019 and a 22-pointer last month. He was held to eight on Wednesday. Heat: Miami went on a 13-0 first-quarter run, the team’s third-longest consecutive point streak of the season. ... Avery Bradley left in the second half with a strained right calf. ... Herro made his first four 3-point attempts, then missed his last five, including a try as time expired. BEAL MILESTONE Beal’s 15th point on Wednesday gave him 12,000 for his Washington career. He became the second player to score that many for the franchise, joining only Elvin Hayes (15,551). Beal is also the 21st player in NBA history with 40 consecutive games of at least 20 points. LEONARD OUT Heat center Meyers Leonard had season-ending stabilization surgery Tuesday on his left shoulder. He appeared in only three games this season. “If anybody can handle it mentally, emotionally and stay positive, that’s Meyers. ... I love the guy,” Spoelstra said.","401267491"
"Julius Randle drains a career-best five 3-pointers, part of a game-high 27, to help the Knicks fend off the Bulls. (0:52) CHICAGO -- — Julius Randle scored 27 points and tied a career high by hitting five 3-pointers, and the New York Knicks beat the Chicago Bulls 107-103 on Wednesday night. New York outscored the Bulls 34-17 in the first quarter. The Knicks withstood a huge run in the fourth and came away with the win after losing two nights earlier in Chicago. Randle made 5 of 7 from beyond the arc to equal his career best at Brooklyn on Dec. 26, 2019. He hit three in a row late in the opening quarter. “That's what we expect from him,” coach Tom Thibodeau said. “A veteran leader. Plays strong on both sides of the ball. Shared the ball. Make the right plays. Set an example for everyone as to how you're gonna work. You give the team the belief that we can win. And you get to that by making hustle plays.” Elfrid Payton added 20 points and eight rebounds. RJ Barrett scored 17, and the Knicks picked up the win after dropping five of six. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 24 points, though he was 0 for 7 on 3's. Thaddeus Young scored 19. Lauri Markkanen, coming off back-to-back outings with 30 or more, cooled off with nine points. The Bulls shot about 49% overall despite making just 6 of 36 3-pointers. They have lost four of their past five games overall and are 3-7 at home. “I'm hopeful it's a real good learning experience competitively for our guys,” coach Billy Donovan said. “We shot the ball miserably tonight. That happens. You have to find other ways to win. I thought we got dirty and grimy and physical, but it needed to be that way a lot earlier.” CLOSE CALL The Knicks led 94-76 early in the fourth before the Bulls went on a 20-5 run. Daniel Gafford's alley-oop and Markkanen's driving dunk cut it to 99-96 with 5:45 left. Reggie Bullock made a 3 for New York and Payton pulled up for a turnaround jumper in the lane to bump the lead back up to eight with 3:33 remaining. Coby White hit a 3 for Chicago, but Randle answered with a jumper with just over two minutes remaining. A driving dunk by LaVine cut it to 106-101 with 1:18 left. It remained that way until Young tipped in White's missed 3 in the closing seconds. “It was kind of like a playoff game in a sense, where you're playing a team back to back and we were able to make the necessary adjustments that we need to make,” Randle said. “I think just our start of the game was a million times better as far as our intensity, our focus and our energy. We made the adjustments. They're a good team. They're a good offensive team. We had to be locked in and we were.” TIP-INS Knicks: New York’s first 22 points came in the paint before Randle hit 3-pointers on three straight possessions and Alec Burks added another one. ...

""I think he's a great fit for the city. High-character guy, very intelligent. I love Billy and Mo Cheeks as well.

Darius Bazley had 18 points and a career-high 12 rebounds, Al Horford scored 17 points and Hamidou Diallo added 16 for the Thunder. Oklahoma City had allowed 147 and 136 points in its previous two games — both losses. On Wednesday, the Thunder allowed a season-low point total. Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said his team had the right approach heading into the rematch. “I give our guys credit not getting too emotional after that last game,"" he said. ""No one likes losing by 30 and giving up 130. But I don’t think we got too low after that one, just like we won’t get too high after this one. But they really came in with a clean slate and wanted to learn.” The Rockets scored a season high for points on Monday and a season low on Wednesday. Houston made a franchise record 28 3-pointers on 52 attempts on Monday, but connected on just 12 of 46 in the rematch. Eric Gordon scored 22 points and Victor Oladipo added 19 for the Rockets, whose win streak ended at six games. Christian Wood, who entered the night averaging 23.3 points and 10.7 rebounds, finished with eight points and six rebounds in 22 minutes, “When you’re not making shots, you’ve got to play a little bit harder on defense and figure out ways to create a little bit easier opportunities on offense,” Gordon said. “The energy just wasn’t there. We missed a ton of shots to where we just couldn’t really get in a groove.” Rockets guard John Wall and Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander missed Wednesday’s rematch. Wall, who averages 17.8 points and 5.8 assists, rested on the first half of a back-to-back with the Memphis Grizzlies on tap on Thursday. Gilgeous-Alexander, who leads the Thunder with 21.8 points and 6.3 assists, sat out with a left knee sprain. Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said it wasn’t too serious and the team was being cautious.

On Wednesday, they trailed 54-43 at halftime, scoring a season low for points in a first half and making just 6 of 25 3s.

"DeMar DeRozan throws down a thunderous jam late in the fourth quarter.

Well, 12 good minutes was all it took to pull out a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. DeMar DeRozan scored 30 points and San Antonio rallied from a 16-point deficit to beat Minnesota 111-108 on Wednesday night. “They hung in,” Popovich said. “It shows a lot of good character. You get down. We lost the last two games. We haven’t played well. We got down again, but they kept plugging away, and that’s impressive to me.” Jakob Poeltl added 19 points and Dejounte Murray had 15 points and 11 rebounds. Malik Beasley scored 29 points and D’Angelo Russell added 20 for Minnesota, which was outscored 32-18 in the final quarter. The Timberwolves dropped to 1-9 on the road this season. The Spurs won for the first time when trailing by 15 or more points at any time in the game. San Antonio trailed until the final four minutes, closing the game on a 30-11 run. “We just fought,” Murray said. “You like to see that fight from the whole unit, whoever is on the floor.” After dropping its previous two games against Memphis, San Antonio finished 4-3 in what became a seven-game homestand due to a postponement at New Orleans. The Spurs were without veteran forwards LaMarcus Aldridge and Rudy Gay, who were both sidelined with hip injuries. Aldridge’s absence enabled Poeltl to make his 50th career start and his 46th with the Spurs. Poeltl’s presence proved key in the fourth quarter. The Spurs went on a 22-7 run to open the fourth quarter and take their first lead at 101-99 on Poeltl’s layup with 4:16 remaining. Poeltl and DeRozan combined to score the remaining Spurs points to seal the win. DeRozan fueled the run when he was fouled on a powerful one-handed dunk. His ensuing free throw pulled San Antonio within 99-93 with 6:29 left. “Just didn’t want to lose,” DeRozan said. “First three quarters were embarrassing, frustrating. We just had to buckle down in the fourth quarter and just lay it down.” The Timberwolves entered the game having lost eight of their previous 10, but quickly built momentum. Minnesota had four players score in taking a 12-6 lead five minutes into the game. Minnesota was 4 for 8 on 3-pointers in the opening quarter and finished 13 for 32 overall.

"Zion Williamson drops 28 points, seven rebounds and six assists as the Pelicans take care of business at home vs. the Suns. (1:29) NEW ORLEANS -- — Zion Williamson punctuated a 28-point performance with a soaring, one-handed alley-oop jam during a decisive fourth-quarter surge, and the New Orleans Pelicans soundly defeated the Phoenix Suns 123-101 on Wednesday night. “That's something I get to see all the time, but it still amazes me every time he does it,” Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram said of Williamson's knockout-blow dunk. ""He started the game really, really good. He was very efficient ... and he just saw everything go in tonight. “That's definitely a confidence boost for him and I don't think he needs much confidence,” Ingram added. Ingram scored 23 and Lonzo Ball added 18 points for New Orleans, which led by as many as 28 in the fourth quarter and ended a two-game slide while also stopping the Suns' winning streak at three. Steven Adams, who returned from a sore left calf that had sidelined him 1 1/2 games, scored 11 points and grabbed 13 rebounds. “I don’t think there’s any doubt it was our best game of the year.,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We played both ends of the floor well and we played for four quarters."" Devin Booker scored 25 for the Suns, who never led in the second half. Deandre Ayton had 13 points and 11 rebounds. The Pelicans outscored the Suns by 37 when their lineup included Williamson, who also had seven rebounds and six assists. He made 12 of 14 shots from the field, including the only 3-pointer he attempted. “There were times where we had four guys around him, and he still dribbled right by us and got to the basket,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. Williamson also was everywhere on the defensive end, defending the paint and closing out perimeter shooters. “Easily his best game of the year if we’re talking both ends of the floor,"" Van Gundy said. ""That’s by far the best defense I’ve seen him play. He covered a lot of ground. He worked really hard.” Williamson also had a couple alley-oop dunks, the last of which put the Pelicans up 108-82. After that, Williams subbed out the entire Suns lineup with half the fourth quarter still remaining. “I know whatever energy we can get, we need, because we need to run off some wins,” Williamson said. “I feel like I'm improving as the season goes on. The game's getting slower and slower for me.” The Pelicans took their first double-digit lead when Ball's 3 made it 72-61 halfway through the third. It was the 14th game this season in which New Orleans had taken a lead of 10 or more. The Pelicans had blown six of the previous 13, but not this time. Josh Hart's 3, Williamson's dunk of Nickeil Alexander-Walker's alley-oop lob and JJ Redick's 3 helped the Pelicans finish the third period with an 88-74 lead. New Orleans then opened the fourth with seven straight points on Williamson's driving leaner, Hart's corner 3 that Williamson set up with a pass from the paint and Hart's fast-break layup to make it 95-74 with 10:31 left.

Hield finished with 15 points and 11 rebounds, Harrison Barnes scored 24 points and Tyrese Haliburton added 21. “We found a way to grind that one out,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “The first half it was kind of survival mode. We couldn’t make any open shots, we were missing layups, we weren’t attacking. Our guys found a way. Not the prettiest of wins, but what a gutsy performance by our guys.” The Kings offense was uneven much of the night. Sacramento was also outrebounded and outscored in the paint, yet came up with several big stops in the second half. The Kings also limited the Celtics to two buckets over the final 2:26 after Jayson Tatum’s tying 3-pointer. “Defensively, that has to be our hallmark,” Barnes said. “When we don’t, it gets ugly. Shout out to our bigs for protecting the paint. There were a lot of pick-and-rolls tonight and our guards were being active.” Tatum had 27 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds for the Celtics. Jaylen Brown scored 21. Boston played without three of its top ballhandlers due to injuries. “We struggled to get stops late but the last two quarters, (the Kings) made a lot of tough plays, too,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “Fox and Haliburton are a handful.” Fox scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, including a spectacular driving layup that put the Kings up 102-100. Tatum’s three-point play pulled the Celtics within 112-111 with 1:06 remaining before Fox connected on a step-back 17-footer with 58.8 seconds left. Boston’s Javonte Green missed when he tried to dunk past a pair of defenders and Tatum’s 3-point try with 1 second left missed the mark. Brown declined to put the blame for Boston’s loss on the injuries. “We’ve been pretty good on back-to-backs all year,” he said. “We were short on bodies, but still a game we could have won.” BOSTON’S GUARD DOWN The Celtics, still reeling from the loss of Marcus Smart to a left calf injury Saturday, played with an even thinner backcourt. Kemba Walker (left knee) was rested on the second half of a back-to-back after playing a season-high 31 minutes against Golden State on Tuesday. First-round pick Payton Pritchard sat out a sixth consecutive game because of a right MCL sprain. “Obviously we were down some guys, but at the same time I trust that the guys in here will be ready to roll,” Stevens said. “A lot of our guys gave us a lot of good things.” Jeff Teague started at point guard and had seven points and one assists. Tremont Waters (three points, five assists) also saw time at the point. KINGS ROOKIE HONORED Haliburton, the 12th overall pick in the draft, made a heads-up play to end the third quarter when he jumped and scored off an offensive rebound as time ran out. Haliburton raced in and jumped to grab the ball, which deflected off the glass following Hield’s desperation heave just inside midcourt. The play was reviewed and upheld. Earlier in the day Haliburton was named the Western Conference rookie of the month for games played in December and January. TIP-INS Celtics: Brown had seven points during a 19-4 run in the third. … Boston missed nine consecutive shots and went scoreless for 4½ minutes in the second quarter. … Tatum made a buzzer-beating 10-foot floater to end the first. Kings: Nemanja Bjelica (back spasms) was held out.","401267496"
"Robert Covington goes up for the rebound against Joel Embiid but unintentionally tips the ball into the hoop. (0:15) PHILADELPHIA -- — Without Damian Lillard or CJ McCollum, Portland's “other guys” stepped in for the stars and pulled off the upset in Philly. Gary Trent Jr. scored 24 points and Enes Kanter had 17 points and 18 rebounds to lead the undermanned Trail Blazers to a 121-105 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night. Carmelo Anthony had 22 points and a Trail Blazers team with four starters missing led by as many as 29 points against the top team in the East. “Dame is our best player, our superstar,” Kanter said. “But on both ends of the floor, the other guys did an amazing job today.” Joel Embiid scored 37 points for the Sixers. Tobias Harris added 12 points and 11 boards. Embiid puffed-up his All-Star game credentials in a game that otherwise lacked star power. Sixers guard Ben Simmons sat out with tightness in his left calf. Portland played without Lillard (abdominal strain) and Derrick Jones Jr. (left foot sprain). Throw in four players already out with injuries -- including Jusuf Nurkic (wrist) and McCollum (left foot) -- and the Trail Blazers were down to nine players. “It does change the chemistry of the game,” coach Terry Stotts said. “We've lost games against teams that were short-handed.” Portland got one this time around. CJ Elleby scored 15 points for the Trail Blazers. “It was just a different energy with the team,"" Elleby said. “It was a celebration tonight.” Sixers President Daryl Morey replied, “ I am not fooled ” hours before the game to a tweet that noted all of Portland’s injuries. He had reason for concern. With Portland trying to keep Embiid in check, Trent hit two 3s and Portland outscored the 76ers 40-19 in the third.. Portland entered 26th in the NBA in team defense, allowing 117.1 points per game. McCollum tweeted, “We might move up to 22nd in the league in Defense after this outstanding performance !” Embiid scored 31 points in the first half (on 11-of-17 shooting; 9 of 9 from the line) and might have topped 40 had he not left the game for about four minutes when he tweaked his right knee. Embiid gave Philly a scare with an awkward landing when he tried to block a shot in the first quarter. Embiid — who said he was “pretty concerned” at first — walked straight to the locker room but returned with 90 seconds left in the quarter. “I kind of felt it when I landed, but I ended up coming back and pushing through it,” Embiid said. “As the game kept going, I felt good. I mean, I wasn't all the way there but I was just trying to push and make sure we get a chance” The 76ers’ big man scored 25 points in the second quarter and carried the Sixers as they struggled from outside. The Sixers missed all 10 3-point attempts in the half and that led to a 57-all tie at the break. “I thought we missed Ben’s presence all over the floor,” Sixers coach Doc Rivers said. “He spearheads our defense. We were a bad defensive team tonight, but I thought we were worse offensively.” Portland opened the second half on a 12-0 run -- the 76ers missed two more 3s over that run -- and Embiid didn’t get off a shot. “Third quarter, especially on the road, can be a swing quarter. It made the difference,” Stotts said. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard shared a pregame hug with Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw. Outlaw was the former police chief of Portland, Oregon. ... Stotts said Lillard is day-to-day. ... Trent hit four 3s and Portland was 13 of 31. 76ers: Furkan Korkmaz started for Simmons. Rivers didn’t expect Simmons to miss much time. ... Embiid’s points tied Andrew Toney’s franchise record for most in a single quarter. Tony scored 25 in the fourth quarter March 21, 1982, vs. Boston. ... G Seth Curry did not play in the second half because he didn't feel well.","401267497"
"Donovan Mitchell gets the ball in the open court and clanks an extremely easy wide-open dunk attempt. (0:30) ATLANTA -- — Jordan Clarkson sank five 3-pointers while scoring 23 points and the Utah Jazz protected the NBA’s best record with a runaway 112-91 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night. Bojan Bogdanovic had 21 points and Donovan Mitchell added 18 for Utah (17-5). Atlanta point guard Trae Young was held out with a bruised right calf. Rajon Rondo made his second start of the season and did not score. Another starter, forward De’Andre Hunter (right knee), missed his third consecutive game. John Collins led Atlanta with 17 points. The Hawks have lost three consecutive games and four of their last five. Utah couldn’t pull away from the short-handed Hawks until outscoring Atlanta 35-26 in the third period. “In the second half I feel like we started attacking defensively,” Clarkson said. “... The biggest thing that we kind of preach ... is getting the stops because that’s going to fuel the offense.” Without Young, their leading scorer, the Hawks’ offense struggled. After failing to lead at any point of its 116-92 loss at Utah on Jan. 15, Atlanta led 2-0 when Kevin Huerter opened the game with a jumper. It was the Hawks’ only lead. Huerter had 16 points. Utah answered Huerter’s basket with 12 consecutive points. Mitchell had six points in the run. The Jazz led 45-37 at halftime. The Hawks set season lows for points in any half and by shooting only 30% (15 of 50) from the field in the first half. The Hawks’ shooting improved only slightly in the second half to finish at 32.7% (32 of 98). “If you’re shooting 30% for the game, it’s going to be hard to win,” said Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce. “It caught up to us in the second half.” TIP-INS Jazz: After a slow start, Utah played closer to its standard as the NBA’s best 3-point shooting team. The Jazz made four of six 3s in the third period and 13 of 27 for the game. Clarkson made five of seven 3s. Utah leads the NBA with its average of 16.9 3s per game. Entering the game, Utah’s 355 3s through 21 games were the most in league history. ... Rudy Gobert had 11 points and 12 rebounds. Hawks: Pierce made a plea for fans — and media — to give Young more All-Star support. Young is only sixth among Eastern Conference guards in the All-Star voting. He was a starter in the 2020 game. ... Rookie Onyeka Okongwu (left Achilles) did not play. ... Capela had 14 rebounds in the first half and 17 overall, extending his streak of games with at least 10 rebounds to 18. It is the NBA’s longest active streak. ... Tony Snell made each of his four 3s off the bench for 12 points. FOUL TROUBLE Utah’s Mike Conley went to the bench after he was called for his third foul late in the first quarter, and his return helped fuel the third-quarter surge. “We’re playing at a high enough level to win the game but we can’t rely on that and we know that,” Conley said. BEST OF THE BEST The Hawks also have played Philadelphia, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers, teams competing with Utah for the league’s best record. Pierce said before the game he believes the Jazz are “the best team we have played this year, and I say team strongly.” LOSING AT HOME The Hawks (10-12) fell to 5-7 at home with their third consecutive loss, each at State Farm Arena against a Western Conference opponent.","401267498"
"Andrew Wiggins rises up to deny Luka Doncic of a layup and Steph Curry is loving it on the bench. (0:21) DALLAS -- — With no traditional center available, the Golden State Warriors’ “dearth lineup” proved more than enough Thursday night. Kelly Oubre Jr. scored a career-high 40 points, Stephen Curry had 28 and the Warriors went small in a runaway win, beating the Dallas Mavericks 147-116 in the first of a two-game series. Draymond Green had 11 points and a season-high 15 assists as a makeshift center, helping Golden State get by without using any player taller than 6-foot-7 forward Andrew Wiggins due to injuries. The Warriors outscored Dallas 54-36 in the paint and outrebounded the Mavs 45-42. “It felt a lot like summer league,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of the game’s frenetic pace. “I think I only called plays out of timeouts. It was like the ‘Run TMC’ days. I just needed my fish tie.” Golden State took control late in the third quarter after a floater by Tim Hardaway Jr. pulled the Mavericks within 93-91 with 5:52 left in the period. The Warriors went on a 17-4 run mixing outside shooting and attacks on the rim and led 110-96 after three. With Curry and Green on the bench during the first half of the fourth quarter, Golden State went on a 17-7 run to put the game away. Dallas trailed 130-105 with 5:35 to play when coach Rick Carlisle emptied his bench. The 147 points were a season best for Golden State and the most allowed this year by Dallas. The win puts the Warriors, looking to return to the playoffs after last season’s last-place finish the West, in a tie for eighth place with San Antonio. Luka Doncic led the Mavericks with 27 points. Kristaps Porzingis had 25, Hardaway added 19 and Jalen Brunson 18 off the bench. Dallas came off a Wednesday night win at Atlanta that snapped a six-game losing streak and has lost six straight home games. The Mavericks shot 51.1% during the first half with 15 3-pointers, which tied a franchise record for a half, then hit only 31.9% during the second and scored 20 points in each of the last two periods. “This was a difficult lesson,” Carlisle said. The Warriors dressed nine players and played without both players who have started at center this season — James Wiseman (sprained left wrist) and Kevon Looney (sprained left ankle) — and also without power forward Eric Paschall (woke up Thursday with a swollen knee). Golden State used power forward Green in the middle and turned to Juan Toscano-Anderson to make this third start up front and ninth appearance this season. Toscano-Anderson scored 14 points, two shy of his career high. Dallas led 76-74 at halftime, falling one point short of its high scoring half of the season while the Warriors set a season best for a half. TIP-INS Warriors: Oubre shot 7 for 10 behind the arc. ... Wiggins hit 5 of 6 shots in the second half after going 2 for 12 in the first. Mavericks: Porzingis played back-to-back games for the second time in four opportunities this season in his return from knee surgery in October. ... Dallas began a seven-game homestand, its longest of the season’s first half. DEALING WITH GREEN Green fell one assist short of tying his career record. Carlisle called him “a point guard, an unusual point guard-power forward.” Green missed much of training camp after testing positive for the coronavirus and then sat out the first four games with a foot injury. “He’s feeling better, in much better shape,” Kerr said.","401267499"
"Christian Wood rolls over his right ankle as he is helped off by teammates in the Rockets' win vs. the Grizzlies. (1:07) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — John Wall scored 22 points, Eric Gordon added 20 and the Houston Rockets beat the Memphis Grizzlies 115-103 on Thursday night. Jae’Sean Tate had a season-high 19 points for Houston, while Christian Wood scored 17 points on 7-of-10 shooting before rolling his right ankle in the third quarter. He did not return and left the arena in a wheelchair. Wall said the veteran Rockets have told Tate, a rookie, to stay within his game and take advantage of his shots, particularly corner 3s. “He listened to the veterans, so we’re fine with those,” Wall said. Rookie Desmond Bane led the Grizzlies with 16 points, while Ja Morant added 15. Tyus Jones and Brandon Clarke finished with 13 each as Memphis lost its second straight. Both teams lost by big margins in their previous games, ending extended winning streaks. But Houston showed no carryover from its 17-point loss at Oklahoma City on Wednesday. After shooting 26% from 3-point range against the Thunder, the Rockets were 19 of 45 (42.2%) against Memphis. Tate said that the loss to the Thunder “was a great wakeup call to us. We figured we came into a team that jumped on us from the gate.” “We just realized that we’re not that team that can just walk into games and not be ready from the jump.” The game got away from the Grizzlies late in the first half as the Rockets used an 18-4 run to carry a 60-47 lead into the break. The Grizzlies endured stretches of poor shooting in the half as Houston connected on 51% of its shots, including 9 of 18 from outside the arc. “Regardless of how we shoot the ball, we’ve got to be able to defend,” Bane said. “That’s got to be our constant and our consistent thing that we can hang our hat on. Tonight, we weren’t good enough.” Now, the Rockets must deal with the questions about Wood’s ankle. “We’ve just got to keep rolling and keep playing,” Wall said. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston went 3-1 on its four-game trip. ... G Victor Oladipo sat out, officially for recovery from a right quad injury. Grizzlies: C Jonas Valanciunas and G Grayson Allen remained out due to the league’s health and safety protocol. ... The Grizzlies shot 42.5% for the game. ... Jones and Bane were each 5 of 8 from the field. ALL- ALL-STAR JA Morant is in fourth place for Western Conference guards in the first returns in All-Star voting. He sits behind Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic and Damian Lillard. “Ja means so much to us, and I think people are recognizing not just the individual talent that he is, but the impact he has on winning and playing in that All-Star consideration,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. MORE FANS IN STANDS The Grizzlies moved into their third phase Thursday of allowing fans back into games on a limited basis. Previously, the team had a limited number of fans to socially distant courtside seats in groups of two to four. Later, suite holders and club box seats were allowed to attend. For the Houston game, select groups of season ticket holders were added to the previous groups, meaning up to 2,000 people or about 11% of capacity. FedExForum is allowed up to 20% capacity.","401267500"
"LeBron James says he's not happy at all that the NBA and NBPA are finalizing an agreement to have an All-Star Game in 2021. (1:14) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James is not happy about the NBA's decision to hold an All-Star game amid a compressed regular season and a global pandemic. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar also knows there's no chance his presence won't be required in Atlanta next month — particularly not after his latest spectacular performance in a career that just keeps hitting new heights. James had 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, Dennis Schröder added 21 points and the Lakers roared away in the second half for a 114-93 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night. James moved into third place on the NBA’s career field goals list while recording his 96th career triple-double and his second of the season, helping the Lakers open a five-game homestand with their 11th win in 14 games. Los Angeles finished on a 46-18 run, thoroughly clamping down on defense and cranking up its transition offense to win this rematch of the Western Conference finals in the bubble. Although James stacked big numbers on another scoresheet, he was more impressed by his team's effort on the other end against high-powered Denver. “We hang our hats on our defense,” James said. “We’re the No. 1 defensive team in the league, and we want to continue that.” Talen Horton-Tucker scored 12 of his 17 points during that inspired second-half effort by the defending NBA champions, who returned from a strong seven-game road trip and improved their surprisingly unimpressive home record to 5-4. Several Lakers said their superb second half was inspired by an aggressive halftime talking-to from coach Frank Vogel. “When we put our minds to it, this team can do great things,” Vogel said. “We were able to basically double their scoring in the second half, 68-35. We did it against a great opponent. It was a heck of a second half for us.” The Lakers took control with a 19-0 run spanning the final two quarters propelled by James and Horton-Tucker, who drove impressively into the paint to make four straight shots along with two steals and a block. Jamal Murray scored 20 points and Monte Morris added 16 for the Nuggets, who struggled down the stretch of just their second loss in eight games. Nikola Jokic managed just 13 points and 10 rebounds after getting 47 points and 12 boards Sunday in the Nuggets' most recent outing against Utah. “Offensively, we just didn't move the ball enough,” Murray said. “They just ran us in that second half — layups, dunks.” Denver took a 12-point lead into halftime with a 29-16 rebounding edge, but the Lakers closed the third quarter with a 15-0 run. TIP-INS Nuggets: Gary Harris sat out after straining his left adductor muscle last weekend. ... Denver hadn't played since last weekend because its scheduled game with Detroit on Monday was scrapped. Lakers: Their 21-point margin of victory was the biggest in franchise history after trailing by double digits at halftime, surpassing a 20-point win at Phoenix on Christmas in 1968. ... Anthony Davis had 13 points and nine rebounds. VAULTING THE STILT James made a finger-roll layup midway through the first quarter for his 12,682nd career field goal, pushing him past Wilt Chamberlain for third place in NBA history. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (15,837) and Karl Malone (13,528) ever made more shots. James became the third-leading scorer in NBA history a year ago, trailing only Abdul-Jabbar and Malone. “The association with a legend like Wilt Chamberlain, that does something for me,” James said. ""I’m someone who grew up reading about the game, studying the game. Wilt obviously was a big staple of that. It's very humbling.""","401267501"
"LaMelo Ball runs the fast break and gets around Donovan Mitchell to the basket to score a tough layup and force a Jazz timeout. (0:29) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — The Charlotte Hornets tried switching on defense to slow down the NBA's top team. It didn't work. Bojan Bogdanovic had 31 points on seven 3-pointers and the Jazz set a franchise record with 26 3's as they beat the Charlotte Hornets 138-121 on Friday night for their 14th victory in 15 games. Donovan Mitchell scored 30 points and Rudy Gobert added 12 points and 15 rebounds for the Jazz, who shot 52% from 3-point range and led by 26 in the second half. “They were playing small, so they were trying to switch and they were giving us open 3s in the corner,” Bogdanovic said. “Our point guards are doing a great job of finding all of us on the perimeter. But everything starts from our defense. If we guard we are able to run and shoot those transition 3s.” Said Jazz coach Quin Snyder: “We knew coming into the game that we’d see different defenses on and off the ball, whether it be switching 1 through 5, blitzing, zone, and I think the biggest thing was we needed to be in attack mode and understand that we can still move the ball, we can still be unselfish.” The Jazz were certainly that, finishing with 32 assists. Rookie LaMelo Ball was terrific in the loss with a career-high 34 points and eight assists for the Hornets, who lost to both conference leaders this week following a three-game winning streak. Mitchell called Ball “the real deal.” “I'm not going to lie, I'm very impressed,” Mitchell said. “Not just his play-making ability and his competitiveness but his joy. I don't think I have ever not seen him smile throughout the game.” Added Bogdanovic: “He is great. He really hurt us with his pick-and-roll game. He has a bright future in the league.” Hornets coach James Borrego was most pleased that Ball didn't have any turnovers. “That’s big for us, we need that,” Borrego said. “When I see that ratio, good things are going to happen for us most times than not, no matter if the shots go in or not.” Gordon Hayward had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Charlotte. The red-hot Jazz (18-5) entered the game with the NBA's best record and left no doubt about this one. Utah led by 15 at halftime and pulled away in the third quarter behind Bogdanovic, who was 4 of 4 from 3-point range during one stretch, helping the Jazz build a 93-70 lead. The short-handed Hornets cut the lead to nine with about three minutes to play in the fourth quarter, but Bogdanovic extinguished the rally with his sixth 3-pointer of the half with 1:18 left to push the lead to 13. TIP-INS Jazz: Bench outscored Charlotte's 40-28. Hornets: With Terry Rozier returning from a two-game absence because of an ankle injury, Borrego went with an unusual starting lineup that included three points guards — Rozier, Devonte Graham and Ball. ... Starting forward P.J. Washington missed his second straight game with a foot injury. His status for Sunday's game vs. the Wizards is uncertain. GRAHAM'S INJURY Both teams lost key players to injuries. Charlotte’s Devonte Graham left the game in the second quarter with a strained groin and did not return, while Utah's Mike Conley developed tightness in his hamstring and only played 22 minutes. Neither coach gave an update on the status of their players after the game. KEPT CLAWING Borrego was pleased with his team's play despite the loss. “Shoot, we scored 121 points on one of the best defenses we are going to see all year,” Borrego said. “They kept battling and fighting and we’ve just got to take that into the way we played there in the second half, just taking that into our next game.”","401267502"
"The third quarter is delayed after the Pacers' maintenance crew needs to work on the basket after a Zion Williamson dunk attempt late in the first half. (0:49) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Brandon Ingram turned in a terrific performance for New Orleans, and Lonzo Ball finished the job. Ingram scored 30 points to help the Pelicans top the Indiana Pacers 114-113 on Friday night. Ball added 20 points and nine rebounds as New Orleans won for the fourth time in six games. Zion Williamson had 18 points, and Steven Adams finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds. The Pelicans led by as many as 18 in the third quarter, but the Pacers rallied in the fourth and Justin Holiday’s seventh 3-pointer gave Indiana a 105-104 lead with 4:02 remaining. Ball made four 3s in the final period to help New Orleans escape with the win. He also came up with a key defensive stop in the final seconds. Pacers center Myles Turner drove the lane and Ball contested the 5-foot shot, which bounced off the outside of the rim and glass. “I just did the best I could,” Ball said. “I wish the game never got to that point really.” The Pelicans earned possession after a scrum resulted in a jump ball with 0.5 seconds remaining. “Lonzo was right there,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “Great defensive stop.” Holiday led Indiana with 22 points. Jeremy Lamb scored 17 points, and reserve T.J. McConnell had nine points and 15 assists. “This group could have easily quit, but that’s not who we are,” McConnell said. “We’re never going to lay down.” The Pacers outscored the Pelicans 38-28 in the fourth quarter. Coach Nate Bjorkgren stuck with his second team for nearly the entire final period. “They deserved to play all the way to the horn,” Bjorkgren said. Two nights after scoring a career-high 33 points at Milwaukee, Pacers All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis kept missing hooks and jump shots in the paint. He ended up with just eight points on 3-of-13 shooting. He sat out the fourth quarter of Indiana's third loss in four games. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson ranked No. 1 among active players in his first 40 games with 920 points. He also leads the league in points in the paint with an 18.1 average. Pacers: Allowed season-high 130 points Wednesday after scoring a season-high 134 points on Tuesday. ... Doug McDermott scored 14 points, and Malcolm Brogdon had 13. Turner finished with 12. CHECK THAT RIM The second half was delayed for about 15 minutes as a Bankers Life Fieldhouse worker climbed a ladder to fix the rim in front of the Pelicans bench. Williamson grabbed the rim with such ferocity on a first-half dunk, it wasn’t level. The rim initially wouldn’t cooperate and needed to be tugged repeatedly.","401267503"
"Nikola Vucevic and Evan Fournier score buckets late in the fourth quarter to put the Magic up for good against the Bulls. (0:22) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — The Orlando Magic aren’t just rooting for center Nikola Vucevic to make the NBA All-Star Game for the second time in his 10-year NBA career. They’re doing their part by voting for the versatile 7-footer every chance they get. Vucevic showed his all-star mettle on Friday, scoring a career-best 43 points as the Magic rallied late to beat the Chicago Bulls 123-119 to stop a four-game losing streak. Vucevic scored 13 of Orlando’s first 15 points against overmatched Chicago center Daniel Gafford and had a tie-breaking clutch hook shot with 1:49 to play after the Bulls had rallied from 14 points down to knot the score at 112. Vucevic, who became an all-star for the first time two seasons ago, made 17 of 29 shots, hit 4 3-pointers and grabbed 19 rebounds on Friday “I’ve gone and voted for him every single day, twice — as many times as I could vote and I’m trying to do my part,” Magic rookie point guard Cole Anthony said of Vucevic’s candidacy. “We definitely want to see him be an all-star because I 100 percent think he deserves it.” Vucevic set his career high with two free throws with 2.6 seconds left in the game. He topped his previous high of 41 points, which he scored in 2017 against Brooklyn. He said the win mattered more to him than the individual accomplishment. “It felt great to have a career high in a win because the last one was a loss,” Vucevic said. “It’s much better when you win because you can enjoy these things more when you win. I’m most happy about the win because I thought we had great effort from the beginning.” Trailing by as many as 14 points early in the fourth period, Chicago used a furious rally behind standout guard Zach LaVine and forged ties at 112- and 114-all. Orlando’s Evan Fournier hit a baseline jumper and two free throws in the final 81 seconds to give the Magic enough breathing room for the win. The Bulls lost their second straight and for the fifth time in six games. Chicago used a 29-15 run in the fourth to tie the game, but once again couldn’t do enough late to win. Just three nights removed from Toronto’s Fred VanVleet scoring 54 points against them, the Magic held LaVine in check most of the night. LaVine, who came into the night 10th in the NBA in scoring at 26.5 points per game, missed six of his first seven shots and had just two points in the first three quarters. He switched into attack mode in the fourth and finished with 26 points and eight assists. Chicago coach Billy Donovan would like to see LaVine be more aggressive early in games. “Zach’s played well, but for him to be aggressive early in the game — maybe not just scoring and shooting — but playing downhill, we need more of that from him,” Donovan said. Chicago rookie Patrick Williams scored a career-best 20 points. Coby White chipped in 16. Thaddeus Young had 15 points off the bench, while Lauri Markkanen scored 13 points. Vucevic had plenty of help as Fournier scored 14 of his 20 points in a seven-minute burst of the second quarter when Orlando wiped out a six-point deficit. Anthony added 17 points and nine assists and hit two clutch free throws with 16.4 seconds left as Orlando clung to a two-point edge. James Ennis III added 14 points for Orlando, which improved to 8-1 this season in games that it led at halftime. Ennis was happy that the Magic could reward Vucevic with a win to go with his career-best performance. “All of the Orlando people, vote for him because he deserves to be an all-star and he’s showing it every night,” Ennis III said. “He can’t be stopped right now.” TIP INS Bulls: Otto Porter made the trip to Orlando, but head coach Billy Donovan sounded as if the forward is still several days from returning because of recurring back spasms. Said Donovan of Porter, who has five games this season with at least three made 3-pointers: “I’d say he’s shut down for the time being. He’s getting treatment while he’s here and he’ll do some mobility work. A lot of it will depend on how he responds to all this stuff.” Magic: Frank Mason III, who signed with Orlando on Tuesday, had four points and four assists in his Orlando debut. ...

(1:12) NEW YORK -- — With Kevin Durant forced out of the game in the third quarter because of the NBA’s health and safety protocols, the Toronto Raptors beat the Brooklyn Nets 123-117 on Friday night behind 33 points from Pascal Siakam. Durant’s first game against the Raptors since rupturing his Achilles tendon in the 2019 NBA Finals was a frustrating one for him and a confusing night for everyone. The superstar forward wasn’t available to start the game — entering as a reserve for the first time in his 867-game NBA career — then was told he had to depart in the third quarter. “It was confusing, frustrating, bizarre,” said Joe Harris, who finished with a team-high 19 points. “For him to not start, then play, then he couldn’t play, just doesn’t make any sense. But, I don’t make the decisions. I just work here.” Kyle Lowry added 30 points and seven assists for the Raptors. Siakam had 11 rebounds and six assists. Norman Powell finished with 18 points, Chris Boucher had 17 and Fred VanVleet finished with 11 points on 4-for-16 shooting after scoring a career-best 54 in his last game. “I think we were ready and I think that’s the main thing,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “We believed we could come in and win from the start and even though it got a little kind of stop-startish and herky jerky there for lots of stretches, we kind of kept playing and hanging around and made some really big plays at the end.” The Nets rallied from a 17-point, second-quarter deficit and took the lead for the first time at 70-69 on Harris’ 3-pointer early in the third quarter. The advantage was extended to as many as six points, but Brooklyn couldn’t hold on without the NBA’s No. 2 scorer. James Harden had 17 points and 12 assists for the Nets, while Kyrie Irving added 15 points. Durant finished with eight points, after scoring 20 or more in each of his first 17 games, his longest streak to start a season in his career. “We missed some open looks and Lowry made some big shots,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. “We gave up offensive rebounds and turned the ball over. And you add it all up and they found separation in the last couple of minutes.” The Nets led 110-108 before Lowry’s 3-pointer gave Toronto the lead for good with 3:45 remaining. He scored 11 points in the final quarter. TIP-INS: Raptors: VanVleet’s 54 points against Orlando on Tuesday was the most by an undrafted player in NBA history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. ... Toronto currently has seven undrafted players on its roster: VanVleet, Aron Baynes, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis, Matt Thomas, Yuka Watanabe, and Paul Watson. Nets: Irving was coming off a season-high 39 points in his last game. ... The Nets had scored 120 or more points in a franchise record-tying four straight games. They set the previous record from January 15-21, 1984. IS THAT REALLY YOU? This was the first meeting of the two teams since the Raptors swept the Nets 4-0 inside the bubble in Orlando during last summer’s playoffs. Only four players on the Nets roster during that series (Chris Chiozza, Joe Harris, Tyler Johnson, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot) remain on the team.","401267505"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo backs LeBron James' sentiments about the All-Star Game, also saying he has zero interest or excitement for it. (1:30) CLEVELAND -- — The Bucks' plane never got off the ground Thursday night. It took them a little longer than usual to fly around the court Friday. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 33 points, Jrue Holiday added 17 and Milwaukee beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 123-105 in the opener of a six-game road trip that began with the Bucks stuck at home due to travel delays. Antetokounmpo picked up two early fouls and started slowly. But the reigning NBA MVP, who had a triple-double in just three quarters earlier this week, found his groove in the second half, scoring 13 in the third and 22 after halftime. The Bucks outscored the Cavs 29-16 in the the fourth and won their third straight after a long day. Antetokounmpo added 12 rebounds, Bobby Portis scored 14 and Donte DiVincenzo had 11 points, a career-high 11 boards and six assists. “It was kind of weird,” Antetokounmpo said of Milwaukee's unusual 24-hour ordeal. ""It took us a little bit before we got out rhythm. But each quarter we got better.” Collin Sexton scored 19 and Andre Drummond 18 for Cleveland, which has been one of the NBA's surprise teams but is starting a difficult stretch, beginning with back-to-back home games with the talented Bucks. “They made us pay for our mistakes,” Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “They keep coming.” Milwaukee's longest trip of the season's first half began ominously. The Bucks were supposed to leave Thursday night, but mechanical issues with their plane while they sat on the tarmac sent them home for the night and forced them to fly to Cleveland on game day. The Bucks didn't arrive until early in the afternoon. “It took me back to playing AAU, traveling the same day,” said DiVincenzo, who grabbed an offensive rebound and hit a 3-pointer early in the fourth to give the Bucks some momentum. Cleveland was still within four early in the fourth quarter when Middleton and Antetokounmpo drained 3-pointers to push Milwaukee's lead to 10. The Cavs, who made 11 3s after attempting just 10 on Wednesday night, stayed within striking distance before Bryn Forbes buried a long 3 for the Bucks to make it 117-105 and Budenholzer was able to pull his starters to get some rest after a long day. TIP-INS Bucks: Embarked on their longest road trip since the 2017-18 season ... Portis sparked Milwaukee with 10 straight points over the first and second quarters. ... Milwaukee made just seven 3-pointers after getting 21 in each of its past two games. No team in history has ever made 20 3s in three straight games. ... Milwaukee is 7-0 against the Central Division. Cavaliers: Fan favorite G Matthew Dellavedova, who hasn't played this season because of a severe concussion, went on Twitter to dismiss a report he's considering retirement. He called it a “temporary setback” and said his “only focus is getting healthy and back with the boys to help make a playoff push.” ... F Larry Nance remained sidelined with a sprained right wrist. ... Cleveland had its biggest crowd this season — 2,720 fans —- after the state of Ohio granted a variance allowing the team to bump its attendance at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse from 10% percent of capacity to 14%. FALLING (ALL)-STAR Like LeBron James, Antetokounmpo isn't happy about the NBA’s decision to hold an All-Star Game in Atlanta next month. “I want to see my family,” said Antetokounmpo, who was looking forward to the break. “I've got zero energy and zero excitement. But we've got to do it.” James called the league's decision “a slap in the face.” Sexton feels differently. “I’m definitely excited for it and hopefully I will be able to be a part of it,” Sexton said. “Everybody is going to voice their opinion, but I’d feel proud to represent my team, represent the organization and just go out there and be part of All-Star Weekend.”","401267506"
"Bradley Beal flings one of his sneakers to a fan in the crowd wearing his St. Louis Eagles high school jersey. (0:25) MIAMI -- — Washington’s Bradley Beal thought he had an open path to a layup in the opening minutes, unaware that Miami’s Bam Adebayo was going to swat his shot out of bounds with ease. Beal’s night didn’t get any better. And the Heat looked like themselves again. Beal — the NBA’s scoring leader, averaging 34.8 points entering Friday — missed his first 13 shot attempts, reserve Kendrick Nunn had 25 points and Miami rolled to a 122-95 win over the Wizards. “Every human being is due for a bad day,"" Beal said. Adebayo scored 21 for Miami, which got 17 points from Kelly Olynyk, 17 more from Tyler Herro and a 14-point, nine-assist, eight-rebound night from Jimmy Butler. “We were competing on both ends. ... It's great to see us try to get back to that form we had last year,"" Adebayo said. “Good to get a win."" Beal scored only seven points on 1-for-14 shooting for Washington, the first time this season he has been held below 25. Alex Len scored 18, Russell Westbrook scored 13 and Rui Hachimura added 12 for the Wizards, who won in Miami on Wednesday by holding the Heat to 35 second-half points — then gave up 40 in the first quarter on Friday. Miami (8-14) led by as many as 37, the biggest Heat lead of the season — and biggest Washington deficit of the season. “We didn't come out with the right frame of mind to compete against a team that's fighting for their lives as well,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. Plenty changed for the Heat. They had a morning shootaround, a break from the norm. They changed the starting lineup, inserting Goran Dragic for Herro. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra even challenged a foul call, something he hardly ever does, and was successful. “We're seeing improvement,"" Spoelstra said. “We just need time. Our core guys have not been on the court together a lot this season, and you're trying to build habits and play the right way."" And Beal simply couldn’t buy a basket. He was 0 for 6 in each of the first two quarters, and then missed his first shot of the third before getting a 3-pointer to fall with 9:46 left in the period. That was his last shot of the night. Washington lifted all five of its starters with 4:14 left in the third, down 93-61. “They double- and triple-teamed a lot. ... They did a good job,"" Beal said. “Very good job."" TIP-INS Wizards: Beal's scoring average fell to 33.3. ... Washington’s 5-14 start matches the seventh-worst in franchise history. ... The Wizards are 2-0 with Westbrook in the lineup against Brooklyn this season, and 0-11 when he’s in the lineup against any other team. Heat: Dragic left in the third quarter with a sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative. ... Adebayo was 11 for 11 from the foul line in the first quarter. The last time a Heat player made more in any quarter was 2007, when Dwyane Wade made 14 in the fourth against Cleveland. REFEREE DUO Lauren Holtkamp-Sterling and Ashley Moyer-Gleich were two of the officials, joined by crew chief Brian Forte. It was the second time in NBA history that two women worked a game; Natalie Sago and Jenna Schroeder were on a crew in Orlando together last month. BIRTHDAY MESSAGE Adebayo always signs off interviews by saying “Black Lives Matter"" and added a new twist Friday. “Everybody tell Trayvon Martin happy birthday,"" Adebayo said. Martin would have turned 26 on Friday. He was 17 when he was shot dead while walking to his father's home in Central Florida in 2012. The Black teen was unarmed when he was shot by George Zimmerman, whose acquittal under Florida’s self-defense law in July 2013 sparked the Black Lives Matter movement.","401267507"
"D'Angelo Russell drains the deep 3-pointer with 2.9 seconds left on the clock as the Timberwolves outlast the Thunder 106-103. (0:29) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — D'Angelo Russell made a 3-pointer with 3.7 seconds remaining to lift the Minnesota Timberwolves over the Oklahoma City Thunder 106-103 on Friday night. Russell dribbled near midcourt to let the clock run, took a couple of steps toward the basket and pulled up a few feet behind the 3-point arc for the winning shot. “Late in the game, D-Lo’s been a big shot-maker in his career,"" Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. ""I’ve got a lot of confidence and faith in D-Lo.” Oklahoma City's Hamidou Diallo missed a 3-pointer as time expired. “We had some chances,” said Thunder center Al Horford, who scored 26 points. “We had opportunities. ... That happens sometimes.” Malik Beasley scored 24 points and Russell added 21 for the Timberwolves, who had lost nine of their previous 11 games. Diallo had 16 points and a career-high 10 assists. Oklahoma City was missing starters Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (left knee sprain), George Hill (thumb) and Lu Dort (sore left knee) along with backup point guard Theo Maledon (health and safety protocols), who had been starting in Hill's place. The Thunder had just eight players available, and they all played at least 14 minutes. “There was great output tonight physically,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “That was like a high effort game. I thought we played really hard, I thought we competed really hard.” The Timberwolves, who still have the worst record in the Western Conference, were without Karl-Anthony Towns again (health and safety protocols). He has played in just four games this season. The Thunder led 55-51 at halftime after making eight of their final nine shots before the break. Horford scored 16 points in the first half. The Timberwolves dominated the third quarter and took an 85-76 lead into the fourth, but the Thunder rallied. Horford's 3-pointer tied the game at 103 with 25.7 seconds remaining and set up the final sequence. Saunders didn't like the fact that Diallo got a shot off at the end of the game, but he was pleased with the win. “I don’t want to take anything away from that,” he said. “I’ll say it again — it’s hard to win in this league on a night-in, night-out basis. Players are good. Everyone’s talented. So it definitely provided a morale boost.” TIP-INS Timberwolves: Beasley scored 10 points in the first quarter. ... G Ricky Rubio had eight assists. ... Naz Reid had 17 points and nine rebounds. ... F Jarred Vanderbilt had nine rebounds. Thunder: Scored the first eight points. ... Held the Timberwolves to 38.5% shooting in the first half. ...

STAT LINES Thunder forward Darius Bazley had 10 rebounds after grabbing 12 on Wednesday against Houston. He finished with 12 points on Friday. SMOOTH TRANSITION Diallo's career-high 10 assists passed his previous high of four. He handled the ball more than usual with Hill and Maledon out. “Even the fact that we put the ball in his hands that much over the course of a game — that’s not something I think he would have handled as well in past seasons,"" Daigneault said. ""So it’s certainly growth. And I think he did a good job of moving it.” QUOTABLE Saunders, on Rubio, who missed time because of league safety protocols and is just getting back into a groove: “He’s found some more Ricky Rubio-like moments. There’s a reason that guys want to play with him. And that’s because he organizes players, competes, and he does the right things. He’ll continue to get better and better, especially coming off a little bit of a layoff.”","401267508"
"Devin Booker sinks the deep 3-pointer as the Suns are cruising vs. the Pistons. (0:19) PHOENIX -- — The Phoenix Suns controlled almost the entire game against the Detroit Pistons until a rough few minutes during the second half made the game a little tighter. That's when coach Monty Williams went to his two-step approach for getting the Suns back on track. First step, put All-Star guard Chris Paul back into the game. Second step, put All-Star guard Devin Booker back into the game. Booker and Paul hit back-to-back 3-pointers midway through the fourth quarter to stop a Pistons' rally and the Suns rolled to a 109-92 win on Friday night. Booker had 23 points while Paul had 20 points and nine assists. “It was a good effort on both ends,” Booker said. “From beginning to end, we had it around 10 to 15 points most of the game, but we knew they weren’t going to give in.” Paul continued his high-production run of the past few weeks. The 10-time All-Star — who came to the desert in a trade with Oklahoma City during the offseason — is averaging more than 22 points over the past seven games, and the Suns have won four of them. “At the end of the day, what I’m most focused on is winning games,” Paul said. “If we’re winning games, I’m cool. But I need to play well for that to happen.” Frank Kaminsky added 15 points and five rebounds in his first start of the season as the Suns improved to 12-9. Williams said he put the 7-foot Kaminsky in the lineup to give the Suns Phoenix had a double-digit lead most of the game and had an 87-68 advantage by the end of the third quarter. Detroit pulled within 11 about midway through the fourth, but Booker and Paul hit back-to-back 3-pointers to push the game out of reach. The Pistons struggled in just about every phase but especially long-range shooting. They were 7 of 36 (19%) on 3-pointers, and the misses kept them from any sort of offensive rhythm. “We just couldn't hit a 3,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “We had some good looks.” Jerami Grant led the Pistons with 21 points. Detroit has lost three straight games and eight of its past 10. The loss dropped the Pistons to 5-17 for the season, which is the worst record in the NBA. One of Detroit's rare wins was against Phoenix earlier this season, but the second matchup didn't go as well. “We felt like we owed them,” Booker said. The Suns led 27-24 after one quarter, holding the Pistons to 33% shooting, including 1 of 9 from 3-point range. Phoenix pushed ahead by 17 points by midway through the second quarter before settling for a 57-44 halftime lead. Cam Johnson led the Suns with 10 points in the first half. The team's bench scored 27 of the 57 points before the break. ALL-STAR TALK Paul — who is president of the NBA players' union — said he's had several conversations with fellow players about the league's plans for this year's All-Star game. Some players, including LeBron James, aren't pleased with the idea of making another trip during the coronavirus pandemic, especially with so many regular-season games packed into a tight window. “Guys are entitled to their feelings,” Paul said. “I think the job for the union is to make sure our players are healthy and safe.""

"Kemba Walker comes up with three big-time baskets in the fourth quarter as he helps the Celtics edge out the Clippers for a 119-115 win. (0:46) LOS ANGELES -- — Jayson Tatum led a 3-point shooting spree and scored 34 points, helping the Boston Celtics hold off the Clippers 119-115 on Friday night without Paul George in the Los Angeles lineup. The Clippers sure could have used the NBA’s 3-point shooting leader. George, who is hitting 48% from long range, sat out with a sore right foot two nights after making 8 of 9 3-pointers in a win at Cleveland. Lou Williams scored the Clippers' final seven points, including a 3-pointer from the left corner that gave them a one-point lead with 46 seconds remaining. But the Celtics closed the game with six straight free throws to hand the Clippers just their third loss at home. “Our margin is such that we’re just going to play a lot of close games,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “We got to get used to doing our best in those moments.” Kawhi Leonard had 28 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers but missed all five of his 3-point attempts. The team was 14 of 32 from long range. Williams finished with 18 points off the bench. Kemba Walker added 24 points for the Celtics. They made 16 3-pointers — two off their season high. Tatum had five 3-pointers — one off his season best. “This was a good win, coming off a loss, down a few guys,” Tatum said. After trailing throughout the first half, Boston rallied in the third quarter, getting eight 3-pointers from five different players. The Clippers were limited to just two 3s while allowing the Celtics to score 39 points in the period. The Celtics took their first lead of the game on a 3-pointer by Grant Williams, who followed with another one, capping a run of three consecutive 3-pointers that began with Tatum. The Clippers rallied from nine down early in the fourth to tie the game three times. Leonard lifted Los Angeles to a 108-106 lead with a turnaround jumper over two defenders. Boston made five straight free throws to go back in front by three. Lou Williams scored four in a row to put the Clippers ahead by one, but they crumbled in the closing seconds. Leonard turned the ball over, Walker stole it and scored. “That was definitely a confidence-builder,” Walker said. “We started off slow, but we stuck together throughout the whole game. Energy was great, communication was great, our togetherness was on a whole other level.” Leonard missed two consecutive baskets and the Clippers were forced to foul. “Sometimes other teams just play better than you and in that stretch I thought that’s what they did,” Lou Williams said. TIP-INS Celtics: They improved to 7-6 on the road. ... Stevens got a technical 26 seconds into the game. ... Walker and Payton Pritchard returned from the inactive list. Clippers: They got 49 points from the bench, including three players in double figures. ... They still have yet to lose two in a row this season.","401267510"
"Damian Lillard gets the fortuitous roll as his shot circles around the rim before dropping in. (0:19) NEW YORK -- — Julius Randle believes times could be changing at Madison Square Garden. “We feel like we have a good shot to win every night,” Randle said after the New York Knicks beat the Portland Trail Blazers 110-99 on Saturday. Randle and Elfrid Payton scored 22 points apiece as the Knicks won their second straight and improved to 11-13. RJ Barrett scored 18 points, Alec Burks added 16 and fellow reserve Immanuel Quickley had 12. “We feel like we can get even better,” Randle added. “We have a lot of guys who can bring (a lot of) different things to the table.” The Trail Blazers went home disappointed with the result but not despondent. Damian Lillard said the lesson of the short-handed Blazers' six-game road trip was they can still be productive even when facing adversity if they stay together. “Obviously, we came in wanting to go 4-2, but I think given the circumstances, if we come on this this trip and we leave splitting it 3-3, we'll take it,” Lillard said. “So I think that’s the lesson and (a) little disappointing to not be able to get this one tonight. We really wanted to get it and that would have been a great trip for us but we didn’t.” The All-Star guard scored 29 points in his return to the lineup but Portland had its two-game winning streak end. Lillard, who missed Portland’s 121-105 victory at Philadelphia on Thursday with a strained abdomen, started and played 38 minutes. Gary Trent Jr. added 19 for the Trail Blazers. Enes Kanter and Robert Covington had 13 apiece, and Anfrenee Simons finished with 12. New York led 57-51 at the half and 84-76 after the third quarter, having outscored Portland 58-45 in the middle two quarters. “We're doing the things that are necessary right now,” Barrett said. Portland cut it to 90-85 after Simons' three-point play, but New York outscored Portland 16-7 in a span of 4:35 to extend its lead to 106-92. The spurt was highlighted by a breakaway dunk from Payton, and Burks draining a pullup 25-footer. TIP-INS: Trail Blazers: Carmelo Anthony was held to two points and is 12 away from passing Oscar Robertson for 12th place on the NBA's career scoring list. Coach Terry Stotts said Anthony enjoys his returns to Madison Square Garden. “He relished his time with the Knicks. ...It definitely has a special place for him,” Stotts said of the forward, who provides Portland with 12.6 points in 25.8 minutes per game as a reserve. “It is a luxury to have that scoring ability. ...You want that scoring off the bench.” Knicks: Though the Knicks are currently in playoff position in a supposed rebuilding season, coach Tom Thibodeau was uninterested in taking a victory lap. “Going into the season the focus was on daily improvement.,” he said before the game. “So that hasn’t changed. And obviously there are some things that we’re doing well and some things that we’re not doing as well as we would like. But we want to keep focused on each game, what’s exactly in front of us, build the right habits.”","401267511"
"Nikola Jokic puts up 50 points, 12 assists, and hauls in 8 rebounds in a 119-114 loss against the Kings. (1:55) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Harrison Barnes had 28 points and seven rebounds to help offset a career-high 50 points by Denver’s Nikola Jokic, and the Sacramento Kings beat the Nuggets 119-114 on Saturday to complete a season sweep. Barnes made five 3-pointers, shot 10 of 16 overall and scored 13 points in the third quarter. Barnes also made a pair of free throws with 0.5 seconds remaining. The Kings have won six of seven after opening the season 5-10. “It’s hard work and trust that has led us to a turnaround,” coach Luke Walton said. “The group’s continued to believe in each other, believe in what we’re building. There’s just a confidence with the group and we’re giving ourselves chances.” Sacramento had four players with 21 points or more and rode Hassan Whiteside’s first double-double of the season to the win. The Kings needed it on a day Jokic had another monster game. “I was just really locked in,” said Jokic, who had matched his previous career high of 47 against Utah on Jan. 31. “We had a couple young guys in the game. I tried to help them a little bit. I don’t know if I did a good job or not. In the last quarter I was kind of aggressive.” Jokic just missed adding to his franchise record of 46 triple-doubles. The big man had 12 assists and eight rebounds and scored 23 points in the fourth quarter. But it wasn’t enough for the Nuggets, who lost their third straight. “More impressive than the 50 points, the 12 assists and the eight rebounds was his approach, his mindset, his leadership,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “He knew we were undermanned. He understood how important this game was. Nikola goes out and does his job. He doesn’t care. We lost the game, that’s all he’s going to care about.” It was another tough blow for Denver. Two nights after being limited to 35 points in the second half when they wasted a double-digit lead and lost to the Lakers, the Nuggets stuck close in the first half before fading over the final 10 minutes. “We’re not out there just trying to let guys score. We just need a little more multiple effort,” said Monte Morris, who started in place of Jamal Murray. “First half the defense wasn’t too bad. Second half it kind of got away from us.” Jokic made a 3-pointer to cut Sacramento’s lead to 112-107 but De’Aaron Fox responded with a layup to help the Kings hold on. The Nuggets fell to 12-10. Three of the losses have come against the Kings. Sacramento first-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton scored a season-high 23 points. Whiteside added 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Richaun Holmes had 21 points for the Kings. Paul Millsap added 14 points for Denver. Barnes scored seven straight points midway through the second quarter, and Haliburton made a 3-pointer with 30 seconds remaining to put the Kings ahead 53-52 at halftime. “Just our pace, being able to get out and run,” Barnes said. “Obviously they are a great offensive team, extremely well coached. For us, making sure our offense is sett up well to defend (is key).” HIELD’S 3-POINT STREAK ENDS Buddy Hield’s streak of consecutive games with at least one 3-pointer ended at 87 after the Kings guard went 0 for 9 beyond the arc. Hield’s streak was the longest active in the NBA. Walton was still impressed with Hield’s performance, which included seven assists and zero turnovers. “For us to be a good team we have to find ways to help us win when our shots aren’t going,” Walton said. “His shot was off tonight, so what did he do? He was selfless and he found other ways to help the team win. That’s a great sign.” TIP-INS Nuggets: Jokic had six assists in the first quarter. As a team, Denver had 16 assists in the first half after having 19 total against the Lakers on Thursday. … Murray (left knee) did not play for the second time this season. Gary Harris (left adductor strain) and Facundo Campazzo (right knee soreness) were also held out. Harris hasn’t played since a Jan. 31 win against Utah.

"Cole Anthony attacks the rim for the one-handed dunk with authority. (0:18) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Billy Donovan challenged his squad to play with the focus, aggression and consistency missing a night earlier in a loss to the Orlando Magic. Zach LaVine delivered. LaVine bounced back from an uneven performance and scored 39 points on Saturday as the Chicago Bulls routed the injury-plagued Magic, 118-92. “He wanted us to go out there and try to blow these guys out. Message received,” LaVine said of Donovan’s morning challenge. “I think the way that we played definitely represented what he wanted us to do.” LaVine scored just two points in the first three quarters of Friday’s loss, but on Saturday had 22 points in the first half. LaVine made 16 of 25 shots and the Bulls outscored Orlando by 26 points in his 39 minutes on the floor. “He didn’t play that (on Friday) and that was part of the challenge,” Donovan said. “He didn’t attack the basket last night. He was coming off pick-and-rolls and taking one dribble and getting off it. Tonight, he played totally downhill and he was downhill at the basket.” Orlando’s Nikola Vucevic, who scored a career-best 43 points in Friday’s win, had 17 points and eight rebounds. He didn’t play in the fourth quarter because of the lopsided score. Chicago broke open a one-point game with a 25-8 burst over the final nine minutes of the first half to build a 61-43 edge at intermission. From there, the Bulls pushed their lead to as much as 33 by making eight of their first 11 shots of the second half. Denzel Valentine, who started in place of the injured Lauri Markkanen, scored 20 points and hit four 3-pointers. Rookie Patrick Williams chipped in 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Coby White added 13 points. “(Donovan) just said if we want to be quote-unquote a playoff team and take our team to the next level — which we have to ability to do — then we needed to come out and show it,” Valentine said. “Nobody is going to just give it to us because we’ve had the same team. He just challenged us to play like we should every single night.” Evan Fournier was scratched just minutes prior to tipoff because of back spasms, meaning Orlando was without four would-be starters because of a myriad of injuries. Aaron Gordon, Markelle Fultz and Jonathan Isaac were already out and the Magic had little working offensively on Saturday. They shot 38.9% from the floor and made only 6 of 27 3-point shots. “Intent, purpose of play and not being willing to pass the ball to the guy next to you,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. “It was just bad offense that hurt our defense.” LAURI LOST Already without key contributors Otto Porter and Wendell Carter Jr. because of injuries, the Bulls were without Markkanen because of a right shoulder sprain. Markkanen suffered the injury early in the third quarter Friday when he was fouled by Orlando forward Gary Clark and there was little improvement in his condition on Saturday, Donovan said. “He’s sore and we’re probably not going to know any more until he gets imaging when we get back,” Donovan said. “Then, we’ll have more information, but there’s no question he’s dealing with pain.” TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago had a 28-10 edge on points in the paint in the first half. The Bulls finished with 50 paint points. … Donovan said he continues to be impressed with the maturity and talent of Williams, who scored a career-best 20 points on Friday. “At 19 years old, he continues to grow and he played downhill, he was physical on drives and he got to the backboard and rebounded,” Donovan said. “Scoring, for a young player, will come and go, but the way he tried to play the game is what we need out of him.” Magic: Fournier missed nine games with back spasms between Jan. 2-18. … Vucevic was flattered that Shaquille O’Neal congratulated him on joining the Hall of Fame center and Dwight Howard as the only Magic players to compile at least 43 points and 19 rebounds in a game.","401267513"
"Ben Simmons receives a technical foul for trash talking after he forces a turnover and races down the court to flush a dunk on Tyler Johnson. (0:21) PHILADELPHIA -- — Ben Simmons showed exactly why trading him away wouldn’t have been easy — even for James Harden. Simmons played a complete game on both ends of the court, finishing with 16 points, 12 rebounds, eight assists and three steals to help the Philadelphia 76ers to a 124-108 victory over the short-handed Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night. Joel Embiid scored 33 points and Tobias Harris added 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Eastern Conference-leading 76ers, who have won five of six. Harden had 26 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds for Brooklyn, which was without stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Irving is day to day with a right finger sprain, and Durant is out for a week due to the NBA’s health and safety protocols. Simmons, reportedly an important piece of a potential Philadelphia-Houston trade that never materialized when Harden landed in Brooklyn last month in a blockbuster deal, played aggressively throughout. “I look forward to playing everybody, especially Brooklyn because they have such offensively gifted players,” Simmons said. “I want to play the best players in the league every night, so I look forward to the challenge.” Simmons’ potential departure for Harden was hotly debated by 76ers fans. Some who focus on the guard’s shooting shortcomings lobbied for the move while others pointed to his overall skillset, on full display Saturday, as a reason to hang onto the 24-year-old two-time All-Star. “I think you have to coach him and be around him to see his value,” Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said. “He’s invaluable to a basketball team. Not only his defense and passing, but so many little things.” Simmons’ highlight was a steal and fast-break dunk over Tyler Johnson with 59 seconds left in the third quarter. Embiid continued his stellar play, surpassing 30 points for the eighth time in nine games. “He’s just been dominant,” Simmons said. “I haven’t seen anyone who can stop him.” The big man was questionable after landing awkwardly on his right knee in Thursday’s 121-105 loss to Portland but showed no ill effects. Afterward, he said he’s fine physically. The 76ers took control with a 14-0 run over 3:05 late in the third. Harden tied it at 79 with 5:15 left on a free throw after Danny Green was whistled for a technical foul, one of four in the game. Then, the Sixers took over. Harris started the spurt with a jumper before Green scored eight straight points, including a pair of 3-pointers from virtually the same spot in the left corner. Embiid’s two free throws with 2:10 left in the period finished the run, giving Philadelphia its largest lead to that point at 93-79. The Nets were 0 for 4 from the field with three turnovers during that stretch. “I thought the third-quarter run, both defensively and offensively, changed the game for sure,” Rivers said. Philadelphia ended the third ahead 102-86, and the Nets never threatened in the fourth. “I do think fatigue played a part,” coach Steve Nash said after Brooklyn played the second game of a back-to-back. “We asked a lot of our guys, a lot of James. These guys have played a lot of minutes. Without two starters, I think there was fatigue. I thought the guys competed and gave ourselves a chance.” Durant is expected to rejoin the team Friday, Nash said. In a strange scene Friday against Toronto, the Nets star wasn’t available to start, entered as a reserve for the first time in his 867-game career and then was pulled in the third quarter. Durant had three negative COVID-19 tests within a 24-hour period, but someone whom he interacted with on Friday afternoon had an inconclusive test, thus the reasoning for keeping Durant out at the start of the game. When that test eventually came back positive, the NBA took Durant off the court. That didn’t sit well with Durant, who Tweeted his displeasure, or his Nets teammates, who expressed confusion and frustration afterward over the way the situation was handled. COVID CHATTER Prior to the game, Nash discussed COVID-19 and NBA protocols in light of Durant’s situation. While acknowledging that this season has been a challenge, he is grateful to still be playing. “Is it perfect? No, but nothing is this year,” Nash said. “We have to do our best to navigate the pandemic. It’s tricky. That is what we all signed up for, to complete and execute this season. Get through it, and get through it as safely as we can.” SHOOTING SIDEWAYS Rivers said Saturday’s morning shootaround was longer than normal and had more of a “mini-practice” feel. With limited practices, the coach is running one shootaround per week more like a practice. Even the coach participated. Rivers had a successful 14-year career as an NBA point guard, but shot 32.8% from 3-point range. How’d he do? “Not very well,” Rivers said. “I haven’t changed at all.” TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn won the first meeting, 122-109 on Jan. 7. … DeAndre Jordan and Harden were whistled for consecutive technical fouls seconds apart in the first quarter. They were upset that basket interference wasn’t called on Green’s follow layup. … Landry Shamet added 22 points for the Nets. 76ers: Simmons received a technical late in the third for taunting. … Philadelphia wore its City Edition jerseys. … Seth Curry had 11 points and four assists. He was listed as questionable due to illness after being pulled from Thursday’s loss to Portland due to lack of energy.","401267514"
"Eric Bledsoe lofts one up and Zion Williamson does the rest on the alley-oop. (0:21) NEW ORLEANS -- — Brandon Ingram had 27 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high four blocks, Zion Williamson capped a 29-point night with a game-sealing dunk in the final minute, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Memphis Grizzlies 118-109 on Saturday for their third straight victory. Eric Bledsoe scored 11 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, when New Orleans fell behind by seven before storming ahead by outscoring the Grizzlies 23-7 over the final seven minutes. Lonzo Ball added 16 points for New Orleans, which broke open a close game despite playing one night after pulling out a tight road game in Indiana. “Everybody just got super aggressive. The momentum shifted a little bit,” Ingram said of the final stretch. ""We stayed in and we knocked down shots and we got stops on the defensive end. So it all came down to the fourth quarter where we had to bring a little extra energy off of a back-to-back. We just couldn’t make (being) tired an excuse, and just kept going.” Jonas Valanciunas returned from a five-game absence because of COVID-19 protocols and scored 23 points in 24 minutes for the Grizzlies. “He really attacked it well tonight and defensively did some good things,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""Obviously, his minutes will continue to go up and up as he gets back and reconditions. He was really good for us tonight.” Kyle Anderson scored 21 for Memphis, and Ja Morant had 16 points and nine assists. But it wasn’t enough to prevent the Grizzlies from losing their third straight. “We kind of lost our pace there in the fourth quarter. They forced us into some tough possessions and some tough shots,” Jenkins said. ""We still had some good looks but didn’t make it, and credit to them. ... They made some big-time shots. That was kind of the difference there late in the fourth quarter.” After the teams were separated by a single point at halftime and the end of the third quarter, Memphis appeared to be taking control when Tyus Jones scored six of his eight points during an 11-2 run that put the Grizzlies up 102-95. Bledsoe then hit two 3s and a driving 10-foot floater during a 10-2 surge that vaulted New Orleans back in front to stay. Bledsoe and Ingram each added 3s inside the last three minutes to help secure the win. “I just try to play off my teammates as best I can,” Bledsoe said. ""When I do get the open looks, shoot and just try to be aggressive when I have the ball.” Memphis hit 10 3s in the opening half, including two by Valanciunas, who scored 15 points in his first 11 minutes off the bench. The Grizzlies led by 12 when Anderson's driving reverse layup made it 49-37. New Orleans still trailed by 10 with just more than three minutes left in the half, but Ingram hit a 3 and Ball threw down a two-handed, alley-oop dunk on a fast-break feed from Bledsoe, sparking an 11-0 run. Ingram, who had 17 first-half points, added a pair of mid-range jumpers during the run and Bledsoe's transition layup briefly gave New Orleans the lead before Anderson's free throws put Memphis up 61-60 at halftime. TIP-INS Grizzlies: F Brandon Clarke was scratched because of soreness in his right calf. ... Grayson Allen returned from a four-game absence related to COVID-19 protocols and scored eight points. ... The Grizzlies finished 13 of 39 from 3-point range and shot 44.4% (40 of 90) overall. Pelicans: New Orleans made 15 3s, five by Ingram and four each by Bledsoe and Ball. ... Shot 51.7% (45 of 87). ... Steven Adams was 0 of 4 on free throws and the Pelicans were 13 of 21 as a team. FIGURING IT OUT Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy made a point of crediting Ingram and Williamson for their play on defense and the trust they showed in their teammates on both ends of the court. Williamson got his points on just 14 shots, including three thunderous alley-oop dunks, and also had five assists, four defensive rebounds and two blocks. Ingram shot 55% (11 of 20) and assisted on three baskets. “We tried to get the ball in the hands of our best players,"" Van Gundy said. ""Zion and Brandon had the ball all the time and they did a good job. They made plays, and that’s what you rely on them to do. ... Right now, they’re really trusting their teammates and their teammates are delivering.”","401267515"
"Trae Young shakes off Norman Powell with two crossovers before draining the 3-pointer. (0:21) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young had 28 points and 13 assists, Clint Capela finished with 23 points and 16 rebounds, and the Atlanta Hawks held off the Toronto Raptors 132-121 to snap a three-game losing streak Saturday night. Chris Boucher scored 29 points off the bench to lead the Raptors, who were going for a season-high four-game winning streak. Fred VanVleet added 22 points and Kyle Lowry had 20 for Toronto. Snapping a 10-game losing streak in the series, Atlanta closed out the game late in the fourth quarter as Young fed Capela for an alley-oop dunk and Kevin Huerter hit a 3-pointer to push the lead to 10 with 53.4 seconds remaining. “We were able to get going on the fast break,"" Capela said. “Our play was pretty efficient tonight. I also feel like we shot the ball pretty well, so that helps."" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce called the performance Atlanta's best of the season. “I think it was such a great game for us because the spirit was great,"" Pierce said. “Thirty-one assists is how you get great spirit. Ball movement, empowerment, guys feeling like they're part of every play. We made simple plays throughout the night."" Capela scored his 15th point on a left-handed jumper that gave the Hawks their first double-digit lead at the 10:23 mark of the third quarter. Three straight Atlanta turnovers contributed to the Raptors closing within two, and the Hawks called a timeout less than two minutes later. John Collins responded with a baseline jumper, Young with a runner and Danilo Gallinari with a 3 to make it 80-71. Huerter followed with a pair of free throws to put Atlanta up 84-73. The biggest lead Toronto had in the second was eight on Terence Davis’ 3 at the 10:22 mark. The Hawks soon went up 47-46 on Huerter’s 3 and led by five on three possessions before entering halftime with a three-point lead. “I think we probably had enough points to win tonight, scoring-wise,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said after his team dropped to 0-3 on the second night of a back-to-back. “I would like to think if we score 121, we can win a game, but we just didn’t have the juice to guard them tonight. They shot their way to a W."" Young returned to full capacity after missing Thursday’s loss to Utah with a bruised right calf. Capela, the NBA’s leading rebounder, has pulled down at least 10 boards in 18 straight games, the longest active streak in the NBA. Toronto had dominated the Hawks even in Atlanta, winning the last six meetings. TIP-INS Raptors: F OG Anunoby missed his sixth straight game with a left calf strain, but Nurse said Anunoby is getting close to returning. “I think it is a little touchy with it, but they’re shooting for maybe the last part of this road trip,” Nurse said. “So I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel here, and we’re hopeful to get him out on this trip.” Toronto has three games left on the six-game trip.

"D.J. Augustin flings a half-court pass just in time for Jrue Holiday to grip it and score while running out of bounds. (0:19) CLEVELAND -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24 points and 11 rebounds, Jrue Holiday scored 20 and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Cleveland Cavaliers for the second time in two days, 124-99 on Saturday night. Khris Middleton added 20 points and Bryn Forbes had 18 on 6-of-6 shooting from 3-point territory for the Bucks, who broke open the game with a 42-18 run spanning the third and fourth quarters and won their fourth in a row. “We pushed it to the limit and had a lot of baskets in transition, which makes it hard for teams that are trying to come back,” Holiday said. “It’s all good. We’re building that confidence and trust with each other. It’s about hard work, playing hard and playing smart.” Milwaukee began its six-game road trip Friday, when Antetokounmpo had 33 points and 12 boards in a 123-105 victory at Cleveland. The Bucks didn’t arrive in Northeast Ohio until the afternoon due to mechanical issues on their team plane. “You just have to adapt, especially with the season and the year that we’re having,” Holiday said. “I think we’re doing a good job with it.” Andre Drummond paced the Cavaliers with 28 points and 11 rebounds, and Collin Sexton scored 17. Cleveland completed a stretch of four home games in six days, winning once, and has lost seven of its last nine overall. “Cleveland has beaten some good teams and Sexton is playing really well, so I’m pleased that we could come in here and win two games,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “As we continue on the road, this is something to build on.” Milwaukee went ahead for good late in the first and took its largest lead at 122-92 on a floater by Jaylen Adams with 3:16 left in the fourth. Holiday finished with eight assists and Antetokounmpo had five. Darius Garland had 17 points and nine assists for Cleveland. Drummond made 12 of 17 shots and was 4 of 5 from the foul line, while Taurean Prince had 12 points off the bench. “Defensively, we’ve started taking breaks, so we’ve got to get back to basics,” Drummond said. “But we’re not going to hang our heads after this loss because we’re still in the fight and trying for a playoff position.” Milwaukee held a 59-54 advantage at halftime thanks to 14 points and six assists from Holiday. Drummond and Sexton each scored 13 points for Cleveland as the teams combined to shoot 54.3%. OFF THE MARK Drummond owns a career-low .477 field goal percentage and had gone five games without making more than half his shots. Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff accepted some blame for Drummond’s inefficiency. “We have to diversify his package and make him more difficult for defenses to find,” Bickerstaff said.

(0:20) HOUSTON -- — DeMar DeRozan scored 30 points and the San Antonio Spurs held off a late charge from the Houston Rockets for a 111-106 victory Saturday night. The Spurs led by 10 in the fourth quarter, but it was tied late in the game before DeRozan scored the next five points to give the Spurs a 107-102 lead with a minute to go. John Wall made a layup for Houston with less than 30 seconds left, but Patty Mills hit two free throws for San Antonio to extend it to 109-104. P.J. Tucker made two free throws for Houston after that, but Rudy Gay made two for San Antonio to secure the victory. It was the third 30-point game this season for DeRozan. “He’s having a wonderful year,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “He’s been a great leader. He’s really been detailed in his approach to games, and he’s been our go-to guy game after game after game.” Teammate Derrick White raved about DeRozan's work, too. “That’s what he (does),"" he said. “He’s been huge for us not just scoring but facilitating, rebounding, doing whatever it takes for us to win."" DeRozan was asked about the key to his efficiency this season. “I’m just taking what they're give me, picking and choosing my spots ... and trying to get my teammates involved to alleviate the pressure on me,"" he said. Wall had 27 points and Eric Gordon scored 26 off the bench as the Rockets lost for the second time in three games following a six-game winning streak.

Jakob Poeltl made two free throws to give the Spurs their first points in almost three minutes and DeRozan, who had eight rebounds and seven assists, added two more free throws a few seconds later to put them back on top. Houston coach Stephen Silas was disappointed that his team let DeRozan get to the free throw line so much late in the game. “I told them we know DeMar DeRozan is going to do whatever it takes to get to the free throw line and we had to be disciplined in those situations,"" he said. “And he did what we expected him to do. He got to the free throw line."" Gay opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer that extended San Antonio’s lead to 10 points.

(0:16) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Darius Bazley made the tiebreaking layup with 1:16 to play after Oklahoma City had blown a 23-point lead, and the Thunder beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 120-118 on Saturday night. The Thunder scored a team-record 83 points in the first half, but then had only 13 in the third quarter. Minnesota came all the way back to take the lead in the final period before Oklahoma City recovered. “It got dicey tonight, and I thought we pulled together,” said Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, whose team lost to the Timberwolves 106-103 on Friday. “In the close games, when the competition is hot, we have a group that binds together and I think that’s a really good quality for a team.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points to go with nine rebounds and seven assists for the Thunder. Mike Muscala, who exited the game after taking an elbow to the face in the fourth, added 22. Naz Reid scored a career-high 29 points for the Timberwolves, but missed a layup that would have tied the game with 2 seconds to play. “I liked the layup. Naz is going to be good for a long time. I know that he’s hurting right now, missing that one, but he had an unbelievable (second) half,” said Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders. “We were content with the 2 or 3 at that point. … But going into Naz, we thought that was a safety because he was so effective down there.” The Thunder looked poised to run away with the contest, opening the game on a 10-0 spurt before Minnesota guard Ricky Rubio hit a 14-footer two minutes into the first quarter. Oklahoma City then raced to a 43-24 lead by the end of the period before notching another 40 in the second. “I thought we attacked really well, we hit the paint, we spread it around,” Daigneault said. “We obviously made shots, but the point total was not sustainable.” The Thunder were outscored 32-13 in the third. The Timberwolves kept chipping away and went ahead 98-96 on Jaden McDaniels’ pull-up jumper with 9:44 remaining. A back-and-forth contest ensued, which included eight lead changes in the fourth. “The reality is that it’s a 48-minute game, and we’ve got to compete every minute,” said Theo Maledon, who returned to Oklahoma City’s lineup after missing Friday’s contest. “I think it was a good lesson for us to carry on in the future.” TIP-INS Thunder: The 43 first-quarter points were the most the Thunder have scored in any period this season. … The Thunder were without Al Horford (rest) and Isaiah Roby (foot). … Luguentz Dort had 10 points, six rebounds and two steals after missing Friday’s game. … Kenrich Williams matched Gilgeous-Alexander’s game-high nine rebounds.

"Mike Breen and Mark Jackson poke fun at Jeff Van Gundy's attempt at the Running Man, and even Steph Curry reacts to the dancing. (0:25) DALLAS -- — Luka Doncic couldn't top Stephen Curry's shoulder shimmy, or the second-best scoring night of the Golden State star's career. The Dallas sensation led his Mavericks to victory, though, and helped them stop a six-game home losing streak. Doncic tied his career high with 42 points in a scoring duel with Curry, leading the Mavericks to an entertaining 134-132 win over the Warriors on Saturday. The prime-time matchup on national TV lived up to the billing, with Curry hitting a season-high 11 3-pointers on the way to 57 points. The two-time MVP put on another show about a month after scoring 62 in a win over Portland. Doncic was 12 of 23 from field, 7 for 12 from 3-point range and 11 of 14 on free throws with 11 assists and seven rebounds as the Mavericks ended the second-longest home losing streak in Rick Carlisle's 13 seasons as coach. “What a display of basketball out there,” Carlisle said. “Just amazing playmaking and shot-making the entire night. Curry and Doncic were spectacular. Both teams played with a lot of heart and a lot of joy. Great thing to see.” The Mavericks took an 18-2 lead two nights after a 31-point loss to the Warriors on the same court, but the 16-point cushion was gone by the third quarter — not long after Curry's shoulder shimmy when he drained a 36-footer from the Mavericks midcourt logo. “That always is a good feeling when you feel like you’re in a rhythm, you just need a clean look and things are going to fall,” Curry said. “It was that type of night. Obviously wanted to get the win. Kind of mixed feelings right now.” Curry was 11 of 19 from 3 — finishing two made 3s shy of his career high — and made all eight of his free throws. He was 19 for 31 overall with five assists. “He’s never played better,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “I’ve never seen him like this. He’s always obviously been an incredible shooter. He looks stronger. It’s almost unfathomable, what he’s doing out there.” Draymond Green matched his season high of 15 assists from the first of the two straight games in Dallas with the Warriors missing all their traditional centers because of injuries. Curry got Golden State within a point with a three-point play with 28 seconds remaining, but Doncic assisted on a 3-pointer by Maxi Kleber for a 134-130 lead with 5.6 seconds left. With Curry sitting early in the fourth quarter, the Mavericks got their lead back to double digits. The Warriors were within four when Curry missed a 3 with a little more than a minute remaining, then Doncic connected from long range to hit 42 points for the third time in his career and put Dallas up 131-124. “Going against Steph, it's fun,” said Doncic, who slammed the scorer's table in frustration after a crushing last-second loss to Phoenix during the home skid. “I've got to have more fun playing the game, to be who I was before. I've just got to get back to enjoying the game.” Kristaps Porzingis had 18 points and 10 rebounds, and Josh Richardson scored 17 for Dallas. Andrew Wiggins scored 22 points and Kent Bazemore had 20 for the Warriors. The duel between Curry and Doncic got going when they traded 3-pointers late in the first half. They did it again early in the second half, when Doncic hit another one after a Golden State turnover. It wasn't all 3s for Curry. He pump-faked behind the arc in the third quarter, sending Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith flying by before dribbling past them and hitting a 17-footer. Curry hit another 3 the next time down, and one from long range by Wiggins gave the Warriors their first lead at 96-95 with four minutes left in the third. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said rookie center James Wiseman won't play in the next two games at San Antonio because of his sprained left wrist. ... It was Curry's eighth 50-point game, and second against Dallas. ... After scoring a career-high 40 during Golden State’s 147-116 win in the first meeting two nights earlier, Kelly Oubre Jr. had 14 points on 5-of-16 shooting. Mavericks: F James Johnson wasn't listed on the injury report, but didn't play and had left knee soreness listed on the box score. ... Kleber scored 16 points and was 4 of 9 from long range. VISIT FROM THE OWNER Carlisle said he invited Mark Cuban to talk to the team before the game after the owner reached out to his coach with a show of support after the Warriors blew out the Mavericks. In the previous home game, Phoenix's Devin Booker beat them with a last-second 3. “He just wanted everybody to know that he was fully supportive of everything and everybody,” Carlisle said. “It was heartwarming. I think it got our guys a little more juiced up to play.”","401267520"
"In the second overtime, LeBron James heats up from downtown as he drains two 3-pointers on Mason Plumlee. (0:40) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James scored eight of his 33 points in the second overtime, Anthony Davis added 30 points and the Los Angeles Lakers narrowly avenged a loss in Detroit last month with a 135-129 victory over the undermanned Pistons on Saturday night. Dennis Schröder had 22 points and eight assists in the defending NBA champions’ fourth consecutive victory since that 107-92 loss to the Pistons nine days ago. The Lakers committed a season-high 23 turnovers, blew a 17-point lead and wasted several chances to win in regulation. Only James' brilliance in the second overtime prevented Los Angeles from being swept by the 5-18 Pistons, who were playing without Derrick Rose and Blake Griffin on the second night of a back-to-back set to close out an eight-day West Coast trip. “Give them credit,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “They kept playing hard, and they got hot from behind the arc. We didn’t do things well enough, and they were able to get back in the game.” Moments after James hit the go-ahead layup in double OT, he made a tough step-back 3-pointer with 1:17 left and added another step-back 27-footer with 34 seconds to play. “I was just ready to go,” James said. “I’m 36 years old, and ... my heart is not sustainable for two overtimes at this point in my career. I’ve got a bottle of wine at home ready to be opened, and I delayed it for two overtime periods.” Jerami Grant scored 32 points and Josh Jackson added 25 of his 28 after halftime for the Pistons, who had another improbably strong showing against the NBA's elite. Delon Wright scored 22 points in Detroit's fourth consecutive loss since beating LA. “We can definitely build off it,” Wright said. “If we take the champions to double overtime, that means we can compete with anybody in this league on any given night.” Jackson led the Pistons' rally while the Lakers went scoreless in the final 4:06 of regulation. He tied it on a driving layup with 3.1 seconds left, and James missed a driving layup at the buzzer. The Lakers missed nine consecutive shots during a nearly six-minute scoreless slump stretching into the first overtime. But Alex Caruso scored five quick points to get Los Angeles back in it, and Davis made a tying dunk with 18.1 seconds left before Grant missed a floater at the buzzer. Rose was inactive for what coach Dwane Casey called personal reasons amid widespread trade rumors linking the former MVP with the Knicks and Clippers. Griffin also sat out to rest on the second night of a back-to-back, but the remaining Pistons still hit 16 3-pointers and shredded the NBA’s best defensive team in their highest-scoring performance of the season. “I was proud of the way the guys played,” Casey said. “There’s so many learning situations for young players and our guys to play against a great team like the Lakers. We have no margin for error, but the effort, the togetherness, the mental toughness is what we’re trying to build.” TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit has beaten the 76ers, Celtics, Heat, Suns and Lakers. ...

"Donovan Mitchell can't fake Domantis Sabonis with a pump fake, but still knocks down the 3-pointer. (0:24) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Minus star point guard Mike Conley, the Utah Jazz got to see Donovan Mitchell do a bit of everything. Mitchell came within one rebound of a triple-double with 27 points, 11 assists, and nine boards as the Jazz won for the 15th time in 16 games, beating the Indiana Pacers 103-95 Sunday. The Jazz improved their NBA-best record to 19-5 despite missing Mike Conley, who was scratched with a hamstring injury. Mitchell ensured a fast start with 11 first-quarter points. “From the beginning, I just wanted to establish the mentality that we were going to push through,” Mitchell said. “There were times we were tired, but we had to do it collectively.” When he wasn't driving past defenders, he was pulling up for uncontested jumpers. When covered, he didn't hesitate to distribute the ball to teammates. “Those shots are more open when you attack the rim,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said Former Pacer Bojan Bogdanovic was rewarded for driving to the rim as he broke an 83-all tie with a three-point play midway through the fourth quarter. On subsequent possessions, Mitchell fed Bogdanovic and Joe Ingles for 3-pointers. The Jazz made up for misses by hitting the boards with a 69-54 advantage that included 17 offensive rebounds. In the final two minutes, Mitchell banked home a runner and sank a pair of foul shots for a 100-91 lead. During a late timeout, teammates advised him he needed one rebound for a triple-double. “I'm not the type of person to go and chase it,” Mitchell said. “I'm just trying to find ways to impact the game.” Bogdanovic finished with 18 points. Jordan Clarkson added 17 off the bench. Rudy Gobert had 16 points and 16 rebounds. “They have such a great team, they make you pay for any little mistake,” said Pacers reserve Doug McDermott, who scored 18 points. Domantas Sabonis scored 20 for the Pacers, who have lost five of six. Malcolm Brogdon had 15 points and seven assists. “We played pretty good defense,” McDermott said, “but we just weren't able to score baskets when we needed to.” TIP-INS Jazz: Only team to rank in the top five in offensive (115.7) and defensive (107.4) rating. ... Conley's plus-minus of +265 is 48 points better than Los Angeles' Kawhi Leonard for the league lead. Pacers: Set a franchise record with 20 3-pointers in Friday home loss to New Orleans. ... T.J.

"Reggie Bullock scores six buckets from beyond the arc before the end of the first half. (1:11) NEW YORK -- — Bam Adebayo had 24 points and 11 rebounds, Jimmy Butler had a big second half and just missed a triple-double and the Miami Heat beat the New York Knicks 109-103 on Sunday in the opener of a home-and-home series. Butler finished with 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. He shot just 3 for 11 from the field but scored 12 points after halftime. Kendrick Nunn and Tyler Herro each added 16 points for the Heat, who won their second straight after dropping seven of eight. “We just stayed with it,” Butler said. “All in all, we guarded, rebounded and played together. I think that’s what this thing is all about.” Julius Randle had 26 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists, but the Knicks had their two-game win streak snapped. Reggie Bullock made seven 3-pointers and scored 21 points. “You’ve got to give them credit and it’s not just Jimmy,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “They have Bam as well and they have great shooting around them, but you’ve got to make plays down the stretch and you’ve got to understand the fourth quarter’s different.” The teams meet again Tuesday in Miami. Also Sunday, the Knicks agreed to a trade with Detroit that brings Derrick Rose back to New York and reunites him with Thibodeau, a person with knowledge of the details said. The Knicks are sending Dennis Smith Jr. and a second-round pick to Detroit, the person told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal was not yet official. Butler, as he often did during Miami's run to the NBA Finals, made many of the big plays down the stretch. He snapped a 94-all tie with a jumper with 4:17 to play and followed with a pair of free throws. After a Knicks basket, he drove into the lane and passed to Kelly Olynyk, who scored while being fouled, completing the three-point play to make it 101-96. “He can read the game and what’s necessary for that possession and it doesn’t have to just be about him scoring,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “He made some big defensive plays and when you have a guy that you can just give the ball to on the other end and know that you’re going to get a coherent possession offensively it just takes a lot of pressure off your basketball team mentally.” The Knicks jumped to a 15-5 lead but the defenses soon settled in and Miami led 25-23 after one. New York then went 7 for 11 from behind the arc in the second and shot 68.4% overall, but Miami hit 65% of its shots and held a 60-59 edge at the break. The Heat then limited the Knicks to 18 points in the third to take an 82-77 lead to the final period. TIP-INS Heat: Miami used its 16th different starting lineup in its 23 games, with Nunn making his third start. But with Goran Dragic sitting out with a sprained left ankle as Miami's latest injury, Spoelstra said: “Nobody’s going to feel sorry for us and we don’t want any pity."" Knicks: Randle was 5 for 5 in the second quarter, with three 3-pointers, for 13 points. ... C Nerlens Noel missed his second straight game with a sore left knee. BUTLER'S DONE IT Butler began his career playing for Thibodeau in Chicago, where he averaged 2.6 points as a rookie in the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season. Thibodeau said he and Bulls leadership viewed Butler as someone who would be a solid rotation player, not one who would become a regular All-Star who averaged more than 20 points by the time he left Chicago. “To say that we saw him as a superstar, we didn’t see that,” Thibodeau said. “But that’s why you should never measure what’s inside a person’s heart, his head, his drive. He is such a great worker and so smart. He got better every year and to the point now where he’s one of the elite players in the league and the impact that he has on the game is unbelievable.” Who are the free agents for the next two years? We have the lists. Center Andre Drummond is now a free agent and can sign with a contending team after reaching a buyout with the Cavaliers.","401267524"
"Devin Booker goes baseline and kicks it out to Frank Kaminsky for a wide-open slam dunk. (0:17) PHOENIX -- — Suns coach Monty Williams isn't usually demonstrative on the sideline so when he angrily called a timeout in the middle of the fourth quarter and visibly chided forward Deandre Ayton, it was a bit of a surprise. Ayton didn't look thrilled by the outburst. But there was no doubt the message had been sent. “He didn’t like me getting on him,” Williams said. “But he took it the right way.” Ayton responded with a few buckets and a blocked shot down the stretch, Devin Booker added 18 points and 11 assists and Phoenix stayed on a roll by beating the Boston Celtics 100-91 on Sunday. Mikal Bridges led a balanced Suns offense with 19 points. Cam Johnson added 17 points off the bench while Ayton finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds. Phoenix improved to 13-9 this season and has won five of its past six games. “Guys are just playing hard, it’s a good recipe,” Johnson said. Williams made it clear after the game that Ayton has “unreal talent” and he wasn't calling him out. He's just trying to get the former No. 1 overall pick to play to his full potential the entire game. Ayton had a stretch early in the fourth when he had the ball knocked out of his hands a few times, couldn't finish shots at the rim and was out of position on defense. The wake-up call from Williams during the timeout ended those problems in a hurry. “It’s a great sign of growth and he doesn’t get enough credit for that,” Williams said. Phoenix built a 17-point lead midway through the third quarter, but Boston rallied to cut the deficit to 76-68 entering the fourth. Backup guard Payton Pritchard gave the Celtics a lift with two 3-pointers during the run. Boston stayed fairly close for most of the game despite a rough shooting performance. Kemba Walker shot just 4 of 20 from the field but hit a 3-pointer with about 2:30 left that pulled the Celtics to within 91-86. Pritchard added a long 3-pointer with about a minute left that brought Boston to within 94-91, but Booker quickly responded with a contested 15-foot jumper and the Suns were able to hang on for the win. “Tonight wasn't our night shooting the ball,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “I told the team just now that I am more encouraged than discouraged because you are going to have days like this. That could have been easily worse the way we shot the ball.” Jayson Tatum led Boston with 23 points and seven assists. Walker added 14 while Pritchard and Daniel Theis had 12. “We've got to make it easier for guys and Kemba to get some easy ones instead of relying on jump shots,” Theis said. The Suns jumped out to a 27-19 lead in the first quarter after the Celtics shot just 7 of 26 (27%) from the field. Boston tied the game late in the second, but Booker hit a 3-pointer with 0.8 seconds left to give Phoenix a 52-49 halftime advantage. Booker led the Suns with 13 points before the break while Bridges had 12. Tatum led the Celtics with 12. HELLO FANS For the first time this season, the Suns hosted a small crowd at newly renovated Phoenix Suns Arena. Free tickets were given to health care workers, who were grouped in pods of two to four seats throughout the arena. The crowd was limited to 1,500 fans, and masks were required. Johnson came to half-court before the game and thanked the health care workers for their work during the COVID-19 pandemic. “It was awesome,” Williams said. “To come out there and see people in the stands and not cardboard imitations of people, it’s new for us.” TIP-INS Celtics: Boston was playing without forward Jaylen Brown (knee soreness) and guard Marcus Smart (calf). ... Tatum and Walker both got technical fouls in the third quarter for arguing with referees.

(0:24) LOS ANGELES -- — De’Aaron Fox scored 36 points, Buddy Hield added 22 and the Sacramento Kings beat the Los Angeles Clippers 113-110 on Sunday for their fourth straight victory. The Kings are 7-1 since suffering a 19-point drubbing by the Clippers on Jan. 20. “It was a real scrappy win on this back-to-back with an early start,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. Sacramento has won seven of eight for the first time since 2006, the last time the team made the playoffs. “We're playing defense. That’s the biggest thing about what we’re doing right now. We knew we’re able to score with anybody. When we’ve needed stops we’ve been able to get them,” Fox said. “If we can stay locked in defensively and we can keep our turnovers down, we can give ourselves a chance to win.” Lou Williams scored 23 points off the bench for the Clippers, who dropped two in a row for the first time this season. Kawhi Leonard had 20 points and 10 rebounds as they played without injured Paul George. The Clippers' reserves outscored the starters, 57-53, and the LA bench outscored the Kings' reserves, 57-30. “Kawhi was a little worn out,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “Guys' legs were a little tired, they couldn’t make shots. Our starters didn't have much."" Neither team led by more than nine points in the back-and-forth affair that featured 11 ties. Nicolas Batum’s potential tying 3-pointer missed in the closing seconds for the Clippers. Williams' pair of free throws tied the game for the last time at 103-all. From there, the Kings stayed in front. Leonard cut Sacramento's lead to 107-106, but Harrison Barnes scored off his own offensive rebound. Rookie Tyrese Haliburton hit back-to-back 3-pointers that put the Kings ahead by five early in the fourth. Williams scored five points in a 7-0 run that put the Clippers ahead 97-95. Fox answered with consecutive 3-pointers to take back a 103-101 lead for the Kings. “His speed and quickness really hurt us,” Lue said of Fox. “He was able to attack us all night and get into the paint and cause havoc."" Los Angeles rallied from a seven-point deficit in the third to lead 80-79, helped by nine straight points from four different players. Fox scored Sacramento's final six points of the quarter.

"LaMelo Ball stuffs the stat sheet with 24 points, including seven triples and 10 assists in Charlotte's win. (2:01) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Everywhere LaMelo Ball has played basketball, people have tried to change his 3-point shot. But the 19-year-old has steadfastly refused. “I stick with it. I say, ‘This is how I shoot,'"" Ball said. “I'm confident in it and I feel good letting it go. I came here and they tried to adjust it a little, but I'm like, ‘Ah, this is how I shoot.’"" And right now, there's no reason to change. Ball made a career-high seven 3-pointers — most of them from several feet behind the arc — and finished with 24 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds Monday night as the Charlotte Hornets defeated the short-handed Houston Rockets 119-94. Ball is 21 of 40 from beyond the arc in his last six games. Miles Bridges had another strong outing with 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Gordon Hayward added 19 points for the Hornets, who opened the fourth quarter on a 19-1 run to blow open a tight game. Victor Oladipo had 21 points to lead the Rockets, who shot 2 of 19 from the field and scored just seven points in the fourth quarter. Ball's release point is at his chest, not above his shoulders like most shooters. Hornets coach James Borrego said he had some initial concerns about Ball's form prior to the NBA draft. But Borrego said that ended when he and general manager Mitch Kupchak watched Ball work out in person after a trip to Los Angeles. “When we went there, there was just a confidence about him and his shot,” Borrego said. “As I sat there with Mitch I looked over and said 'he's going to be fine.' The kid is confident and believes it is going in. And that is at least half the battle.” Borrego said he has been most impressed by Ball's range. “Whether he’s at the line or two feet behind the line, it’s almost effortless,” Borrego said. The momentum of the game changed when Malik Monk, who scored 14 points off the bench, knocked down a 3-pointer in the waning seconds of the third quarter to give the Hornets a 90-87 lead. Charlotte then held the Rockets without a field goal for more than 7 1/2 minutes to start the final quarter. It wasn't until 4:18 remained when Oladipo finally broke the drought with a 3 from the wing. SHORT-HANDED ROCKETS Houston played without three of its top four scorers — John Wall, Eric Gordon and Christian Wood. Gordon and Wall were given a night of rest, while Wood missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle. Together, the trio is accounting for more than 59 points per game. Rockets coach Stephen Silas said he expects Wall and Gordon to play Tuesday night, but said Oladipo will sit out. “It impacted us a lot,"" Silas said of playing without Wall and Gordon. “Those guys are good defenders. We’re one of the best defensive teams when they’re on the floor. They weren’t on the floor tonight and I didn’t like our defensive approach, so we’re going to need them tomorrow night.” TIP INS Rockets: Ben McLemore had 15 points off the bench on four 3-pointers. ...

"Bradley Beal tosses a lob to Alex Len for a powerful alley-oop slam. (0:16) CHICAGO -- — Bradley Beal scored 35 points and the Washington Wizards held on to beat the Chicago Bulls 105-101 on Monday night. Beal, the NBA’s leading scorer, hit three free throws in the final 9.8 seconds. Rui Hachimura added 19 points and a season-high 10 rebounds on his 23rd birthday. The Wizards improved to 6-15 even though they rested Russell Westbrook. And they won for the third time in six games, the victories by four points or less. For a team that was hit hard by COVID-19 issues, it's at least an encouraging sign even if the losses during this stretch were lopsided. “I'm not usually fired up about 3-3,” coach Scott Brooks said. “But we've gone through a lot. And our guys battled back.” Zach LaVine led Chicago with 35 points, though he missed a potential tying layup in the closing seconds. He also got an All-Star endorsement from Beal, who said LaVine should get picked for the first time “hands down.” “He's electric,” Beal said. “He has a great change of pace, can shoot the 3.” Thaddeus Young scored 14 points, but the Bulls lost for the sixth time in eight games. “Just a lot of self-inflicted wounds, I thought,” coach Billy Donovan said. TIGHT FINISH The Wizards led 93-84 about 4 1/2 minutes into the fourth quarter before Chicago scored seven straight points, capped by Denzel Valentine's 3-pointer. Beal then drove for a layup. Alex Len hit two free throws and scored on a putback dunk to bump Washington's lead to 99-91. But the Bulls answered with a six-point spurt, pulling within two on LaVine's two foul shots. Beal made two of his own and Len added one to make it a five-point game before LaVine sank two more foul shots to pull Chicago to 102-99 with a minute left. Beal lost his dribble, resulting in a turnover, and Coby White hit a floater for the Bulls coming out of a timeout to cut it to one with 29 seconds left. Beal got fouled on a drive and made the second free throw after missing the first to make it 103-101 with 9.8 seconds to play. Following a timeout, a driving LaVine missed a layup over Len, who joined the Wizards last month after being released by Toronto. Beal grabbed the rebound and hit free throws with 0.1 seconds left. “I thought I drove and created contact,” LaVine said. ""The refs saw it differently. Everybody says put the pressure on the rim at the end of the game, don't settle. I thought I did that. I thought I created contact. I guess I've got to make the layup.” TIP-INS Wizards: Westbrook was held out because the Wizards were playing for the second time in two days.

"Fred VanVleet intercepts Ja Morant's pass, then he sends a pass through defenders to Norman Powell, who lays it in. (0:20) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Intentional or not, Toronto coach Nick Nurse’s ejection in the third quarter kickstarted the Raptors to a winning rally. Fred VanVleet and Pascal Siakam each scored 32 points and the Raptors put together a second-half burst to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 128-113 on Monday night. Norman Powell added 29 for the Raptors, who began their rally after the ejection of Nurse, who picked up his second technical of the game in the third quarter. “Well, definitely sparked them,” Nurse said of his departure. “I don’t need any credit at all. I’m glad they started playing better and playing up to their capabilities and glad they found a way to win.” VanVleet also had nine assists for Toronto, which outscored Memphis 65-43 in the second half, including 34-16 in the fourth. The Raptors appeared reeling with 3 minutes left in the third quarter. Nurse had just been ejected and starting guard Kyle Lowry had left in the first half with back spasms. But Nurse’s departure was followed by a 27-5 run as Toronto turned up the defense and got strong backing from a cheering bench. That rally eventually stretched the Raptors’ lead to 113-100 with 7:48 left and Memphis never really threatened again. “They executed well on offense and defensively,” said Memphis guard Ja Morant, who had 18 points and nine assists. “Got stops. Got buckets and they were able to get out to a lead and hang on.” Jonas Valanciunas led Memphis with 27 points and a season-high 20 rebounds. Dillon Brooks had 22 points, but was 8 of 20 from the field, Morant was only 5 of 17 from the field as Memphis shot 43%. “I think teams have scouted us a little differently and we’ve regressed defensively,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said of the fourth-quarter slide. “It happens throughout the season. We’ve just got to get back to it, keep working, keep finding ways to get better defensively. And offensively, we’re seeing a whole lot different game plans, especially late in the games.” Memphis used a strong second quarter to take a 70-63 lead into the break. Valanciunas’ domination inside against his former team keyed much of the Grizzlies' offense. He already had 18 points and 14 rebounds at halftime, the first player in franchise history to have that stat combination in a half. “I think we were all frustrated and embarrassed with our effort to start,” VanVleet said. As Memphis took the lead to double digits in the third, things got testy between the teams. First, Nurse picked up his second technical, then Grayson Allen got called for a flagrant on Chris Boucher. All of this allowed Toronto to remain close before the Raptors pulled away in the fourth. “It was fun. It was fun postgame in the locker room,” Nurse said. “Guys were enjoying it, and they should. I talk about never getting too high or getting too low, but you’ve got to enjoy the wins. It’s too hard to get them.” TIP-INS Raptors: Are not only in the midst of a six-game road trip, but only have one home game — Saturday against Minnesota — before going on a three-game trip, making nine of 10 games on the road.

We’re a young team that simply has to learn from these situations.” Beasley tied a season high with 30 points, 22 in the fourth quarter, and rookie Anthony Edwards added 22 for the Timberwolves, who finished a five-game road trip 1-4. It was the second straight loss for the Wolves in which they rallied from a huge deficit early and nearly won. On Saturday at Oklahoma City, they came from 23 down to lead in the fourth quarter only to lose by two. “We’re finding ourselves as a group,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “I liked some of the progress.” Porzingis had 15 points and six rebounds in the first quarter as Dallas led 43-22. It was the most points for the Mavericks in one period this season and the second straight game in which the Wolves have allowed 43 in the first quarter.

Murray finished 2 for 5 on 3-pointers. “I love (Spurs assistant coach) Chip Engelland to death,” Murray said. “We do stuff like that. A lot of people might say, ‘Ah, it was luck, whatever.’ But we (practice) game winners.” Curry responded after a timeout with his own fall-away 3-pointer, but DeRozan closed out the game by making four straight free throws. Curry had 32 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. added 24 points for the Golden State, which was without injured centers James Wiseman and Kevon Looney. “It was an up-and-down game,” Oubre said. “They made some changes. I feel we didn’t adjust to those changes very well.” The teams will meet again Tuesday night in San Antonio. The Spurs trailed by as many as 14 points in the first half before rallying. Curry made three early 3-pointers and finished 6 of 11 on 3s. Mychal Mulder’s 3-pointer gave the Warriors a 45-31 lead with 8:25 remaining in the first half. “Nobody hung their head,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “We competed all night long and found a way at the end.” Draymond Green had seven points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for Golden State. Murray equaled his season high for a game with five steals in the first half. His eight steals are the most in a game in the league this season. “He has the ability to do that on an even more consistent basis,” Popovich said. “He wants to be pushed and we are pushing him. So his aggressiveness tonight was great.” Murray intercepted a long outlet for his sixth steal, which led to DeRozan’s 3-pointer that pared the Spurs’ deficit to 64-63 with 9:29 remaining in the third. San Antonio captured its first lead a minute later at 65-64 on Jakob Poeltl’s layup. “DJ, I think the thing I’m most impressed with is his leadership qualities,” Poeltl said. “He’s really stepped it up.” The Warriors closed the third quarter on a 10-6 run, scoring all five of their baskets on layups, dunks or short jumpers. The Spurs responded with a 10-2 run to open the fourth capped by Patty Mills’ 3-pointer for an 88-82 lead with 8:35 remaining. TIP-INS Warriors: Wiseman missed his fourth straight game with a sprained left wrist. The rookie suffered the injury Jan. 30 against Detroit. ... Klay Thompson, who is expected to miss the season following right Achilles tendon surgery, was in attendance. Thompson wore a boot as he sat on the second row of the Warriors’ bench. Spurs: The Spurs are targeting a return by fans for late February or early March following the city’s annual Stock Show &amp; Rodeo, according to an email sent to season ticket holders last week. The Spurs invited family members as well as full-time staff members to attend Monday’s game as part of a test run for whenever fans can return. ...

"Devin Booker ties the game with this off-balance trey in the fourth quarter. (0:21) PHOENIX -- — Monty Williams has proven to be a pretty good coach for the Phoenix Suns over two seasons. Having Devin Booker on the roster certainly helps. Booker scored a season-high 36 points, Mikal Bridges added 22 and the Suns rallied in the fourth quarter to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-113 on Monday night. Williams praised Booker's improvisation on one of the All-Star guard's best nights of the season. Booker made 14 of 27 shots, including five 3-pointers. “I made a few calls in the huddle, they take away the option and then he just makes a play,” Williams said. “His willingness to take big shots is something I really value.” Said Booker: “It’s my sixth year — I’ve seen a lot of different matchups and players and I try to take the challenge every night.” The Suns have won six of their past seven games while the Cavaliers have dropped four straight. Booker also had eight assists, which was valuable since All-Star point guard Chris Paul was sidelined with a sore hamstring. Phoenix took a 101-100 lead with seven minutes left on a 3-pointer from Cam Johnson. The second-year forward had missed his first six attempts from beyond the arc. That started an entertaining back-and-forth that lasted until the final minute. Bridges hit two free throws to give the Suns a 117-113 lead with 17.2 seconds left. “A resilient, gutsy win for us,” Williams said. “I’m proud of our guys, I hope they really enjoy it.” Cleveland has been one of the NBA's worst offensive teams this season but it didn't look that way on Monday. The Cavs' young backcourt of Darius Garland and Collin Sexton continually carved through the Suns' defense, which has been among the better units in the league. Sexton led the Cavs with 23 points while Garland had 17. Andre Drummond added 15 points and 14 rebounds. Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff was frustrated with an offensive foul that was called against Sexton late in the game. Booker poured in 17 points in the first quarter on 7-of-10 shooting. Langston Galloway had a steal and made a short jumper at the buzzer to give the Suns a 34-28 lead heading into the second. The Suns took a 64-61 edge into halftime. Both teams were getting lots of close, uncontested looks. Phoenix shot 60% from the field and had 40 points in the paint before the break while the Cavaliers shot 56.5% and got 23 points from their bench. SHORT-HANDED SUNS The Suns played without five players who are in their normal rotation. Paul missed his first game of the season with hamstring soreness after starting the first 22. He's averaging 16.4 points and more than eight assists per game. Phoenix also didn't have forwards Abdel Nader (ankle), Jae Crowder (foot) and Dario Saric (ankle), along with guard Cameron Payne (foot). Suns forward Deandre Ayton said that was no excuse: “The show must go on.” NANCE HAS SURGERY Cavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr. broke his left hand Saturday against Milwaukee and is expected to be out six weeks. Nance posted on Twitter on Monday that he had surgery. Nance has played in 19 games this season, starting 18. He's averaging 9.3 points and 6.8 rebounds. Nance's injury has left the Cavaliers thin in the frontcourt since Kevin Love is also out with a calf injury. Bickerstaff said he was pleased with the production of Drummond and Jarrett Allen, who had 14 points and five rebounds. “I think we definitely have room to grow,” Bickerstaff said. “We weren’t pleased with the 40 points in the paint that Phoenix scored in the first half. We addressed that at halftime. I thought they did a much better job.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: JaVale McGee was ejected early in the fourth quarter after getting into a heated argument with Suns forward Frank Kaminsky. Both players were quickly assessed technicals and then McGee got another one when the yelling continued. He blew kisses to the 1,500 fans at Phoenix Suns Arena as he was booed off the court. McGee finished with eight points in 8 minutes. Suns: E'Twaun Moore got his first start of the season with Paul out. He finished with a season-high 17 points in 40 minutes. ... Ayton finished with 15 points and 16 rebounds.","401267532"

"LeBron James records 28 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists as the Lakers edge out the Thunder in overtime 119-112. (2:22) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists for his third triple-double of the season, and the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 119-112 in overtime on Monday night to win their fifth in a row. It was their second straight overtime win after beating Detroit in two overtimes on Saturday. The Lakers tied their longest winning streak of the season despite being without Anthony Davis, who sat out with right Achilles tendinosis. “I'm good with one overtime compared to two overtimes,"" James said. “Get home a little bit earlier and my heart don’t feel as bad as it did the other night."" The Lakers dominated overtime after playing from behind for much of regulation. They scored seven straight to go up 117-110. The Thunder had a turnover, a shot-clock violation and two misses by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander before Hamidou Diallo finally scored. James answered with a basket that kept the Lakers ahead 119-112. The Thunder's miscues weren't over. Darius Bazley turned the ball over on a double-dribble and Gilgeous-Alexander was called for an offensive foul. Oklahoma City challenged that call, but lost the decision and the Lakers kept possession before playing out the clock. “We just have to stick with it,” Thunder center Al Horford said. “Our guys learn pretty quick. We make a mistake, we watch it on film and we correct it. We keep improving and that’s the mindset we have.” Gilgeous-Alexander narrowly missed matching James' triple-double. He finished with 29 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. Bazley added 21 points and a career-high 16 rebounds. Diallo had 20 points and tied his career high with 11 rebounds. “They got a lot of energy, a lot of young guys, no quit in them,” James said. Dennis Schroder added 19 points for the Lakers. Montrezl Harrell had 21 points and Wesley Matthews had 16, including four 3-pointers, off the bench. Kyle Kuzma added 11 points and 10 rebounds. “I feel like our guys are playing hard. We're not shooting the ball well,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “We had a ton of great looks from the perimeter and they didn't fall. When you’re not shooting well you got to win it with your defense."" The Lakers trailed by 11 in the fourth, the same deficit they faced in the first quarter. “Allowing ourselves to get down double-digits is not something we want to have long term,"" James said. “We play with a sense of urgency. I just think it’s our demeanor and our pace is very slow to start the game. We can change that."" James stole the ball from Bazley and scored to tie the game, 107-all. It was part of an 8-0 run by the Lakers in the closing seconds. Gilgeous-Alexander got fouled on a 3-point attempt and made all three free throws with 1 second left to force the extra session. The Lakers opened the third on an 18-8 run, highlighted by consecutive dunks from James including a one-handed reverse jam, to take a 74-68 lead. The Thunder answered by closing out the quarter with a 16-2 spurt, with Diallo scoring seven to go into the fourth leading 84-76. TIP-INS Thunder: They lost to the Lakers by 29 points on Jan. 13. ... They had just eight available players, with George Hill and Mike Muscala among those sidelined. Lakers: They've won six games this season after trailing by 10 or more points. ... Alex Caruso sat out after jamming two fingers against Detroit and having swelling. LEBRON AND BRADY James said watching Tom Brady win his seventh career Super Bowl with Tampa Bay at age 43 was inspiring. At 36, James has competed in 10 NBA Finals and won four titles. “I don't know how long I'm going to play the game,"" he said. “The way I feel right now, we'll see what happens. I have no timetable on it. I have no year. The game will let me know when it's time.""","401267534"
"James Harden gets animated on the sideline during a timeout as he appears to confront DeAndre Jordan about his defense against the Pistons. (0:15) DETROIT -- — The Brooklyn Nets are dealing with a bit of a challenge while Kevin Durant is sidelined. It's not going well at the moment. Jerami Grant equaled a career high with 32 points and the Detroit Pistons took advantage of Durant's absence Tuesday night, beating the Brooklyn Nets 122-111. It was the third straight loss for the Nets, who are without Durant because of coronavirus protocols. He can't return until later this week. Coach Steve Nash wasn't pleased with his team's response Tuesday, especially at the start. Brooklyn fell behind the last-place Pistons by 20 points in the second quarter. “This is professional sports. The other team is talented and capable, and we’re short-handed,"" Nash said. “We’ve got a lot to clean up. Number one thing is just that attitude and that competition level and that connectivity.” Detroit snapped a four-game losing streak and showed the same type of spirit that was on display in its previous game, a double-overtime loss in Los Angeles against the defending champion Lakers. “I like our foundation. I like the pieces we have,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “We’re not a finished product. ... We’ve just got to grow and get the pieces together.” The Nets were without both Durant and Kyrie Irving (right finger sprain) in a loss to Philadelphia on Saturday night. Irving returned against Detroit and scored 27 points. James Harden added 24 for Brooklyn, but it wasn't enough for the Nets to overcome a poor start. The Pistons shot 66.7% from the field in the first quarter and led by 12 at the end of the period. The lead reached 20 in the second. “We look very average, and we have the talent that the eye test presents, that we should be dominating,"" Irving said. ""We’re dealing with a lot of the reality that we’re putting this together on the fly.” Brooklyn rallied to within two in the third, but a 3-pointer by Grant gave the Pistons a 94-86 advantage at the end of that quarter, and Detroit was able to hold on. Pistons rookie Saddiq Bey scored all of his 15 points in the final period, making all six of his attempts from the field. Grant also tied his career high with 32 points in the loss to the Lakers. Durant was removed from the starting lineup Friday, then was cleared to play before he was pulled in the third quarter of a loss to Toronto. He's now missed two full games since then. It's been a tough stretch for the Nets, but plenty of other teams are also dealing with periods of uncertainty this season. “That’s the way this year’s going to be,"" Nash said. ""We can’t make excuses.” TIP-INS Nets: Irving and former Piston Bruce Brown were both called for technical fouls in the third quarter. ... Brooklyn signed F Noah Vonleh on Monday. He played a bit against Detroit but did not score. Pistons: Grant scored 29 points in the first three quarters. TAKING ADVANTAGE Detroit has only six victories on the season, but the last three were against the 76ers, Lakers and Nets — three good teams. They were without key players, however: Philadelphia was missing Joel Embiid, Los Angeles was without Anthony Davis, and Brooklyn didn't have Durant. NEWCOMER This was Detroit’s first game since acquiring Dennis Smith Jr. from New York in a deal that sent Derrick Rose to the Knicks. Smith couldn’t play Tuesday because of health and safety protocols. Casey said Smith was still in quarantine, but he was hoping Smith could be part of practice Wednesday.","401267535"
"Derrick Rose scores 14 points and dishes out three assists in his debut with the Knicks, who fall to the Heat. (1:10) MIAMI -- — A Heat-Knicks game, down to the wire, just like old times. Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo made sure it wouldn't get away from Miami. The duo did all of Miami's scoring for much of the second half, Butler finishing with a game-high 26 points, and the Heat beat New York 98-96 on Tuesday night to finish off a sweep of a home-and-home series. “This was more of a throwback Miami Heat-New York Knicks game from the ‘90s, where there weren't a lot of open shots in the last 14, 16 minutes of the game,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “You were just going to have to grind out a win."" RJ Barrett had a chance to tie it on the final play, but his layup bounced off the rim and Miami won three straight for the first time this season. Kelly Olynyk scored 20 points for Miami, Adebayo had 19 and Tyler Herro finished with 15 — including the 3-pointer with 1:04 left that put Miami up for good. The Knicks scored 14 points in the fourth quarter, and went to the line 16 times in the game — compared with 39 for Miami. The difference in free-throw attempts was 13-2 in the fourth, and Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau noticed. “I want to look at the film,"" Thibodeau said. “It just seemed a little strange to me in terms of ... I'll leave it at that."" Elfrid Payton led the Knicks with 18 points, and Derrick Rose — in his first game back with New York — had 14 off the bench. Barrett scored 13 and Julius Randle finished with 12 for New York. Herro scored Miami’s final basket of the first half, a layup with 30 seconds left. For the next 18 1/2 minutes of game time, Butler and Adebayo would be the only Heat players to score. They combined for all 19 Miami points of the third quarter and the first eight of the fourth, before Herro hit a jumper with 6:06 remaining. “We've got grit,"" Adebayo said. Miami led 57-55 after a first half that featured wild mood swings. The Heat opened on a 20-9 run, the Knicks then went on a 13-0 run to cap what became a 33-10 burst, and Miami immediately followed that with an 11-0 run of its own. New York led by as many as 10 in the third, taking an 82-76 lead into the fourth. But the Heat found a way at the end. “We're figuring this thing out, slowly but surely,"" Butler said. TIP-INS New York: Frank Ntilikina missed the game because of a contact-tracing issue, Thibodeau said. ... This was New York's lone regular-season visit to Miami this season. The Knicks will play host to the Heat once in the NBA's second half, sometime between mid-March and mid-May. Miami: Goran Dragic (ankle) remained out. ... The Heat start a seven-game Western Conference trip Thursday in Houston. ... Butler made a 3-pointer in the third quarter, his first of the season in 15 tries and his first in Miami’s home building since March 2. 2’S ARE WILD Miami made 12 2-pointers, the fewest in franchise history. The Heat made only four in the first half, two fewer than the previous low in the NBA this season. The last time a team had fewer 2-pointers in a first half was Oct. 27, 2018, when Atlanta made three against Chicago. The record for fewest 2s in a full game since the shot-clock era began is seven, by Washington last season — against Miami. HELLO, AGAIN Rose has now played three games as an opponent at AmericanAirlines Arena this season — two last month with Detroit, one with the Knicks. Such a quirk happens about twice a year on average; James Ennis (Philadelphia and Orlando) did it last year. Jason Collins and Jason Kidd (both in the 2003-04 and 2007-08 seasons) have done it twice since Miami moved into its current building in January 2000.","401267536"
"Brandon Ingram creates space and makes a 3-pointer in the Pelicans' win vs. the Rockets. (0:24) NEW ORLEANS -- — Pelicans reserve Josh Hart went from being questionable to play with back spams to scrapping for 40 minutes because of Zion Williamson's early foul trouble. “He played probably way too many minutes,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “But I wasn’t going to take him out because he was doing a great, great job.” Hart scored 20 points and grabbed a career-high 17 rebounds, and the Pelicans beat Houston 130-101 on Tuesday night to extend their winning streak to four games. “Luckily, I didn’t go out too often, so I didn’t have the risk of me getting cold and then locking back up,” Hart said as the team prepared to head straight from the arena to the airport for a road trip. “Being able to go out there and help the team — obviously, it was a pretty good game — so it felt amazing, felt good. I'm only worried that, hopefully my back doesn't lock up on this plane ride.” Brandon Ingram scored 22 and Williamson added 20 points, seven assists, five rebounds and a steal despite being limited to 20 minutes on the court, which might prove beneficial with New Orleans playing on back-to-back nights. Willy Hernangomez added 14 points and 10 rebounds in a reserve role and Lonzo Ball capped his 15-point night with a back-breaking 3 as New Orleans pulled away in the fourth quarter. John Wall scored 25 points, routinely beating defenders off the dribble and finishing near the basket. Eric Gordon 23 for Houston, which lost its third straight. Houston coach Stephen Silas took issue with his team's defense, citing the Pelicans' 60 points in the paint and 18 second-chance points. “If we’re not committed to stopping people like we have been up until this point, it’s going to be hard for us to win,"" Silas said. “A lot of points in the paint or rebounding isn’t necessarily a technical or a schematic thing. It’s: Go and get the ball. Get the ball out of the middle of the paint.” Whatever pain Hart was in didn't show. He threw down several driving one-handed dunks, made three 3-points and even blocked two shots to go with a steal. “Josh always plays hard,"" Williamson said. ""He always sacrifices his body for the sake of the team. To see Josh do that, we're all happy for him.” New Orleans led by 20 when Ball's 3 made it 82-62 in the third quarter. Wall scored six and Sterling Brown hit a pair of 3s to help Houston cut it to 92-81 heading into the fourth quarter. But New Orleans never let Houston get within 10 in the final period, going up 112-97 on Ball's deep 3 with 4:55 left. Van Gundy said Ball “controlled that game down the stretch and made sure that we took care of the ball, made sure that we got the ball where it needed to go.” TIP-INS Rockets: Danuel House Jr. and Jae'Sean Tate each scored 13. Brown scored 11. ... Houston was 13 of 43 from 3-point range. ... Center Christian Wood, who had 27 points and nine rebounds in the previous meeting, missed his third straight game with a right ankle sprain. ... Silas received a technical foul after yelling at officials for failing to call a foul when Gordon had shot blocked by Steven Adams. Pelicans: First-round draft pick Kira Lewis Jr. and Eric Bledsoe each scored 10 points. ... The Pelicans hit 12 of 31 3-point attempts. ... New Orleans outrebounded Houston 55-37. ... The Pelicans combined for 31 assists on 47 made baskets. SMOOTH ADJUSTMENT Williamson, who's been increasingly initiating New Orleans’ offense by handling the ball on the perimeter, had 10 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal in the first half despite playing just more than four minutes in the first quarter and less than two in the second. Still, the Pelicans opened up a double-digit lead, going on a 17-0 run in the second quarter during which Hart scored 10 points on a driving dunk, a 3, a driving layup while he was fouled, and after he missed the free-throw, a floating put-back as he was fouled for a 3-point play. The spurt put the Pelicans up 61-43 and they led 63-50 at halftime. OFFENSIVE FLOW After scoring 120 points twice in their first 15 games, the Pelicans have scored 123 or more four times in their last eight. “I’ve had zero to do with that. Our guys have just gotten comfortable playing together,"" Van Gundy said. ""We’re making plays for each other. We’re getting higher quality shots.”","401267537"
"Steph Curry goes to pass but changes his mind in midair and flips in an and-1 layup. (0:27) SAN ANTONIO -- — Even after three NBA championships and two MVP awards, Stephen Curry has never looked better to his coach. Curry scored 32 points and the Golden State Warriors dominated San Antonio 114-91 on Tuesday night, snapping the Spurs’ three-game winning streak. “This is the best I’ve ever seen him, just from a confidence and strength standpoint, and that’s saying something, obviously,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “Two-time MVP. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him look better.” After missing all but five games last season due to a broken metacarpal in his left hand, Curry is averaging 29.5 points this season. “I worked my butt off over the offseason,” Curry said. “I’m just happy to be playing. I feel strong. I feel in rhythm, in ultimate control of my game. Shots are falling. It all comes not only with my own confidence, but growing confidence in my team.” Curry was 4 for 10 on 3-pointers and 11 for 20 overall. His night included switching hands after contact for an improbable, behind-the-back flip shot late in the first quarter that he made despite being fouled. “Man, I have to go back in the fault for that,” Warriors veteran Draymond Green said. “That was nice. It was very close to an (Michael Jordan) little flip. That was a good one for sure. That was up there.” Curry laughed when told of the comparison. “Nothing high flying or above the rim about that,” Curry said. “I’ll take that recognition. I did switch hands, so that is the only comparison.” Golden State ended a five-game losing streak in San Antonio. Eric Paschall had 15 points and Andrew Wiggins added 14 for the Warriors. Rudy Gay scored 17 points, Trey Lyles had 15 and Keldon Johnson and Patty Mills had 13 apiece for San Antonio. It was the Spurs’ final home game before embarking on their annual nearly month-long road trip while the city’s Stock Show &amp; Rodeo is held at the AT&amp;T Center. After blowing a 14-point lead in a 105-100 loss to San Antonio on Monday, Golden State did not let up in the second night of a back-to-back. The Warriors finished 17 for 40 on 3-pointers and shot 46% overall. The Spurs received a spark off the bench with Lyles scoring nine points in the first half after entering the game with 3:21 left in the opening quarter. Lyles, who was averaging 10.8 minutes in 12 games this season, played 26 minutes. The Warriors went on a 20-2 run in the third, capped by a 3-pointer by Kelly Oubre Jr. for a 73-55 lead midway through the quarter. Golden state extended the lead to 86-65 on Kent Bazemore’s 3-pointer off a Curry assist with 2:31 remaining in the period. “When you’re not getting stops, it’s hard to win a game,” Spurs guard Dejounte Murray said. The Spurs were without injured starters Derrick White and LaMarcus Aldridge, who has a sore right hip. White sat out the second night of a back-to-back for injury rehabilitation after missing 12 straight games earlier this season with a fractured left second toe. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State won the first and last games of its four-game road trip, losing twice by a combined seven points. … The Warriors used the same starting lineup despite a back-to-back. … Golden State’s previous victory in San Antonio was Nov. 2, 2017, when Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant all scored 20-plus points in a 112-92 victory.

(0:17) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Donovan Mitchell had 36 points and nine assists to lead the Utah Jazz to their fifth straight victory, 122-108 over the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night. Joe Ingles scored a season-high 24 points and added six assists for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert chipped in 18 points and 12 rebounds. Bojan Bogdanovic added 16 points and eight rebounds. Utah (20-5) has won 16 of its last 17 games and keeps seeking ways to improve. “It’s a group that isn’t concerned with our record, our win streak,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “We want to win, but the focus is squarely on getting better.” Jaylen Brown scored 33 points and Jayson Tatum added 23 for Boston. The Celtics (12-11) lost for the third time in four games. After trailing by as many as 14 points in the third quarter, the Celtics cut it to 108-104 on free throws from Brown and Tristan Thompson. The Jazz slammed the door on a comeback by scoring on six straight possessions. Ingles and Mitchell combined for three 3-pointers to start the run and Gobert finished it with back-to-back dunks, giving Utah a 122-108 lead in the final minute. “They got the best record in the league and it showed,” Brown said. “The way they play with the freedom. The kind of the flow they have to their team is really good right now.” Mitchell scored or recorded an assist on each of the final seven Jazz baskets, showing his progression as a decision-maker in crunch time. “He’s really able to understand the tempo of the game and is able to find his teammates,” Gobert said. “He’s improved every single year. But this year it feels like, especially these last few weeks, he’s been at his best.” Over the last five games, Mitchell has averaged 28.6 points and 6.2 assists. He credits the trust teammates and coaches have placed in him. “I’m always going to be confident in my abilities and what I can do,” Mitchell said. “But the trust factor allows me to be in that position.” The Celtics made their first five baskets from long distance – starting with three consecutive 3-pointers from Brown – and shot 7 of 13 overall from 3-point range during the first quarter in taking a 27-19 lead. Utah clamped down defensively in the second quarter, holding the Celtics without a point over a four-minute stretch early in the period. The Jazz also settled into a consistent rhythm on offense as the quarter progressed. Back-to-back 3-pointers from Royce O’Neale and Mitchell triggered a 14-4 run that put Utah ahead 44-38. The Jazz scored on five of six possessions during the run, culminating in a dunk from Bogdanovic. “You can’t make mistakes against these guys,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “They’re exceptionally well oiled on offense, just a special team to compete against. When you make a mistake, they make you pay.” Mitchell dominated during a third quarter where the Jazz totaled 42 points. He scored three baskets and assisted on two others while fueling a 17-4 run that extended Utah’s lead to 70-58 midway through the quarter. Mitchell ended up with 14 points in the quarter after scoring 12 in the first half.

""I try to play it cool. Sometimes I try to sit back and reflect on these moments, take these moments in. I’m enjoying this. I’m glad I can keep climbing up the charts. But the Big O, that’s big.” Nikola Vucevic had 27 points and 15 rebounds for the short-handed Magic, who have lost six of their last seven games. Rookie Cole Anthony started but did not return for the second half because of a shoulder injury. Carmelo Anthony hit a 3-pointer that gave the Blazers a 93-79 lead early in the fourth quarter and Portland didn't let the Magic get within single digits until the final seconds. “I don't know how long he's going to play. He could play a few more years, I don't know. But he was a professional force last year, he's been really good for us this year,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of the 10-time All-Star. ""There's some highs and lows, but he has earned the respect of our organization, of his teammates, his coaches.” Evan Fournier, a late scratch on Saturday with back spasms when Orlando fell 118-92 at home to the Bulls, was unavailable again against Portland. The Magic were also without Michael Carter-Williams, who has a sprained foot, and Aaron Gordon because of a sprained left ankle. But the Magic got some good news with the return of Al-Farouq Aminu, who played for the first time this season after rehabbing his right knee, although he was limited to just five minutes in the opening half. Aminu played for four years in Portland before signing with Orlando as a free agent in 2019. “It's been the story of our season,” Vucevic said. “Guys keep getting injured for some reason. It's been unfortunate and it's tough.” Portland led by as many as 16 points in the opening quarter. Gary Trent Jr.'s 3-pointer put the Blazers up 45-28 midway through the second. Orlando's 10-3 run to close out the half cut the margin to 50-43. Anthony appeared to hurt his right shoulder late in the second quarter and did not return. Frank Mason started the second half. The Magic pulled to 70-63 on Terrence Ross' floater. The Blazers answered with an 8-0 run to pull away and led 84-73 going into the final period. TIP INS Magic: The game kicked off a four-game road trip for the Magic. ... The last Orlando win in Portland was in January 2017. ... The team said Anthony had a right shoulder strain. Additional details weren't available. Anthony was averaging 11.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists going into the game.

The Blazers were at home after a six-game road trip, which they finished 3-3. ... Trent led all players with 15 first-half points. ... It was Lillard’s 13th game with 30-plus points this season. MOVING UP Anthony is now 32 points from Hakeem Olajuwon in 11th. He said after he was out of the game for a year that he's tried to enjoy the milestones as they come, but it's a busy season. “I'll try to go home and have a glass a wine and reflect over it, but tomorrow we'll be back at it with practice, so I only have a couple of hours to kind of take in this moment,” he said. NO BREAK Vucevic played the entire second half. “The game was right there and I thought if I kept playing it would give us a chance to get closer and maybe turn the game around,” he said. “I didn't want to come out and maybe have the game get away if they went on a run or something.”","401267540"
"Ben Simmons blows by the Kings' defense and finishes with a one-handed jam. (0:18) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Joel Embiid had 25 points, 17 rebounds and helped the Philadelphia 76ers turn up the defensive intensity in the fourth quarter to beat the Sacramento Kings 119-111 on Tuesday night. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry each added 22 points as the Sixers used a 10-0 run to take control of the game in the fourth and win for the sixth time in seven games. “I loved the defense first,"" coach Doc Rivers said. “This is a very good offensive team. Holding them to 20 points in the third and fourth quarter is great. I loved our execution. It's important at the end of the game our guys understand who we want to play through and the ball moves from there.” The Kings took a 99-97 lead on a layup by Harrison Barnes with 7:26 to go and then didn’t score again for nearly three minutes, missing seven straight shots and committing a turnover. “We just started playing better defense honestly,” Rivers said. “A lot of it too is we kept them out of the paint. That’s what created a lot of (their) 3s.” Shake Milton tied the game with a layup and then Harris and Milton hit 3-pointers to put Philadelphia up six points. Embiid’s two free throws made it 107-99 and the Sixers held on from there to snap Sacramento’s four-game winning streak. De’Aaron Fox led the Kings with 34 points and 10 assists. Buddy Hield added 21 points and Marvin Bagley III had 17. The Kings shot just 3 for 22 from 3-point range in the second half after making 11 from long range in the first two quarters. Coach Luke Walton said he believed there might have been some fatigue with his team playing for the third time in four days. “We just missed,” Walton said. “We missed shots we’ve been making lately. Maybe we wouldn’t have won either way but we would have had a better chance if some of those open looks had gone in.” The Sixers built a 14-point lead early in the second quarter before the Kings responded and went up 66-61 on successive 3-points from Fox, Hield and Tyrese Haliburton in the span of less than a minute. Sacramento led 71-66 at the break and the game stayed close from there until the end.

Walton said G DaQuan Jeffries is close to returning from an ankle sprain that has sidelined him all season. FAST STARTING FOX Fox had 15 points and five assists in the first quarter, the second time this season he has hit those marks in a single period having had 16 points and five assists in the third quarter against New Orleans on Jan. 17.

"Russell Westbrook throws down a two-handed dunk for his second slam of the season. (0:22) WASHINGTON -- — Norman Powell scored 28 points, Pascal Siakam added 26 and the Toronto Raptors made 19 3-pointers in a 137-115 win over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. Seven Raptors hit at least one 3-pointer, with Kyle Lowry leading the way with 5-for-8 shooting from long range. He finished with 21 points. Toronto shot 59% (19 for 32) from beyond the arc. Powell and Siakam each hit three 3-pointers as Toronto won for the fifth time in six games and improved to 4-1 on their current trip. After starting the season with one win in seven games, Toronto is almost back at .500 at 12-13. “They were 19 for 32 — that’s tough to do in an open gym,” said Wizards coach Scott Brooks, who once again watched on as his team struggle to defend. “That was the night,” he said. Chris Boucher had 17 points and Fred VanVleet scored 14, and seven Raptors reached double figures. NBA leading scorer Bradley Beal, who averages 33.3 points was held to 24, as the Wizards lost to the Raptors for the eighth straight time, including four in a row at Washington. Russell Westbrook, who sat out Washington’s win at Chicago on Monday, returned to score 23 points, including 19 in the second half. He added seven assists and six rebounds. Westbrook made back-to-back 3-pointers to cut Toronto’s lead to 111-106 with 8:27 left. Toronto finished the game on a 26-9 run as Washington fell to 6-16, the NBA’s third-worst record. “It’s frustrating because we are in the game,” Beal said. ""We were right there in the game and then all of a sudden, we’re down 10, we’re down 15. We couldn’t guard the 3-point line and they were just lining them up.” Rui Hachimura scored 15 points and had seven rebounds, and Robin Lopez had 13. Toronto used a hot shooting start to jump out early before eventually taking a 74-61 advantage into halftime. The Raptors shot 59% in the first half and connected on 8 of 14 3s. TIP-INS Raptors: OG Anunoby missed his eighth straight game with a left calf strain. ...

Bertans came into the game shooting a career-low 33.1% on 3s. CASE CLOSED Raptors coach Nick Nurse spoke pregame on the lawsuit against team president Masai Ujiri being dropped. “I’m certainly happy for him that it’s over,” Nurse said. “It’s a long process that he had to go through but he did it properly and went through it without ever wavering. I’m sure he’s glad it’s over with, as we all are.” A law enforcement officer in California had sued Ujiri over a scuffle following the Raptors victory over Golden State in the 2019 NBA Finals in Oakland. SUPER BOWL SHOUTOUT “We had to get out of Tampa Bay so they could win the Super Bowl,” Lowry said about the Toronto’s temporary home this season. “Congratulations to the Buccaneers.” HOT STREAK Powell came into the game as the Raptors fourth-leading scorer averaging 15.8 but the sixth-year pro has scored at least 20 in nine of his last 10 games. “He looks really confident,” said Nurse. “When he rises up, you’re really expecting it to go in.

"Kyrie Irving passes to DeAndre Jordan at the rim for a two-handed alley-oop dunk. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — Steve Nash just wanted to see his Brooklyn Nets compete harder and tougher. “They gave us everything we asked for,” Nash said. And way more than the Indiana Pacers could handle. Kyrie Irving had 35 points and eight assists and the Nets were defensively dominant in the first half in shutting down the Pacers 104-94 on Wednesday night to snap a three-game losing streak. A night after an embarrassing effort in Detroit, when the Nets yielded 38 points in the first quarter, the Pacers didn't reach that total until 8:46 remained in the third. By then, the Nets had built a 32-point halftime lead, their largest since moving to Brooklyn in 2012, and with a 62-30 bulge allowed just two more points than their best total since moving from New Jersey. “We haven’t played defense like that pretty much the entire season, so it was definitely good to see us taking a step in the right direction,” swingman Joe Harris said. Irving was 17 for 17 from the throw line, career highs in both categories, and Brooklyn led by as many as 36 points. James Harden added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Nets, who expect to get Kevin Durant back from his three-game absence for coronavirus health and safety protocol reasons when they open a five-game trip to the West on Saturday at Golden State, his former team. Domantas Sabonis had 18 points and nine rebounds for the Pacers, who dropped their season-high fourth in a row. They were coming off their worst offensive performance of the season, with season lows of 95 points and 39.8% Sunday against Utah. That was nothing compared to this mess. The Pacers missed 10 of their first 12 shots and had six points in the first seven minutes. Things didn't get much better, as they went 4 for 21 (19%) in the second quarter. “I thought we were getting frustrated on both ends, which was affecting the other,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. “Offensively, just the movement kind of came to a standstill, kind of looking around a little bit instead of really being the aggressor.” After limiting the Pacers to 18 points in the first quarter, the Nets had their best period of the season in the second when they gave up just 12. Indiana got within 14 late in the third quarter, but Brooklyn got the final six points to take an 82-62 lead to the fourth. TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana had won six in a row in Brooklyn. The Pacers' last loss at Barclays Center had been Oct. 28, 2016, and they fell to 10-5 in the arena. ... Malcolm Brogdan had 15 points, six assists and five rebounds. Nets: Harris scored 17 points. ... DeAndre Jordan finished with 12 points and 13 rebounds. CROWDS COMING When the Nets return from their upcoming trip to the West, some fans will be at Barclays Center to welcome them. The Nets announced they had been approved to reopen at 10% capacity starting with their Feb. 23 game against Sacramento, in accordance with guidelines announced Wednesday by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Requirements include all fans to have a negative test for the coronavirus within 72 hours of the game, along with mandatory temperature checks and wearing of masks. “Obviously 10 percent isn’t a packed house, but I think it is a little boost and I think it can help at least players enjoy the experience a little more and make the season a little less monotonous,” Nash said. LEVERT LOOKS ON Caris LeVert is traveling with the Pacers and was sitting on the bench to watch a video tribute the Nets played after the first quarter. LeVert, who went to Indiana as part of the Harden trade last month, is recovering from surgery to treat a cancerous growth on his left kidney that was discovered during his post-trade physical. Bjorkgren said the guard has been working out and looks good.","401267543"
"Trae Young argues with the referees that a foul should have been called, after Danilo Gallinari can't convert and the Hawks fall to the Mavs. (1:19) DALLAS -- — Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks were trying to hang on to a one-point lead in the final seconds after rallying in the fourth quarter against Atlanta. Trae Young never got a chance to answer for the Hawks. Doncic had 28 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds, and Young was knocked down setting a screen on the final play as the Mavericks beat the Hawks 118-117 on Wednesday night, a week after ending a six-game losing streak in Atlanta. With Young on the ground after Willie Cauley-Stein ran into him, Danilo Gallinari ended up with the ball and missed a jumper just before the buzzer. Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce thought Young was fouled and said an official told him it was an illegal screen. Pierce and Young disagreed. “The play was for me to get the ball,” said Young, who finished with 25 points and 15 assists. “I’m not going to run away from the ball with four seconds left and we’re trying to win the game. I’m not going to just fall at the end. That’s the most frustrating part is not really having the opportunity to make a play at the end.” Crew chief Josh Tiven told a pool reporter the crew felt the contact was incidental, and therefore no foul was called. “After reviewing the play postgame, we still feel that a no-call was the correct decision,” Tiven said. Cauley-Stein said he didn't see Young, adding he didn't think there was any way the Atlanta guard would get the call when the Hawks would have had free throws to take the lead and maintain possession. “Good try, though,” Cauley-Stein said. “That was smooth. It was sneaky.” Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 13 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter to spark the comeback, starting with a quarter-opening 3 to get the Mavericks within six after they trailed by 13 in the third. Dallas won its third straight and fourth in five games. John Collins scored 33 points for the Hawks, who have lost four of five in a stretch that included a 122-116 Dallas win in Atlanta that ended the Mavericks' longest skid since 2019. Kevin Huerter scored a season-high 23 points for the Hawks. Dallas played the national anthem before the game for the first time this season, a day after owner Mark Cuban revealed he had decided not to play “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The NBA initially said teams had been given latitude for pregame activities in the coronavirus pandemic before reversing course and declaring all teams would play the anthem before games, as news of Cuban's decision sparked a national conversation. Most teams aren't playing in front of fans, but this was the second of the season for the Mavs to have up to 1,500 vaccinated essential workers attending for free. Jalen Brunson, who scored 11 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, put Dallas ahead for good on a jumper for a 111-109 lead with less than four minutes to go and assisted on a 3-pointer by Dorian Finney-Smith for a four-point lead before Young answered with a 3 in the final minute. Hardaway scored seven points in the first minute and a half of the fourth quarter after assistant Jenny Boucek went to coach Rick Carlisle and said the Mavericks needed to get the guard a shot. He was 5 of 6 in the fourth, making all 3 of his 3s. “We set up a play, we got him a shot and he banged in a 3 and that kind of got the team going,” Carlisle said. “It got us going. It got the fans in the building going. It ignited our defense and a lot of good things happened after that.” TIP-INS Hawks: Coach Lloyd Pierce said F De'Andre Hunter was going through strength work after surgery on his injured right knee. ... Clint Capela's NBA-best streak of 19 straight games with at least 10 rebounds ended because of foul trouble. He picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter and had seven rebounds. Mavericks: Doncic had his NBA-leading seventh triple-double. ... Kristaps Porzingis was in foul trouble but finished with 15 points. ... Cauley-Stein scored 14 points and was a plus-19, with Carlisle crediting his defense for the fourth-quarter rally and praising the effort after sitting for consecutive games. LATE FIRST SURGE The Hawks led 62-52 at halftime after finishing the first half on a 14-4 run that started when Young hit a 3-pointer as Porzingis ran into him for his third foul. Young, an 89% free throw shooter, didn’t convert that four-point play but hit another 3 just before Doncic also picked up his third foul to join Porzingis on the bench in the final two minutes of the first half.","401267544"
"Zach LaVine makes nine 3-pointers on his way to 46 points in the Bulls' 129-116 win vs. the Pelicans. (2:32) CHICAGO -- — It was Zach LaVine and Coby White all night long. There were layups and jams, well-placed passes and 3-pointers. So many 3s. LaVine scored a season-high 46 points, hitting nine of Chicago's franchise-record 25 3-pointers, and the Bulls cooled off the New Orleans Pelicans with a 129-116 victory Wednesday. “I expect to do that. I put in the time and effort,” LaVine said. “It happens that way. You hit a couple, get hot. You wish it could happen every game. Obviously, it can’t. But when you get in a zone, you want to stay in it.” White made eight 3s and scored 30 points in an impressive show by Chicago's starting backcourt. LaVine and White became the first duo in NBA history to make at least eight 3s apiece in the same game, according to STATS. Denzel Valentine added four 3-pointers and 16 points as the Bulls went 25 for 47 from beyond the arc and shot 59% (48 for 81) overall. “We (were) due for a good team shooting night,” White said. “We haven't been shooting the ball well as a team, especially at home.” New Orleans had won four in a row, including a 130-101 victory over Houston on Tuesday night. But the Pelicans looked a little tired in the second half of the opener of a four-game trip. “Bad combination tonight of them being great and making shots and us being a step slow defensively,” coach Stan Van Gundy said. Zion Williamson had 29 points for New Orleans, and Brandon Ingram finished with 21 points on 6-for-19 shooting. Lonzo Ball scored 19 of his 21 points in the first half. New Orleans led 74-66 at the break despite Chicago setting a franchise record with 14 3s in the first half. But the Bulls rolled right by the Pelicans with a big third quarter. White connected from long range and Daniel Gafford had a driving dunk with 7:03 left, capping a 19-2 run for Chicago. White hit another 3 with 15.3 seconds remaining in the third, lifting the Bulls to a 106-88 lead. “Their ball movement was incredible,” Williamson said. “The pace of their offense was great, and they were also hitting shots.” TURNING IT AROUND White had been struggling, shooting just 35.9% from the field in his previous five games. But he went 8 for 17 from deep and 10 for 20 overall in the victory over New Orleans. He also had seven assists. “I’m very happy for Coby that he got back on track,” LaVine said. “He showed that confidence again.” TIP-INS Pelicans: Rookie PG Kira Lewis Jr. scored a career-high 14 points on 5-for-7 shooting. The 19-year-old Lewis was the No. 13 pick in last year's draft. “I love his mindset. I love his approach to the game. I just really love his mentality,” Van Gundy said. “(Assistant coach) Teresa Weatherspoon’s done a terrific job with him, getting him acclimated to the NBA, and I really look forward to watching his growth as the season goes on.” Bulls: C Wendell Carter Jr. (bruised right quadriceps) has been doing some running, but coach Billy Donovan said he doesn't have a timetable for his return. Carter hasn't appeared in a game since Jan. 18. “For right now he continues to progress in a very positive way,” Donovan said. ...

Dillon Brooks added 20 points, Desmond Bane and Grayson Allen scored 18 each, and Ja Morant had 15 points and 11 assists. “I feel like we’re a very dangerous team, knocking down shots,” Morant said. “I feel like the team we have now, there’s a lot of shooting we can put on the floor. We encourage everybody from the first man to the last man when they get in the game to shoot it.” Terry Rozier led the Hornets with 34 points, connecting on 12 of 17 shots. LaMelo Ball added 17 points, and Gordon Hayward and Malcolm Bridges added 15 points apiece. Bridges had 10 rebounds. “I think we gave great effort at the beginning of the game and kind of went away from it,” Rozier said. “Got discouraged, especially in the second half when they started hitting 3s. They just never looked back.” The biggest burst for Memphis came in the third quarter. Anderson opened the second half with four 3-pointers in less than 3 minutes, leading to a Charlotte timeout. “I think I had knocked down a corner 3 in the first half, and it just felt good,” Anderson said. “It came to me about four or five times in a row (in the second half).” Later in the quarter, the Grizzlies had a 21-7 run and the Memphis lead swelled to 101-83 at the end of the third. Memphis outscored the Hornets 31-15 in the frame as Charlotte, which shot well in the first half, converted only six of its 20 shots. Charlotte never threatened the rest of the way. “Poor performance defensively out of our group overall,” Hornets coach James Borrego said about allowing Memphis to connect on the franchise-record 3-pointers. “The commitment we’ve had this season, tonight we were not there. We weren’t locked in.” Both teams started the game shooting well, but Memphis was hindered by a handful of turnovers and a half dozen fouls in the first quarter. The Hornets were still shooting 67.6% midway through the second quarter. Still, Memphis shot well enough for a 70-68 lead at the break. Rozier had 24 for Charlotte, while Allen led Memphis with 16 points. The performance was contrary to the four-game losing streak, particularly recently when the Grizzlies let games get away late. “I thought our spirit was good, (regardless) of what the result was in the first quarter or the first half,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “I think our spirit was there and it just set a tone for us to continue to go out there and grind out a win.” TIP-INS Hornets: Starting G Devonte Graham missed his third game with a left groin strain. “We’ll be cautious,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “He’s getting better.

Towns announced on Jan. 15 that he tested positive for COVID-19 and remained on the league’s health and safety protocol list until Wednesday, when coach Ryan Saunders said Towns was a game-time decision. “I thought he competed,” Saunders said. ""His wind was good; 18 and 10 coming back from a layoff like he did was a good night for him.” Towns detailed his bout with COVID in his postgame comments, noting that underlying conditions made his battle with the virus especially tough.

Booker scored 30 points, Paul added 28 points and seven assists and the Suns extended their winning streak to four games by rallying to beat the Milwaukee Bucks 125-124 on Wednesday night. Booker and Paul combined for 15 points in a tight fourth quarter. “It’s tough for other teams,” Paul said. “You don’t know what to take away. Most teams have one primary defender so who you gonna put him on? Me or Book? We’re learning to play off of each other.” Milwaukee had its five-game winning streak snapped despite getting a season-high 47 points from Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Bucks had a chance to win on the final possession, but Antetokounmpo missed a 20-foot jumper at the buzzer. “To get it to Giannis, to be at the top of the key with the court spread, you attack or get a shot,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “He got a pretty good look.” The Suns have won seven of eight and have a 15-9 record. Phoenix struggled to slow the Bucks’ offense, especially in the first three quarters. Milwaukee has scored at least 120 points in every game over their past six. Antetokounmpo made 15 of 23 shots from the field, including 15 of 19 from inside the arc, finishing all night on layups and dunks. The Suns took their first lead of the second half at 104-101 when Paul made a 3-pointer with 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Frank Kaminsky made another long ball less than a minute later to push the Suns ahead 107-101. Booker made a step back 3-pointer with 2:30 left to put the Suns up 124-116 but the Bucks pulled to 124-122 with a minute left on Khris Middleton's corner 3. Antetokounmpo flushed a dunk on the next possession to tie it at 124 with 50 seconds left. Booker made a free throw with 32 seconds left that proved to be the difference. “It’s a big win for us,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “We don’t take wins like this for granted.” The teams fought to a 32-all tie in the first quarter before the Bucks caught fire from 3-point range and scored 39 points in the second. Milwaukee took a 71-59 lead into the break after shooting 13 of 24 (54%) from long range. Bryn Forbes and Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 17 points each. Forbes — who was making just his second start of the season — made 5 of 6 3-pointers. NATIONAL ANTHEM Suns coach Monty Williams said he understands both sides of the debate on playing the national anthem before sporting events, but said he “enjoys” the song during the pregame. The Suns have played the anthem at all home games this season, even when fans weren't in attendance. “I’ve also experienced the anthem in the World Cup and the Olympics, which was one of the coolest things I’ve ever been a part of, was hearing our anthem in a foreign country before you compete or at the end when you win,” Williams said. “So for me, as much as I can appreciate both sides of the coin, it does hold a special place in my heart because of what I’ve experienced.” Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and the NBA made news earlier this week when reports surfaced that the anthem hadn't been played at the team's first 11 home games. Cuban relented Wednesday and the anthem will be played before home games this season after the NBA reiterated its “longstanding league policy” to include the song. HOLIDAY OUT Bucks guard Jrue Holiday missed a second straight game because of the league's health and safety protocols. Coach Mike Budenholzer said he's been in touch with Holiday while he's been out. “Spoke with Jrue a lot over the past few days,” Budenholzer said. “He's in a good place and he's taking care of himself, but he has an eye on the team too.” Holiday started the season's first 23 games and is averaging 16.4 points. TIP-INS Bucks: Backup forward Bobby Portis had 10 points and nine rebounds in the first half. ... Antetokounmpo made 17 free throws, which was easily a season high.

"The Lakers go to overtime for the second game in a row as they take down the Thunder 114-113 thanks to late-game heroics by LeBron James. (2:58) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James hit the tying 3-pointer late in regulation and then broke up the Thunder's final possession in overtime to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to their sixth consecutive victory, 114-113 over Oklahoma City on Wednesday night. James had 25 points, seven assists and six rebounds for the defending NBA champions, who survived their third consecutive overtime game. Montrezl Harrell scored 20 points, and Dennis Schröder had 19 points and seven rebounds as the Lakers rallied back from another huge early deficit and again showed just enough late-game poise to win. “We’ve got a deep team, a lot of weapons, a lot of ways we can hurt you down the stretch,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “They gave us all we could handle, especially in the first half of these games. But we kept grinding, stayed connected, believed in each other and grinded it out.” Al Horford scored 25 points and Kenrich Williams had a career-high 24 for the Thunder, who excelled at Staples Center despite having just eight available players for back-to-back narrow losses to the defending NBA champions. “I’m proud of our fight, the way we competed,” Williams said after his third start. “Coach always emphasizes playing the whole 48. We had a little extra time more than 48, but I’m just proud of our guys.” James hit a tying 3-pointer with 19.6 seconds to play in regulation, and Luguentz Dort missed a 3 at the buzzer. Wesley Matthews then hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer for the Lakers with 41.4 seconds left in overtime. After Dort made a driving layup, James airballed a long jumper to give Oklahoma City one last shot with 4.3 seconds to play — but James anticipated the Thunder's midcourt inbounds pass and knocked it into the backcourt, leaving the Thunder with no time to get a good shot. “It’s getting old, but I've just got to commend them for their effort, their competitiveness,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “On a short turnaround, after a tough loss the other night, we compete for 53 minutes. These ones sting, because you want to come away with a win when you put that sort of effort forward. But we’re focused on progress, and we continue to show progress.” Both teams were significantly shorthanded. The Thunder played without leading scorer Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who has a nagging left knee injury. Anthony Davis missed his second straight game for the Lakers with an Achilles issue, and key reserve Alex Caruso also missed his second straight game with an injured hand. Meanwhile, James played at least 40 minutes in three consecutive games for the first time in four years with no noticeable drop-off in play. “That's why he's probably going to be this year's MVP,” Vogel said. TIP-INS Thunder: Gilgeous-Alexander sat out for the third time in five games. ... Mike Muscala returned from a one-game absence with a concussion and scored six points. Lakers: Caruso went through a lengthy pregame workout before deciding to rest. ... Davis has missed five of the Lakers' 26 games. OVERTIME FEATS The Lakers became the seventh team in NBA history to win three consecutive overtime games. Minnesota did it last in January 2007. Los Angeles hadn't played three straight overtime games since 1991.","401267550"
"Justin Holiday extends the Pacers' lead as he completes a 4-point play after getting fouled while scoring the trey. (0:18) DETROIT -- — Domantas Sabonis had 26 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, and the Indiana Pacers snapped a four-game losing streak with a 111-95 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night. Malcolm Brogdon added 18 points and Jeremy Lamb scored 17 for the Pacers, who posted a season-low 94 points in a loss to Brooklyn on Wednesday. One night later, it was Detroit that struggled offensively, shooting 5 of 28 from 3-point range. “I thought we guarded the ball better tonight,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. ""We were disruptive. I thought we were pressed up to their shooters on the catch.” Josh Jackson led Detroit with 18 points, and rookie Isaiah Stewart added 17 in his first start at center. Mason Plumlee missed the game for the last-place Pistons because of a right elbow issue. Detroit missed its first eight shots from beyond the arc, but the Pistons were effective enough inside that the game was tied 52-all at halftime. Then the Pacers outscored Detroit 30-18 in the third quarter. Brogdon had 10 points and Myles Turner added nine in that period for Indiana. The Pacers went on a 13-1 run during the third quarter to take a 70-59 lead. Sabonis, Brogdon and Turner did all the scoring during that stretch for Indiana. “I think for us, all it comes down to is defense and getting stops,"" guard T.J. McConnell said. ""When we’re really connected defensively, like we were tonight, we’re tough to beat.” Jerami Grant, coming off big games against the Lakers and Nets, shot 4 of 17 from the field and scored only nine points for the Pistons. “We’re getting bumped and hit and we didn’t respond in the proper way,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""They played last night. I just didn’t think we had the proper disposition in the second half.” TIP-INS Pacers: Turner had 14 points and eight rebounds. ... Indiana went 14 of 31 from 3-point range and shot 51% overall from the field. ... McConnell had seven points, seven assists and six rebounds. Pistons: Dennis Smith Jr. played his first game for Detroit since being acquired in a trade with the New York Knicks. He scored four points in a reserve role. ... Stewart made his first six shots from the field. ... Blake Griffin scored 16 points. SNAPPED Grant set a franchise record with 23 straight games with at least two 3-pointers.

"Victor Oladipo drives along the baseline and throws down a one-handed dunk while drawing a foul. (0:21) HOUSTON -- — Jimmy Butler had a triple-double with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists and the Miami Heat overcame a slow start to beat the slumping Houston Rockets 101-94 on Thursday night. Miami won its fourth straight and handed Houston its fourth loss in a row. The winning streak comes after the Heat lost seven of their previous eight. “We’re just gaining more and more confidence,"" Butler said. “We know what we’re capable of and we know what we want to do."" Butler had his first triple-double of the season and 10th overall. The Heat came close to having two players with triple-doubles, with Bam Adebayo finishing with 10 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists before fouling out with about a minute left. Miami trailed by 13 in the first half, but used a big run and great defense in the third to take a 12-point lead into the fourth quarter. They remained up by 12 after a dunk by Adebayo before Houston used a 9-0 run to get to 97-94 with less than a minute to go. The Heat missed two shots after that but got the rebound both times, with Butler grabbing the second one. He was fouled and made two free throws with 10 seconds to go and the Heat added two more free throws in the final seconds to secure the win. “It wasn’t a beautiful game by any means... but we found a way to grind it out and get the win,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Miami's last three games have been decided by seven points or fewer. “I’ve seen some great development of mental toughness and grit,"" Spoelstra said. “Unfortunately some of our best games have been losses on the road, but that develops this grit. It doesn’t happen overnight."" John Wall and Eric Gordon led the Rockets with 17 points each. “We just missed a lot of shots and they made shots,"" Wall said. “We just have to do a better job of closing out quarters... and I have to do better as a leader of this team."" Miami pushed the lead to 15 on a 3-pointer by Max Strus with about eight minutes to go before Houston used a 10-3 spurt to get within 88-80 three minutes later. Strus had a career-high 21 points and tied a career mark with five 3s. “I’m happy for Max... he had just as much to do with us winning as I did,"" Butler said, after brushing off talk about his triple-double. A 3-pointer by John Wall got the Rockets within seven not long after that, but Miami scored the next five points to pull away again — 95-83. The Heat used a 12-0 run to take a 70-59 lead in the third quarter and limited the Rockets to just 10 points in the quarter. TIP-INS Heat: The team learned shortly before game time that Tyler Herro would not be available in accordance with the NBA’s health and safety protocols, which would mean he either tested positive, had an inconclusive test or was flagged because contact tracing data suggested that he may have been exposed to someone else positive for COVID-19. The Heat were scheduled to fly to Salt Lake City later Thursday night. It was not immediately clear if Herro would be cleared to fly with his team there, if he would remain behind in Houston, or return to Miami. If Herro is forced to stay behind, it might only mean they didn’t get a new test result back. Rockets: Christian Wood missed his fourth straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... DeMarcus Cousins had 16 points and 11 rebounds.","401267552"
"Steph Curry unloads 40 points, including 30 from 3-point land, as the Warriors defeat the Magic 111-105. (1:41) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Magic coach Steve Clifford made sure he got a pregame moment with Stephen Curry, who is from Charlotte where Clifford used to work and is friends with the superstar's father, Dell. Curry proceeded to go off on Orlando shortly thereafter. Curry knocked down 10 3-pointers on the way to 40 points and also contributed eight rebounds and five assists, leading the Golden State Warriors past the undermanned Magic 111-105 on Thursday night. “I just told him he looks great, he looks quick, he looks healthy, he looks like he’s loving it,” Clifford said. “He’s playing as well or better than he was before.” Curry finished 10 for 19 from deep — even having one taken away by a replay review after the third quarter. The two-time MVP has made at least four 3-pointers in a career-best 13 straight games. “It is routine, which is the crazy part of it. You just come to expect it,” coach Steve Kerr said. ""These 3s that he hits when there’s nothing there offensively and he just uses his dribble to free himself up, not exactly with a ton of space just a few inches of space, then he rises up and you expect every one of them to go in, it’s just crazy."" Orlando was already missing four key players, then lost guard Frank Mason III to a strained right groin early in the game. Draymond Green dished out 11 assists as Golden State returned home with a 2-2 record on their road trip through Texas, splitting two-game sets with both the Mavericks and Spurs — with the two losses by a combined seven points. And how about Curry in the chatter for another MVP? ""How could he not be? He's other-worldly,"" Kerr said. Curry's not worried. “The game speaks for itself,"" he said. ""I really try not to get distracted by that because it kind of taints the moment. If I do my job, I’ll be there at the end of the season.” Golden State attempted a franchise-record 30 3-pointers in the first half and went 20 of 50 from long range overall. Kelly Oubre Jr. hit three 3s and added 17 points with 10 rebounds. Nikola Vucevic had 25 points, 13 rebounds and five assists as the Magic lost a third straight game, seventh in eight and ninth of 11. After going ahead 35-22 on Oubre's 3 at the 10:27 mark of the second, Orlando outscored Golden State 33-12 to lead 55-47 at halftime. Golden State won its eighth straight at home against Orlando dating to a 102-94 loss on Dec. 3, 2012. CURRY'S FLURRY Curry notched the 17th game of his career with 10 or more 3s — most in NBA history — and second this season. Splash Brother Klay Thompson has five and is the only other player with at least five such games. Curry scored 30 or more for the fourth straight game and 13th in all, needing 30 on Saturday against old pal Kevin Durant to match a career-best five-game 30-point streak also done from Feb. 22-March 3, 2016. Curry's 10 3s were one off his season high set in a 134-132 defeat last week at Dallas. Teammates have taken to celebrating before the ball swishes through the net.

Anthony scored a season-high 24 points off the bench, including 16 in the fourth quarter, and the Trail Blazers beat the Sixers 118-114 on Thursday night. “Once Carmelo gets it going, he’s still Carmelo. He reminded us of that tonight,"" Rivers said. Damian Lillard had 30 points in Portland's fourth win in five games. Joel Embiid led the 76ers with 35 points and nine rebounds, and Ben Simmons added 23 points and 11 boards. The loss snapped a four-game road winning streak. The Eastern Conference-leading Sixers had won six of seven, with the only defeat during that span coming a week ago to the Trail Blazers, 121-105. It was just the second loss at home for Philadelphia. “I thought tonight was just one of those games where we felt like we had to win the game,” Anthony said. “I got hot in the fourth quarter and made some shots, got a great rhythm, gave our team a different spark, some momentum, some energy, and we won the game. We know how important this game was for us, going up against the top team in the East.” After a back-and-forth game, the 76ers held the edge going into the final period but Anthony hit three consecutive 3-pointers to give the Blazers a 102-97 lead with 8:28 left. Anthony added a pair of jumpers that made it 108-101. The Sixers came back to narrow the gap to 108-107 on Seth Curry's pull-up jumper and Simmons' layup. Tobias Harris' free throws knotted the game at 109 before Gary Trent Jr.'s 3-pointer put the Blazers back in front. Lillard added a basket to make it 114-109 with 1:15 left. Embiid's pull-up closed the margin, then Curry's 3-pointer tied it at 114 with 22.1 seconds left. Tripped by Harris, Anthony made a pair of free throws with 3.1 seconds remaining. After a timeout, Robert Covington got a deflection and steal on the inbounds play and Lillard made free throws to close it out. “He carried us in the fourth quarter,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said about Anthony. “He really got on a roll and he was vintage Melo. Hitting 3s, hitting some off-balance shots, just in a real rhythm and he provided points when we needed them.” Embiid came in averaging 29.1 points per game, good for fourth in the NBA. He averaged 34.1 points and 10.1 rebounds over the last nine heading into Thursday’s game. Lillard was third in the league, averaging 29.4 points a game. He now has 14 games with 30 or more points this season. The Blazers jumped out to a 20-13 lead, hitting six 3-pointers. But the Sixers tied the game at 28 on Simmons' short jumper and pulled in front on Embiid's dunk. Portland was ahead 37-36 at the end of the opening period. Lillard led the way for the Blazers with 19 points, a season high for a quarter this season. Anfernee Simons' floater gave the Blazers a 58-50 advantage with just under five minute left before halftime.

(0:20) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Terry Rozier scored 41 points and rookie LaMelo Ball had 20 points and 11 rebounds to help the Charlotte Hornets beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 120-114 on Friday night. Charlotte improved to 13-14, opening a five-game homestand with its third victory in four games. Minnesota has lost four straight to fall to 6-20. “Terry deserves a ton of credit for this victory and he was great down the stretch,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “But overall, he kept us going. When we were dry, he kept us going, he was talking in huddles. So even off the floor, he’s showing his leadership and his will to win games.” Cody Zeller added 17 points for Charlotte on 7-of-8 shooting, Gordon Hayward had 14 points on 5-of-21 shooting, and Miles Bridges had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Hayward hit a 3-pointer to put Charlotte ahead 106-100 with 4:27 left. Malik Beasley scored 31 points — 16 in the first period — for Minnesota. Karl Anthony-Towns added 25 in his second game back after missing 13 because of the coronavirus. Anthony Edwards had 21 points for Minnesota in the first matchup between the first and third overall picks in the 2020 NBA draft. Edwards went first, and Ball third. “I thought (Edwards and Anthony-Towns) found a little bit of synergy in terms of that high-angle screen where they’re worried about Karl on the pop and Anthony getting all the way to the rim,” Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said of his two stars playing together for the first time in several games. “It made it a little more open for him, so I thought they did find a little bit of chemistry there, which is something that we need to continue to focus on because games come quick.” Borrego won a challenge on a second-quarter foul called on center Bismack Biyombo. At 5:50 left in the half, Biyombo challenged and appeared to block Edwards’ layup. After the foul call, Biyombo argued the call and was assessed a technical foul. “We just found a way that’s the bottom line,” Borrego said. “We had every excuse in the world not to win this game, but our guys stuck with it and figured out a way to get it done.” McDANIELS BACK Forward Jalen McDaniels rejoined the team from his G-League assignment with Greensboro. Borrego said he hoped to have him for the home game on Sunday against San Antonio. McDaniels missed an opportunity to play against his brother, Timberwolves forward Jaden McDaniels, on Friday. HE'S GOOD Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders has noticed the smooth transition forward Gordon Hayward has made in his first season in Charlotte. And he isn’t surprised by it. “It’s been a seamless fit,” Saunders said before the game. “They’ve done a nice job with the guys around him delivering him the ball as well. They’ve been able to get him in spots where he’s been able to be successful and he’s been doing it for a long time.” Hayward averaged a team-high 22.6 points per game coming into the matchup with Minnesota.

"Russell Westbrook backs down Reggie Bullock and sinks a fadeaway two while getting fouled. (0:16) WASHINGTON -- — Julius Randle had 24 points and a season-high 18 rebounds, and the New York Knicks cruised to a 109-91 victory over the cold-shooting Washington Wizards on Friday night. Derrick Rose scored 14 points in 20 efficient minutes off the bench in his second game for the Knicks, who stopped a two-game skid but lost center Mitchell Robinson to a fractured right hand. “We know how important he is to the team, and any time someone gets hurt, you certainly feel for him,” coach Tom Thibodeau said. “You don’t replace a guy like that individually. You have to do it collectively. And everybody’s got to step up.” Russell Westbrook had 23 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for the Wizards, who lacked a reliable second option with NBA scoring leader Bradley Beal sitting out to rest for the first time this season. Washington had its second-lowest points total of the season and has lost four of five. “Effort is very important. We’ve got to take pride in defending, take pride in protecting our home court, just take individual pride,” Westbrook said. “One thing I'm not going to do is give up or give in to our record or anything else that's going on.” The Knicks dominated inside, with a 58-42 advantage in points in the paint and a 65-46 edge in rebounding. Robinson had 10 points and 14 rebounds, all in the first half, but was injured just before halftime when his hand collided with Randle's elbow while contesting a shot from Rui Hachimura. Robinson will be re-evaluated when the team returns to New York. “It definitely will be tough without him,” Randle said. “He brings so much to the game, especially on the defensive end with his rebounding.” The Wizards shot 38.2% overall and 9 of 34 (26.5%) from 3-point range against the league's best scoring defense. “We're not shooting it great, and that happens, but we cannot let that affect the defensive end,” said Garrison Mathews, who scored 14 points and made four 3-pointers in his first career start. “It's a want-to. It's how hard you want to do it.” Washington got within three points midway through the third quarter, but Randle responded with a 3-pointer and New York bridged the third and fourth quarters with a 14-0 run to put the game away. Westbrook missed a layup to start the fourth quarter, paused under the basket and jogged slowly to the other end as Immanuel Quickley took a pass from Rose and buried a 3-pointer. Rose followed that with a jumper to give the Knicks a 20-point lead. “I've got to match everybody's intensity when I'm out there, play as hard as I can defensively,” said Rose, who was acquired Monday in a trade with Detroit. “Once I do that, everything just falls into place. I'm trying to get everybody's trust on the team by letting them know that if you run, you'll get the ball, and so far it's working.” TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES The game was delayed for about nine minutes between the first and second quarters because of a malfunctioning video replay monitor at the scorers’ table.

(0:23) ATLANTA -- — DeMar DeRozan scored 23 points and the San Antonio Spurs capitalized on a dominant finish to the first half to beat Trae Young and the slumping Atlanta Hawks 125-114 on Friday night. The Spurs opened a seven-game trip with a season-high 77 points in the first half. They have won four of their last five games. “We just wanted to come out and make our stamp on the game early,” point guard Derrick White said. “This is a huge seven games. ...

Young and other Atlanta starters sat out most of the second half after San Antonio stretched its lead to 39. “Our starters weren’t very good,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. “They weren’t good at all. Our second unit did a good job of making the night somewhat decent.” The Hawks have lost five of their last six games. San Antonio led the full game and pulled away with 16 straight points late in the first half. The Spurs outscored the Hawks 41-19 in the second quarter. San Antonio led 57-44 before starting the 16-0 run. Murray sank a 3-pointer and another jumper, and rookie Devin Vassell added a 3. The Spurs led 77-48 at the break after scoring their most points in any half this season. Their previous high mark for points in a first half was 66 in a 131-119 win at Memphis on Dec. 23. The 77 points are the most allowed by Atlanta in a first half this season. “We laid an egg defensively with our effort and our energy,” Pierce said. The Spurs continued their hot shooting to open the second half. A 3-pointer and another basket by Johnson stretched the lead to 82-48. After San Antonio took its big lead at 100-61 with 5:40 remaining in the third period, Pierce called a timeout and pulled all his starters. Backups played the remainder of the game. The Spurs seemed to lose their shooting touch against Atlanta's backups. After making 65.5% of their shots from the field while building the 100-61 lead, the Spurs finished at 52.9% for the game.

"Celtics rookie Payton Pritchard comes off the bench and scores 18 of his 20 points from beyond the arc in a win for the Celtics over the Raptors. (1:17) BOSTON -- — The Celtics didn’t play the way they wanted to on either end of the floor during their recent West Coast trip. Back at home, they got sparks from two unlikely sources to tame one of the league’s hottest teams. Semi Ojeleye had a career-high 24 points and six 3-pointers, and the Boston Celtics rolled to a 120-106 win over the Toronto Raptors on Thursday night. Rookie Payton Pritchard added 20 points and had a career-high six 3s to help Boston snap a two-game skid. The Celtics never trailed and led by as many as 19, thanks in part to a season-high 20 3-pointers. Ojeleye said he feels like he’s playing a lot freer offensively this season. “I really try to focus on the process on the shooting and not the result,” OJeleye said. Leading scorers Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown deferred to their teammates from the outset as they drew attention from Toronto's defenders. “(They're) able to impact the game whether they’re scoring or not,” Ojeleye said. “They took everybody with them.” Kyle Lowry led the Raptors with 24 points and six assists. Pascal Siakam finished with 23 points for Toronto, which was coming off a win at Washington a night earlier. Toronto cut what had been a 15-point deficit to 98-93 with 6:21 remaining. But the Celtics used a 15-5 run to take control down the stretch. The Raptors played without OG Anunoby (left calf strain) for the ninth straight game but still managed to dominate in the paint, where they outscored the Celtics 58-32. But Boston’s second unit was strong throughout and, led by Pritchard, outscored its bench counterparts 38-31. As well as Boston played on the offensive end, it also did a good job defensively, holding the Raptors without a second-chance point. The Celtics had assists on 30 of their 39 field goals. “If we can play this way and we can just continue to share and build some habits. … I think that will help us,” coach Brad Stevens said. In Toronto's prior loss, last week at Atlanta, the Raptors also allowed their opponent to shoot more than 50% from 3-point range. The Raptors finished their trip at 4-2 but missed out on a chance to get back to .500 following a 2-8 start to the season. “I feel pretty good. Trending upward, playing really good basketball,” coach Nick Nurse said. “We weathered some storms and came back. … We’ve got a lot of room for improvement. We’ve got some time to get better.” TIP-INS Raptors: Yuka Watanabe (left ankle sprain) sat for the second consecutive night. Nurse said he anticipates both Anunoby and Watanabe returning Sunday against Detroit. Celtics: Ojeleye and Pritchard are the first pair in Celtics franchise history to make at least six 3-pointers in the same game. ... Marcus Smart missed his sixth straight game with a left calf tear. EARLY ACTION Toronto cut an early 11-point deficit to a point early in the second quarter but struggled to keep pace with Boston’s 3-point shooting. The Celtics connected on 12 of 20 attempts from beyond the arc in the half. Tatum and Brown combined for just two points in the first quarter. They remained active in the offense, though, assisting on eight of Boston’s 12 field goals in the period. That helped the Celtics sprint out to a 15-4 lead and take a 34-29 edge into the second quarter. ELITE COMPANY Pritchard is the third Celtics player since the 2000-2001 season to produce at least 20 points, six 3-pointers and five rebounds off the bench. He’s the first Celtics reserve to accomplish that feat since Rasheed Wallace (Nov. 11, 2009).","401267558"
"Luka Doncic takes advantage of a mismatch and sinks a midrange shot over Willy Hernangomez. (0:34) DALLAS -- — Luka Doncic couldn't miss from 3-point range during a brief, sizzling stretch in the third quarter — the same way Zion Williamson was perfect the entire first half. Dallas was just a little bit hotter overall. Doncic scored a career-high 46 points, Kristaps Porzingis added 36 and the Mavericks overcame Williamson's career-best 36 points in a 143-130 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. Doncic, who also had 12 assists and eight rebounds, connected on three of four Dallas 3-pointers in just 93 seconds as the Mavericks made 13 of their first 15 shots in the third quarter. The Mavericks matched their season best with a fourth consecutive victory and beat the Pelicans for the fifth straight time. Williamson set a New Orleans franchise record by making all 10 of his shots in the first half — including rim-rattling dunks on consecutive possessions — and finished 14 of 15. His only miss was a wide-open 3 early in the second half. “Luka was phenomenal. (Porzingis) was phenomenal,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “Williamson was ridiculous. I mean, unbelievable, what he can do on the basketball floor. The ESPN crowd got a real treat tonight in terms of entertainment. But it was a pillow fight on defense.” Brandon Ingram scored 30 for the Pelicans in what was supposed to be the second meeting with Dallas this season. The first, scheduled for Jan. 11, was postponed because of COVID-19 issues. The Pelicans gave up a franchise-record 25 3-pointers for the second consecutive game. Chicago made 25 in its 129-116 victory two nights earlier. New Orleans shot better than 50% (53%) for a sixth consecutive game, but gave up 58% shooting while allowing their most points since a 147-140 loss to Golden State in January 2019. “It's because we're playing abhorrent defense,” coach Stan Van Gundy said. “Our defense is ridiculous. We tried everything tonight. Two games in a row like this is inexcusable for me as a coach and for the players it's inexcusable.” Porzingis, who finished three points shy of his most since coming to Dallas in the blockbuster trade with New York in 2019, set a career high for any half with six 3-pointers before halftime. Four of them came in the first five-plus minutes. The 7-foot-3 Latvian was 8 of 13 from long range as Dallas shot 56% (25 of 45) from beyond the arc after coming in second-to-last in the NBA in 3-point percentage. “Tonight was one of those games where things were just clicking for both of us,” Porzingis said. “He was finding me open on the 3-point line. It gives both of us energy and just builds the momentum for both of us and the team.” Doncic, who tied his career high of 42 in a recent scoring showdown with Golden State star Stephen Curry, was 17 of 30 from the field, including 5 of 8 from 3, and went 7 of 9 on free throws. The Slovenian sensation, the third overall pick in the 2018 draft, has won both meetings with Williamson, the top choice from a year later. “Sometimes the trust can be there and a team just hits tough shots,” Williamson said. “I think Luka went on a run there where he hit like four or five tough, contested 3-pointers. There's not really a defensive scheme you can do there. That's just a great player hitting tough shots.” Josh Richardson, who had 11 points and six rebounds, hit the other 3 for Dallas' first double-digit lead during Doncic's hot streak from beyond the arc in the third quarter. The Mavericks were up 108-104 early in the fourth when a dunk from Willie Cauley-Stein started a 15-4 run for a 123-108 lead. Tim Hardaway Jr. finished it with a 3-pointer. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans lost a second straight game coming off a four-game winning streak, the longest of the season. ... Eric Bledsoe made all four of his 3-point attempts and scored 16 points. ... Lonzo Ball had 12 points and seven assists. Mavericks: Dallas finished above 50% shooting for the third consecutive game while improving to 7-0 when scoring at least 120 points. ... Dorian Finney-Smith scored 14 points on 4-of-5 shooting from long range. MORE HISTORY FOR DONCIC Doncic tied a franchise record shared by Mark Aguirre (1983-84) and Dirk Nowitzki (2005-06) with his 13th consecutive game of at least 25 points. The 21-year-old has at least 10 assists in all seven of his career 40-point games. That’s the most such games to start a career in NBA history.","401267559"
"Kawhi Leonard cruises to the bucket for a one-handed dunk. (0:20) CHICAGO -- — Kawhi Leonard got rolling in the third quarter, and Marcus Morris and Lou Williams took over in the fourth. It all added up to another win for the Clippers. Leonard scored 33 points, Morris added 20, Williams scored 17 and Los Angeles beat the Chicago Bulls 125-106 on Friday night. Leonard finished three points shy of a season high set two nights earlier at Minnesota. He scored 16 points in the third quarter to help Los Angeles stretch a four-point lead to 12. “Kawhi, when he gets it going, it's hard to stop him,” teammate Ivica Zubac said. “He's hitting those contested shots like there's no defense. He gets the ball so high. It seems like defense doesn't affect him. When he gets it going, we're a tough team to beat.” Morris scored 15 points in the fourth, hitting five 3-pointers, and finished 6 of 8 from beyond the arc. Williams added 11 points in the final quarter, and the Clippers won their second straight after losing two in a row. The Bulls cooled off after setting a franchise-record with 25 3-pointers in a win over New Orleans on Wednesday, making 12 of 32. Zach LaVine, coming off a season-high 46-point outing, scored 26. He also had nine rebounds and six assists. Coby White and Tomas Satoransky added 17 points apiece, but coach Billy Donovan noticed too many quick possessions. That in turn took a toll on the defense, and the Bulls fell to 4-9 at the United Center. “They were quick possessions,"" Donovan said. “It was like no pass, one pass, shot. And if you don't make those shots, you're back having to guard again instead of maybe getting to the free-throw line, slowing the game down, getting physicality into the game defensively."" The Clippers led by eight late in the third after Zubac hit two free throws. Leonard nailed a 3 in the closing minute and added a free throw with a second left to make it 90-78. Los Angeles outscored Chicago 35-28 in the fourth, with Williams and Morris combining for nearly as many points as the Bulls. Williams, coming off a 27-point outing, scored 11 of his team's first 13 points in the quarter. He made back-to-back layups to push the lead to 103-86. Morris hit a 3 to make it 109-90 with seven minutes remaining. “We've got to be if not the best bench in the league — both of us are proven vets and proven scorers in this league,” Morris said. “I think it's just our camaraderie. Being really good friends, that helps us on the court, not just scoring (but) being vets, being able to talk, being able to lead the team, being able to lead our unit."" STILL A THRILL Even in his 16th season, Williams still gets a kick out of playing in Chicago. He posted a video on Instagram showing the Bulls' banners and Michael Jordan's retired number 23 and Pippen's 33. “I'm still kind of in awe of some of the things that I've been able to experience throughout the game of basketball,"" he said. “To be in Michael Jordan's house, that never gets old to me.” TIP-INS Clippers: Paul George missed his fourth consecutive game with a swollen right toe. Coach Tyronn Lue said they texted Friday and the six-time All-Star is “in a good place, good spirits.” George is second on the team in scoring at 24.4 points per game. ... Chicago product Patrick Beverley had six points in about 12 minutes in his second game back after missing eight in a row with a right knee injury. Bulls: F Otto Porter Jr. missed his sixth straight game with recurring back spasms.","401267560"
"Jamal Murray throws up a half court shot before the end of the third and Hamidou Diallo intervenes in a very costly way. (0:30) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic finished an assist shy of a triple-double, scoring 22 points and grabbing 13 rebounds to help the Denver Nuggets rally for a 97-95 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. Jamal Murray also scored 22 points and Michael Porter Jr. finished with 15 for Denver, which trailed most of the game before winning its second straight. “There’s no such thing as an ugly win,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “I’d much rather be 14-11 than 13-12 with the Lakers coming to town on Sunday.” The Thunder were coming off two overtime losses to the Lakers in Los Angeles despite being shorthanded. Oklahoma City had just eight players available Wednesday and only nine Friday night. “There’s going to be nights like that. The main thing you want to focus on is the way you compete,” Kenrich Williams said. “The past three games, although we didn’t win...I’m proud of the way we competed.” Justin Jackson led Oklahoma City with 20 points off the bench, and Al Horford and Hamidou Diallo had 16 each. The Thunder led by as many as 19 in the first half. After Denver cut it to nine early in the third quarter, Oklahoma City built a 15-point advantage. Every time the Nuggets made a run, Oklahoma City had an answer — until the final minutes. “We weren’t having the same pace as we were earlier,” Horford said. “They really locked down defensively and made it tough for us.” Porter sparked a 13-4 run to get Denver within 70-64 late in third quarter, but Jackson’s 3-pointer got the lead back to 12. The Nuggets made a big push in the fourth with Jokic on the bench, scoring seven straight to cut the deficit to three. Denver had a chance to tie or take the lead, but turned it over and Oklahoma City scored the next six to go ahead 89-81 with 4:28 left. The Nuggets scored the next 12 points, taking their first lead on Jokic’s jumper in the lane with 1:21 left. Will Barton hit a 3-pointer and Denver sealed it at the line. “The team who wants it more is probably going to win the game,” Jokic said. “Will made a big 3, I made a mid-range. We made the plays at the end.” TIP-INS Thunder: G Shai Gilgeous-Alexander missed his second straight game with a knee injury. He has missed four of the last six. ... Oklahoma City is 7-7 on the road. Nuggets: Guards Gary Harris (adductor strain) and P.J. Dozier (hamstring) will be on the upcoming four-game road trip that starts in Boston on Tuesday. Both have missed multiple games with their injuries. ... Denver did not attempt a free throw in the first half. HEAVE, OH! The Nuggets were gifted three points at the end of the third quarter thanks to Hamidou Diallo. After Jackson hit a 3-pointer with 2.7 seconds left in the period Murray, launched an off-balance shot from near half court. It banked off the glass and Diallo tipped it as it bounced on the rim and was called for basket interference. “Hami I’m sure would love that play back,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “I challenged a play earlier in the game and that is a play had I had my challenge I would’ve challenged it.” Malone wasn’t apologizing for the gift. “Sometimes you need the breaks to go your way and that was definitely one that went in our favor,” he said.","401267561"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo is high on the Jazz after Utah improved its record to 21-5 with a win vs. the Bucks. (1:36) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Utah Jazz say they don’t care who scores as long as they keep winning. Sure looked that way Friday night. Rudy Gobert had 27 points and 12 rebounds, and the Jazz beat the Milwaukee Bucks 129-115 for their sixth straight victory. Joe Ingles tied his career high with 27 points as Utah won for the 17th time in 18 games to improve to an NBA-best 21-5. Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points, and Jordan Clarkson had 25. Ingles, who had a hand in the Jazz's first 14 points with four 3-pointers and a pass to Gobert for a thunderous dunk over Giannis Antetokounmpo, joked about Utah’s team-oriented approach. “Obviously, Donovan finally let me get a couple shots early tonight, which he usually doesn’t, because he’s so selfish,” Ingles cracked. But Mitchell was serious about Ingles' effect on the game. “Joe getting hot … and Rudy getting in there finishing the dunk like that – that’s the tone we want to set from the beginning,” Mitchell said. Antetokounmpo scored 27 of his 29 points in the second half, but Milwaukee dropped its second straight game after a five-game win streak. Brook Lopez had 23 points, and Khris Middleton finished with 18. Antetokounmpo said he noticed how much the Jazz are enjoying their time together this season. “It just looks fun. When I watch them play, it looks fun, it looks easy, it looks simple,” he said. On the other hand, the reigning NBA MVP said the Bucks need to “know our roles. We got to know what we’re about. Visually, we got to stay in our lanes. Do what you do. Be a star in your role.” The Jazz led by as many as 21 when Mitchell fed Derrick Favors for an alley-oop layup to make it 89-68 with 3:39 left in the third quarter. Mitchell’s 3 sparked a 14-5 run to end the first half, and the Bucks never got the deficit within single digits again. “When we want to play the right way, no one cares who scores, and no one knows who’s going to score in a given possession,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. The Bucks had scored at least 120 points in a franchise-record six straight games, but they often looked out of sync against the Jazz’s multiple defensive looks. “They’re a good defensive team. They make things hard on you,” Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. “The key against a good defense: If you do get clean looks, you got to make more of those.” Antetokounmpo, guarded primarily by Royce O’Neale at 6-foot-6, scored only two points in the first half after finishing with a season-high 47 on Wednesday against Phoenix. That’s the fewest he’s had in a half since last season at Utah. “Obviously, I wanted to be more aggressive in the first half, but it wasn’t there,” Antetokounmpo said. THIS TIME AROUND Utah knocked down a franchise-record 25 3-pointers in a 131-118 victory at Milwaukee on Jan. 8. This time, the Jazz got a lot of their points by driving to the basket and getting to the line. They went 14 for 38 from beyond the arc and 29 for 34 at the free-throw line. “We can score in different ways,” Gobert said. “It’s really, really tough to guard when a team has so many guys that can score and shoot the ball like that.” WORTH NOTING Bill Kennedy and Brian Forte were the only two officials on the court. Jonathan Sterling was unavailable because of COVID-19 protocols. TIP-INS Bucks: Jrue Holiday sat out his third game in a row due to the NBA’s health and safety protocols for COVID-19. ...

"LeBron James has been warned by the NBA for violating the league's anti-flopping rule with this move vs. the Grizzlies. (0:18) LOS ANGELES -- — Anthony Davis scored 35 points and LeBron James had 28 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in the Los Angeles Lakers' seventh consecutive victory, 115-105 over the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night. Kyle Kuzma had 20 points and 10 rebounds for the defending NBA champions, while Davis finished two points shy of his season high in his return from a two-game absence with an Achilles injury. Montrezl Harrell scored 14 points for Los Angeles, which extended its longest win streak in a year even after falling behind by 20 points in the first quarter. The Lakers also fell behind by 20 two nights ago before rallying to beat Oklahoma City, making them the third NBA team in the past two decades to win back-to-back games after falling behind by 20 in each contest. “There's a little frustration,"" Kuzma said. ""We should never be down 20 points at any point in time with the personnel that we have on our team. ... But we’ve been through the fire, and we know how to walk people down. We've been having to walk people down a little too much lately.” The Lakers took their first lead late in the third quarter while James scored 13 points in the period. They took control early in the fourth and wrapped up a perfect five-game homestand — even managing to avoid tying an NBA record by playing a fourth consecutive overtime game. Grayson Allen scored 23 points and Ja Morant had 22 points and 10 assists in the Grizzlies' fifth loss in six games. Memphis had just nine players in uniform. “We definitely miss the guys that are out right now,” said Allen, who hit six 3-pointers. “We know they add a lot to our team, but I feel like the nine guys we had available for tonight did a great job of fighting. I don’t think there was any letdown or any factor of fatigue.” Jonas Valanciunas had 22 points and eight rebounds for the Grizzlies, who hit 12 3-pointers after making a franchise-record 23 against Charlotte two nights earlier. “Very proud of our effort tonight,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “They turned it on in the third quarter. I thought we tried, but for the most part, really proud.” TIP-INS Grizzlies: Desmond Bane missed his first game of the season for personal reasons after scoring a career-high 18 points Wednesday.

Asked to gauge his level of concern with the Lakers' slow starts, Vogel said he's “not there yet.” “We don’t want to lose any of these games,” Vogel said. “The big picture is to build habits that are going to win for us in the playoffs.”","401267563"
"Carmelo Anthony caps off a 16-point first half with a buzzer-beater before the break. (0:49) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Gary Trent Jr. had 26 points and the Portland Trail Blazers handed the Cleveland Cavaliers their sixth straight loss with a 129-110 victory Friday night. Carmelo Anthony added 23 points and Enes Kanter had 21 points and 13 rebounds for the Blazers, who have won five of their last six games. Portland led by as many as 30 points in dominating the Cavaliers. “We're staying locked in, trying to get as many wins as we can,” Trent said. Collin Sexton had 25 points for Cleveland, which has lost eight of its last nine and tumbled to third-to-last in the Eastern Conference. Cleveland was routed 133-95 by the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night, a loss coach J.B. Bickerstaff called “embarrassing.” The game against the Blazers was the second of a five-game road trip. “I mean, obviously, we're going through a rough patch at a tough time against very good teams,” Bickerstaff said after the loss in Portland. The Blazers were playing the second of a back-to-back, following a 118-114 victory over Eastern Conference leader Philadelphia. Jarrett Allen had started the last two games for Cleveland in place of Larry Nance Jr., who is out with a fractured left hand. But Taurean Prince started against the Blazers. Allen finished with 22 points off the bench. Portland jumped out to a 22-4 lead at the start, but the Cavaliers closed the gap to 34-23 by the end of the opening quarter. The Blazers took a 65-45 lead on Anfernee Simons' 3-pointer late in the first half. Anthony, who has been hot the past two games, hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer that put Portland up 73-52 at the break. He led all scorers with 16 points off the bench. Trent made a 3-pointer that gave the Blazers an 85-61 lead and the rout was on. He finished the game with four 3s. Trent has been getting more playing time in the absence of CJ McCollum, who is out with a fractured bone in his left foot. Trent said he's also learning from Damian Lillard, as well as Anthony. “Everything I'm doing now I've just been working on in the shadows,” Trent said. “Now I'm having the opportunity to put it in play, to actually go through it, try moves and different stuff that I've been working on.” The Blazers lost Rodney Hood for the final quarter because of left foot soreness. Lillard, who was averaged 29.4 points a game, third best in the NBA, finished with 20 points before resting the final quarter. The Blazers finished their homestand 3-0. TIP INS Cavaliers: Kevin Love is traveling with the Cavaliers, but is still recovering from a calf strain and isn't quite ready to join the team. “He’s making steps in the right direction. I would expect an update within the next week or so, but he’s headed in the right direction,” Bickerstaff said at shootaround. Trail Blazers: Last year, the Blazers dropped their lone game against the Cavaliers. ... Portland hit nearly 60% from the floor in the first half. The 21-point halftime lead was the Blazers' largest of the season. GRABBING THOSE OFFENSIVE BOARDS Of his 13 boards, Kanter had seven offensive rebounds. “It's a special talent,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “He has a nose for the ball. He's got great hands. He's persistent. It's just a remarkable skill."" Kanter has 14 double-doubles this season. WHERE THERE'S A WILL Andre Drummond, who finished with eight points, was asked after the game how the Cavaliers can recapture the success they had early in the season. “We just have to find the will, the will to do it,” Drummond said. “We're playing really good teams right now, playoff teams, championship-contending teams. This is a great test for us as a young team to go against these teams and see where we are. Obviously we have a lot of work to do.”","401267564"
"Michael Carter-Williams sneaks a no-look pass to Khem Birch and Birch slams it home. (0:17) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Nikola Vucevic’s latest shooting display had teammates calling the Orlando big man All-Star worthy. Michael Carter-Williams isn’t likely to come up in similar discussions, but his return to a depleted Magic lineup might have been equally as important. Vucevic scored 42 points and matched his career high of six 3-pointers as slumping Orlando beat the Sacramento Kings 123-112 on Friday night. “He made the big passes, the big plays,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""He’s playing at an incredibly high level every night. He gets special attention, but he’s scoring inside and then he’s shooting the ball so well from the 3. I just think it’s where he is, his approach, his demeanor. He wants us to turn this around and he’s willing to take responsibility for that.” With Carter-Williams running the offense and sparking Orlando’s inside game, Vucevic’s shooting beyond the arc helped carry the perimeter attack. The 6-foot-11 big man made three 3s in the first half, two in the third quarter and added a sixth early in the fourth to put the Magic ahead 105-91. Vucevic shot 17 of 22 and grabbed nine rebounds. Orlando hit 15 3-pointers overall. “He’s definitely elevated his game,” Carter-Williams said. “He’s always been an unbelievable passer out of the post. Him working on the 3 this year, extending his range … he’s clearly an All-Star. To me, he’s one of the best big men in the league.” Vucevic sounded more satisfied with how Orlando played on the second half of a back-to-back after losing at Golden State on Thursday night. “Very proud of everyone. We brought it tonight,” Vucevic said. “Obviously, (the Kings) missed two important players so we knew we would have a good chance if we played well. We started off well and kept it up the whole game. Big win.” Carter-Williams returned for the Magic after missing more than five weeks and scored 15 of his season-best 21 points in the third quarter. Playing for the first time since a sprained left foot sidelined him for 18 games, Carter-Williams had an uneven shooting night but made up for it by repeatedly driving through the paint and getting to the rim. He also had seven assists and seven rebounds. “I’m always ready to go play the point,” Carter-Williams said. “I’ve been doing it all my life. I’m always staying sharp in those areas for moments like this. I was itching to get back on the court. I miss playing the game.” Terrence Ross added 18 points for the Magic, who won for the fourth time in 19 games. Hassan Whiteside had 18 points and seven rebounds for the Kings, who had won seven of nine. “They just physically pushed us around tonight,” Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. “They took it to us. The (21) points off (18) turnovers killed us.” Both teams were missing key players. Sacramento played without injured starters De’Aaron Fox and Marvin Bagley III. Orlando, already without Markelle Fultz for the remainder of the season, added Frank Mason to a long list of injured players that includes Evan Fournier, Al-Farouq Aminu and Aaron Gordon. Walton was so frustrated with his team that he pulled his entire starting five off the floor with a mass substitution four minutes into the third quarter while the Magic were in the midst of a 19-3 run. Vucevic dominated the low paint and had 21 points in the first half. He scored 16 in the first quarter, made 10 of his first 13 shots and had a pair of 3s to help put Orlando ahead 64-59. TIP-INS Magic: Clifford is 7-3 on coach’s challenges this season after losing one early in the third quarter.

"Devin Booker eyes a deep triple from the logo as the Suns defeat the 76ers 120-111. (0:19) PHOENIX -- — Devin Booker lost plenty of games in his first five NBA seasons. That's part of what makes these past few weeks even more sweet. Booker scored 36 points, Chris Paul added 18 points and 10 assists and the rising Phoenix Suns beat the Philadelphia 76ers 120-111 on Saturday for their fifth straight victory. “It's so nice, man,” Booker said. “We’re deep. I feel like we’re 15 deep. Everyone can play and everyone’s ready to go.” The Suns have won eight of their past nine games and improved to 16-9. They got a big game from their bench against Philadelphia, especially from Dario Saric, who scored 15 points in his first game back after missing 13 straight. Saric missed about a month because he was in the league's COVID-19 health and safety protocol and also dealt with a sore ankle. “Now to be finally back, play with this group of guys who are really talented and positive minded, it’s just a pleasure,” Saric said. Joel Embiid had 35 points on 12-of-23 shooting for the Sixers, who have lost two in a row but still hold the top spot in the Eastern Conference at 18-9. Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris both added 18 points. The game was tied 53-all at halftime after a tight second quarter when there were nine lead changes and five ties. Booker took control in the third quarter, when he scored 16 points to give Phoenix an 86-81 lead going into the fourth. Saric and Jae Crowder each hit 3-pointers to open the fourth quarter and extend the Suns' lead to 92-81. The closest the Sixers would get was 102-97 after Embiid's bucket with 5 1/2 minutes remaining. The Suns had an 11-2 run which gave them a 113-99 lead with 3:15 left to close out the win. The 76ers' offense wasn't great down the stretch but the real problem was defense. Phoenix shot 60.8% from the field and got 49 points from the bench. “We know we’re not going to stop teams every possession, teams are going to score, but we’ve got to make it tough,” Simmons said. Booker has scored 30-plus points in each of the last three games overall and has scored 30-plus in each of his last seven games against Philadelphia. That is the longest streak ever by a Suns player against a single opponent. “More than anything, Devin will take the wins over stats every time and that’s what I love about him,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “He and I are growing with our relationship and communication. He’s just scratching the surface.” TIP-INS 76ers: The Sixers fell to 7-7 on the road. … Embiid extended his streak of scoring at least 25 points to 11 games. That puts him alongside the Hall of Fame trio of Wilt Chamberlain, Allen Iverson and Charles Barkley as the only players in franchise history to accomplish the feat. He has scored at least 33 points in nine of those 11 contests. … Mike Scott returned to the lineup after missing 18 of the last 19 games with a knee injury. The forward was scoreless in 11 minutes … Shake Milton sat out with a left ankle injury. Suns: The Suns are 9-4 on their home court. … Cameron Payne returned to action after missing 10 straight games. Payne, who had a foot injury, played 15 minutes and scored four points. BENCH BOOST Saric wasn’t the only Suns reserve who produced. E’Twaun Moore had 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting, Cam Johnson had nine points and Crowder added eight points and four rebounds. The bench combined to make 19 of its 29 shots. “Our bench came in and gave us unreal production,” Williams said.","401267566"
"John Collins tried to go in for a two-handed slam, but instead causes the ball to get stuck before it could go into the basket. (0:23) ATLANTA -- — Doug McDermott scored 26 points, Myles Turner had 19 points and 10 rebounds, and the Indiana Pacers won their second straight game with a 125-113 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. The Hawks blew a nine-point lead in the fourth quarter as Indiana scored 41 points in the final period and used a 27-7 run to take control of the game. It marked the first time this season that the Pacers have scored 40 or more points in a quarter. Aaron Holiday was the spark with the outcome on the line, scoring 13 of his 18 points in the fourth. “We just stuck with it,"" Holiday said. “In the first half, they crept back into the game right before the half ended. We wanted to pick up the pace, move the ball on offense and lock in on defense."" Atlanta, a loser in six of its last seven, got 24 points and 10 rebounds from Clint Capela. Trae Young had 15 points and 14 assists but didn’t attempt a 3-pointer for just the second time in his career. “I think (coach Nate Bjorkgren) has really put a huge emphasis on it,"" McDermott said. “We know where every guy shoots going into the game. He really wants us to flush them off the line."" The Hawks took a 73-72 lead on Young’s floater with 8:10 left in the third. A pair of free throws by John Collins matched Atlanta’s biggest lead at the time at eight at the 3:37 mark, and the Hawks were up 87-84 entering the fourth. It didn’t last long. Leading by nine after a pair of free throws by Cam Reddish, the Hawks were outscored by 20 points before McDermott hit a pair of free throws with 3:03 remaining. “I think three of the plays Aaron Holiday made were containment plays,"" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. “Three of the 3s that were given up were tough shots. How do you take away Aaron Holiday’s 3-point shot over Cam? How do you get to Myles Turner a little bit quicker on his catch and shoot? How do you get to his body earlier so he doesn’t have that look? Obviously they all went in, so it looks and feels a lot worse."" JaKarr Sampson’s runner gave Indiana its first double-digit lead midway through the second. The Hawks trimmed the lead to one on Capela’s layup before the Pacers were up 62-58 at halftime. TIP-INS Pacers: Each of the starters came over to give Hawks assistant Nate McMillan, their former head coach, a hug a few seconds before tipoff.

LOOKING FOR A ROLE Pierce said rookie forward Onyeka Okongwu, the No. 6 overall draft pick, is progressing slowly after the cancellation of the NBA Summer League and a left foot injury that delayed his debut until last month. Okongwu, who did not play against the Pacers, is still trying to carve out a role. “We’re not throwing him out there to be a rotational player right now,” Pierce said. “We’re throwing him out there mainly because we need a body and it does give him an opportunity to get his feet wet some.”","401267567"
"Danuel House Jr. denies Alec Burks with an emphatic block. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — Julius Randle and rookie Immanuel Quickley each scored 22 points and the New York Knicks sent the Houston Rockets to a season-high fifth straight loss with a 121-99 victory Saturday night. Derrick Rose added 16 points for the Knicks, who had no problem in their first game after losing starting center Mitchell Robinson to a broken right hand Friday night in a victory at Washington. Their defense remained sturdy and they put six players in double figures while shooting 52% from the field. “Played the right way tonight and we’ve been doing that pretty much all season,” said Nerlens Noel, who started in place of Robinson. “So, games like these when you have to make the extra pass, guys been doing that.” John Wall scored 26 points and Eric Gordon had 24 for the Rockets, who are 0-5 since Christian Wood sprained his right ankle and also played without Victor Oladipo because of a sprained right foot. They had been limited to just 98.8 points per game during the previous four losses and things didn’t get any easier against the team that is allowing the fewest points per game in the NBA. “I thought the unselfishness was important and then we had a number of guys just step up and make shots,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “But overall, the defense I thought was very, very good and so we have to count on that.” Houston was 8 for 43 (18.6%) from 3-point range and fell to 0-5 this season when being held below 100 points. “It is a deflating thing when you have shots that you feel like you should make and there’s a lot of pressure being put on you on the defensive end,” Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “You feel like you need to make those shots and then having that, like, tension going along with needing to make those isn’t a good recipe for making shots.” An 11-2 surge in the opening minutes of the second quarter extended the Knicks' three-point lead to 41-29, and New York took a 63-47 advantage to the half after Randle beat the buzzer with a jumper. The Rockets went just 2 for 18 from 3-point range in the first half. “We’re just not getting it done,” Gordon said. Wall was the catalyst during a good stretch that helped Houston cut an 18-point deficit to 79-74, but Quickley hit a pair of 3-pointers in the final 1:48 as the Knicks had it back up to 87-75 going to the fourth. TIP-INS Rockets: Silas said Oladipo is traveling with the Rockets on their three-game road trip, but had no clarity on a possible return for the guard. ... Ray Spalding scored two points in his Rockets' debut after being called up from the Rockets' NBA G League affiliate Friday and signed to a two-way contract. Knicks: Noel had 10 points on 5-for-6 shooting. ... The Knicks said Robinson was evaluated by their medical staff Saturday and surgery was recommended. He will have a surgical consultation early next week before a further update. He watched the game from the bench with his hand heavily wrapped. TUCKER'S TOUGHNESS Listed as questionable before the game with a bruised left thigh, P.J. Tucker started for the Rockets and has played in 267 consecutive games. The forward has played more games than anyone in the league dating to the 2012-13 season. “To have the steadiness, the professionalism, I mean the grit, the toughness, all of those things wrapped up in one P.J., it means a lot to have a guy who’s not going to miss a game based on maybe a little injury,” Silas said. “But some of it is luck as well. He just doesn’t get hurt like some guys.”","401267568"
"Kevin Durant walks into the Chase Center as he prepares to face his former team, the Warriors, for the first time since he left. (0:22) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Kevin Durant offered hugs and handshakes all around, then left a winner in his reunion with the Warriors. Durant did a bit of everything in his first trip back to the Bay Area to play the team he helped capture two championships over three years, scoring 20 points in the Brooklyn Nets' 134-117 victory against Golden State on Saturday night. “My time here at Golden State was so much fun,” Durant said. “It was such a big learning experience, especially learning the game of basketball, a different philosophy. I'm going to take that with me for the rest of my life.” The NBA Finals MVP during both title runs, Durant missed his initial three shots before making a 3-pointer at the 5:49 mark of the first quarter and finished 8 for 19 from the floor and 1 of 6 on 3s. Pal Stephen Curry didn't have his best stroke either, going 10 of 17 for 27 points and 2 for 9 from deep as cold-shooting Golden State lost its third straight to the Nets and missed a chance at its first three-game winning streak of the season. Golden State paid video tribute with “Welcome back KD!” during a first-quarter timeout and plans to so again during his next visit to Chase Center when fans have returned. “This is something that is such a no-brainer. When Kevin came here and gave us three years of just incredible basketball the least we could do is welcome him back with open arms,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “... A guy that gave everything to us for three years then left with a devastating injury. There should be a lot of love, he did so much for us.” The Nets had lost three of four but welcomed back Durant after he missed the past three games under COVID-19 quarantine protocols. The Warriors saw ex-Houston nemesis James Harden in a Nets uniform for the first time, and he dished out 16 assists to go with 19 points, including five 3s, and eight rebounds. Kyrie Irving scored 23 points as Brooklyn snapped a seven-game losing streak on the Warriors' home floor in its first visit to Chase Center. “The tribute video was cool. I think about those moments daily. Every single moment that I've had in this league I think about it and try to analyze it and get better from it,"" Durant said. Durant walked onto the court for pregame warmups and greeted all his friends. He and Curry were concentrating on their warmup routines until the two-time MVP stopped to say hello as Durant stretched on his back at midcourt. “I think it does mean something to him but he hasn’t showed it, we haven’t talked about it,” said Nets coach Steve Nash, who worked closely with Durant during his Bay Area stint as a Warriors player development consultant. “If there’s ever a comeback game that is less than what it may have been in the normal situation, it’s this one.” Durant returned from missing last season following surgery for a torn right Achilles tendon he hurt in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals with the Warriors. It’s the same injury Klay Thompson is sidelined with now — and Durant has been in regular touch with Thompson, who watched from the sideline Saturday. “Can't wait to see him back out there,” Durant said. The Warriors shot 4 for 20 on 3-pointers in the first half, 1 of 7 by Curry, and trailed 66-51 at the break. Curry struggled by his standards coming off a 40-point performance two nights earlier against Orlando in which he made 10 3-pointers. The Warriors lost 125-99 at Brooklyn to open the season Dec. 22, but “we're a totally different team,” Kent Bazemore said. So were the new-look Nets. “James Harden's kind of a big deal,” Kerr said. TIP-INS Nets: The Nets made their first visit to second-year Chase Center having been scheduled to play here during the arena’s first season March 12 last year but the game was canceled near the start of the pandemic. ... Brooklyn won three in a row against Golden State for the first time since March 9, 2011 through March 30, 2012. ... The Nets earned their first road win at Golden State since a 102-100 victory on March 30, 2012. Warriors: Draymond Green “tweaked his knee and was in a lot of pain” in the first half but was able to return, Kerr said. ... Injured rookie James Wiseman spoke in Mandarin Chinese on the big screen to help celebrate the Lunar New Year. ... Big man Kevon Looney says he’s “making good progress. Hopefully I’ll be back on the court soon,” a week out from his left ankle sprain — surprisingly an injury he’s never had previously. QUOTEABLE “He’s Kevin Durant and his name speaks for itself.

"The Jazz move the ball around unselfishly before Bojan Bogdanovic feeds Rudy Gobert for a jam. (0:23) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Utah turned to its defense when its outside shots weren’t falling. The Jazz held Miami scoreless over six-minute stretches of both the second and third quarters, turning a close game into another blowout. Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points and Utah won its seventh straight, beating the Heat 112-94 on Saturday night. “We know the shots are not always going to fall,” said center Rudy Gobert, who 16 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks. “It’s basketball. But we know we get a chance to win every single night with our defense.” Bojan Bogdanovic added 19 points and Georges Niang had 14 for Utah, which has won 18 of its last 19 games since a 4-4 start. Kendrick Nunn scored 20 points for Miami, which missed 11 straight shots to open the third quarter. Jimmy Butler added 15 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Bam Adebayo finished with 14 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. The Heat had a four-game winning streak snapped. “We just did not do things with a great motor and purpose,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. “If you get caught late in the clock, they can really swallow you up with their discipline and their size, with Gobert in the paint.” Mitchell made three straight baskets in just 58 seconds, including back-to-back reverse layups, to spark a 16-0 Jazz run to open the second half. Royce O’Neale capped the run with a steal and slam, giving Utah a 63-42 lead. Miami did not score its first points of the second half until Tyler Herro hit a jumper with 5:51 left in the third quarter. The drought lasted 14 straight possessions for the Heat. “We let our offense dictate our defense,” Butler said. “We started missing shots, not getting back, not rebounding. And then they started scoring, so it’s always going to look like that whenever you’re not guarding. You got to anchor down and guard somebody.” Utah struggled to build any consistent rhythm on offense during the opening quarter against a tenacious Heat defense, going 1 for 12 from 3-point range. So the Jazz attacked the rim to get the offense going. “When we have guys that are really good at creating those advantages, then we are able to have the defense commit and try to take away the rim and we’re able to have all those 3s,” Gobert said. “That’s what makes it so hard. We’re able to get really really good pressure on the rim and the defense has to make decisions.” The shots started falling in the second quarter. Utah scored baskets on six straight possessions early in the period and tied it at 31 on a layup from Bogdanovic. Jordan Clarkson scored a basket and assisted on four others during that stretch. Herro and Max Strus scored back-to-back baskets to make it 36-31 the Heat then missed eight straight shots and went six minutes without scoring. Utah answered with a 14-0 run in that stretch to take a 45-36 lead. The Jazz finally went ahead for the first time on back-to-back baskets from O’Neale and Clarkson. TIP-INS Heat: Goran Dragic (left ankle sprain) and Avery Bradley (right calf strain) did not travel with the team to Utah. … Strus is averaging 18.0 points over his last two games. He scored 15 against the Jazz. … Kelly Olynyk finished with 10 rebounds. Jazz: Mike Conley missed his fourth straight game (right hamstring tightness). … Gobert’s half-court heave at the first-quarter buzzer was his first 3-point field goal attempt since the 2016-17 season. He is 0 for 4 from 3-point range for his career. … Utah outscored Miami 13-2 in second-chance points and 20-10 in fast-break points.

"With the help of a late 3-pointer, Damian Lillard's 34 points help the Trail Blazers overcome Luka Doncic's 44 points in a 121-118 win vs. the Mavericks. (2:32) DALLAS -- — Portland star Damian Lillard didn't wait until just before the buzzer for another game-defining shot, or get anywhere close to the career high he tied in the previous meeting with Dallas. The dynamic guard still carried his team late, overcoming another dazzling performance by Luka Doncic. Lillard hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer in the final minute after a big Dallas rally, and the Trail Blazers held off Doncic and the Mavericks for a 121-118 victory Sunday night. “I think we earned this win,” said Lillard, who finished with 34 points and 11 assists. “We played the kind of game we played, against what we've been up against through the game, it's rewarding in the end.” Doncic scored 44 points two nights after getting a career-high 46 in a victory over New Orleans, but it wasn't enough to extend the Mavericks' four-game winning streak, tied for their longest this season. Lillard connected on the go-ahead 3 after Doncic assisted on a tying 3-pointer from Dorian Finney-Smith after the Mavericks trailed by 13 midway through the fourth quarter. The Mavericks were down three again when Doncic missed a potential tying shot from beyond the arc with less than five seconds left. Doncic was 14 of 20 from the field, including 5 of 8 from deep, and 11 of 12 on free throws. He also had nine assists and seven rebounds. “It didn’t matter if I felt confident or not,” Doncic said of his final shot. “I thought it was in. It went in and out, so I was disappointed and that’s on me. I should have hit the shot.” Doncic set a pair of franchise records with his 14th consecutive game of at least 25 points and the highest two-game total at 90 points. The Trail Blazers won their fourth consecutive game with help from a 45-point third quarter, matching the franchise record for that period while outscoring Dallas by 15 to wipe out a seven-point deficit early in the period. The Mavericks got close late with a 12-0 run that Lillard ended with a layup before Finney-Smith's tying shot. Lillard wasn't nearly as dazzling as his previous meeting with Dallas, when he tied a career high with 61 points in the Florida bubble last summer. Instead, the NBA's fourth-leading scorer shook off some early frustration over non-calls on several drives by scoring 16 points with five assists in the third quarter after getting called for a technical foul late in the first half. Lillard's step-back 3 for the lead from above the key came with 32 seconds remaining in the 10th straight game between these teams decided by less than 10 points. “I know that we're going to get a makeable shot and he makes good decisions,” coach Terry Stotts said. “He can make great shots. He's done it for a long time. A lot of times the most important thing is just get him the ball.” Kristaps Porzingis scored 18 points, half of the season high for Doncic's European sidekick in a 143-130 win over New Orleans two nights earlier. “I’m concerned that the load (Doncic is) carrying is a difficult load to carry on a game-to-game basis,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “I’ve got to try to get some more balance in our attack. It’s just a lot to ask of Luka to put the 40-point stat-stuffer nights on a night-in, night-out basis.” TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Rodney Hood didn't play because of a left foot sprain. Stotts didn't rule out a return against Oklahoma City on Tuesday. ... Carmelo Anthony scored 15 points despite going 1 of 8 from 3-point range. Robert Covington also had 15 while making all four of his 3-point attempts.

Aguirre held the previous club record for points in consecutive games with 87 in January 1985. ... Finney-Smith scored 14 points. TRENT-LED RUN Gary Trent Jr. scored 17 points, including eight in a row in the third quarter to extend a one-point lead and give Portland the cushion that lasted until the late run by Dallas.

Bey also had 12 rebounds and went 7 for 7 from 3-point range, including the shot that gave Detroit a 101-95 cushion in the final minute. The points, rebounds and seven 3s were all career highs for the rookie from Villanova, who was the 19th overall pick in the draft. ""Really proud for him,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “He’s just scratching the surface. He needs to stay humble, stay working, and he is. As a matter of fact, he’s getting a workout in right now.” The last-place Pistons (7-19) have beaten Boston (13-12) twice and also have wins against the Lakers, Nets, 76ers and Suns — all teams above .500. Jayson Tatum scored 33 points with 11 rebounds and seven assists for the Celtics, and Jaylen Brown added 27 points. “We are so inconsistent,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""There is a big difference between being capable and consistent in this league, and we aren’t there yet.” The Celtics led by 10 early but gave up 11 straight points and Detroit took a 27-23 lead into the first break. The Pistons led by as many as 13 early in the fourth before the Celtics began chipping away, cutting it to 95-93 with just over two minutes left. But Josh Jackson made a 3-pointer and, after Tatum's layup, Bey made a 3 to protect the lead. “I’m more happy about the win,"" he said. ""It’s just a blessing to be able to play this game every day for a living.” THAT SMARTS Celtics guard Marcus Smart told reporters before the game that he is making progress toward a return from the torn left calf that has kept him out of the last seven games. Although he is walking with a slight limp, he has been able to do a light jog and some basketball movements. “My body is definitely healing the way we expected it to,” said Smart, who was projected to miss 2/3 weeks after the Jan. 31 injury. “But it’s definitely going to take some time.” Smart said the injury did not occur because of the contact with Lakers forward Montrezl Harrell underneath the basket. Instead, he felt a pair of pops in his leg when he planted and again when he stepped to jump. “That (second) pop sent this burning sensation down my whole leg,” he said. “It still hurts like hell but I’m blessed it’s not anything else.” HAPPY BIRTHDAY Hall of Famer Bill Russell turned 87 on Friday, prompting a tribute from the team. “He is everything you want to be represented by,” Stevens said. ""When you think about his impact on and off the court, he’s in very rarefied air. And I can’t think of a better representative of our sport or the Celtics.” Russell tweeted a video of himself blowing out the candles on his birthday cake. Earlier in the day, he engaged with some friendly trash-talking by responding to a post lauding Tom Brady (seven championships) and Michael Jordan (six) for their success. “(You're) getting closer,” the 11-time NBA champion tweeted.

"Anthony Edwards gets downhill and rises up to flush a two-handed jam on Chris Boucher. (0:20) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Karl-Anthony Towns had just enough scoring help from his teammates for the Minnesota Timberwolves to end a four-game losing streak. Towns scored seven of his 20 points late in the fourth quarter before fouling out with 38 seconds left, and the Timberwolves beat the Toronto Raptors 116-112 Sunday night. Malik Beasley also scored 20 points, hitting six of 10 3-point shots, and rookie Anthony Edwards added 18 for the Timberwolves, who shot 69% in the second half. Ricky Rubio contributed 16 points and five assists. “If you go 6 for 10 and 7 for 13 (in the preceding game), we've got to get him the ball more,” Towns said of Beasley, who is averaging 24.6 points in seven February games. “He's opening up the court for me. I haven't played with a shooter like that for a long time.” The Raptors (12-15) had a chance to tie the game in the closing seconds after Beasley stepped out of bounds with 12.1 seconds left for Minnesota's eighth turnover of the fourth quarter. But, Pascal Siakam missed a layup that was contested by 6-foot-10 Jaden McDaniels. Jordan McLaughlin clinched the victory with two free throws with 3.7 seconds left. Kyle Lowry led the Raptors with 24 points, including 12 in the fourth quarter, helping the Raptors overcome a 12-point deficit. “He went to the free throw line 12 times,” coach Nick Nurse said, “so you can tell how hard he was trying to will us in there.""

(0:27) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — San Antonio star DeMar DeRozan was the defensive focus for the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday night. That left DeRozan's teammates to step up and handle the scoring load. Dejounte Murray had 26 points and 12 rebounds, leading the Spurs to a 122-110 victory over the short-handed Hornets. Derrick White scored 12 of his season-high 25 points in the fourth quarter, helping San Antonio to its fifth win in six games. The Spurs also improved to 5-0 this season against Eastern Conference teams. “They had a lot of attention on him from jump — making it crowded for him,” White said of DeRozan. “But he’s a great passer and we used their aggressiveness against them.” DeRozan attempted just eight shots and finished with eight points, but he dished out nine assists. “They made it tough for him,"" Murray said. ""He is going to have nights where they make it tough on him, but he knows that we've got his back.” Terry Rozier scored 33 points for the Hornets, who played without leading scorer Gordon Hayward because of a sore back. P.J. Washington, Caleb Martin and Cody Martin sat out due to health and safety protocols, and Devonte Graham did not play in the second half because of discomfort in his knee. Malik Monk scored 23 points for Charlotte, while rookie LaMelo Ball had another strong outing with 17 points, 12 rebounds, eight assists and three steals. Hornets coach James Borrego was essentially down to seven NBA-ready players after Graham left, one of them being G League call-up Jalen McDaniels. That meant Rozier had to play 41 minutes and Ball 39. “It was challenging just trying to figure out how to keep these guys fresh and competitive and keep the rotations moving forward,” Borrego said. “But our guys gave us everything they could tonight, and we just ran out of gas there in the fourth quarter."" The Hornets were hoping to get back to .500 on the season. They started with a sense of urgency. Rozier, who scored 41 points in Friday’s win against the Timberwolves, had 16 points on 7-of-12 shooting as the Hornets built a 33-17 lead. But the Spurs began to heat up in the second quarter, going 20 of 26 from the field and scoring 47 points to take a 64-59 halftime lead. The game was tied heading into the fourth quarter, but White scored 10 points in the first seven minutes to help the Spurs to a 108-99 lead. Charlotte pulled within six down the stretch before White converted a driving layup across the lane with 47.8 seconds left to help close it out. ROZIER'S RUN Rozier is averaging 36 points over the last three games while shooting 59% from the field. “Sometimes when you’re in the zone the hoop feels like it’s an ocean,” Rozier said. JOHNSON STRONG Keldon Johnson, the 29th pick in the 2019 draft, had 18 points and eight rebounds for the Spurs. White called him “country strong.” “He’s a hell of a rebounder,"" White said. ""In traffic it just seems like he comes down with it. It brings a lot of energy for himself and his teammates.” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said DeRozan has been a big part of Johnson's development to this point. “He’s not only having a great season playing, he’s doing a great job as a mentor with Keldon being a young, energetic guy with a lot to learn,"" Popovich said. ""DeMar enjoys him, but also wants the best team he could possibly have and bringing Keldon along quickly is part of that.” TIP-INS Spurs: Had 31 assists. ... Shot 29.4% from 3-point range. Hornets: Hayward had been listed as probable before his back tightened up. He is day to day.","401267574"
"Justin Jackson hits the big 3-pointer to all but end the Bucks' chances at a win. (0:41) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — The Thunder finally got one. Justin Jackson scored a season-high 22 points and hit a critical 3-pointer in the final minute to help the Oklahoma City Thunder overcome Giannis Antetokounmpo's triple-double and beat the Milwaukee Bucks 114-109 on Sunday night. With Milwaukee making a late push, Jackson hit a 3-pointer with 14.9 seconds remaining to put the Thunder in control for good in just his second start of the season. The Thunder had been nearing a breakthrough. During their recent three-game road trip, they lost back-to-back overtime games to the Los Angeles Lakers and dropped a two-point game to the Denver Nuggets. “These games are all an opportunity to sharpen our blade, and they’re all a barometer of kind of where we’re at as a team,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. ""The only way you know how good you can be or how much you need to improve or where you need to improve is when you test yourself against the league’s best. Milwaukee -- we have high respect for them. They’re one of the league’s best, and we were able to improve as a result of being able to play them and compete with them tonight.” Al Horford had 20 points, nine assists and seven rebounds, Lu Dort scored 19 points and Darius Bazley added 18 for Oklahoma City. The Thunder won without leading scorer Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who sat out with a sprained left knee. Antetokounmpo had 24 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists for his fourth triple-double of the season. Khris Middleton scored 23 points and Bobby Portis added 21 for the Bucks. “Tonight, they were the team that wanted it more,"" Middleton said. ""It’s as simple as that.” Milwaukee closed out its six-game road trip with three losses after starting with three wins. “It felt like 12 days on the road — that’s what it’ s felt like and that’s what it looked like,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Obviously, guys are tired playing every other day — the road trip started with a back to back. We haven’t had time to rest.” Milwaukee missed 14 of its first 15 shots to start the second quarter, and the Thunder took advantage to lead 52-41 at halftime. Middleton scored 17 points in the first half for the Bucks on 7-for-10 shooting, but the rest of the team went 10 for 38. Dort scored 16 points in the first half for Oklahoma City. “From the nine-minute mark in the first quarter to halftime, it was just an ugly game for us,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We just weren’t able to make enough plays — all of us.” Milwaukee rallied and took the lead on a jumper by Portis late in the third quarter. The Bucks made 67% of their field goals in the third, and the game was tied at 81 heading into the fourth. Consecutive buckets by Bazley and a 3-pointer by Jackson gave the Thunder a 101-93 lead midway through the final quarter, and Oklahoma City held on. Daigneault was proud of the way the Thunder bounced back after falling behind 8-0 at the start. “It was really just regrouping and refocusing everybody on what the blueprint was for the game on both ends of the floor,"" he said. ""We weren’t terrible the first few minutes, but against a team that good, you can’t be average or above average. You have to be great at it, and for the rest of the game, our execution was great.” TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee scored the game's first eight points. ... Antetokounmpo had a double-double in the first half with 11 points and 11 rebounds. ... Donte DiVincenzo scored 17 points. ... Guard Jrue Holiday was out because of health and safety protocols.

"LeBron James might've gotten away with a travel before this monstrous dunk to end the first half vs. the Nuggets. (0:22) DENVER -- — The sight of Anthony Davis limping off the court was hard for the Los Angeles Lakers to shake. They never really recovered. Nikola Jokic recorded his sixth triple-double of the season and the Denver Nuggets beat the Lakers 122-105 on Sunday night in a game in which Davis re-aggravated his sore right Achilles. Once he exited late in the first half, the Nuggets turned a close game into a runaway. Now, the only thought for the Lakers is the result of Davis' MRI on Monday for what the team called a strain. “I don’t want to mess around with this type of injury,” Davis said. “Just trying to figure out the best steps.” The spotlight was on the showdown between Jokic and LeBron James, who are both among the favorites in the NBA MVP race. Jokic finished with 23 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists. James had 22 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, but the Lakers' seven-game win streak ended. For his big game, Jokic credited a new mindset. “If I’m open, shoot it,” Jokic said. “If I see someone is coming, just pass the ball. Don’t overthink anything.” Los Angeles never got back on track after Davis limped to the locker room. He was banged up when he tried to drive around Jokic with 2:39 left before halftime. Davis hobbled to the free-throw line, made both and then was subbed out. He finished with 15 points and four rebounds in 14 minutes. Entering the game, Davis was questionable with what was described as right Achilles tendinosis. He missed two contests due to the ailment before returning in a win over Memphis on Friday. James now has some advice for Davis: Take all the time he needs. Don't rush back. “Just want him to be healthy and get back to full strength,” James said. “All I care is about his health."" Jamal Murray scored 25 points for Denver in its third straight win. Zeke Nnaji had 16 points, and fellow reserve Facundo Campazzo finished with 15. “In this business, you never know when your number is going to be called,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “You better be ready when it's called. That's what I'm proud of most.” This was meeting No. 2 of the season between the teams that advanced to the Western Conference finals last season. In the first contest on Feb. 4, the Lakers trailed by 12 points in the third quarter before going on a big run to take control. They outscored the Nuggets 68-35 in the second half for a a 114-93 win. Only this time, the third quarter wasn't an issue. Denver outscored the Lakers 30-24 in the third to open a comfortable lead and stretched it to as many as 21 in the fourth. And while the Lakers were able to rally from 20-point deficits in their last two wins, they couldn't storm back in this one. “It’s definitely deflating anytime you lose a big player — a big guy on your team,” James said. “We have a lot of things that's built in around A.D. and a lot of other players. When he goes down, you have to switch up. That hurt us.” TIP-INS Lakers: F Kyle Kuzma scored 19 points and grabbed eight rebounds. Nuggets: Gary Harris (left adductor strain), Will Barton III (personal reasons) and P.J. Dozier (strained right hamstring) were out. ... F Paul Millsap didn't play in the second half due to a sprained left knee. He had 10 points. LONG-RANGE SLUMP Lakers guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope has been in a slump since hitting 7 of 10 from 3-point range on Jan. 21 at Milwaukee. He is 9 of 36 from deep since that game, including 1 of 4 Sunday. “He’s just not getting as many clean looks,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “It’s not anything I’m worried about.” HOW ABOUT THAT PASS Campazzo had a no-look pass in the first quarter that whirled past the head of Kuzma and straight to Nnaji, who drained the 3-pointer. EVEN BETTER? For as good as the NBA champion Lakers were last season, Malone believes their additions of Montrezl Harrell, Dennis Schröder and Marc Gasol takes them to an even higher plateau. “In my opinion, and no disrespect to any players that are not back ... I think they’re even better this year with the talent they’ve brought in,” Malone said.","401267576"
"Chris Paul grabs the rebound and drains a 3-pointer at the other end for the Suns vs. the Magic. (0:19) PHOENIX -- — The Phoenix Suns were coming off impressive, hard-fought victories over two of the NBA's best teams. They've got another big game in a few days when the Nets come to town. That made a drama-free blowout over the Orlando Magic a welcome change Sunday night. Devin Booker scored 27 points, Mikal Bridges added 21 and the Suns cruised to their sixth straight victory, beating the short-handed Magic 109-90 in a game that was never particularly close. “We did what we had to do to win the game,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “We’ve had some really emotional games in this building and to win the way we’ve won the past few games, we didn’t even want to talk about a letdown.” It's safe to say that wasn't a problem. The Suns never trailed and jumped out to a 14-2 lead after Orlando missed 12 of its first 13 shots. “We just wanted to push the tempo early and make them feel us,” Suns forward Jae Crowder said. It never got much better for the Magic, who had just eight players available because of injuries. Orlando has lost eight of its past 10 and fell to 10-18. The Suns improved to 17-9. Terrence Ross led the Magic with 23 points. Dwayne Bacon added 19 points, and Nikola Vucevic had 14 points and 10 rebounds. “We got off to a bad start and I thought, actually, in the first quarter in the beginning we had decent shots,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. “We didn’t finish any of them so we played in a hole.” Booker scored 17 points in the first quarter on 8-of-10 shooting, including a 30-foot 3-pointer and a breakaway dunk, and the Suns took a 28-16 lead. They led by 23 in the second quarter before settling for a 52-35 advantage at the break. Phoenix scored the first six points of the second half and pushed ahead 80-55 after Crowder hit back-to-back 3-pointers. Crowder finished with 12 points and eight rebounds. Chris Paul added 12 points, nine assists and six rebounds. Orlando shot just 6 of 35 (17%) from 3-point range and was outrebounded 59-48. Ross said he's never been on a team that's dealing with so many injuries at the same time. “Everybody is kind of doing something different, playing outside our comfort zone,” Ross said. “It is part of the game I guess. That is where we are at right now.” TIP-INS Magic: Orlando's injury list was a long one: It included Al-Farouq Aminu (right knee), Cole Anthony (shoulder), James Ennis III (groin) and Evan Fournier (back spasms). ... Ross started a game for the first time in three seasons. He had come off the bench in 180 straight games. ... The Magic shot just 6 of 24 from the field in the first quarter. ...

"Jonas Valanciunas takes exception to Chimezie Metu holding on to the rim above him, so he discards the Kings big man to the court. (0:27) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Jonas Valanciunas scored a season-high 25 points and had 13 rebounds to offset a late technical foul and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Sacramento Kings 124-110 on Sunday night. Ja Morant added 16 points and 10 assists despite a rough 7-for-18 shooting night from the field. Dillon Brooks scored 22 points and Kyle Anderson had 17 points and six rebounds for Memphis, which had lost five of six. “Our guys were great tonight up and down the entire roster,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “Our starters set a tone for us from the start. Our defensive activity set a tone for us offensively. Our bench came in, gave us tremendous minutes. Definitely one of our better games all around from start to finish.” Two days after blowing a 20-point, first-quarter lead in a loss to the Lakers, the Grizzlies built another early advantage and withstood a late run by the Kings. The game got chippy late, after Sacramento’s Chimezie Metu dunked over Valanciunas and held onto the rim with both hands. Valanciuanas continued to stand under the rim and did not move to allow Metu to land. With Metu still hanging on the rim, Valanciunas appeared to get his left arm hooked around one of Metu’s legs and threw him off as players from both teams ran in. The play was reviewed and Valanciunas was called for an unsportsmanlike technical foul. Valanciunas was not made available to the media after the game, but Kings coach Luke Walton called the play unsafe. Morant felt Metu was at fault. “He went a little overboard. He got the dunk, probably was excited,” Morant said. “I felt like he wrapped his legs around (Valanciunas) and that’s a little disrespectful to a man. I don’t blame JV at all.” Sacramento’s Cory Joseph also didn’t see it as bad. “Jonas was kind of underneath (Metu), he didn’t want to go down and create an injury,” Joseph said. “They were both competing, playing hard. It is what it is.” A few minutes later, Valanciunas dunked and hung onto the rim for several moments, even though no one was near him. Memphis had seven players score in double figures, led by as many as 24 points and scored 68 points in the paint. It wasn’t just the Grizzlies starters who stood out. Xavier Tillman drove the lane for a thunderous one-handed dunk and Sean McDermott followed with another dunk off a baseline drive moments later. The Grizzlies had not won in Sacramento since Dec. 31, 2017. De’Aaron Fox had 23 point and nine assists for the Kings despite not playing in the fourth quarter. “I would have put him back in in a different scenario, if we didn’t have another game tomorrow, if we weren’t fighting back (from) 20,” Walton said. “There wasn’t a minutes restriction on him, I was just being careful.” The teams were scheduled to play back-to-backs in Memphis in late January before the games were postponed due to COVID-19 issues. BROOKS FAST START Brooks, who had not scored more than 15 points in four previous games against Sacramento, had 18 in 18 minutes to get Memphis off to the double-digit lead by halftime. Brooks picked up his fourth foul 25 seconds into the third quarter, but came back to score four in the fourth. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Brandon Clarke returned for Memphis after missing four consecutive games with a sore right calf and scored 13. ... Brooks scored 12 of Memphis’ first 21 points. Kings: Sacramento missed eight of its first 10 shots. … Marvin Bagley III was held out for a second consecutive game with left calf soreness.

"Take a look at Patrick Beverley's no-look 3-pointer vs. the Cavaliers and how it compares to other iconic trick shots. (1:13) LOS ANGELES -- — Lou Williams scored a season-high 30 points in his first start of the season, and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated Cleveland 128-111 on Sunday night, sending the Cavaliers to their seventh straight loss. The three-time Sixth Man of the Year added a season-high 10 assists and made all eight of his free throws on a night when the Clippers were without Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Leonard has a lower left leg contusion and Paul is dealing with bone swelling in his right toe. Williams has been on a roll, scoring 20-plus points in three of his last four games. “He had to get his rhythm and his legs under him,” teammate Patrick Beverley said. “He's been in the league since high school, so he's got some miles on him. We're happy those legs are on him now. He's been dangerous."" Marcus Morris had a season-best 23 points off the bench for the Clippers, who have won three in a row and seven of 10. Serge Ibaka finished with 21 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Collin Sexton scored 23 points for the short-handed Cavs. Darius Garland and reserve Cedi Osman each scored 20 points. Cleveland has dropped nine of 11. The Clippers got the rout going in the third when they scored 36 points after notching 38 in the second. Beverley and Williams combined to score their first 14 points, including eight in a row, for an 84-60 lead. Reggie Jackson's three-point play provided the Clippers' largest lead of 28 points. “It started at the end of the second,"" Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “It was a six-point game and we had some costly decision-making errors. It went up to 12 at halftime. They got momentum and confidence and put the game out of reach."" The Cavs never made a run in the fourth. Their only lead came in the first when they opened the game on a 7-2 spurt. “Defensively, we have to be better. It’s not enough against high-scoring teams,"" Osman said. “We have to play harder. They’re not letting us score easy but we gave up so many easy points."" Beverley and Williams quickly shut down the Cavs, combining for 14 of the Clippers' first 16 points to start the game. Ibaka, Morris and Terrance Mann teamed to run off eight in a row after their teammates' early scoring binge. “With this new coaching staff, they've been telling me let it fly even if it's being contested,"" said Beverley, who had four 3-pointers. “Those shots have been going in.""

Clippers: Beverley reached 4,000 career points on a 3-pointer in the third quarter. “He's proud as hell right now,"" Williams said. ...

"Zach LaVine hits a breathtaking step-back triple over Domantas Sabonis late in the fourth quarter. (0:22) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Zach LaVine wants to be more than just a flashy scorer. It's a work in progress, but he showed Monday night how much he has improved this season. After scoring 12 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter to help Chicago force overtime, LaVine dug in defensively and helped lead the Bulls to a 120-112 victory over the Indiana Pacers. “He’s tried to be more and more engaged (defensively),” coach Billy Donovan said. “I feel like he’s working defensively, and I think he’s finding out how difficult it is to be a two-way player in this league. He’s chasing all these guys, he’s getting hit and he’s working. And late in the game, he was involved in a lot of those defensive stops for us.” The combination helped the Bulls end a 10-game losing streak in the series and an eight-game skid at Indiana. And LaVine got plenty of help — after shooting an errant 19-footer at the end of regulation. Garrett Temple started overtime with a 6-foot pull-up. After Thaddeus Young chased down an offensive rebound, Denzel Valentine made a 3-pointer to give the Bulls a 110-105 lead. They never trailed again. “That’s what our defense is built on, forcing you into tough shots, making you miss and not letting you get second chances,” said Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon, who had 23 points and 15 rebounds. Brogdon helped Indiana charge back from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Domantas Sabonis' two free throws with 4:58 left in regulation gave the Pacers a 94-92 lead. After LaVine scored four straight to give the Bulls a 105-103 lead, Brogdon's 5-footer with 10.5 seconds left tied the score at 105. “We competed and battled, it wasn’t always pretty,” Donovan said. “There were a lot of balls and plays we missed at the rim, but we scrapped and made them miss a lot at the rim. That’s how we have to play.” TIP-INS Bulls: Coby White had 19 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. ... LaVine also had nine rebounds. ... Young had 13 points and 11 rebounds against his former team. ... Temple had 16 points and Valentine finished with 11. ... Wendell Carter Jr. had 11 points and nine rebounds in his return after being sidelined by a bruised right quadriceps tendon. He sat out the previous 11 games. Pacers: Sabonis had 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and four blocks. ... Guard T.J. McConnell made his first start of the season, replacing Doug McDermott (sore right knee). McConnell scored 19 points — his highest total since joining the Pacers. ... Myles Turner had 11 points and six more blocks — his eighth game this season with five or more. ... The Pacers were 9 of 33 on 3s and had 19 turnovers, ending a five-game stretch with 10 or fewer. FAN-LESS The Pacers first welcomed fans back to Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Jan. 24 and played their next five games in front of smaller crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But on Monday, a few hours before tip-off, team officials announced a snowstorm would require them to close the arena doors to fans after city officials announced they were issuing a travel advisory. INJURY UPDATE Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren remains hopeful he can get forward T.J. Warren and guard Caris LeVert back this season. Warren, Indiana's top scorer last season, hasn't played since the Pacers announced Dec. 31 that he would undergo surgery on his left foot. LeVert hasn't played since being acquired in a January trade with Houston after Indiana's team doctors found a cancerous growth on LeVert's kidney.

"John Wall racks up 29 points and 11 assists, but it's not enough as Bradley Beal's 37 points lead the Wizards to victory. (2:14) WASHINGTON -- — Bradley Beal and John Wall reunited on the floor in the nation's capital wearing different uniforms and with no fans to cheer their electrifying drives to the basket. One thing remained the same: They continued to motivate each other to play their best. Beal scored 37 points in an entertaining duel with his ex-teammate, and the Wizards beat the Rockets 131-119 on Monday night in Wall's first game in Washington since being traded to Houston. “Even tonight, we're pushing each other, telling each other to be better, guarding each other. It's just competitive. It's just our nature,” Beal said. “It's a beautiful thing. I'm definitely looking forward to competing against him for the rest of my career, as crazy as that may sound.” Wall, traded in December for Russell Westbrook and a first-round pick, had season highs of 29 points and 11 assists for the Rockets, who were missing leading scorer Eric Gordon along with Victor Oladipo, Christian Wood and P.J. Tucker. Houston dropped its sixth straight. Wall, the 2010 first-round pick who missed most of the previous two seasons with an Achilles tendon injury, took at least some satisfaction in showing the Wizards he hasn't lost his speed or skill. “They see it,” Wall said. “They’ve been seeing it all season.” The Rockets were dealt another blow Monday. Center Ray Spalding suffered an Achilles tendon injury in just his second game with Houston, and coach Stephen Silas said “the prognosis is not good.” “We'll see what the tests bring tomorrow, but just off the initial (diagnosis), it didn't seem like he'll be playing anytime soon,” Silas added. Westbrook had 16 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds for his sixth triple-double of the season — his first in a Wizards win — and 152nd of his career. But it was a largely inefficient performance from the former MVP, who shot 8 of 22 overall, 0 of 3 from 3-point range and airballed a 20-foot jumper. Westbrook played on back-to-back days for the first time this season. “When I'm watching, I'm learning,” Westbrook said. “I don't just sit there for kicks and giggles. I'm able to see my teammates in a different light, see different things and apply it when I get back on the floor.” Davis Bertans added 18 points on 5-of-6 3-point shooting for Washington, which won consecutive games for the first time this season. Houston kept it close against Washington's league-worst defense before the Wizards wore down the Rockets, who had only 10 players dressed for the game. Washington finally started to pull away with an 11-2 run late in the third quarter. Wall went to the bench early in that run. He returned with 7:28 left in the fourth quarter and the Rockets trailing by 13, and Houston could not get closer than eight points the rest of the way. LOW-KEY TRIBUTE The Wizards played a video montage in tribute to Wall during a first-quarter timeout that highlighted Wall’s charitable efforts in Washington, which have continued since the trade. Playing in an empty arena and without his mother, who died of cancer in December 2019, was not how Wall envisioned his return to the city where he spent the first decade of his career. “It was difficult. I play for the fans. I play for the city. I’m an emotional and passionate person out there for 10 years. So you know I wanted to see those guys here and see them there to support me,” Wall said. “I also wanted to have my first game that I would have played back in D.C. to have my mom out there in the stands. She's been with me for everything, and knowing she was not here, that was difficult.” TIP-INS Rockets: Tucker's streak of 267 consecutive games ended because of a left thigh contusion. The forward has played more games than anybody in the NBA since the 2012-13 season. “For him not to play, you know he's pretty banged up. It was a tough conversation to have, but he was the one who was like, 'Yeah, I just can’t do it. I can't move on the floor,'” Silas said. ... Gordon was out with a sore groin, Oladipo has a sprained right foot and Wood has a sprained right ankle. ... Silas said his wife had no heat or power at their Houston home because of a winter storm that slammed Texas on Monday. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks said Westbrook felt healthy enough to play on consecutive days and wouldn't predict his availability for future back-to-backs. ...

Randle added nine rebounds and five assists in perhaps the best performance of a season that should merit consideration for the All-Star Game in Atlanta next month. “What else does he have to do?” teammate RJ Barrett said. “The man’s an All-Star.” Randle scored 17 points on 7-for-8 shooting in the first quarter to send the Knicks to a fast start and ended up one point shy of his career high. He didn't feel good about his first season in New York, and the seventh-year forward was driven to make this one better. “A lot of people may have wrote me off, a lot of people may have had their doubts or whatever it may be, and that was just motivation or fuel,” Randle said. “For me it was just about coming back a better player and a better teammate than I was last year.” Barrett added 21 points and rookie Immanuel Quickley had 16 for the Knicks, who improved to 14-15 and can reach .500 with a victory over Orlando on Wednesday. They have doubled their win total through 29 games from last season, when they were 7-22. Trae Young had 23 points and eight assists for the Hawks, who dropped their fourth straight and seventh in the last eight games. The Hawks yielded 118, 125 and 125 in the first three games of the skid and had plenty more trouble defensively with a Knicks team that scored 20 more than its NBA-low 103.3 points per game. New York tied its season best with 66 points in the first half. The Knicks raced to a 16-5 lead in the first four minutes and Quickley's 3-pointer to open the second made it 42-28, New York's largest lead. Atlanta scored the first nine points of the third for a 72-66 lead after John Collins' dunk, but couldn't control Randle — the only Knicks player to score for nearly half the quarter. New York surged ahead again with a 15-2 spurt, and another 3 by Randle made it 93-86 with just over a minute remaining in the period. “He hit every big 3,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. “And our guys competed and we’re constantly trying to find those big-play moments on our side, and we got dinged by a guy making play after play all night."" The biggest might have been a 3-pointer with the Knicks protecting a two-point lead with under 3 1/2 minutes to play. Randle then found Barrett for another 3 that made it 115-107 and knocked down a jumper that pushed the lead to eight with 1:36 left. TIP-INS Hawks: Collins had 19 points. Cam Reddish and Danilo Gallinari each scored 16. ... Clint Capela, the NBA's leading rebounder, had 15 points and 18 boards. He has been in double figures in rebounds in 22 of 24 games this season. Knicks: Coach Tom Thibodeau said center Mitchell Robinson will have another consultation with a surgeon on his broken right hand Tuesday and afterward would have a better update on how much time he could miss. ... Frank Ntilikina missed his fourth straight game because of health and safety protocols. Thibodeau said Ntilikina continues to test negative for the coronavirus. MR. NICE GUY Thibodeau has always had a reputation as a no-nonsense workaholic, but Pierce described a much different personality at the Las Vegas Summer League or NBA coaches' meetings. “About as nice a person as you’ll meet,” Pierce said. “He’s always got a smile on his face. He’s easy to talk to. Different personality come game time.” Thibodeau smiled when told that Derrick Rose, playing for him for the third time, said he's never seen the coach smile as much as he has now. “Look, I want us to work,” Thibodeau said. “I think when you get a team that’s committed to playing for each other and doing the right things, I also want us to enjoy it.”","401267582"
"Ben Simmons pours in a career-high 42 points, but Jordan Clarkson scores 40 points off the bench to lead the red-hot Jazz past the 76ers. (1:45) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Even without Joel Embiid, the Philadelphia 76ers were scoring every time down the court. But the Utah Jazz didn’t blink. They just gave the ball to Jordan Clarkson. Clarkson had a season-high 40 points off the bench to send the streaking Jazz past Philadelphia 134-123 in a matchup of conference leaders Monday night despite a career-best 42 points from Ben Simmons. “I’ve never played with anyone like JC in my lifetime,” teammate Joe Ingles said. “It’s pretty cool to play with someone that’s so locked into what his role is and so comfortable in the role.” Utah (23-5) has won eight straight games and 19 of 20. Clarkson has been a sparkplug in several of those victories. A leading candidate for NBA Sixth Man of the Year already, Clarkson knows his role is to score — and there aren’t many shots he’ll turn down. Nicknamed the Flame Thrower, Clarkson was so hot he didn’t want to come off the court. “What Jordan did tonight was special,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “He and I just laughed about me telling him that I appreciate him at least hiding (his disappointment) when he comes out.” Clarkson hit a career-high eight 3-pointers and Donovan Mitchell added 24 points to help the Jazz overcome an early 14-point deficit. Philadelphia has dropped three straight. Clarkson set his career scoring high for a game that ended in regulation. He had 42 points in a three-overtime loss to Brooklyn on Feb. 13, 2019. “With them saying they believe me, letting me be myself and embracing me, it plays into the whole role of who I am and that gives me even more confidence,” Clarkson said. Philadelphia (18-10) was minus Embiid, a late scratch because of back tightness. Playing without his All-Star running mate, Simmons had 12 assists and nine rebounds — barely missing a triple-double. He easily topped his previous best of 34 points set on Dec. 7, 2019. “Honestly, I’ve been working on my mentality and my mental (approach) a lot these past few weeks,” Simmons said of his newfound scoring prowess. “It’s not easy to do that, change the way you play. Certain things in the game come natural to certain people. I feel like I’m figuring it out.” Tobias Harris had a season-high 36 points for the Sixers in a fast-paced game between championship hopefuls. Despite all the highlights from Clarkson and Simmons, it was Royce O’Neale who made the biggest shots down the stretch. The Utah guard hit consecutive 3-pointers to quell Philadelphia’s final rally. His wing 3 to beat the shot clock gave the Jazz a 129-118 lead with 2:12 to play. “I try and get Royce to shoot as much as possible. We played hot potato for a second there at the end trying to get him to shoot it, but we’re a really good team when he shoots the ball,” said Ingles, who had 20 points. Simmons scored eight straight points in the fourth quarter to cut the Jazz lead to 110-104 with 8:40 left. Minutes later, he found Harris for a 3 to get Philadelphia within 113-109. Embiid was scratched after coming out to warm up, and coach Doc Rivers expressed surprise the big man wasn’t playing. But that just cleared room for Simmons. “I didn’t know we’d get 42 points out of him, but he did everything. He guarded, did a good job. Played with pace,” Rivers said. The Jazz scored 10 consecutive points as part of an 18-4 run to take their first lead in the second quarter and went up 67-59 on Bojan Bogdanovic’s jumper in the lane. Clarkson was the primary driver of the surge with 21 first-half points to help Utah build a 72-66 halftime lead. “I’m just coming in to do what Coach is telling me to do and what my teammates trust me to do and that’s to take shots and try to make plays,” Clarkson said. “That never changes if we’re up by 20 or if we’re down by 15.” The 76ers scored on 16 straight possessions in the first half and led 24-10 but couldn’t slow the Jazz much, either. Simmons and Harris took turns isolating and driving to the basket with a full head of steam starting from beyond the 3-point line. Utah tried O’Neale, center Rudy Gobert and others but they all had trouble stopping Simmons in the paint. Simmons had 19 points in the first quarter, his most ever in one period. “I loved when I saw Rudy was guarding me,” Simmons said. “I feel it was a little bit of disrespect putting him on me.” HEAVY HEART Already short-handed without Embiid, Rivers offered a night off to center Dwight Howard when he learned of a death in Howard’s family. Howard didn’t even arrive at the arena until an hour before tip-off. “I told him he didn’t have to play, and he said, ‘Coach, I just want to get on the floor. It’s better than just sitting around the room.’ I thought he was phenomenal,” Rivers said. Howard finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds. “Obviously, he’s playing with a heavy heart out there tonight. Ultra amount of respect for him,” Harris said. “It just shows who he is as a person. He’s an amazing leader.” TIP-INS 76ers: It was the fourth time Simmons had at least 12 assists this season. … Shooting under 60% from the foul line during his career, Simmons went 12 of 13 on free throws. … The 76ers made only eight 3s to 18 for the Jazz. Jazz: Mike Conley missed his fifth straight game with a sore hamstring. … Ingles passed Pete Maravich for seventh on the Jazz career list with 1,845 assists. … Clarkson missed his second free throw of the season and now sits at 46 of 48. … Clarkson joined Jeff Hornacek, Rodney Hood, Randy Foye and Bogdanovic as Utah players to hit eight 3s in a game.","401267583"
"Steph Curry shows off his dribbling skills as he makes a step-back 3-pointer vs. the Cavaliers. (0:22) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Stephen Curry scored 36 points in three quarters and the Golden State Warriors routed the Cleveland Cavaliers 129-98 on Monday night. Draymond Green tied his career high with 16 assists as the Warriors sent the Cavaliers to their eighth straight loss. Curry was 13 for 19 from the floor and 7 for 11 from beyond the arc, and sat out the fourth quarter with the outcome all but decided. The two-time MVP is averaging 37.3 points over his last six games and showing no wear and tear in a season in which he is carrying a heavy offensive burden. But Green, starting at center recently with James Wiseman and Kevon Looney injured, was just as crucial against the Cavaliers. He consistently found teammates cutting to the basket and led an unselfish offense that piled up 34 assists. “Playing center opens the floor for him,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “When he’s playing center and handling the ball, it completely changes the chess board.” Curry is just the second guard to score at least 25 points and shoot 50% or better from the field in 10 consecutive games since the 1970-71 season, when such data first started being tracked. Michael Jordan is the other. Curry said his chemistry with Green plays a huge part in his success. “It’s built on eight, nine years of experience that comes out whether we draw something up or just kind of feel it or see it,” Curry said. “It definitely helps just to find open space out there and exploit how teams are going to be aggressive on me.” Collin Sexton led the Cavaliers with 23 points. Cleveland shot 38.9% from the floor and was winless on its five-game road trip. “You have to look in the mirror and be honest with yourself and see areas you can improve,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “And we’ve got room to grow.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: Taurean Prince (ankle) sat out the game, with Cedi Osman taking his spot as one of the starting forwards. … Isaac Okoro went down hard in a collision on a second-quarter drive to the basket. He was tended to by trainers on the court and left the game. He returned in the second half. Warriors: Curry has hit at least one 3-pointer in 90 consecutive games, passing Dana Barros for the fourth-longest 3-point streak in NBA history. Curry happens to own the record with a 157-game 3-point streak from Nov. 13, 2014 to Nov. 3, 2016. … Green, who was limited in the morning shootaround due to a sore right knee, has 10-plus assists in six of his last seven games. DRUMMOND TRADE CHATTER The Cavaliers are sitting center Andre Drummond while they try to work a trade for the two-time All-Star. Drummond attended Monday’s game and cheered on his teammates. Bickerstaff said Drummond has handled the situation very professionally. “We had conversations with Andre and his representation,” Bickerstaff said. “We thought we came to the right conclusion that was best for everybody. I have a ton of respect for Andre as a human being and a basketball player.”","401267584"
"Luke Kennard intercepts Tyler Herro's pass then gets the perfect pass to Ivica Zubac for the slam. (0:23) LOS ANGELES -- — Marcus Morris had season highs of 32 points and six 3-pointers, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Miami Heat 125-118 on Monday night for their fourth straight victory. The Clippers won without four starters, including Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, who were out for the second straight night because of injuries. “A total team effort. We kept grinding,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. Morris recorded a season-high 23 points during Sunday's win over Cleveland and he came back strong, scoring 26 in the first half. He was making a rare start with most of the regulars out. “I'm a hooper. Whatever you need me to do,” Morris said. “I don’t just be talking.” The Clippers have won eight of 11. Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the Heat. He made all 10 of his free throws. Bam Adebayo added 27 points and 12 rebounds, and reserve Tyler Herro scored 27 points. “I'm not going to say we gave one away, we didn’t deserve to win,” Butler said. “We weren't protecting the paint or rotating or running them off the line to make them miss. They were just comfortable the whole game.” Ivica Zubac added 22 points for the Clippers. Lou Williams had 18 points and 10 assists, and two-way player Amir Coffey had a season-high 15 points and a career-high five 3-pointers. Coffey was in the G League a few days ago, and made 14 3s in his last game there. “When you're short-handed, you really find out what your team is made of,” said Terrance Mann, who added 15 points. “It brings your team closer.” Los Angeles had 31 assists for the second straight game, something the franchise hasn't done since December 2014. “Sharing the basketball, getting into the paint and making a play for your teammate, we did it all night long,” Lue said. “It’s fun playing that way.” The Clippers led by one heading into the fourth. They got back-to-back 3-pointers by Luke Kennard and Mann dunked to push their lead to 11 points. Herro hit his fourth 3-pointer and followed with a basket to draw the Heat to 121-116 before the Clippers controlled the final seconds. “We had some breatkdowns. They capitalized on the important ones at swing moments of the game,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “We just did not do things well enough, consistently enough.” Williams' slick behind-the-back pass to Reggie Jackson gave the Clippers a nine-point lead in the third. Miami ran off 10 straight points, capped by Herro's 3-pointer, to go back in front 76-75. Neither team led by more than three points the rest of the quarter. Coffey's fifth 3-pointer put the Clippers ahead 92-91 going into the fourth. The Clippers outscored the Heat 20-9 to open the second quarter, using runs of 7-0 and 11-0 that were highlighted by four 3-pointers from Coffey to take a 53-44 lead. TIP-INS Heat: Fell to 4-9 on the road. ... They've dropped nine of their last 14. ... They were without Avery Bradley (right calf strain), Goran Dragic (left ankle sprain), Meyers Leonard (left shoulder surgery) and Chris Silva (left hip flexor strain). Clippers: Williams had 10 assists in back-to-back games for the second time in his career. ... Improved to 3-1 this season with Leonard and George out. ... Nicolas Batum sat out with a migraine and Patrick Beverley rested on the second night of a back-to-back. ... Have won five in a row over the Heat. ... George watched the game in shorts and a sweatshirt.","401267585"
"James Harden drains his vintage step-back 3-pointer while being fouled and then falling to the floor. (0:29) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Even with one of their Big Three on the bench, the Brooklyn Nets had no problem keeping their high-powered offense running smoothly. James Harden expected that. What caught the three-time scoring champion by surprise was how well the Nets played defensively, if only for a short but pivotal stretch in the third quarter. Kyrie Irving scored a season-high 40 points, Harden had his fifth triple-double with Brooklyn and the Nets beat the Sacramento Kings 136-125 on Monday night as injured Kevin Durant watched from the bench. “Offensively, we’re going to have nights like this. What’s going to get us over the top is defense,” Harden said. “That third quarter we took it upon ourselves collectively to get stops and guard. That allowed us to get out in transition and get easy buckets.” The Nets led 82-80 midway through the third before going on a 20-0 run that broke the game open. Harden and Irving were responsible for much of it, another sign the two perennial All-Stars are getting more comfortable after a month of playing together. Irving went 15 of 22 and made nine of the Nets’ franchise-record 27 3-pointers, including consecutive shots from beyond the arc to start the game and three more as part of a 23-4 spurt in the third period. Harden got caught up watching Irving’s display. “It’s a movie, like a show. Sometimes I forget I’m on the court,” Harden said. “One of the reasons why I’m here. He makes the game so easy for the rest of the team when he has it going like that.” Harden had 29 points, 14 assists and 13 rebounds, his ninth straight game with a double-double. The club record is 10. “That’s the type of offensive output we’re capable of. For us it’s the defense we’re trying to work with,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. “They’re a difficult team to guard … and I thought we slowed them down.” Hassan Whiteside had 26 points and 16 rebounds for the Kings. De’Aaron Fox added 19 points and eight assists. Brooklyn had seven players in double figures while Sacramento had six in a matchup between two of the NBA’s three worst defenses. “Unfortunate, but we knew this was going to be that type of test,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “They’re not an easy team to stop, and as soon as we made mistakes … they turned them into 3, 3, 3 like that. Tough to beat a team when they hit 27 3s.” The Nets were again without Durant, who sustained a mild left hamstring strain Saturday against the Warriors after returning from a weeklong quarantine due to COVID-19 issues. Durant watched from the end of the bench. It didn’t matter much against the overmatched Kings. Brooklyn scored 74 points in the first half, led by as many as 28 and shot 58% overall. TIP-INS Nets: DeAndre Jordan was back in the lineup after sitting out Saturday’s win at Golden State for personal reasons. Jordan finished with 10 points and eight boards. ... Brooklyn set a franchise record with its eighth game of 130 points or more. ... It was the seventh time in 20 games with the Nets that Irving scored 30 or more. Kings: Marvin Bagley III had 19 points and seven rebounds after missing two games because of a sore left calf. … Sacramento scored 22 points in the paint during the first quarter. … Because of the back-to-back, Richaun Holmes was rested with a sore right knee. Cory Joseph started and scored a season-high 22 points.","401267586"

"Ja Morant flies to the rim and throws down a dunk vs. the Pelicans. (0:20) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — When Zion Williamson mixes up his game, the New Orleans Pelicans can be tough to stop. Williamson scored 31 points while dominating inside, and the Pelicans finished with a season high in points while ending a three-game skid with a 144-113 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. “I’m always on the move, so the defense has to not only adjust to me trying to get to a spot, but they also have to adjust to me making a move,” Williamson said. “I feel like I pull the defense in so I can find my teammates a lot easier.” Williamson, who was 13 of 16 from the field, added seven rebounds and six assists. “He’s just tough. There’s only so much you can do,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said, adding that the team has improved in the past month and “a lot of that is because of the efficiency of Brandon (Ingram) and Zion and their willingness to pass and set people up.” “We keep trying to find more and more ways to use (Williamson),” Van Gundy said. Josh Hart scored a season-high 27 points and Ingram added 22 for New Orleans. Ja Morant, who was picked second in the 2019 draft behind Williamson, scored 28 points on 12-of-16 shooting for Memphis. Kyle Anderson finished with 19 points and Dillon Brooks scored 18, going 4 of 6 from 3-point range. “They’ve played well, and we haven’t,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. The Pelicans, who won their fifth straight over the Grizzlies, pulled away in the third quarter, outscoring Memphis 38-23 to take a 101-81 lead into the fourth. Memphis never threatened in the final frame as the Pelicans’ lead eventually stretched to 34 points. “We just kept getting stop after stop after stop,” Hart said. “We were getting out in transition, play fast and knock down shots. That lead started to balloon. Fourth quarter, we did the same thing.” Van Gundy was reasonably pleased that New Orleans held Memphis to 48% shooting and forced 19 turnovers. “The issue is, it’s got to be consistent from possession to possession,” he said. “People will still score. You can’t give away possessions because of a lack of effort and lack of focus and a lack of toughness. Those three things you can’t give away. “Tonight was better.” TIP-INS Pelicans: Wrapped up a four-game trip with a 1/3 record. ... Are 16-0 against the Grizzlies when scoring at least 110 points. ... JJ Redick missed his first free throw of the season late in the third quarter, ending a string of 33 straight. ... Either Williamson or Ingram has led Pelicans in scoring all but one game this season. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, the second-year pro from Virginia Tech, scored 37 against the Clippers on Jan. 13. Grizzlies: Morant had eight assists, ending a string of three straight games of double-digit assists. ... Dillon Brooks made four 3-pointers, passing Marc Gasol for seventh on the franchise list with 302 3s. INJURY REPORT The Grizzlies were without guard De’Anthony Melton (sore left shoulder). Jenkins said Melton is day-to-day. Meanwhile, Jenkins said Justise Winslow and Jaren Jackson Jr. are getting closer to returning. Neither has played this season.","401267589"
"Pat Connaughton blocks Norman Powell's intended 3-pointer, then blocks Kyle Lowry's layup, and the Bucks capitalize with buckets of their own both times. (0:44) MILWAUKEE -- — Fred VanVleet scored 33 points, Pascal Siakam added 23 and the Toronto Raptors withstood the loss of Kyle Lowry to beat the slumping Milwaukee Bucks 124-113 on Tuesday night. Lowry exited with a sore left ankle in the third quarter but had 18 points, six rebounds and six assists in 22 minutes. The ankle problem caused Lowry to go to the locker room late in the first half, though he returned to start the third quarter. “He hit it a couple of times, once in the first half and then once in the second,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “They're going to evaluate it thoroughly here tonight and we should know more here tomorrow.” Even with Lowry out of the game, the Raptors never fell behind in the second half. “Any time a guy goes down, it's that next-man-up mentality that we've always had here,” VanVleet said. “Something I've tried to continue to do is increase my level of play when he's out. I thought the entire team just picked it up a notch when he went down. That's what you like to see.” Milwaukee lost its fourth straight despite getting 34 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists and five steals from Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Bucks hadn’t dropped four in a row since the 2019 Eastern Conference finals against Toronto, when they blew a 2-0 lead and lost the series in six games. Antetokounmpo nearly recorded his second straight triple-double. The two-time reigning MVP had 24 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists Sunday in a 114-109 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. “You've just got to go to work the next day,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We've got to look at the film. We've got to go to practice. We've got to see where we can get better. Nobody's happy with the result. Nobody feels good about it.” Siakam added 13 rebounds and six assists. VanVleet had a team-high seven assists. The Bucks were playing the first of eight straight home games after ending a six-game road trip. This prolonged homestand also gives the Bucks the chance to play in front of spectators at Fiserv Forum for the first time this season. Tuesday’s game featured only about 250 invited guests and family members of players in an arena that seats over 17,000. But the return home couldn't end the Bucks' slide. Milwaukee trailed 112-103 and then scored six straight points before Donte DiVincenzo missed a potential tying corner 3-pointer with 5:08 remaining. The Raptors answered with seven straight points and stayed in front by at least six the rest of the way. OG Anunoby returned to action after missing 10 games with a strained left calf and had 13 points and seven rebounds in 27 minutes. Chris Boucher scored 14 points and Norman Powell had 11. Pat Connaughton had a season-high 20 points and Bobby Portis scored 16 for the Bucks. DiVincenzo had 12 points and eight assists but shot just 1 of 8 from 3-point range. TIP-INS Raptors: With 6-foot-10 center Aron Baynes moving to the bench to make room for Anunoby, the Raptors opened the game with a lineup that didn’t include anyone taller than 6-9.

Bucks: The Bucks hadn’t lost four straight in the regular season since Feb. 25 to March 2, 2018. … Jrue Holiday missed a fifth straight game due to the NBA’s health and safety protocols. ...

"Karl-Anthony Towns drives in for an easy dunk after getting Montrezl Harrell in the air with a pump fake. (0:17) MINNEAPOLIS -- — The Los Angeles Lakers strengthened their rotation during the abbreviated offseason, realizing that defending their NBA title amid the ongoing pandemic would require ample depth. The absence of Anthony Davis will give their enhanced roster an extended test. LeBron James had 30 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists and Dennis Schröder scored 24 points, helping the Lakers beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-104 on Tuesday night. “We’re not expecting one person to try to pick up A.D.’s productivity. Nobody’s going to be able to do that. He just brings too much to the table. But we all can do more,” James said. Montrezl Harrell pitched in 17 points for the Lakers, who stopped a seven-game losing streak at Minnesota with their first win at Target Center since March 25, 2015. The energy and production provided by the four new players on the 2020-21 squad — Schröder and Marc Gasol with the starters and Harrell and Wes Matthews off the bench — was palpable. “We’re going to attack this stretch of games and be confident in what we have on this roster, embrace the challenge of playing without A.D. Every guy has got to step up,” coach Frank Vogel said. Minnesota rookie Anthony Edwards had a career-high 28 points. The Lakers otherwise played sound defense in the first of what will be several games without Davis, the seven-time All-Star who was shelved with an injury to his Achilles tendon. He aggravated it in a loss at Denver on Sunday that ended the Lakers' seven-game winning streak. The Lakers were far from sharp — James had four of his five turnovers in the first quarter — but efficient enough on offense to emerge victorious over the team with the worst record in the league. “You’ve got to do nearly everything right to come out with a victory against them,” Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. Ricky Rubio and Jordan McLaughlin each scored 13 points for the Timberwolves, sharing time at point guard in the continued absence of D’Angelo Russell, who will miss the next four to six weeks after surgery on his left knee. Karl-Anthony Towns scored a quiet 15 points for the Timberwolves, who were outscored 17-5 to start the fourth quarter after a spirited effort over the first three periods. Towns didn’t even get a shot in the fourth, with Edwards taking over. “I know Ant had it going, but I’m the point guard out there and I’ve got to know who to get the ball to,” Rubio said. Harrell's defense on Towns had something to do with that, too, despite giving up four inches. “I don’t really believe in that smaller stuff, because at the end of the day if you believed in that, man, then the elephant would be the king of the jungle,” Harrell said. FINISHING STRONG Edwards, the first overall pick in the draft, hit his fourth and fifth 3-pointers of the game to cut the lead to 105-100 with 3:28 to go. Edwards was called for a charging foul on James, knocking the four-time league MVP over and negating a runner in the lane with 2:57 left, and the Timberwolves never got any closer. “He’s playing at a great level, and we’re trying to build confidence in him and let him know that we believe in him,” Towns said. NO GO The Lakers won the first meeting in Los Angeles by 36 points on Dec. 27, when Towns was out with a dislocated wrist. The absence of Davis from this one meant yet another missed matchup of two of the NBA's best big men — and first overall draft picks out of Kentucky, three years apart. The Lakers' visit to Minnesota last season was wiped out by the pandemic. TIP-INS Lakers: Davis is unlikely to return before the All-Star break, Vogel said. The cautious approach means Davis, whose official diagnosis is a right calf strain, would miss at least eight more games. ... Gasol played a season-high 30 minutes. Timberwolves: Jarrett Culver, who missed his 12th consecutive game with a sprained left ankle, has been upgraded to on-court activity. The team said he could return to action late next week. ... Malik Beasley had 11 points on 4-for-15 shooting after averaging 25 points over his last four games.","401267591"

Lillard rescued them by making all four of his 3-point tries — all from at least 25 feet — during the closing run while playing with five fouls. On one, he had Thunder defensive stopper Lu Dort in his face and hit a step-back, 28-footer to give the Trail Blazers a 109-102 lead. It was enough to make Portland coach Terry Stotts dust off 1970s movie references. “When he made those, all I could think of was the theme from the movie ‘Shaft,’"" Stotts said. ""That Dame is a bad -- somebody say ‘Shut your mouth!’ Can you dig it?” Lillard also had 10 assists and seven rebounds. At one point, teammate Enes Kanter put his hands on his head in amazement. “I went up to him and told him, ‘You crazy, man!’"" Kanter said. ""He’s like a cheat code. I’ve never seen anything like this before and I’ve played with some great, great players.” Gary Trent Jr. scored 19 points and Kanter had eight points and 21 rebounds for Portland, which has won five straight. Lillard is averaging 30.2 points during the streak. Portland has been rolling despite C.J. McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic being out for the past month. McCollum has a fracture in his left foot and Nurkic has a fractured right wrist. Dort scored 23 points and Hamidou Diallo added 17 for the Thunder. Oklahoma City guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the team’s leading scorer, missed his fourth consecutive game with a sprained left knee. The Thunder trailed by 22 in the second quarter before finishing strong and cutting the deficit to 64-50 at the break. Anfernee Simons scored all of his 15 points in the first half for Portland. Oklahoma City, as has been customary this season, was hard to shake. The Thunder made a run, but Portland still took a 93-79 lead into the fourth quarter. Oklahoma City stayed hot, and Dort's 3-pointer put the Thunder up 98-97 midway through the fourth. “I feel like it just takes will and fight,” Diallo said. “And I feel like with this group of guys that we have here, we’re never going to give up, no matter what we’re down."" Portland scored four points in almost eight minutes to start the final period before getting its offense going again. The Trail Blazers closed the game on an 18-2 run. Oklahoma City's last field goal was a layup by Diallo with 5:09 remaining. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Former Thunder player Carmelo Anthony scored 10 points on 4-for-14 shooting. ... Anthony was called for a technical in the second quarter. ... Lillard picked up his fourth foul with 1:05 left in the first half and his fifth with 4:48 remaining in the game. Thunder: Rookie point guard Theo Maledon returned after missing four games due to health and safety protocols. He played 28 minutes and scored seven points. ... Isaiah Roby had 11 points and 10 rebounds. QUOTABLE Kanter on one of Lillard's deep 3s late in the game: “There is no way to guard him. And that was not a bad shot. That was a good shot, by the way. It is a bad shot for everyone else, but not for Dame.” STAT LINES Kanter is averaging 12.6 rebounds during Portland's win streak -- an uptick from his season average of 11 per game.","401267592"
"James Harden drives inside and finishes through contact for a layup. (0:22) PHOENIX -- — James Harden relished the chance to share the scoring load when he joined the star-filled Brooklyn Nets earlier this season. But with his All-Star buddies cheering in street clothes from the bench, Harden showed he can still fill up a box score and provide plenty of fourth-quarter heroics if needed. Harden scored 38 points, Joe Harris added 22 and the Nets overcame a 24-point deficit to stun the Phoenix Suns 128-124 on Tuesday night. While Harden was the undeniable star for the Nets, his teammates provided plenty of good moments, too. The bench added 40 points and Harris scored 15 in the second half. “It’s the true definition of a team,” Harden said. “One or two guys go down, next man up.” The Nets were playing without two of their three main stars, but Harden was more than up for the challenge. Kevin Durant was out with a hamstring injury while Kyrie Irving was held out with lower back tightness. Harden's 3-pointer from a few feet beyond the arc with 31 seconds left gave the Nets their first lead of the game at 126-124 and he hit two more free throws with 11.3 seconds remaining to polish off the win. Harden shot 14 of 22 from the field and added 11 assists and seven rebounds. The Suns didn't score over the final 2:48. “All vibes in (the locker room) right now,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. “Guys are rightfully excited, it’s great for morale. Missing Kevin and Kyrie and finding a way to make up a 24-point deficit. They showed a lot of heart.” Brooklyn won its fourth straight game in a triumphant return to Phoenix for Nash. The Suns had their six-game winning streak snapped. Chris Paul scored 29 points, including 17 in the fourth quarter, but it wasn’t enough for the Suns. Devin Booker added 22. Phoenix jumped out a 33-22 lead in the first quarter after shooting 56.5% from the field. The Suns were even better in the second, pouring in 42 points to grab a 75-54 halftime lead. But the Nets were about to pull off their biggest halftime comeback since joining the NBA in 1976. Brooklyn sliced Phoenix's lead to 100-88 by the end of the third quarter. Suns coach Monty Williams said that was the time when his team lost the momentum. “I thought the first four, five, six minutes of the third quarter our offense was in mud,” Williams said. “The ball movement wasn’t there. The urgency just wasn’t there and we gave a team life.” The Nets would pull within 108-106 midway through the fourth after a corner 3-pointer from Tyler Johnson but the Suns responded with a dunk from Deandre Ayton and a 3 from Mikal Bridges and it looked like they would regain control. But the Nets had one more run. Harden sliced through the Suns' defense to pull Brooklyn within 124-121 with 1:39 left. Jeff Green's layup with 59 seconds made it 124-123. That set up Harden's decisive 3-pointer on the next possession. “That one was fun,” Johnson said. TIP-INS Nets: Johnson got his first start of the season in Irving's place. The 28-year-old Johnson spent the first half of last season with the Suns before being released in February. Johnson finished with 17 points in 32 minutes. Suns: Phoenix had a full roster for a second game in a row. The logjam in playing time was one reason the Suns sent rookie forward Jalen Smith to the G League on Monday. The No. 10 overall pick out of Maryland had played in eight games and was averaging 1.8 points and 1.3 rebounds. ... The Suns were able to host a season-high 3,000 fans for Tuesday's game. Phoenix started the season with no fans at the arena before allowing 1,500 per game at the beginning of the current seven-game homestand. ... Booker got a technical foul in the first quarter for arguing with officials from the bench. WELCOME BACK, STEVE Nash got a big cheer during introductions and one fan shouted “We love Steve Nash!” just before the singing started in the national anthem. The point guard had the best years of his career with the Suns and was a two-time league MVP. Phoenix hasn’t been to the playoffs since he left in 2012. “This place means a lot to me, obviously,” Nash said. “Had some incredible years here, incredible teams, teammates, coaches, the organization was first class. And the fans here were fantastic. Lived here for 10 years and loved every minute of it.”","401267593"
"Michael-Carter Williams drives the lane and throws down a dunk. (0:24) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Terrence Ross scored 18 of his season-high 30 points in the second half, and the Orlando Magic used a decisive third-quarter run to beat the New York Knicks 107-89 on Wednesday night. Orlando went on a 25-8 run over the final nine minutes of the third quarter and outscored New York 30-14 in the period to wipe out a three-point halftime deficit. The Knicks shot 6 of 20 in the third quarter and 12 of 48 (25%) in the second half as their season-best three-game winning streak ended. “It was a good team effort, especially since the Knicks have been playing well for the last seven games,” Ross said. “Julius (Randle) has been on a roll and is having a great year. We had to dig deep and figure out how to slow him down. In that second half, we were on the same page, tied together and we closed it out.” Ross made 10 of 16 shots and 5 of 6 3-pointers. With Orlando up 11 early in the fourth quarter, Ross buried three free throws after being fouled beyond the arc and then sank a 3-pointer to push the score to 89-72. Randle had 25 points and seven rebounds for New York, but Orlando limited him to eight points in the second half. Randle was coming off a season-best 44 points on Monday in a win over Atlanta. “I feel like it was a good opportunity for us, but we just didn’t have it for whatever reason,” Randle said. “We’ll chalk it up, look at the film and see how we can correct it.” RJ Barrett added 15 points for the Knicks, who fell to 2-9 when failing to score 100 points. The Knicks, who are 9-6 against teams with winning records, fell to 5-9 against losing squads. Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 17 rebounds, his 20th double-double of the season. Evan Fournier, playing for the first time in more than a week because of back spasms, scored 19 points. Orlando hit 16 of 34 3-point attempts and shot 45.7% from the floor. INJURY REPORT The injury-plagued Magic welcomed back Fournier, the team’s second-leading scorer who had missed 14 of the past 23 games while battling back spasms. Al-Farouq Aminu played in just his second game of the season for Orlando. James Ennis III was sidelined with a groin injury. “Back spasms is nothing and it’s everything,” Fournier said. “I don’t really know how to explain to you what I am dealing with, but it’s hard because when it’s a finger or a joint, you know how long you are going to be out and what the rehab process is like. The back is tricky because sometimes you feel good and sometimes you don’t. I’m in a tough spot, to be honest.” TIP-INS Knicks: Coach Tom Thibodeau said guard Frank Ntilikina rejoined the team Wednesday morning. Ntilikina had been quarantined because of COVID-19 contact tracing. Magic: Rookie guard Cole Anthony, whose shoulder injury was recently re-diagnosed as a non-displaced rib fracture, won’t return until after next month’s All-Star Game, the team said. ... Asked whether he is in favor of the NBA’s relatively new rule where the No. 8 seed in each conference is decided with a mini-series between the eighth- and ninth-place teams, coach Steve Clifford said: “I am right now!” The Magic came into Wednesday with the 12th-best record in the East. Orlando made the playoffs the past two seasons as the seventh (2019) and eight (2020) seeds.","401267596"
"Facundo Campazzo knocks down a shot from deep despite getting knocked over by Garrison Mathews. (0:30) WASHINGTON -- - Bradley Beal made two free throws with a tenth of a second left to give the Washington Wizards their third straight victory, 130-128 over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night. Davis Bertans had career highs with nine 3-pointers and 35 points, Beal finished with 25 points and a season-high 10 assists, and Russell Westbrook had a triple-double with 12 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists. Washington has won three straight for the first time since Dec. 1-5, 2018. ""When those shots went down, they started looking for me even more, running more plays for me, and I took advantage of that,"" Bertans said. ""My shots are falling, and sometimes there's not much the defense can do."" Denver coach Michael Malone wasn't pleased with his team's defense. ""Obviously, Bertans killed us tonight,"" Malone said. ""He comes off the bench to go 9 for 11 from 3 for 35 points. That guy is supposed to be a guy that's not supposed to get off 11 shots from the 3-point line."" Jamal Murray led Denver with 35 points, and Nikola Jokic scored 33 points. Murray scored Denver's final 11 points, with his 3-pointer tying it at 128 with 2.1 seconds left. Coming off a loss at Boston on Tuesday night, Denver allowed its highest points total of the season. The Nuggets had a 39-19 lead late in the first quarter, but it quickly vanished. ""We were up 20,"" Jokic said. ""We didn't play any defense. We can not have that many letups."" Jokic scored 10 points in the first 3 ½ minutes and 15 in the first quarter, and then coach Scott Brooks put Robin Lopez on him. ""My goal is just to try to make him not quite as comfortable,"" Lopez said. ""He's somebody that likes to be really sneaky and really clever out there."" TIP-INS Nuggets: F Paul Millsap missed his second straight game because of a strained left knee. Malone said he hasn't gotten ""a real clear picture"" of how long Millsap will be out. ... G Gary Harris returned after missing seven games with a strained left abductor. ... F Monte Morris, who missed Tuesday night's game at Boston with a strained right shoulder also returned. Wizards: G Ish Smith will miss six to eight weeks with a right quadriceps injury. ""That's a big chunk of the season,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ... Westbrook was assessed a technical foul in the fourth quarter. BEAL WAITING ON ALL-STAR CALL Beal has twice been an All-Star, and he'll find out on Thursday if he'll get a third invitation. He was disappointed that he wasn't selected last season. ""When I first picked up a basketball, it wasn't to win a trophy,"" Beal said. ""It wasn't to win someone's approval. It wasn't to win someone's vote."" SLEEPLESS NIGHTS FOR BERTANS Before the season, Bertans signed a five-year, $80 million contract extension with Washington, and hadn't been playing well. Entering the game, he was hitting on 34.9% of his 3-pointers. ""Those couple of months have been frustrating as hell,"" Bertans said. ""I can't sleep at night.""","401267597"
"Jayson Tatum uses a step-back move to hit a tough 3-point shot along the sideline with the defender hovering in the area. (0:16) BOSTON -- — Hawks associate head coach Nate McMillan described his team as being “emotionally drunk” at times in close games this season. They followed the lead of their best player to earn a much-needed victory. Trae Young had 40 points and eight assists, and Atlanta snapped a four-game losing streak with a 122-114 victory over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night. Clint Capela finished with 24 points and 13 rebounds to help the Hawks earn their first victory over Boston since April 8, 2018, ending a seven-game losing streak. John Collins added 20 points and six rebounds. “I just think I kind of found a rhythm throughout the whole game and just playing aggressive,"" Young said. ""When you have that aggressive mentality, open shots — you just kind of find them on your own.” The Hawks, who shot a season-high 57% from the field, took a 90-81 lead into the fourth quarter. Boston rallied to cut it to 94-91, but Atlanta responded with an 8-2 run get it back up to 102-93 with 6:33 left. The Celtics tried to employ an intentional foul strategy on Capela. But he was able to connect on three of his next seven free throw attempts, followed by Young's 3-pointer to make it 108-95. Boston made one final push, getting within 118-113 with 13 seconds left after Jayson Tatum was fouled on a 3-point attempt and made all three free throws. But Collins connected on four free throws the rest of the way to close it out. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce missed the game to be with his wife, who was awaiting the birth of their second child in Atlanta. McMillan served as head coach in Pierce’s absence and announced after the game that the baby was born, though he said he hadn’t been informed of the gender. McMillan said he thinks Pierce would be pleased with how Young, who scored 16 points in the final 12 minutes, kept the team together as the Celtics tried to rally late. “(Young) has to show that growth of managing a game whether we’re up or down in the fourth quarter,"" McMillan said. ""I thought he did a good job of when we didn’t have anything, getting us organized down the stretch.” Tatum had 35 points for Celtics, who have lost five out of seven. Jaylen Brown added 22 points. “It’s tough going up and down,” Brown said. ""But I still think there’s a lot to learn, and we have learned a lot.” With Kemba Walker not playing in back-to-back games right now following a preseason procedure on his left knee, Javonte Green took his place in the starting lineup. But it was Tatum who took on the primary role of guarding Young at the outset. While it gave Young with a bigger defender to contend with, it didn’t stop him from facilitating action when Atlanta had the ball. The results were the same when others, including Green and Payton Pritchard switched onto him. Young ended the first half with 15 points and four assists, pacing an offense that shot 60% (24 of 40) from the field and scored 40 points in the paint to take a 62-56 lead into halftime. Boston wasn’t crisp at all offensively, turning it over 10 times. TIP-INS Hawks: Played without Bogdan Bogdanovic (right knee), Rajon Rondo (back). D’Andre Hunter (right knee surgery rehab) and Kris Dunn (right ankle surgery rehab). Celtics: Finished with 15 turnovers. … Walker (load management), Marcus Smart (left calf tear), Daniel Theis (sprained right index finger) and Romeo Langford (right wrist surgery rehab) all sat.

"Joel Embiid sets up for a midrange jump shot and makes it over DeMarcus Cousins. (0:20) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid’s back was hurting. Luckily, for the 76ers his game was not. Embiid had 31 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists and hit a key jumper late to help Philadelphia beat the Houston Rockets 118-113 on Wednesday night. Seth Curry scored 25 points and Tobias Harris added 24 for the Eastern Conference-leading 76ers, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Ben Simmons (illness) didn’t play for the 76ers a game after scoring a career-high 42 points and adding nine rebounds and 12 assists. John Wall scored 28 points for the short-handed Rockets. Houston, playing without injured starters P.J. Tucker, Christian Wood and Victor Oladipo, has lost seven in a row. DeMarcus Cousins and Jae’Sean Tate had 19 points each and Eric Gordon contributed 17. Embiid returned to the lineup after sitting out Monday’s 134-123 loss at Utah due to back stiffness. The 76ers’ big man looked sluggish at times in the first half and grabbed at his back after getting his shot blocked by Cousins with 47.8 seconds left in the first half. “The whole game it was pretty tight,” he said. It looked like Philadelphia’s star big man might be able to rest his aching back in the second half. The 76ers led by 29 points and looked on their way to an easy victory when Tyrese Maxey’s two free throws made it 100-82 with 10:07 to play. But Philadelphia relaxed enough to let Houston slowly back into the contest. “We got sloppy,” 76ers coach Doc Rivers said. Gordon’s 3-pointer with 3:54 remaining cut the margin under double-digits for the first time since early in the second quarter, pulling the Rockets within 108-99. Then, Wall scored eight straight points for the Rockets, the last two on a pair of free throws with 1:28 left, to make it 110-107. Embiid answered with a baseline, 12-foot jump shot and the 76ers made enough free throws in the final minute to hold on. Embiid had 23 points after halftime. “Obviously, things changed and I had to adjust to it,” Embiid said. “I just wanted to make sure that we got the win.” Before entering Philadelphia’s locker room, Embiid sat on a chair, stretched and grimaced. He looked more spry at the start of the second half, scoring early with a pair of layups and a short jumper. And he looked fine when Philadelphia needed him the most in crunch time. SECOND-HALF SURGE Houston coach Stephen Silas was as happy with the second-half comeback as he was disappointed with the first-half performance. “I told them the way we were playing in the first half was unacceptable, unfair to themselves, unfair to everybody and they had a decision to make as far as our professionalism, our overall lackadaisical play,” he said. “Incredibly disappointing in the first half, walking around, not defending, not doing the things we should do. I challenged them to be better and they were.” SIMMONS SITS Rivers said Simmons’ illness wasn’t related to COVID-19. “You cannot say that word,” Rivers jokingly told a reporter when asked if Simmons’ absence had to do with the virus. TIP-INS Rockets: Silas said the Rockets were planning to fly home after the game but were keeping an eye on the weather situation in Houston following a winter storm that left much of the city without power or heat. ...

Sabonis, Brogdon and the Pacers erased a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Indiana trailed 98-88 and eventually took a five-point lead in the fourth. Sabonis knocked down a pair of free throws with 11.1 seconds left in regulation to help send the game to overtime tied at 121. “We got some key stops, and that helped our offense,” said Sabonis, whose 36 points were a career high. The Pacers played their second straight overtime game, coming off an OT loss to Chicago on Monday. After giving up the first five points in overtime Monday, Indiana jumped out to a quick five-point lead Wednesday in OT. Brogdon hit a 3 to start overtime, and Sabonis followed with a basket in the paint for a 5-0 run. “That’s exactly what the guys were talking about at the end of regulation, getting into that last five minutes and really digging in,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. ""I thought we came out more assertive on offense to start that (overtime).” Karl-Anthony Towns had 30 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota. Malik Beasley added 31 points in his first game of the season off the bench, and Ricky Rubio finished with a season-high 20 points and 13 assists. Minnesota lost its second game in as many nights after falling to the Los Angels Lakers 112-104 Tuesday. “I thought we had some tired guys towards the end,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. Timberwolves rookie Anthony Edwards had a good look at a game-winning shot at the end of regulation, but his 3-pointer rimmed out as time expired. Minnesota led 73-69 at halftime. Both teams struggled offensively in the third quarter. Neither team topped 20 points in the period as the Timberwolves moved out to a 92-86 lead heading into the final period. Minnesota was 6 of 22 from the floor in the third. The Wolves led by five in the final minute of regulation after a basket by Towns made it 121-116, but the Pacers made a late push thanks to a 3-pointer by Jeremy Lamb and two free throws by Sabonis. “As a young team, we’ve got to know that in winning time, you can’t make any mistakes,” Rubio said. ""The momentum can change so much. I think we made a lot of mistakes down the stretch.” Coming off a career-high 28 points a night earlier, Edwards was quiet offensively.

"Damian Lillard catches Lonzo Ball off guard and gets the circus shot to drop for the much-needed two points for the Blazers. (0:23) NEW ORLEANS -- — By necessity, Damian Lillard has played hero ball so often this season that it’s difficult to be awed by another sterling performance. Somehow, he continues topping himself. Portland’s leading man showcased his clutch credentials with 43 points, including a go-ahead three-point play with 16.5 seconds left, to lift the Trail Blazers to their sixth consecutive victory, 126-124 over the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night. Lillard also added 16 assists – his third consecutive game of at least 30 points and 10 assists — for a team playing without backcourt mate CJ McCollum and center Jusuf Nurkic. “Our guys fought hard, but we just could not contain him at all,” said Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy. “Stopping them is 90% stopping him.” Lillard had 11 fourth-quarter points and was clutch in the final seven minutes. JJ Redick gave the Pelicans a 105-103 lead with 7:34 left, capping a 7-0 New Orleans run, but Lillard then came off the bench and immediately hit a 3-pointer as Portland regained the lead. Anfernee Simons added a 3-pointer on the next possession to make it 109-105. The Pelicans retook the lead on a pair of 3-pointers by Lonzo Ball and Redick and led for the final time at 124-123 with 26.4 seconds left after Zion Williamson made two free throws. Williamson’s finished with 36 points. But Lillard drove past Ball on the left side of the lane for the layup and drew contact to put Portland up 126-124. “There were 26 seconds on the clock, and I knew that whether we scored or not, if we just got a quality shot and gave ourselves enough time, even if we fouled and they made both free throws, we still would have had a chance to tie and go into overtime,” Lillard said. “So, it was really no pressure on that possession. “I just wanted to attack, make an aggressive move. I was able to get some space. I drew contact and I just focused on the finish.” The Pelicans had a final chance, but Ball missed a 3-pointer and Brandon Ingram threw up an airball at the buzzer. Lillard had 11 points in the third quarter as the Blazers outscored New Orleans 35-22 to take a 94-91 lead, with Gary Trent Jr. hitting a 3-pointer from the right wing at the buzzer. Lillard hit three consecutive 3-pointers in a 1:44 span as part of his 15-point, first-quarter flurry, which keyed a 21-8 run and produced a 35-30 Portland lead. The Blazers led by as many as 11 in the first quarter, but the Pelicans, shooting 52.2%, closed out the period with an 11-5 run. Lillard played the entire first quarter, but when he sat for the first six minutes of the second, the Pelicans made a move, taking a 45-43 lead behind Williamson’s eight points on an array of power moves to the basket from the high post. New Orleans used a 28-9 run to take a 53-45 lead. During one five-minute stretch, New Orleans made nine consecutive shots, including two 3-pointers by Ball and one each by Eric Bledsoe and Willy Hernangomez, to stretch its advantage to 64-49. Ball’s 16 first-half points on 4-of-5 shooting from long range helped the Pelicans to a 39-24 edge in the second quarter and gave the Pelicans a 69-59 halftime lead. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: The Blazers’ postgame flight from Oklahoma City to New Orleans on Tuesday night was canceled due to bad weather, forcing them to fly to New Orleans on Wednesday afternoon and bus directly to the Smoothie King Center. … Coach Terry Stotts gushed over seeing Williamson for the first time. “He’s playing off the dribble, gets to the rim, being a passer, being a facilitator. He’s shooting at an unbelievable rate, mainly because he gets to the rim.” Pelicans: Starting C Steven Adams left in the first quarter with a right ankle injury. ... Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said Williamson is expanding his game quickly by taking opponents off the dribble. Williamson entered the game with an effective field-goal percentage of 62.2, just behind NBA leader Steph Curry (62.3).","401267601"
"Stephen Curry makes a tough 3-pointer to put the game out of reach in overtime. (0:46) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Stephen Curry's supporting cast knew he would finally break out — and he had no doubt either. “Utmost confidence it will fall eventually,” Curry said. “I just was missing, so not losing confidence is huge.” Curry hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:15 left in overtime, passed to Andrew Wiggins for another the next time down before delivering a final dagger from deep, rallying the Golden State Warriors to a 120-112 win over the Miami Heat on Wednesday night. “Everything was in rhythm for Steph. Percentages always catch up for him,” Kent Bazemore said. “We just stayed with it, which is good on him, just staying with it and keep letting it fly. He was huge for us late there.” Bazemore tipped in Wiggins' miss with 1:32 left for one of his two big baskets in OT and finished with a season-high 26 points — his second 20-point performance this season. Curry scored 25 points playing a season-high 42 minutes and overcame an off shooting night by finding his stroke when it mattered most. He added 11 assists and seven rebounds. “It's just a testament to who he is,” Bazemore said. ""When you've got a guy like that who believes in you and instills that confidence in you, you feel like you can do anything."" Jimmy Butler had his second straight triple-double with 13 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists for the Heat, who never trailed in regulation. Curry's 3 with 2:26 left in regulation cut it to 103-101 and he stole the ball from Butler on the other end moments later. Bazemore made consecutive hoops to tie it with 52 seconds remaining. Kelly Oubre Jr. missed a 3 for the win. “The last few minutes of the fourth we were just scrambling out there and I thought Baze kind of led the charge. He really made some huge plays for us and kept us in it,"" coach Steve Kerr said. “Then of course Steph, this is so typical of Steph, he's just the kind of player and the kind of person who can be in the midst of one of his worst shooting nights of the year and still hit three enormous shots to help us win the game.” Kendrick Nunn scored 19 points for Miami, coming off a 125-118 loss at the Clippers on Monday night. Golden State started with a 13-3 burst out of halftime to make it a game again after falling behind 61-46 at the break. Wiggins wound up with 23 points as Curry mostly struggled. Curry was 3 for 11 in the first half, missing eight of his nine 3-point tries. He finished 5 of 20 from long range as Golden State went 18 for 52 and got outrebounded 50-45. ""Once it got close and it became a possession game. That’s when Curry came alive,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Draymond Green was a late scratch by the Warriors because of right ankle soreness they didn't know about until just before tipoff given the team didn't hold a morning shootaround. Mychal Mulder made his fourth career start in Green's place and first of the season. IGGY'S BACK Andre Iguodala received a nice welcome back when he checked into the game for the first time in the final two minutes of the opening quarter. He then scored 10 points against his old team. The 2015 NBA Finals MVP did a little bit of everything in six seasons for the Warriors from 2013-19. “That’s why Andre will always be one of my favorites just his selflessness and willingness to do whatever it takes to win a game,” Kerr said. TIP-INS Heat: Butler has grabbed eight or more rebounds in nine straight games. ... The Heat dropped to 4-10 on the road with their third straight loss away from home. ... The Heat swept last season's series with the Warriors and had their three-game winning streak in the series snapped. Warriors: C Kevon Looney was re-evaluated before missing his eighth straight game with a sprained left ankle. He has resumed some portions of practice and Kerr hopes he will be back on the floor in the latter part of an upcoming four-game road trip. ... Rookie James Wiseman is scheduled to have his sprained left wrist examined again Thursday and if all is well could return as soon as Friday vs. the Magic. ""I can’t wait to get on the floor, which should be pretty soon,” Wiseman said.","401267603"
"Rudy Gobert comes up with the block on one end, then Donovan Mitchell tosses a pass between defenders to Gobert for the hammer finish in the lane for the Jazz. (0:21) LOS ANGELES -- — Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points, Rudy Gobert had 23 points and 20 rebounds, and the Utah Jazz rolled past the short-handed Los Angeles Clippers 114-96 on Wednesday night for their ninth consecutive victory. Jordan Clarkson scored 18 points for the NBA-leading Jazz, who improved to 24-5 with their 20th win in 21 games. After three tight quarters, Utah broke it open in the fourth to win this matchup of Western Conference powerhouses — although it wasn't a proper showdown with the Clippers missing injured superstars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. With the 7-foot-1 Gobert scoring 17 points in the second half while playing a dominant game on both ends of the court, the Jazz beat the Clippers for the ninth time in the teams' last 12 matchups. “I think it really started from the defensive end, our physicality,” Gobert said. “They were really aggressive in the first half. They were just playing harder than us. Regardless of who we play, we can’t really let that happen if we’re going to be the team we want to be. In the second half, we became more aggressive and we got better shots.” After a rough first half that didn't resemble Utah's impressive recent play, the Jazz opened up a tight game with a 14-2 run spanning the third and fourth quarters, followed by a 16-3 run to put it away. “(Gobert) was the aggressor on defense, on the boards, everywhere,” Mitchell said. “That’s something that really set the tone. He did that from the jump. That’s the Rudy we need every day, and he’s been doing that.” Lou Williams scored 16 points and Reggie Jackson added 15 for the Clippers, whose four-game winning streak ended. The Clippers were profoundly disadvantaged in this heavyweight matchup: Leonard missed his third straight game with a bruised leg, and George missed his seventh straight with an injured toe. Nicolas Batum also sat out with a concussion, leaving LA without three regular starters. “I can't fault our effort and our competing, (but) it’s just one of those games where they played well enough to beat us, especially in the fourth quarter when they got it going,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “That’s why they’re the best in the league defensively, because of the way they make you play.” The Clips fell to 3-2 this season when playing without both Leonard and George. The Jazz played without Mike Conley, who had hamstring tightness. TIP-INS Jazz: Conley has missed six straight games. ... Clarkson, the former Lakers guard, scored 11 points in the second half. He dropped 40 on the 76ers on Monday. Clippers: Batum missed his second straight game after taking a shot to the head last week. ... Patrick Beverley returned after missing Monday's win over Miami to rest on the second date of a back-to-back set. GOOD START Despite their injury absences, the Clippers’ supporting cast made Utah uncomfortable on offense throughout the first half. Los Angeles took a 51-46 lead into the break while soundly outrebounding Utah, forcing poor shots and bothering its usually fluid ball movement. Both teams credited Gobert with changing the game after halftime. “Their guard play is pretty good in the pick-and-roll, so when you have a big like Rudy Gobert setting solid screens, it makes it hard to guard him,” said Amir Coffey, who scored 13 points for Los Angeles. “He does a good job finishing around the rim and cleaning up misses. Sometimes it’s just tough to handle what he can do.”","401267604"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo reacts to the Bucks recent losing streak and how the team can get back in the win column. (0:37) MILWAUKEE -- — Norman Powell's efficiency ensured the Toronto Raptors would extend the Milwaukee Bucks' longest skid in four years. Powell matched a season high with 29 points, Pascal Siakam had 27 and the Raptors beat Milwaukee 110-96 on Thursday night to hand the Bucks their fifth consecutive loss. “I thought we did a great job as a team of moving the ball and playing hard on defense to open up our transition so we could get easy looks,” Powell said. Powell shot 9 of 12 overall, 4 of 7 from 3-point range and 7 of 8 from the free-throw line. He had 15 points in the first quarter alone and made a pair of 3-pointers to start a 21-4 run that put the Raptors ahead for good. “He was aggressive and decisive tonight,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. The Bucks last dropped five straight games from Jan. 25 to Feb. 3 in 2017. Milwaukee’s entire slide has come without guard Jrue Holiday, who has missed six consecutive games due to health and safety protocols. “When things go bad, that’s where you get better... that’s where you improve,” said Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had 23 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists before fouling out. “You can turn the other way and just go home and quit, or you’ve just got to keep fighting. We might lose 10 in a row. I don’t know. I don’t know what the future holds. But I know that we’ve got to have good thoughts, and behind our actions, we’ve got to have effort.” Toronto wasn't at full strength for this one either and still defeated the Bucks for the second time in three nights. The Raptors beat the Bucks 124-113 on Tuesday despite losing Kyle Lowry to a sore left ankle early in the third quarter. Lowry didn’t play at all Thursday, though the Raptors said it was due to a sprained left thumb rather than his sore ankle. Fred VanVleet scored 17 points for the Raptors. Milwaukee's Donte DiVincenzo had 14 points, Khris Middleton 13, Brook Lopez 12 and Bryn Forbes 11. After trailing by as many as 23, the Bucks got the margin down to 10 on a number of occasions but couldn't get any closer. “The competitiveness, the spirit was actually better,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “I think guys were covering for each other. Guys were scrambling. I know it’s (about) results. People are going to look and see another loss, but the togetherness, the competitiveness, the spirit was better tonight. We’ve got to build on that.” TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto won convincingly despite collecting just two offensive rebounds. ... Bembry made his first start of the season and had five points and four assists in 38 minutes. Aron Baynes, who had started the first 24 games in which he’d played this season, came off the bench for a second straight time. Bucks: Before the game, Antetokounmpo was named an All-Star Game starter for the fifth consecutive season. ... The Bucks scored just 15 points in the second quarter, their lowest point total in any quarter all season. ... Bobby Portis' only points of the night came on a basket in the game's final second. Portis had scored at least 15 points in each of his last three games. CROWD GETTING (SLIGHTLY) BIGGER The Bucks played in front of 500 spectators — invited guests and family members of players — as they gradually work their way up to playing in front of 10% capacity at Fiserv Forum. The Bucks will welcome the general public to a home game for the first time Sunday when they allow about 1,800 spectators for a game with Sacramento.","401267605"
"Frank Vogel says that Anthony Davis has been reevaluated by team doctors and will be out four weeks because of a calf strain. (1:36) LOS ANGELES -- — James Harden scored 23 points, Joe Harris added 21 with six 3-pointers and the Brooklyn Nets routed the short-handed Los Angeles Lakers 109-98 Thursday night for their season-best fifth straight victory. Kyrie Irving had 16 points and seven rebounds as Brooklyn easily won this matchup of NBA title contenders and improved to 4-0 on a five-game West Coast road trip even without Kevin Durant, who missed his third straight game with a strained left hamstring. “I don’t think we’re getting too carried away,” Brooklyn coach Steve Nash said. “We played a solid game and got a good win on the road, but it’s early and we’ve got a lot of growing to do. We have to take the opportunity to get better regardless of the results, but it also feels sweet when you go out West and win some games."" The Nets knew this statement win had an asterisk: Anthony Davis and Dennis Schröder sat out for Los Angeles, leaving the defending champions without two of their top three scorers. “We’ll see them down the road again with a whole entire healthy Lakers team,” Irving said. “That’s what we wanted, and we expect that.” LeBron James scored his 35,000th career point while getting 32 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Lakers. Kyle Kuzma added 16 points and 10 rebounds for Los Angeles, which lost for only the second time in 10 games. “Missing AD and then our starting point guard in Dennis, it’s a big blow for us,” James said. “But they’re missing key players as well. Neither team was full strength. We just didn’t play up to our capabilities tonight. Give them credit.” Davis missed his second straight game after aggravating his strained right calf last weekend, and Schröder was a late scratch under the NBA’s health and safety protocols. “Obviously AD is an MVP-caliber player, and then Dennis, he’s our engine,” Lakers guard Quinn Cook said. “He makes everything go with his pace and his defense. Guys have to step up, but to lose him right before tipoff, it’s something we definitely haven’t dealt with all season.” Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot scored 15 points and hit five of the 18 3-pointers by the Nets, who pulled away comfortably in the second half. Brooklyn also showed off its recently improved defense, limiting the Lakers’ good looks all night. “It’s about time we turned the corner defensively,” Irving said. “No team is going to win anything in this league if they don’t get stops. We heard (Nash) loud and clear the last few games. It’s one of our points of emphasis.” TIP-INS Nets: DeAndre Jordan had seven points and eight rebounds in the longtime Clippers center's latest return to Staples Center. ... Brooklyn improved to 10-1 against teams above .500. Lakers: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored nine points on his 28th birthday. ... Lakers coach Frank Vogel said Davis will be sidelined for four weeks, stretching into the second half of the season. Los Angeles intends to be conservative with the All-NBA big man, allowing him to return to full strength before he plays again. LEBRON'S MILESTONE James became the third player — and the youngest player — in NBA history with 35,000 points on a free throw late ein the first half. James was also the youngest in NBA history to 5,000 points, 10,000 points, 20,000 points and 30,000 points. James received his 17th consecutive All-Star invitation earlier in the day and was named a captain for the game, along with Durant. STREAKING NETS Along with their longest overall winning streak in two years, the Nets have won four straight road games for the first time since December 2008. They’ve also got seven straight wins over Western Conference opponents for their longest streak since November 2006.","401267606"
"After Hassan Whiteside rejects Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo picks up the ball and posterizes his former teammate. (0:22) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Jimmy Butler had 13 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for his third consecutive triple-double, and the Miami Heat beat the Sacramento Kings 118-110 to end a three-game losing streak on Thursday night. Bam Adebayo also had a triple-double with 16 points, 10 assists and 12 rebounds to help Miami to its first win in Sacramento in nearly five years. Tyler Herro scored 27 points and Kelly Olynyk added a season-high 22 points and seven rebounds. Butler and Adebayo are the first players in NBA history to have triple-doubles in the same game multiple times, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. They also did it against Atlanta on Dec. 10, 2019. “They have to shoulder big-time responsibilities for us. That’s not only on court but from a leadership standpoint,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “That’s what they signed up for. That’s what they earn their paychecks for. The way our offense is designed, they play-make quite a bit and get other guys involved.” The NBA hadn’t had a triple-double by two players on the same team in the same game since Ja Morant and Jonas Valanciunas did it together for Memphis on Aug. 13, 2020. “We were just out there playing,” Adebayo said. “We’re trying to get a win. A win matters more than the numbers did. I’m glad we did the triple-double thing again, but I’m really appreciative of the W.” Olynyk was in awe of what his teammates did. “It’s uncanny to have a player that go get a player triple-double any night of the season,” Olynyk said. “To have two on the same night, I’m not sure if every team has that luxury. We need that. We’re welcoming that and riding their coattails.” Already the only player in franchise history with triple-doubles in consecutive games after doing it against the Clippers and Warriors, Butler made it three in a row with season-highs in assists and rebounds against the Kings. One day after blowing a 15-point halftime lead and losing to the Warriors in overtime, the Heat built another early lead and this time held on against the short-handed and sloppy Kings. Miami led by 23 points in the third before Sacramento made four consecutive 3s and closed the quarter on a 19-9 run to pull within 89-79. The Heat pulled away early in the fourth after Herro made a 3-pointer and three-point play on consecutive possessions. “You want to see if your team can grow and respond to different things and do better,” Spoelstra said. “I think there were certainly some things that we handled better tonight in the second half. There was probably a 4-5 minute stretch where we didn’t get back in transition with the level of detail and sense of urgency we had in the first half, but for the most part it was adequate.” Marvin Bagley III had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento. De’Aaron Fox added 11 points and 10 assists. The Kings have lost five straight following a season-best four-game win streak. “We have to get back to how we were playing,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “We really miss some of our guys but we have to be tougher, we have to pay attention to detail. We have to know these types of things going into games.” Miami got a big lift in the first half from Herro, who had 14 points in the first quarters after making seven of his first nine shots. Andre Iguodala added a steal in the backcourt and dunk to put the Heat up 57-43. TIP-INS Heat: Miami’s last win in Sacramento was on April 1, 2016. … Duncan Robinson made the first shot in the first, second and fourth quarters. Kings: Starters Harrison Barnes (left foot strain) and Richaun Holmes (right knee soreness) did not play. .

"Draymond Green hits the triple before the third quarter ends, and he shouts at the Magic bench after the play. (0:19) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Nikola Vucevic had 30 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists for his third career triple-double and the Orlando Magic overcame a 13-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Golden State Warriors 124-120 on Friday night. Up 17 early in the second half, the Magic found themselves trailing 106-93 with 8:50 to play. However, Orlando outscored the Warriors 31-14 the rest of the way by getting three 3-pointers from rookie forward Chuma Okeke and a strong closing kick from Vucevic. Vucevic made two free throws with 16 seconds left to put Orlando ahead 123-120 after Warriors star Stephen Curry hit back-to-back 3-pointers in the final minute. Curry missed an off-balance 3-pointer from 27 feet with five seconds left that could have tied it. “We were able to stay together because it’s difficult to have a big lead and then have it disappear in like a 3-minute span just from out mistakes,” Vucevic said. “We were just able to fight back. We stuck together and that’s something we struggled to do in the past. It shows growth.” Curry finished with 29 points, 11 assists and six rebounds. He notched his 12th straight game with at least 25 points despite making just 11 of 29 shots and only 6 of 16 3-pointers. “It was really an emotional roller coaster all night,” Curry said. “That’s kind of the theme of our season.” Kelly Oubre Jr. added 26 points for Golden State, and Andrew Wiggins had 16. Golden State was trying to win three straight games for the first time this season, but failed to get past two in a row for the seventh time. “We should have won this game tonight and continued on our winning streak, but we let another one get away,” said Draymond Green, who returned from an ankle injury and had six points, nine assists and six rebounds. ”That’s kind of been the story line of the season.” Evan Fournier scored a season-high 28 points for Orlando, and Terrence Ross had 24 points and four 3-pointers. Okeke had all 11 of his points and three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. The Magic made 18 3-pointers. Golden State appeared to have grabbed control of the game when it unleashed a 52-22 run over a 12-minute stretch of the second half. But the Warriors’ offensive efficiency crumbled late, head coach Steve Kerr said. “I’ll have to watch the tape, but it seemed like to me it was one pass and a shot,” Kerr said of the game's final 5 minutes. “We stopped doing what got us the lead. When you do that and you are giving up hoops at the other end the whole game shifts.” TIP INS Warriors: Green was back in the starting lineup after missing the previous game with ankle soreness.

"Joel Embiid drops a career-high 50 points to go with 17 rebounds as the 76ers defeat the Bulls 112-105. (1:45) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid was simply unstoppable. Embiid scored a career-high 50 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 112-105 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Friday night. Embiid added 17 rebounds, five assists, four blocks and two steals in a dominating performance at both ends of the court. “The only difference from this year and last year is about me being willing to dominate every single moment I’m on the floor on defense and on offense,” Embiid said. Tobias Harris had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Eastern Conference-leading 76ers, who played without Ben Simmons (illness) for the second straight game and clinched coaching duties for Doc Rivers at the All-Star Game. Having Embiid, of course, has helped. “It’s good to have him on our side, I’ll tell you that,” Rivers said. Zach LaVine scored 30 points for the Bulls. With the 76ers clinging to a 107-103 lead, Embiid blocked LaVine’s driving attempt with 1:02 remaining, then hit a 17-foot baseline jumper with 41 seconds left. When the Bulls called timeout, Embiid jogged to center court and put both hands up as if requesting cheers from the empty seats while the speakers played artificial “M-V-P!” “M-V-P!” chants. “I play for the fans, and I play for the city,” Embiid said. “I always feel like they’re here with us even though they’re not.” The Bulls did fine when Embiid wasn’t in the game. With Embiid on the bench at the start of the fourth, the Bulls used a 10-2 run over the first 3 1/2 minutes to take an 89-87 lead after Ryan Arcidiacono stole an inbounds pass and converted a three-point play. Then Embiid returned and scored six points during a 7-0 spurt that made it 94-89. After hitting a 16-footer, he grabbed an offensive rebound and made both free throws after getting fouled and then pulled down another offensive board and scored on a follow on the next possession. “It really just feels like he’s unstoppable,” Philadelphia’s Matisse Thybulle said. “You start to think that maybe there’s no answer for him.” It was still a game, though, as LaVine and the Bulls were playing tough until Embiid clinched it with his defensive and offensive prowess. “Overall I thought the guys really competed, battled and hung in there,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. Voted an All-Star for the fourth consecutive season on Thursday, Embiid scored 25 first-half points in a variety of ways, seemingly however he wanted. “I’ve been adding a lot to my game and it’s been working well,” he said. Embiid put an exclamation point on the half with 33 seconds remaining before the break by dribbling from Philadelphia’s free throw line, deking past Wendell Carter Jr. in the Bulls’ paint, scoring and getting fouled -- an amazing show of athleticism from the 7-foot-2 big man. Then, during one 29-second stretch in the third quarter, Embiid hit a 3-pointer, stole Thad Young’s pass and then assisted Tyrese Maxey’s fast-break layup. Maxey’s bucket gave Philadelphia its largest lead, 83-73 with 1:59 left in the third. TIP-INS Bulls: Arcidiacono, who played collegiately at nearby Villanova, had 10 points and four assists. … Have lost six in a row in Philadelphia. … Mo Cheeks, whose retired No. 10 76ers jersey hangs in the rafters in Philadelphia, is an assistant for the Bulls. 76ers: Shake Milton (ankle) missed his fifth straight game, but Rivers said before the contest that he expects Milton to return on Sunday. … Improved to 13-2 at home. … Embiid’s previous career high was 49 points. BIRDIES OVER BASKETS The victory gave Philadelphia the best record in the Eastern Conference through games played Feb. 21. That made Rivers the coach of the team captained by Kevin Durant, the leading vote-getter in the East. While acknowledging prior to the contest that it would be an honor to coach in the All-Star Game, Rivers said his preference would be to play golf over the All-Star break. Instead of tabbing the coach of the team with the best record to lead the All-Stars, Rivers jokingly said that person should get to choose among his colleagues who would be the coach. Asked whom he would select, Rivers said he’d choose Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. LAVINE LOVE All-Star reserves will be announced on Tuesday, and Donovan thinks LaVine belongs on the list. He entered sixth in the NBA with 28.5 points per game. “He’s played at the level of an All-Star caliber player,” Donovan said. “He’s had an incredible year.”","401267610"
"Jaylen Brown throw it up to Robert Williams who throws down the bucket. (0:18) BOSTON -- — Following back-to-back losses to two of the Eastern Conference’s worst teams last week, Kemba Walker offered a simple prescription for what the Celtics needed to do: Play better. They hope their 121-109 victory over the inconsistent Atlanta Hawks on Friday night is a start. Walker scored a season-high 28 points  to help Boston take the second of back-to-back meetings between the teams. “It was a great win for us. I thought we played well,"" Walker said. ""We moved the basketball. Defensively we were in the right spots.. ... Hopefully we can really just build off this.” Jayson Tatum added 25 points and eight rebounds. Jaylen Brown and Tristan Thompson each finished with 17 points to avenge the loss in the first meeting between the teams on Wednesday. The Celtics have won two of three since equaling a season-worst stretch in which they dropped five out of seven. Trae Young led the Hawks with 31 points. Atlanta has lost five of six. Boston led by as many as 27 in the third quarter before that margin was trimmed to 108-99 with 4:50 left in the game. But the Celtics got 10 points the rest of the way from Daniel Theis to close it out. Walker sat out Wednesday’s loss as part of an ongoing effort to manage the load on his left knee. He was joined on the sideline by Theis, who missed his second straight game with a sprained right index finger. Both were back in the starting lineup for Friday’s rematch and made their presence felt early. Theis blocked John Collins' dunk attempt on Atlanta’s second possession. Later, Walker got loose for a fast-break layup, absorbed a foul and completed a three-point play. It helped set the tone for an active opening quarter in which Walker led all scorers with eight points on his way to 20 in the first half. “Kemba’s been really good,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""We’ve struggled through this stretch and there’s been a lot of angst and a lot of talk. But in three of the four games he’s played in we’ve won. And in all of them he’s played well.” The Celtics increased their lead in the second quarter, going 13 of 22 from the field and using a 20-5 run to take a 62-37 lead late in the half. Walker reeled off nine straight points during the run. The Hawks, who got 40 points from Young and shot a season-high 57% in Wednesday’s win, struggled to keep up with Boston’s pace. Atlanta shot just 14 for 43 (33%) in the opening 24 minutes, including 3 of 15 from the 3-point line. It was only able to stay close by going 10 for 10 from the free-throw line. Associate head coach Nate McMillan said he didn’t think his team responded well to Boston going to a lineup that used Theis and Robert Williams to protect the rim, making Atlanta play more on the perimeter. “They did pretty much what we did to them in the first game, attack the paint,” McMillan said. ""We never established we could keep this team in front of us.” TIP-INS Hawks: Shot 10 of 30 from beyond the arc. … Coach Lloyd Pierce missed his second straight game.

"Ja Morant takes advantage of the mismatch on Mason Plumlee and gets to the basket for a lay-in. (0:17) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Ja Morant scored 21 of his 29 points in the second half, Jonas Valanciunas added 17 points and 15 rebounds and the Memphis Grizzlies rallied for a 109-95 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. Kyle Anderson added 16 for Memphis as the Grizzlies won their second straight. “He’s able to see what’s kind of going on in the first three quarters,” forward Brandon Clarke said about Morant. “The fourth quarter, he can kind of read it. By the time Ja gets there in the fourth quarter, he pretty much knows what the defense is trying to do to guard him.” Jerami Grant and Delon Wright led the Pistons with 16 points each, while Josh Jackson added 15. Rookie Saddiq Bey finished with 14 points for Detroit. Grant, coming off a 43-point performance in Wednesday’s loss to Chicago, made only one of his eight shots in the first half and was 5 of 20 in the game, including 2 of 10 from outside the arc. Morant’s scoring pulled Memphis away in the third when Detroit made a run. Then the Grizzlies shut down the Detroit offense in the fourth, keeping the Pistons from scoring a field goal over six minutes after Detroit pulled to 90-89 with 6:26 left. Part of the problem throughout the game was the Pistons inability to hold on to the ball. Detroit committed 21 turnovers in various ways from bad passes to offensive fouls to throwing the ball into the stands. “You can’t turn the ball over 21 times for 24 points,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “As much as we were soft in the first half defensively, the second half, it was mostly our offensive turnovers.” Part of that came when Wright left the game in the fourth quarter with a right groin injury. That led to more disorganization on the offensive end for Detroit. When the Pistons got within 90-89 in the fourth, the turnovers cost them a chance to overtake Memphis. “It was huge because he was playing well,” Casey said about Wright’s injury. “Offensively, he got us into stuff, was making plays, making shots. That did slow us down a little bit.” Memphis benefitted from a poor-shooting first quarter by the Pistons and eventually built the lead to 21 points before settling in for a 53-42 lead at the half. The Grizzlies were working inside with Valanciunas and controlling the paint with drives to the basket. Memphis would finish the night with 66 paint points. “Our team is really good at getting to the paint and finishing,” said Clarke, who finished with 12 points and seven rebounds. Wright’s 4-of-5 shooting, including a trio of 3-pointers, helped keep the Pistons hopes alive at the half. The optimism got higher as Detroit converted a quartet of 3-pointers to open the second half. But Memphis, led by Morant’s 13 points in the third helped the Grizzlies lead 84-73 heading to the fourth. “I felt like I missed some shots. Got to be better from behind the arc,” Morant said, adding: “Even though I was plus-14, I give myself a 6.5 on tonight’s performance. I’ve got to be better.” TIP-INS Pistons: Shot only 29% in the first quarter, while scoring 17 points. …Entered the game first in NBA in bench scoring at 41.6, but managed only 29 against Memphis. …Grant has reached double-figure scoring in all but two games this season. … Have lost eight of the last 10 games in Memphis. … F Sekou Doumbouya played after missing the past three games under concussion protocol. …Are now 1-16 when trailing after three quarters.

"Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman debate why the Bucks are struggling. (1:56) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo wanted to see how his Milwaukee Bucks would respond to adversity after losing five straight games. The Bucks passed that test convincingly. Now they just need to handle prosperity a little better. Antetokounmpo had 29 points, a season-high 19 rebounds and eight assists to lead the Bucks past the Oklahoma City Thunder 98-85 on Friday night to end their longest losing streak in four years. “Guys were ready,” Antetokounmpo said. “Guys competed. Guys played hard. Even though we weren't knocking down a lot of shots, we competed defensively and were able to rebound and share the ball. It's good. We're still building.” The Bucks, who posted the NBA's best regular-season record each of the last two seasons, avoided their first six-game skid since March 12-22, 2015. They hadn’t lost five straight since Jan. 25 to Feb. 3 in 2017. After the Bucks fell 110-96 to the Toronto Raptors  on Thursday, Antetokounmpo said he appreciated facing adversity and being getting down because “that’s the only way you improve.” The two-time reigning MVP noted that “if everything always goes well and goes your way, you kind of not know the other side. You don’t feel it. So now we feel the other side.” The Bucks responded by going on an 18-0 run midway through the game to lead by as many as 22 points in the third quarter. But after it appeared the Bucks were on their way to a blowout victory, Oklahoma City started to make things interesting. “We were a play or two away from getting ourselves back in the game there,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. Oklahoma City cut Milwaukee's lead to 83-76 on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s free throw with 5:26 left. Khris Middleton answered by sinking a corner 3-pointer to start a 7-0 run, and the Bucks stayed ahead by double figures the rest of the way. “That's just the NBA, man,” said Milwaukee's D.J. Augustin, who had 11 points and five assists in his first start of the season. “You've got a couple of options. You can either be up on a team, step on their neck and put them out, or you can keep the game going and they'll make a run. It happens. We did a great job tonight keeping our composure when it got close late in the game. We just kept doing what we wanted to do and made big plays.” Middleton scored 20 points for the Bucks and Lu Dort had 17 for the Thunder on a night when both teams struggled on offense. The Thunder's 85 points were the fewest by a Bucks opponent all season. Milwaukee's 98 points represented its second-lowest point total of the season. Oklahoma City didn’t make its first basket of the second half until Hamidou Diallo delivered a follow shot with 4:31 left in the third. “Certainly we were in mud,” Budenholzer said. “Maybe they were in mud a little bit. It turned into more of a half-court (game), a little bit slower.” Oklahoma City has lost six of its last seven games, though its one win during that stretch was a 114-109 victory over the Bucks  on Sunday. TIP-INS Thunder: Justin Jackson scored a season-high 22 points in Oklahoma City’s victory over the Bucks on Sunday, but he wasn't much of a factor in the rematch with two points in six minutes. Jackson got more playing time Sunday because Oklahoma City was playing without Gilgeous-Alexander and Théo Maledon, who were both in the starting lineup Friday. Bucks: Jrue Holiday missed a seventh straight game due to the league’s health and safety protocols. Reserve guard Jaylen Adams was unavailable Friday for the same reason. ... Milwaukee recalled rookie second-round pick Sam Merrill from the NBA G League’s Memphis Hustle.","401267613"
"Anthony Edwards rises up and throws down a dunk all over Yuta Watanabe. (0:26) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Norman Powell and the Toronto Raptors used one final push to slip by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Powell scored a season-high 31 points and the Raptors topped the Timberwolves 86-81 on Friday night, closing the game with an 11-0 run. Toronto (15-15) earned its third straight win to reach .500 for the first time after starting the season 1-6. Powell is averaging 22.8 points over his last 14 games, including four games of 28 or more points. Even though his offensive contributions are making headlines, Toronto coach Nick Nurse said Powell is doing a lot more than just scoring. “He’s been a prime-time player. He’s been at his very best since he’s been here,” Nurse said of the sixth-year guard. “That means as a two-way player. He’s playing great, his shooting’s great, he’s exploding to the rim, but he’s also been put on some tough matchups as well and he’s handled those. ... His all-around game has been good."" Karl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 19 points and 13 rebounds. Malik Beasley scored 13 and Jordan McLaughlin had 11. Minnesota dropped its third in a row since winning at Toronto on Sunday. In that victory over the Raptors, the Timberwolves overcame a four-point halftime deficit with a 37-point blitz in the third quarter. On Friday, they made a comeback that was even more dramatic. After trailing by as many as 19, the Wolves clawed their way back into the game with a 16-0 run midway through the third quarter. Jake Layman had a dunk and a 3-pointer during the stretch, which tied the game at 57. Minnesota led 81-75 with 3:30 to play when Toronto took over. Fred VanVleet hit a pair of free throws, Powell scored on a transition layup, and Pascal Siakam threw down a tying dunk. On Minnesota’s next possession, Towns was called for a moving screen, and on the other end, Terence Davis hit his third 3-pointer of the quarter to make it 84-81 with 30 seconds to play. The Wolves had a chance to tie it, but Beasley’s 3-pointer was short, and Davis hit two free throws for Toronto. The Timberwolves came up empty on their last eight possessions, and VanVleet noted that it was refreshing to win a game with strong defense “Our offense has been carrying us most nights, but it’s probably harder to win that way,” VanVleet said. “If that score would have been 120 to 125, I don't know which way it goes. But I like the fact that we were able to clamp down.” Playing a second straight game without point guard Kyle Lowry (sprained thumb), the Raptors dominated the first half, thanks in part to Minnesota’s cold shooting. At one point the Wolves missed 18 straight 3-pointers before hitting their last two of the second quarter to finish the half 3 for 22 from behind the arc. BRINGING THE THUNDER Minnesota rookie Anthony Edwards, the No. 1 pick in the 2020 draft, had a dunk for the ages near the end of the third quarter. After corralling a pass on the left wing, Edwards saw a clear path to the basket along the baseline. Two dribbles later, he reached the lane, where he was met by Toronto's Yuta Watanabe. No problem. Edwards skied over the defender and threw down a vicious right-handed dunk. “That’s probably the best dunk I’ve ever seen with my own eyes ever,” Timberwolves forward Jaden McDaniels said. Edwards didn't want to talk about the dunk. He was distressed about Minnesota's loss and his 3-for-14 night from the field, including missing on all seven of his 3-point attempts. Once his media duties were finished, the rookie went back onto the Target Center court and spent an extra 15 minutes working on his jump shot. TIP-INS Raptors: Nurse said he didn’t anticipate an extended absence for Lowry, who is averaging 17.7 points and 6.4 assists per game. ... Forward Patrick McCaw was available for the first time in 11 months after recovering from surgery to remove a benign mass from his leg. He entered the game midway through the second quarter, receiving a standing ovation from his teammates on the bench. Timberwolves: Layman, who started Minnesota’s first three games of the season, had seen his playing time dry up of late. He got off the bench for the first time in the six games, finishing with eight points in 13 minutes.","401267614"
"After trailing for majority of the game, the Suns go on a 41-12 run in the fourth quarter as they pave their way to a 132-114 win over the Pelicans. (2:05) NEW ORLEANS -- — Chris Paul had 15 points and a season-high 19 assists, spearheading an 11-point, fourth-quarter comeback in the Phoenix Suns' 132-114 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. Paul, who rose to stardom with New Orleans after being drafted fourth overall in 2005, appeared to be gesturing that he owned the arena after hitting a step-back 3 that gave Phoenix a 118-107 lead with less than five minutes to go. “I said, ‘I know this place. I know it.' I do,” Paul said. ""Some of the best years of my life was here in New Orleans playing in front of these fans. This always will be a special place for me for the rest of my life.” At that point, the Suns had outscored the Pelicans 27-5 in the fourth quarter, with Paul scoring five and assisting on five other baskets during that pivotal surge. “He’s orchestrating out there,"" said Devin Booker, who scored 23 points. ""He knows what’s going on before it even happens. ... He did a good job of leading us, keeping our composure throughout the whole game and that fourth quarter was a work of art.” New Orleans had no response down the stretch and both teams pulled all starters with 2:26 left, and the Suns went on to outscore the Pelicans 41-12 in the final period. “That's the resiliency and the relentless play that we've talked about,” said Suns coach Monty Williams, whose team squandered a 24-point lead in losing its previous game at home to the Brooklyn Nets. ""It wasn't going our way pretty much the whole game. You could just feel it was just a bit funky. “We don't give in. Chris never feels like he's ever lost anything. So, when you have a guy like that who can will himself to success, it really gets contagious.” Paul's decisive 3, his third of the game, was one of 22 the Suns hit from deep on 39 attempts (56.4%). Jae Crowder hit six 3s on his way to 20 points, and Frank Kaminsky made five 3s for the bulk of his 17 points as the Suns won for the 10th time in 12 games. Brandon Ingram scored 25 points for the Pelicans, who've lost five of six. Zion Williamson added 23, and his second alley-oop dunk of the night helped the Pelicans build what looked like a promising 102-91 lead at the end of the third quarter. “It happened,"" Williamson said of the Pelicans' ensuing collaps. ""We’ve just got to figure it out and hope we can prevent it from happening again. They hit tough shots. Hats off to Phoenix. They’re a great team. They had great ball-movement and they found good shots.” Lonzo Ball hit six 3s and finished with 21 points and 12 assists to go with two blocks and three steals for New Orleans. “We played three good quarters against a very, very good team that’s been on a good role and got dominated in the fourth,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We were stagnant. I probably should have had us in some other stuff offensively. We had a disastrous quarter. ... We couldn’t stop them at the other end at all. Chris Paul just took the whole game over.” TIP-INS Suns: Deandre Ayton had 16 points and 16 rebounds. ... Cameron Johnson scored 13 points. ... Shot 58% overall and had 38 assists on 51 made shots. ... Converted 14 Pelicans turnovers into 24 points. Pelicans: Ball's double-double was his first this season. ...

Rookie Kira Lewis Jr. missed all eight of his shots and finished with four assists, a rebound and a steal in 19 minutes. LESSON LEARNED The Suns made a point of noting how gratified they were to follow up a big blown lead against the Nets with a thoroughly dominant fourth-quarter comeback in New Orleans. “I’m really happy that we bounced back,"" Ayton said. ""This team stuck together and we trust each other. Having each other’s back like we did in this game, it shows a lot. ... We treat every loss like it’s a lesson. We learned our lesson.”","401267615"
"Steve Ballmer gets fired up in his seat after Patrick Beverley drains a 3-pointer to give the Clippers a 13-point lead over the Jazz in the fourth quarter. (0:19) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 29 points, reserve Lou Williams had 19 and the Los Angeles Clippers edged Utah 116-112 on Friday night, snapping the Jazz's nine-game winning streak. The Clippers avenged an 18-point loss to Utah two nights earlier, when starters Leonard, Paul George and Nicolas Batum were sidelined. George had 15 points in his return from a seven-game absence with an injured toe. “I wasn't ready to play 30-plus today,"" said George, who was held to 26 minutes. “Got to get back to that basketball conditioning. I probably would have hurt the team if I'd been on the floor past the minutes I was.” Donovan Mitchell scored 29 of his 35 points in the second half for the NBA-leading Jazz, who lost for just the second time in their last 22 games. Bojan Bogdanovic added 23 points, reserve Jordan Clarkson had 19 points and Rudy Gobert had 15 rebounds as Utah fell to 24-6. “It felt like a playoff game, the intensity, the tough shots they were making all night,” Gobert said. The Jazz got outrebounded 45-38. “This is a bump in the road and a good one,” Mitchell said. “We lost the game on the boards, that was second-chance points, which is what really hurt us.” Gobert added, “If we get those rebounds we win this game.” After not making any 3s in the third, the Clippers got timely 3-pointers from Marcus Morris and Patrick Beverley, who had two apiece in the fourth. Beverley's consecutive long-range baskets pushed their lead to 107-94 and finished off a 20-10 run. Los Angeles played without a center in the fourth, when Morris was added to the rotation and scored 10 points. “We might be small in size but we're not small in heart, for sure,” Beverley said. “Playing the No. 1 team, we got to go out and beat them. They’re not going to give it to you and that’s the mindset we came out with."" Trailing by 10, the Jazz weren't done yet. They closed to 112-110 on consecutive 3-pointers by Mitchell. Beverley and Leonard combined to make four straight free throws that kept the Clippers ahead 116-110. George fouled Mitchell on a 3-point attempt, and Mitchell made the first two with 2 seconds to go. He deliberately missed the third and Royce O'Neale grabbed the offensive rebound but missed at the buzzer. “We got our guys back and we wanted to win this game,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “Guys went out and did a helluva job.” The Clippers led by 15 points in the second quarter and were up by 10 early in the third only to see the Jazz tie it up. Mitchell scored 12 of Utah's first 15 points, including seven in a row. Neither team led by more than five points the rest of the third. Leonard, who returned after missing three games with a bruised leg, carried the Clippers with 14 points in the quarter after having just 12 in the first half. His pair of free throws sent Los Angeles into the fourth leading 79-75. TIP-INS Jazz: Mike Conley finished with 16 points in his return after missing six games. ... They are 2-1 against LA this season. ... Fell to 11-4 on the road. Clippers: Beat the Jazz for just the fourth time in the teams' last 13 matchups. ...

"Draymond Green loses his cool and gets ejected after receiving two straight technical fouls. The Hornets would later win the game on a shot from Terry Rozier. (1:45) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Draymond Green lost his cool and the Golden State Warriors lost another game. After Green picked up two technical fouls and was ejected with 9.3 seconds left for arguing the outcome of a jump ball, Terry Rozier hit an off-balance jumper from the left corner as time expired to give the Charlotte Hornets a 102-100 victory Saturday night Rozier finished with 36 points, his fourth straight 30-point game. The Warriors were leading by two when officials ruled Hornets coach James Borrego had called a timeout as Gordon Hayward came down with the jump ball. Green immediately began jumping around the court, screaming at players and officials arguing that the Warriors had tied up Hayward as he was falling to the floor and it should have resulted in another jump ball. Rozier sank two free throws for the technical fouls to tie it, then hit the winner. “He crossed the line, that's the main thing,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said about Green, who has a history of in-game outbursts. “We love his passion and his energy and we would not be the team we are without him. But that doesn't give him license to cross the line — and he knows that.” Head official Marc Davis said after the game Green's first technical foul was assessed for directing profanity at an opposing player and taunting, and the second technical was for directing profanity at a game official. Green did not participate in the Warriors' videoconference call after the game. Kerr said Green was apologetic after the game, but he will speak to him in private more about the incident. Teammates were quick to rally to Green's defense. “He said it was his fault and he took ownership as a leader,"" forward Eric Paschall said. “We are still rocking with Draymond. Great dude. Great competitor.” The incident overshadowed another huge night for Rozier, who had 20 points in the fourth quarter. Rozier is averaging 37.5 points over the last four games for the Hornets. “I just hit one or two shots before that in that corner, so I felt real confident when I lost the ball, I grabbed it and let it go,” Rozier said of the winning shot. ""I saw it going through all the way.” Borrego said Rozier has brought a “winning spirit” to the Hornets. “Never give in, never die. That’s as simple as I can put it,” Borrego said. “He’s been fantastic. His will throughout games and fourth quarters just to keep us alive and to actually throw in daggers to help us win games is tremendous on his part. But he’s been fantastic. He gives us a tremendous amount of confidence and tonight, he just willed us to another victory.” P.J. Washington finished with 15 points to help the Hornets overcame a season-high 25 turnovers to beat the Warriors without Stephen Curry. Kelly Oubre Jr. led the Warriors with 25 points. For the Warriors, it was their second tough loss in two nights after falling the Orlando Magic 124-120. “This is a tough loss,"" Kerr said. “They don’t really get any tougher than this one. ... But you've got to get ready for the next game.” CURRY'S ILLNESS Curry went through warmups but was a late scratch after he became ill. The team said the illness is not COVID-19 related and that Curry was “just not feeling well.” Curry had not been listed on the team’s injury report and was even introduced before the game, although he had returned to the locker room at that point. Even Dell Curry, Steph’s father, seemed surprised. The elder Curry, a broadcaster for the Hornets, said on air “Want me to send a text to his phone?” TIP INS Warriors: Mychal Mulder started in Curry’s place but had just two points in 16 minutes. Hornets: Devonte Graham missed his fourth straight game with a left groin strain. ... Rookie LaMelo Ball had a disappointing first half with no points, two assists and three fouls.","401267619"
"Zach LaVine puts the game out of reach with a pull-up jumper in crunch time. (0:42) CHICAGO -- — Zach LaVine scored 38 points and the Chicago Bulls beat the slumping Sacramento Kings 122-114 on Saturday night. The Bulls bounced back after getting dominated by Joel Embiid in a tight loss at Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia on Friday night. They withstood a fourth quarter push and handed the Kings their sixth loss in a row. LaVine, making a case for his first All-Star invitation, hit 15 of 20 shots in his fourth straight game with 30 or more points. He also had three steals. “Zach LaVine is deserving of being an All-Star,” coach Billy Donovan said. “He has played as well as anybody. I can't imagine that there's been many guys that have played better than him.” LaVine will find out Tuesday if he made it when the reserves — voted on by the coaches — are announced. “You just want to be recognized,” he said. “I feel like I played at an All-Star level the last couple of years and I don't think that (many) people have had better seasons than me over the last couple years in the Eastern Conference. It comes down to winning. You have to show that. I'm glad that we're in the hunt.” Coby White scored 19 points, hitting 5 of 8 3-pointers. Thaddeus Young added 18 points and made a key layup in the closing minute. Patrick Williams hit the shot of the night when he buried a 52-footer at the end of the third quarter, and the Bulls improved to 6-9 at the United Center. Sacramento’s Marvin Bagley III tied a season high with 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. Buddy Hield scored 23 points, and De’Aaron Fox added 20 points and nine assists. The Kings remained winless since they beat Kawhi Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 8. “It's always concerning, obviously, when you're stringing together some losses like this,” Fox said. “You got to keep the course. Obviously, no one's gonna feel sorry for you — especially around this league. If you keep your head down, people will keep you down. Every team in this league will just continue to keep you down. ... There are stretches in the game where we look really good as a team, but we have to be able to do that for as long as possible."" HANGING ON The Bulls led 101-92 early in the fourth quarter before Sacramento scored seven straight, Bagley's driving layup cutting it to two. Garrett Temple stopped that spurt with a 3-pointer.

"Chris Paul sets up Mikal Bridges' 3-pointer and moves past Oscar Robertson on the all-time NBA assists list. (0:18) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — On a night the Phoenix Suns made a franchise-record 3-pointers, Chris Paul passed a hero on the NBA's career assists list. Paul had six assists in the Suns' 128-97 romp over the short-handed Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night to pass Oscar Robertson for sixth place. Paul has 9,891 assists, four more than Robertson had in his Hall of Fame career. “It’s an honor and a privilege to play the game as long as I’ve played,” the 35-year-old Paul said, adding that he has been a fan of Roberson since he began playing basketball. “It’s a huge accomplishment, and I’m grateful.” Paul’s pass that led to Mikal Bridges’ 3-pointer with 7:05 left in the second quarter, moved the Phoenix guard past Robertson. “I say the same thing, ‘Be legendary every day,’” Suns star Devin Booker said. “Chris is there. He’s a living legend.” Booker scored 23 points, hitting five of the Suns’ franchise-record 24 3-pointers. Mikal Bridges added 19 points, making 6 of 7 shots overall and 4 of 5 from long range. Cam Payne and Dario Saric also had 19 points, season highs for both, and Paul added 16. “This is a big-time road win,” Payne said. “We know we’ve got to win on the defensive end. Thought we shot the ball well. But I feel like our defense fires our offense. The fact that we were getting stops, it allows players on the offensive end to get a little bit loose and shoot the ball at a high clip.” Phoenix won for the eighth time in nine games. The Suns made 22 3-pointers Friday night in New Orleans in a game where they outscored the Pelicans 41-12 in the fourth quarter in a 132-114 victory. Paul had 19 assists in that game. Gorgui Dieng led Memphis with 15 points, most of them in a mop-up fourth quarter. Ja Morant had 12 points and five assists, and Jonas Valanciunas added 10 points and 12 rebounds. The Grizzlies also were coming off a victory Friday night, at home over Detroit. Playing their fourth game in five nights, they rested key players Brandon Clarke, Kyle Anderson and Grayson Allen. “I think there was a focus from the jump to play the way we play no matter who they have in their lineup,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “Those are the kind of game where you can lose your rhythm.” Justise Winslow returned for Memphis after being out more than a year because of injuries. He missed all nine of his shots in the first half, eventually finishing with nine points on 3-of-14 shooting. “Pleased with him all game,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said about Winslow, whose return was one of the lone bright spots for the Grizzlies. “He went out there, and I said before the game, I just wanted him to attack and compete and he just found his groove. He’s the ultimate pro.” TIP-INS Suns: … Ended a four-game losing streak in the series. … The Suns made 13 of 25 3s in the first half. …Early in the third quarter, Paul and Bridges were a combined 11 for 11 from the field, including seven 3-pointers. Grizzlies: Winslow had played only one game since Dec. 5, 2019, and had not appeared in a Memphis uniform because of injuries since he came to the Grizzlies from Miami in a Feb. 6, 2020 trade. … Used their ninth starting lineup of the season. … The 36-point deficit in the fourth quarter was the largest of the season for Memphis. REST LIST With the Grizzlies playing their sixth game in nine days, Allen, Anderson and Clarke, all of whom started in Friday’s win over Detroit were given the night off. “Zero injury concerns whatsoever for Grayson, Kyle and BC,” Jenkins said, adding: “Just taking stock of where our team’s at. …It’s just one game. Those guys will be back in the action (Sunday against Dallas).” GAME BALL During his postgame interview, Paul was holding the game ball in recognition of passing Robertson. The ball was tracked down by Booker. “It’s really dope. We’re a team like that,” Paul said of having a younger player like Booker make sure he got the ball. “…These moments are something big. I’m grateful (Booker) got the ball for me.”","401267622"
"LeBron James tips the ball away fro Jimmy Butler and passes to Alex Caruso, who comes up short on the potential game-tying shot. (0:58) LOS ANGELES -- — Although the Miami Heat's road trip started slowly, Kendrick Nunn thinks they are picking up steam because of a team chemistry that is growing at every stop. The Heat even kept it together to pull out a win over the defending NBA champions despite a fourth quarter that nearly went wrong. Nunn scored 27 points, Jimmy Butler had 24 points and eight rebounds, and Miami held off the Los Angeles Lakers 96-94 Saturday night in an NBA Finals rematch. Bam Adebayo had 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Heat in the teams’ first meeting since the Lakers won their 17th championship with a six-game victory over Miami in the Florida bubble four months ago. The Heat scored only 15 points in the fourth quarter, but they held the Lakers to 17 and hung on when Alex Caruso missed a long jumper at the buzzer. “You can tell that the chemistry is building,” said Nunn, who hit five 3-pointers. “We’ve been together for a week and a half, and it just gives us more of a feel for each other. We’re moving in the right direction now. We dropped a couple early, but we’re starting to give ourselves the best chance at the end of the game.” The victory was Miami's second straight following a three-game skid during this seven-game road trip. The defending Eastern Conference champions (13-17) have been under .500 since Jan. 12, but their confidence is growing. “We’re seeing progress the last few weeks,” coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I think our defensive mental toughness was better in this game to get some stops when we weren’t able to knock down some shots in the fourth quarter.” LeBron James had 19 points, nine assists and nine rebounds as the champs lost their second straight game without starters Anthony Davis and Dennis Schröder. James stole the Heat's inbounds pass with 8.4 seconds left to create one last chance for the Lakers, but the 17-time All-Star passed out of a double team to Caruso, who capped his scoreless 20-minute night by missing. “We're figuring out how to play without one of our creators in Dennis and one of our stars in AD,” Caruso said. “That's going to take a little time, and obviously we don't have practice time.” Davis missed his third straight game after aggravating his strained right calf last weekend, and Schröder missed his second straight under the NBA’s health and safety protocols. Kyle Kuzma scored 23 points while hitting four 3-pointers, and Montrezl Harrell had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Lakers. The injury absences don't account for the Lakers' shooting woes over the last 10 games, including a 39% performance against Miami. LA missed five of its last six shots, including Wesley Matthews' rushed, off-balance 3-pointer with 15 seconds left. “We're going to continue to work on our habits and be great for each other,” James said. “We all put in the work, so it’s not that. The law of averages will even itself out. We had lapses last season, and we had them during the playoffs. We know they’ll even them out over the course of the year.” TIP-INS Heat: Avery Bradley, a starter for the Lakers last season who missed their playoff run after opting out of the NBA restart, missed this game for Miami with a calf strain. ... Goran Dragic missed his eighth straight game with a sprained left ankle. Lakers: Schröder will miss at least two more games in quarantine, coach Frank Vogel said. The Lakers hope he'll return Friday against Portland. HERRO HURT Tyler Herro left after playing less than 14 minutes due to a hip pointer. He will be re-evaluated Sunday, Spoelstra said. “We’re used to it,” Spoelstra said of the Heat's latest injury. “Every game there’s going to be something. This is developing a level of toughness in our group."" Max Strus missed eight 3-pointers in Herro’s place.","401267623"
"Russell Westbrook records 27 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds in the Wizards' 118-111 win vs. the Trail Blazers. (2:07) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Russell Westbrook had 27 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds, and the Washington Wizards snapped Portland's six-game win streak with a 118-111 victory over Damian Lillard and the Trail Blazers on Saturday night. Bradley Beal scored 37 points, helping Washington to its fourth straight win. Rui Hachimura added 17 points, and reserve Robin Lopez had 10 points and 11 rebounds. Wizards coach Scott Brooks said he thinks Westbrook is finding a rhythm. “He’s going to have more games like this,"" Brooks said. ""The guy is a championship player. How he prepares, how he talks to our guys, he gets them to be ready. His voice was loud in that first quarter. That’s what you want your leaders to do.” Lillard had 35 points and 12 assists, but he was 10 for 30 from the field. Enes Kanter had 19 points and 13 rebounds for Portland, and Robert Covington finished with 11 points and 11 boards. “We were on a winning streak too but they were feeling confident,” Kanter said. ""They beat three good teams before us and they were playing confident, making shots. We cannot let our offense affect our defense.” Lillard was held in check in the first half, going 2 for 13 from the field. But he scored 23 points in the third quarter on 7-for-8 shooting. He was hit in the neck by an elbow from Washington’s Raul Neto, but he remained in the game after he was examined by the Blazers training staff. Lillard's buzzer-beating 3-pointer from the just in front of the mid-court logo lifted Portland to a 92-89 lead heading into the fourth. “We made some mistakes in the third quarter, but I thought we did a good job on him,"" Brooks said. “He’s a great player and we helped, but he did have some missed shots that he normally would make.” The Trail Blazers had a 96-93 lead with 8:39 left when the Wizards grabbed control with a 10-2 spurt. Lopez sparked the run with a layup, Davis Bertans hit a key 3 and Hachimura finished the decisive stretch with a foul shot, making it 103-98 with 5:40 to go. Bertans made another big 3 with 2:18 left, lifting Washington to a 110-101 lead. “We didn’t make a lot of 3s,” Brooks said. “We made them when they counted.” TIP-INS Wizards: Beal was 16 for 27 from the field. He also had seven rebounds and three assists. ... Brooks said defense has been a key part of the team's win streak. ""The defense has been much better,” he said. Trail Blazers: It has been over a month since starting center Jusuf Nurkic had surgery on his right wrist. Although the Blazers have not yet updated his status and aren’t expected to do so for another two weeks, they are encouraged by the fact that he has been able to stay in relatively good shape since he can still work out his lower body. “He’s doing well,” coach Terry Stotts said. “The good thing is since it’s a hand injury, he can do aerobic things to stay in basketball shape."" Nurkic admitted to reporters prior to his injury that the early turnaround, as well as attending to family matters in Bosnia, caused him to be in worse condition than he would have liked to start the season.","401267624"
"Zion Williamson describes how he and the Pelicans were able to pull of the biggest comeback in franchise history against the Celtics on Sunday. (1:07) NEW ORLEANS -- — Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson took what they hope will be meaningful steps in turning the New Orleans Pelicans' season around, combining decisively to produce pivotal plays during a memorable comeback. Ingram highlighted a 33-point performance by hitting a go-ahead 3-pointer with 33.3 seconds left in overtime, and New Orleans held on for 120-115 victory over the Boston Celtics on Sunday after rallying from 24 points down in the third quarter. “Today was a day of encouragement,” Ingram said. “We just stayed together and everybody did things that they do well.” Zion Williamson scored 24 of his 28 points after halftime and had 10 rebounds, four assists and a block for the Pelicans, who narrowly avoided losing for the sixth time in seven games. Josh Hart, who was instrumental in the comeback, had 17 points, 10 rebounds, three blocks and a steal. “We stayed true to who we were. We rallied back,” Williamson said. “Everybody — coaches, players, ball boys — everybody was just engaged.” Jayson Tatum had 32 points and nine rebounds, and Jaylen Brown scored 25 for the Celtics, who appeared to be cruising to their third victory in four games when Tristan Thompson's free throws gave Boston a 79-55 lead in the middle of the third quarter. “We kind of got away from what got us the lead, not moving the ball, guarding, and they stormed back,” Brown said. “This one definitely hurts. It’s tough. Just a tough loss — a game we 100 percent should have won.” Added Tatum, ""If we want to be a really good team, we’ve got to put teams away early, especially being up 20-some points.” The Pelicans finished the third period on a 19-8 run, capped by Williamson's layup after he drove nearly the length of the court to score with less than 2 seconds on the clock. The momentum carried into the fourth. Williamson's put-back dunk ignited a 10-2 run during which Hart scored eight. The spurt included his driving layup as he was fouled, a 3 and a reverse put-back after Lonzo Ball's fast-break layup had been blocked by Daniel Theis. New Orleans pulled even when Ingram's transition 3 made it 98-all with 4:10 left, setting up a riveting finish to what had looked like a laugher. The lead changed hands twice in the last 11 seconds of regulation, with Tatum draining a fall-away to make it 106-105 and Williamson hitting a layup as he was fouled to put the Pelicans up 108-106 with 6.9 seconds to go. Tatum then sank a driving floater in the final second to force overtime. The game was tied at 112 when Ingram's 3, set up by Williamson's pass, put the Pelicans in front to stay. The Celtics controlled most of the first half, scoring 19 points off of 10 New Orleans turnovers. Tatum exploded for 17 points in the second quarter, when Boston led by as many as 19 before taking a 63-47 lead into halftime. “We played exceptionally well for a large part of the time,” Brown said. “We just got to mature and grow up.” TIP-INS Celtics: Coach Brad Stevens said Marcus Smart, who has not played since injuring his calf during a Jan. 30 loss to the Lakers, is traveling with the team. But while Stevens said Smart has been “going at a decent rate the last few days,” he stressed that it remains uncertain when Smart will be ready to play. ... Thompson and Kemba Walker each scored 14 points and Aaron Nesmith scored 10. ... Robert Williams III grabbed 13 rebounds, blocked four shots and scored eight points. Pelicans: Ball scored 16 points and Willy Hernangomez grabbed 13 rebounds. ... JJ Redick was ejected after committing a pair of technical fouls within the first minute of the fourth quarter. His first technical came while arguing, the second after he hastily bounce-passed the ball to an official after Boston's Nesmith was called for fouling him on a drive. Coach Stan Van Gundy said he told Redick, “I don’t remember too many guys getting ejected on a call that went their way.” LEARNING EXPERIENCE Van Gundy was gratified the see his club rally from a big second-half hole just one game after seeing an 11-point fourth-quarter lead turn into an 18-point loss during a dreadful final 12 minutes against Phoenix on Friday. ""The last two games — right there — are about all the lessons that our team needs,” Van Gundy said. “You’ve just got to play through everything and keep fighting, play possession by possession by possession from night to night and from minute to minute. ... Things change very, very quickly in this league, in games and in seasons. Just keep fighting.”","401267625"
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander gets the Thunder defender off balance and drains the baseline shot through contact. (0:20) CLEVELAND -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 31 points and nine assists as the Oklahoma City Thunder beat Cleveland 117-101 on Sunday night, handing the Cavaliers their 10th consecutive loss. Al Horford had 16 points and eight rebounds, and Hamidou Diallo scored 15 points off the bench for the Thunder, who snapped a five-game road losing streak and three-game overall skid. Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging career highs of 22.6 points and 6.5 assists in his third season. Western Conference coaches will vote for the All-Star Game reserves Monday. “Most nights, I feel like we’ve got the best player on the court in Shai -- and that seems like an All-Star to me,” Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. “I certainly feel like he’s deserving of consideration.” Collin Sexton scored 27 points and Jarrett Allen shot 11 for 11 and finished with a career-high 26 points and 17 rebounds for the Cavaliers. Cleveland hasn’t won since beating Minnesota on Feb. 1, and is 1-12 since Jan. 27. The Cavaliers have three double-digit losing streaks since LeBron James left the franchise for the second time in 2018 via free agency for the Los Angeles Lakers. Cleveland lost 12 in a row from Dec. 19, 2018-Jan. 11, 2019, and dropped 11 straight from March 22-Oct. 23, 2019. “We just have to be better,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “We’ve got to make open shots in order to survive. We’ve got to guard better and be more physical. We have to be better.” Oklahoma City took its largest lead at 104-84 on a 3-pointer by Horford early in the fourth quarter. The Thunder made 13 of 28 3-pointers with Gilgeous-Alexander perfect on three 3-point shots. “Shai is an All-Star,” Oklahoma City forward Mike Muscala said. “He had another great game tonight.” Darius Garland had 21 points and eight assists for the Cavaliers, who never got closer than six points in the second half. Cleveland missed 27 of its 35 shots from beyond the arc, with Cedi Osman missing all eight 3-point attempts. Oklahoma City held a 62-51 lead at the break on the strength of 16 points by Gilgeous-Alexander and 12 from Diallo. Allen had 10 points and 11 rebounds over the first two periods. “They were all pretty locked in and played together for 48 minutes,” Daigneault said. “And when it was time to shift into that next gear, Shai was outstanding.” DELLY DOWN Cavaliers G Matthew Dellavedova, who has yet to play this season because of a concussion, underwent an appendectomy Saturday. The fan favorite experienced abdominal pain while at Cleveland’s training facility earlier in the day. “The first thing Delly told me was, ‘I’m going to have a run of good luck here soon,’” Bickerstaff said. “He’s in good spirits and is optimistic.” TIP-INS Thunder: Rookie G Theo Maledon is averaging 10.0 points over 31.3 minutes in four contests since returning from a five-game absence under the NBA’s health and safety protocols. “The whole year has been a nice trajectory with Theo,” Daigneault said. “He’s somebody who can fit in, no matter what four-man unit he’s out there with.” … G George Hill (right thumb surgery) missed his 15th straight game. Cavaliers: F Larry Nance Jr. (left hand fracture) and F Taurean Prince (left ankle soreness) remain out, but were active for Cleveland to meet the NBA game minimum. … F Kevin Love (right calf strain) was held out of team drills Saturday after experiencing soreness.

"Nikola Vucevic scores 37 points and grabs 12 rebounds as the Magic defeat the Pistons 105-96. (0:31) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Nikola Vucevic had 37 points and 11 rebounds, Evan Fournier added a season-high 29 points and the Orlando Magic beat the Detroit Pistons 105-96 on Sunday night. The Magic have won three in a row, their longest winning streak since opening the season 4-0. The Magic and Pistons play again in Orlando on Tuesday night. “What I’m seeing is that we’re starting the game well and we finished it well, so there are a lot of positives,” said Fournier, who suffered a mild ankle sprain late in the game. “We had one or two stretches where we weren’t as good on defense and not executing, but we kept fighting and got the (win).” Vucevic had his seventh 30-point game of the season, two days after recording the third triple-double of his career. Fournier had a season high for the second straight game. Vucevic, took advantage of Detroit’s lack of size on the inside when center Mason Plumlee left the game for an extended period early in the fourth quarter. Vucevic scored 15 points in the fourth quarter. “I've been feeling good and obviously I've been playing at a high level since the beginning of the year,” Vucevic said. “Once you get in a good rhythm, the game comes easier to you, you don't think so much about stuff and my experience from this being my 10th year helps.” Fournier, who scored 28 points in Orlando’s victory over Golden State on Friday night, had 16 first-half points. He made 12 of 13 free throws in the game to key Orlando’s 26-of-29 shooting from the line. “He drove the ball hard and he got to the free throw line, and for our team that’s not an area of strength and it’s something that we badly need,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. “He’s playing at a high level. Evan is a mentally and physically tough guy. He’s not 100 percent physically, but he wants to be out there and he’s playing very well.” Jerami Grant bounced back from his poorest shooting game of the season in Memphis on Friday by scoring 24 points for the Pistons. They dropped to 1-17 on the season when trailing after three quarters. Last in the Eastern Conference, the Pistons have lost three straight and eight of 11. Josh Jackson added 17 points and 10 rebounds, but he missed all six of his 3-point shots. Detroit was just 11 of 40 from beyond the arc and shot only 37.4 percent. “We didn’t do a good job of knocking down shots, but we had some great looks,” Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. TIP INS Pistons: Delon Wright say out because of a Grade 2 groin strain that is expected to sideline him for two weeks. Wright was injured in Friday against Memphis — a game where he had a team-best 16 points. He leads the Pistons in assists (1.4) and steals (1.4). … Dennis Smith Jr. started in place of Wright, but Casey said two-way players Frank Jackson and Saben Lee will get plenty of looks. One stumbling block, Casey said, is the NBA’s limits on how many games two-way players can play before their contracts much be converted. Said Casey: “It’s going to be by committee. With the starting position, it’s going to come down to who maintains it.” … Lee had a career-best 12 points and five assists on Sunday. Magic: With Aaron Gordon (ankle sprain) still out, the Magic plan to rotate the starters at the power forward position for the next two weeks. Khem Birch started Friday, while Al-Farouq Aminu moved into that slot Sunday despite the minutes’ restriction he is still under following two knee surgeries. Aminu finished with three points and six rebounds in 19 minutes. … Terrence Ross, who had 24 points in Friday’s win, scored 17 points and hit three 3-pointers on Sunday. HEROES HONORED The Magic honored 500 frontline workers from AdventHealth and the Orlando community on Sunday as part of their “Healthcare Heroes Night.” Who are the free agents for the next two years? We have the lists. Center Andre Drummond is now a free agent and can sign with a contending team after reaching a buyout with the Cavaliers.","401267627"
"Terence Davis crashes into the lane unguarded for the electric dunk. (0:23) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet each had 23 points and the Toronto Raptors beat the Philadelphia 76ers 110-103 for their fourth straight victory Sunday night. Chris Boucher scored all 17 of his points for the Raptors in the final 14 minutes, hitting five 3-pointers over six minutes in a 19-10 stretch that pulled the Raptors ahead for good. “They got me open and I shot with confidence. Then when I made them I felt good about taking the next one,"" said Boucher, who also had a big fourth-quarter block of Philadelphia center Joel Embiid. Coming off a 50-point outburst against Chicago on Friday night, Embiid had 25 points and 17 rebounds for the 76ers, who lost their fourth consecutive road game. But he made only six of 20 shots from the field, and the Sixers went 5 for 21 in the fourth quarter. Toronto coach Nick Nurse gave much of the credit for the defense on Embiid to Aron Baynes. “We kind of had to have him in there. When we didn't, it wasn't pretty,” Nurse said of his 6-foot-10, 260-pound center. “I thought he put his body on him just enough. He got called for some, but that's OK.” Ben Simmons paced Philadelphia (20-11) with 28 points and nine rebounds. The 76ers led 55-52 after an 18-point first half by Simmons, who had missed two games with a stomach virus after scoring 42 points in a loss at Utah. Philadelphia shot 39% for the game. “I thought a lot of our guys had great looks tonight,” coach Doc Rivers said. “The problem was they weren't going in, and then it started mounting up.” The Raptors had erased an early 14-point deficit by hitting five 3-pointers — four by Van Vleet — in a span of 2 1/2 minutes. Boucher's big shooting spurt late in the game was less expected. ""We started behind before both those barrages and obviously it was important in getting back in the game,” Nurse said. VanVleet and Boucher hit five 3s each and the Raptors shot 14 for 34 from behind the arc. TIP-INS 76ers: G Shake Milton played 29 minutes after missing five games with a left ankle injury. ... Embiid went 12 for 14 at the foul line in his 14th straight game shooting nine or more free throws. Raptors: G Kyle Lowry missed his second game with a sprained left thumb.

"Karl-Anthony Towns lofts a no-look pass to Jaden McDaniels for an easy basket under the hoop. (0:18) NEW YORK -- — Tom Thibodeau's first game against his former team turned out to be the last one for Ryan Saunders. Julius Randle had 25 points and 14 rebounds, and the New York Knicks recovered after blowing a 21-point lead to pull out a 103-99 victory Sunday night over the Minnesota Timberwolves, who fired Saunders afterward. Thibodeau got the Timberwolves to a rare postseason spot — with Saunders one of his assistants — and might do the same this season in New York, where the Knicks are 15-16 and entered play in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. They have won four of their last five games. Randle made the go-ahead free throw with 32 seconds left and the Knicks held on in a game that seemed fully in their control when they led 86-65 late in the third quarter. But Karl-Anthony Towns had a big fourth, finishing with 27 points and 15 rebounds. Minnesota outscored New York 28-16 in the final period. “They made up ground quickly on us but I do like the fact that we kept fighting and we found a way to win the game and ultimately that’s what’s important, is finding a way to win,” Thibodeau said. RJ Barrett added 21 points for the Knicks in their last game played with no fans at Madison Square Garden. The arena is set to be filled to 10% capacity, about 2,000 fans, Tuesday night when the Knicks host the Golden State Warriors. Ricky Rubio scored 18 points for Minnesota. The Timberwolves have lost four straight and eight of nine. “We've got to do better as players to find ways to win,” Towns said. They'll have to do it without Saunders, who was dismissed after the game with a 43-94 record after replacing the fired Thibodeau on Jan. 6, 2019. The Knicks hadn’t played since Wednesday, after their first postponement of the season Saturday because of coronavirus cases on the San Antonio Spurs. They looked good after the layoff, taking a 61-50 lead at halftime. The lead hit 21 when Randle made two free throws with 1:48 remaining in the third. Minnesota came all the way back to take a 96-95 lead on Towns’ basket with 2:45 remaining. They were still ahead until Towns fouled Randle on a drive, and after his two free throws, Towns missed a baseline jumper. Alec Burks made four free throws to close it out. “Unfortunately we ran out of time,” Saunders said. “I did like the two looks we got late in the game, but you dig yourselves holes you've got to do everything right when you’re down 21 to come out of here with a victory.” Thibodeau’s 2 1/2 seasons with the Wolves included their lone playoff berth in the last 16 seasons when they went 47-35 in 2017-18. But the following season got off to a tumultuous start when Jimmy Butler wanted out and Thibodeau was fired around midseason. Taj Gibson, who played for Thibodeau in Minnesota, said his coach didn't put any extra emphasis on the game. “Just focus on each other and not worrying about anybody or any other team,” Gibson said. “Just focusing on ourselves and getting better and understanding we’re building something and that’s it.” TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota had won the last four meetings. The teams did not play in 2019-20, last meeting March 10, 2019, not long after Saunders replaced Thibodeau. Knicks: Austin Rivers (illness) didn't play. He has been out of the rotation since the Knicks traded for Derrick Rose. ... Thibodeau said he wasn't considering for now sending G Frank Ntilikina to the NBA G League to get some work. Ntilikina has played in just four games this season, missing time for injuries and health and safety protocols and not cracking the rotation when healthy. Thibodeau said he likes having the former lottery pick around the team, adding “even though he’s not playing, he’s adding a lot to our team right now.” MINNESOTA MENTORS Rose (20 points) and Gibson were the Wolves’ top scorers the last time they played at MSG, in a victory on Feb. 22, 2019. Saunders praised Rose for helping teammates who were far less accomplished. “His willingness and ability to impart any knowledge and any wisdom on young players, I’ll go on to say that I’ve been around a lot of really good veterans, but he’s probably the best I’ve ever seen,"" Saunders said, ""and right with him would be Taj Gibson, too.”","401267629"

(0:16) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young had 35 points and 15 assists, Clint Capela added 22 points and 10 rebounds, and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Denver Nuggets 123-115 on Sunday night. The Hawks had lost five of six and eight of 10. The Nuggets have lost six of seven on the road. Jamal Murray, coming off a career-high 50 points Friday at Cleveland, led Denver with 30. Nikola Jokic, Will Barton and Monte Morris each scored 15. “Obviously, Jokic is a top two or three MVP,"" Capela said. “So I really challenged myself tonight to eliminate him as good as I could because I know he can have the type of game that can help his team."" The Nuggets, playing their fourth game in six days, looked tired in the second half as the Hawks went up by 22 points on a 3-pointer by Young at the 2:35 mark of the third quarter. They trimmed the lead to eight with 1:14 left in the game and closed within seven with 46 seconds remaining, but got no closer. “It’s a long season. I don’t know how many times you have to explain it,"" Murray said. “You guys ask about if we lose games ... it’s the end of the world. It’s just basketball. Some days you lose. Some days you win. We know we can beat the teams we’re supposed to beat. We know we’ll be in the playoffs and it doesn’t matter who we’re playing. We’re going to give it our best shot."" Young’s runner made it 64-54 with 32.6 seconds left before halftime, giving the Hawks their first double-digit lead and closing out a 14-4 run. Young hit a 33-footer to give the Hawks a 12-point lead midway through the third, and the Nuggets called timeout. Atlanta soon took a 17-point lead on Kevin Huerter’s inside basket at the 4:37 mark, and the Nuggets called another timeout. Capela followed with a reverse layup to make it a 19-point lead. Young, who made 11 of 13 free throws, was the catalyst at point guard. “I thought he did a great job of the entire floor game on both ends,"" Hawks assistant coach Nate McMillan said. “I thought he worked hard on the defensive end of the floor. He had Murray to start out the game and did a good job of just trying to work to stay in front of him, fight over the screens. Offensively we wanted to force misses and get out in transition. We were able to do that."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Michael Porter Jr. scored 10 points in the first quarter as the Nuggets shot 72.2% on 20 attempts from the field, but led just 33-27. Porter did not score the rest of the game. ... Denver was outscored 37-23 in the second. ... The Nuggets dropped to 1-10 when allowing at least 119 points. ... Jokic pulled down 10 rebounds for his league-leading 27th double-double. Hawks: Atlanta has won 10 of the series’ last 12 games at State Farm Arena. The Hawks are 25-5 at home against Denver since the 1989-90 season. ... Capela, the NBA’s rebounding leader, finished four under his average. STILL ON THE SHELF JaMychal Green’s right shoulder was already hurting going into the Cleveland game Friday when he got hit in the left shoulder after just 1:15 on the floor. He quickly left and couldn’t play against Atlanta. “I don’t think it’s going to be a long-term thing,” coach Michael Malone said. “I’m hoping maybe we can get him back sometime in the near future.” It appears starting guard Gary Harris will need more time off with a left adductor strain. He came back at Washington earlier in the week, but wasn’t his usual self, scoring two points and handing out one assist in 28 minutes. The Nuggets were also without F Paul Millsap (right knee sprain) and P.J. Dozier (hamstring). Atlanta was missing F De’Andre Hunter (right knee surgery), G Bogdan Bogdanovic (right knee fracture), G Kris Dunn (right ankle surgery), G Rajon Rondo (lower back pain). QUARANTINED Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce missed his third straight game, this time because the NBA ruled that COVID-19 restrictions meant he needs to stay away from the team a couple of more days. Pierce had stayed at home from two games at Boston earlier this week for the birth of his second child. “We thought or anticipated he would be able to return for this night’s game, but the NBA stepped in and he had to take a couple more days off,” said McMillan, who took charge for the third straight game. “He should be available, if everything goes well, for Cleveland’s game on Tuesday.” McMillan said Pierce had a Zoom call with the staff to go over Sunday’s game plan. “He’s doing great,” McMillan said. “His family’s doing good. He’s watching film and in the mix of trying to help with the baby, but he basically prepped us for the game tonight with the coaches this morning. He went through everything with us on a Zoom call because he anticipated being here tonight and unfortunately he can’t because of the protocol, but the family’s doing well.”","401267630"

(0:18) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 38 points and Khris Middleton scored 32 to lead the Milwaukee Bucks past the skidding Sacramento Kings 128-115 on Sunday night. “I thought individually they were good, and they had good moments together,” Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. “I thought our defense set the table and we were able to get out and both of them were able to be in attack mode.” The Bucks won their second straight after ending a five-game losing streak with a victory over Oklahoma City on Friday night. “It felt good. We were making the right plays. We were being aggressive. We were finding teammates,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We’ve done this for eight years.” Antetokounmpo added 18 rebounds, one off his season best, as the Bucks sent the Kings to their seventh consecutive loss. Milwaukee has won nine in a row against Sacramento. The two-time reigning MVP attempted 24 free throws, a career high. He made 19, tied for his most ever. “Part of the game plan was if he has a layup, let’s wrap him up. He’s supposed to be a 64% free throw shooter,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. “Unfortunately, tonight he looked like Steve Nash shooting free throws.” The Bucks led 28-25 after one quarter but poured it on in the second, leading by as many as 17. Milwaukee began to take control midway through the period when Jabari Parker appeared to draw a charge on Antetokounmpo as he sank a short jumper. Budenholzer challenged the call, which was reversed, resulting in a blocking call against Parker. Antetokounmpo made the foul shot to complete the three-point play. The Kings rallied to cut the lead to eight with just under two minutes left in the half before the Bucks scored six straight to put the finishing touches on a 42-point quarter. Milwaukee scored the first eight points of the third quarter to build a 22-point lead and held a 99-82 margin heading to the fourth. Sacramento pulled within 12 early in the fourth but the Bucks remained in command throughout the quarter. Rookie guard Tyrese Haliburton, a native of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, paced the Kings with 23 points. DaQuan Jeffries added 18. “I dreamt of playing for the Bucks or against the Bucks, just playing in Milwaukee, playing in the NBA, my whole life,” Haliburton said. “It was special to have a lot of my friends and family in the stands.” GENERAL PUBLIC RETURNS The Bucks welcomed back a limited number of regular fans for the first time since March 4 of last season. About 1,800 people attended the game, which amounts to 10% of the arena’s capacity. The Bucks played in front of 750 spectators — invited guests and family members of players — on Friday after inviting 250 spectators on Tuesday and 500 on Thursday. Bucks officials plan to seek permission from the Milwaukee Health Department to increase fan capacity to 25%, or about 4,300 fans, after the completion of the current eight-game homestand. PARKER SIGHTING After being inactive or not getting a single minute of playing time during Sacramento’s first 28 games, Parker saw action for a second consecutive game. After logging nine minutes Saturday night, the Bucks' first-round pick (second overall) in the 2014 draft played 16 minutes and tallied six points against his former team. TIP-INS Kings: F Harrison Barnes (strained left foot) — Sacramento’s second-leading scorer — missed his third consecutive game. … F Richaun Holmes (sore right knee) returned after missing three games. … F Glenn Robinson III, unavailable Saturday night with a sore right knee, was away from the team Sunday for personal reasons. Bucks: G Jrue Holiday missed an eighth consecutive game due to the league’s health and safety protocols but was on the bench. Reserve guard Jaylen Adams was unavailable for the same reason for the second straight game. ... Milwaukee activated rookie second-round draft pick Sam Merrill, who was recalled from the NBA G League’s Memphis Hustle.","401267631"
"Paul George talks about not being able to finish the Clippers' game vs. the Nets due to his minutes restriction. (0:52) LOS ANGELES -- — James Harden scored 37 points and the Brooklyn Nets held off a furious fourth-quarter rally to edge the Los Angeles Clippers 112-108 on Sunday night for their season-best sixth victory in a row. The Nets wrapped up a 5-0 trip, beating Golden State, Sacramento, Phoenix, and both Los Angeles teams to complete their longest undefeated single trip in franchise history. All but two of the wins were by double digits. They've now defeated West teams eight straight times. “Winning six in a row, all it does is keep the world silent for a bit,” Kyrie Irving said. “When we hit a bump in the road, then it’s, ‘What’s going on with the Nets?' The destination is making it to that main stage and earning our way there.” Harden just missed a triple double, finishing with 11 rebounds and seven assists. Irving added 28 points and eight assists. Paul George led the Clippers with 34 points. Kawhi Leonard had 29 points on 9-of-19 shooting. Ivica Zubac finished with 13 points, but no other Clippers reached double figures. Lou Williams was 2 of 11, and Marcus Morris 2 of 7. The Nets dominated in the paint, outscoring the Clippers, 60-38. Leonard hit a pair of free throws to it it 108-all with 28 seconds remaining. Irving missed a 3-pointer and former Clipper DeAndre Jordan grabbed the offensive rebound and scored. Leonard got called for an offensive foul that put Harden at the line, and he made both free throws to finish off the victory. “No call, so great defense,” said Leonard, who promptly got up and walked out of his postgame virtual media session. Brooklyn got off to a quick start in the fourth. Harden breezed past Zubac to score, Joe Harris hit a 3-pointer and Harden made a pair of free throws for a 15-point lead — its largest of the game. Zubac and George combined to score 20 straight points, drawing the Clippers to 103-99. Zubac dunked twice and George made two 3-pointers and six free throws in the spurt. Leonard ran off four in a row that drew the Clippers to 107-103. Patrick Beverley fouled Jeff Green from behind with 2:50 remaining. Green crumpled to the floor and the Clippers challenged the call, but lost. Green kicked over a drink cooler on his way off the court. “We showed mental toughness and belief by continuing on this trip no matter who is available,” Nets coach Steve Nash said, citing the team’s 24-point comeback at Phoenix and its recovery from blowing the lead to the Clippers. “Some of that toughness has to be built, it’s not just turned on.” Williams hit a 3-pointer and Jordan fouled Leonard, who made both for the tie. Brooklyn stretched a seven-point halftime lead to 11 points in the third. The Clippers closed within four points on a basket by George, but the Nets quickly got back to double digits on a 3-pointer by Harris. Irving scored 12 points — matching his total from the first half — to send the Nets into the fourth leading 89-79. “We’re still growing, but this is a really good road trip for us,” Harden said. “From when I first got here, we’re playing hard and we’re playing smart. We’ve had time to go over things on both sides of the ball and that’s why we’re playing better.” TIP-INS Nets: Kevin Durant missed his fourth straight game with a left hamstring strain. He's averaging 29 points, 7.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists. “Even when Kevin gets back, it's not going to be easy,” Harden said. Clippers: Fell to 11-6 at home. ... Previously lost to the Nets by four points Feb. 2. OVER AND OUT George was pulled with 2:50 to play and the Clippers down six. He had clocked 33 minutes; his playing time is being restricted as he returns from a toe injury. “I wanted to keep going,” he said. “I’m healthy and I feel good.” HELPING HAND Harden is working to help out people in his former city of Houston affected by the winter storms that knocked out electricity and caused pipes to burst in the unusual cold that battered the region. Besides food, he says water will be shipped in this week and he's talking to plumbing companies about repairs. “It won’t stop because there’s so many people that’s been affected that I can’t stop,” he said. “Phone calls every day trying to impact the city because they’re shown me so much love and respect.”","401267632"
"Jae'Sean Tate cleans up a miss by coming out of nowhere for a putback flush. (0:24) HOUSTON -- — Coby White scored 24 points, and the Chicago Bulls used a big third quarter to pull away for a 120-100 win over the short-handed Houston Rockets on Monday night. Zach LaVine scored 14 of Chicago's 46 third-quarter points, finishing with 21, as the Bulls outscored the Rockets by 20 points in the quarter to break open a tight game. “He’s an efficient scorer because he scores not taking a lot of shots,” coach Billy Donovan said of LaVine, who made 4 of 6 3s on Tuesday. “When he lets it go from behind the line you feel like it’s going in.” Chicago had runs of 15-4 and 12-0 in the third period. During that second burst, Houston missed four shots, two of which were air balls, and had a turnover. Houston coach Stephen Silas said LaVine's breakout quarter was pivotal. “I think him getting hot caused some adversity that we didn’t handle correctly,” Silas said. “We have at times succumbed to that adversity and let them do what they want to do and that was the case tonight.” David Nwaba scored 22 points off the bench to lead Houston, which has lost eight straight. The Rockets had their previous two games postponed because of a winter storm and subsequent utility outages in the Houston area. “It got away from us as far as our defensive principles, our chemistry, our togetherness,” Silas said. “All of the things that you need to compete in an NBA game we didn’t have tonight.” The Rockets have been without center Christian Wood since Feb. 5, and DeMarcus Cousins, who has been filling in for him, sat out Monday with a sore right heel. Victor Oladipo remained sidelined with a strained right foot. Wendell Carter Jr. added 18 points with 13 rebounds for the Bulls, who have won four of their last five. TIP-INS Bulls: Otto Porter Jr. missed his 11th straight game with back spasms. ... Thaddeus Young scored 17 points off the bench. Rockets: Oladipo missed his fourth straight game. ... Jae'Sean Tate had 12 points. STUMPING FOR ZACH Donovan has talked often about LaVine's improved play this season, and he hopes LaVine's performance will put him into the All-Star game for the first time when reserves are announced on Tuesday night. “He’s learning, he’s evolving, he’s growing, and he continues to get better,” Donovan said. “My feeling is he’s played at an All-Star level and I don’t anybody would dispute that. He deserves to be in the game."" LaVine ranks sixth in the league in scoring by averaging a career-best 28.6 points per game and his 5.1 assists are also a career high. WHITE'S SPILL White went to the locker room for a few minutes early in the third quarter after falling down chasing a loose ball and crashing into the padded backstop on the goal. “My nose was busted, other than that I was cool,” he said. “They just had to stop the bleeding.”","401267634"
"The Heat pull away from the Thunder with a big run to open the fourth quarter. (0:41) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Duncan Robinson scored 22 points and made six 3-pointers, leading the Miami Heat to a 108-94 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night in the finale of their seven-game road trip. Kendrick Nunn added 20 points and nine assists, Bam Adebayo had 19 points and 13 rebounds, and they hooked up on an alley-oop dunk during Miami’s 15-0 run to start the fourth quarter. Robinson ended it with a 3-pointer that gave the Heat a 94-77 lead midway through the final period. The Heat did it all with five-time NBA All-Star Jimmy Butler on the sideline for the last 12 minutes. “It was great, just the enthusiasm,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I think those guys wanted to play well while he was on the bench and see if we could push the lead. “Then, when we took that first timeout, I looked at Jimmy, and Jimmy was in the huddle and he said, ’Hey guys, keep going. Let’s give it another two or three minutes and see how it goes.'” Spoelstra said Butler’s comments energized the group, which kept its double-digit margin and won the final three games of its trip to finish 4-3. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 27 points for the Thunder, who were outscored 63-40 after halftime. “I give them a lot of credit. They came out of halftime really focused and we had to earn everything on both ends of the floor in the second half,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “They just outplayed us. … We definitely enjoy competing against a team like them, because we learn a lot about ourselves. They just outlasted us tonight.” The Heat made five of their first eight 3-point attempts. Max Strus capped the hot start with one with 4:19 remaining in the first quarter. Miami missed its next 12 3-point shots. Robinson finally ended the drought with a 31-foot jumper with 43 seconds left until the break. Meanwhile, the Thunder shot 54% from the floor through the first 24 minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander fueled Oklahoma City’s 54-45 halftime advantage, scoring 18 points on 6-of-7 shooting. His only miss of the half came via a 27-foot stepback as time expired in the first period. Miami responded with 34 points in the third quarter to take a 79-72 lead with under a minute left. Gilgeous-Alexander rattled off five points in the final 31.6 seconds to bring the Thunder within two entering the final period before Miami promptly blew it open. TIP-INS Heat: Tyler Herro (right hip contusion) was ruled out ahead of Monday’s game. He is day to day, according to Spoelstra. … The Heat haven’t played at home since a Feb. 9 win over the New York Knicks. … Jimmy Butler played in his 600th career game. Thunder: Al Horford (rest) was not available for Oklahoma City’s second game in as many nights. Isaiah Roby started in Horford’s place. … The Thunder fell to 2-4 when playing the second game of a back-to-back. … Darius Bazley finished with 13 points on 5-of-9 shooting and five rebounds. END OF THE ROAD The Heat lost three consecutive games before beating the Sacramento Kings on Feb. 18, the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday and the Thunder on Monday. Adebayo attributes the team’s time on the road to the group’s strong finish and strengthened bond within the locker room. “We got better,” Adebayo said. “I feel like it was one of those situations, it felt like the bubble again where we got a chance to be cohesive and feel like brothers again. … When we’re at home, we can’t really hang out with each other. So, being able to be in the hotel and be safe, it feels like the bubble.”","401267635"

"Devin Booker gets by his defender and throws up a shot that somehow falls in while drawing the foul. (0:26) PHOENIX -- — Devin Booker's 17-footer to beat the halftime buzzer brought the 3,000 fans to their feet. His 3-pointer with two seconds remaining in the third quarter earned an even bigger roar from the socially distanced crowd. Because of shots like those, no heroics were needed in the fourth. Booker took a seat on the bench and got comfortable. This one was over. Booker scored 34 points, Deandre Ayton added 19 and the Phoenix Suns kept rolling with a 132-100 win over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. There's been some talk over the past few months about whether Booker should earn his second straight All-Star selection. He certainly looked worthy in a dominant performance against the Blazers. Booker finished 12 of 17 from the field and hit both his 3-point attempts. He was 8 for 8 at the free throw line. “There’s no doubt about it,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “Nobody can debate Book’s not an All-Star, end of story.” Said forward Mikal Bridges: “You see what he does game in and game out: leads us to wins. He deserves it — that's all I have to say.” Phoenix has won nine of its past 10 games and put this one away late in the third quarter with a fast flurry. Booker made his 3-pointer with two seconds remaining and then — following a quick Portland turnover — Cam Johnson hit another 3 at the buzzer to give the Suns a 100-71 lead. The 32-point win was the Suns' largest margin of victory this season. “Everyone's locked in,” Booker said. Portland has lost two straight following a six-game winning streak. The Suns improved to 20-10 on the season while the Trail Blazers fell to 18-12. Booker poured in points all night, scoring 17 as the Suns pushed ahead 32-26 in the first quarter. The sixth-year guard was up to 22 points by halftime, including an off-balance 17-footer at the buzzer that gave Phoenix a 63-54 advantage. Damian Lillard led the Trail Blazers with 16 points in the first half and finished with 24. Nassir Little added 18 off the bench. It was a fairly tight game until the third quarter, when the Suns had a 37-17 advantage. “It went off track in the third quarter, which is an understatement,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Stotts said he was confident his team would get back on track after the rough night. “We always bounce back. That has been a trait of ours,” Stotts said. “You are going to have some bad losses and it is how you respond to them. That is what matters.” COOLING OFF, A LITTLE Phoenix entered on an incredible shooting roll from long range, breaking the franchise record with 24 3-pointers in a win Saturday against Memphis. That came one night after tying the franchise record with 22 3s against the Pelicans. It was the fourth time in NBA history that a team made at least 22 3s in back-to-back games. The Suns were very good again on Monday from long range, but not quite as prolific. They shot 16 of 33 on 3-pointers (48.5%). TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland got good minutes from its bench in the first half. Rodney Hood had nine points and Carmelo Anthony added eight. ... Anthony got a technical foul in the third quarter for elbowing Suns forward Jae Crowder in the face. Suns: Booker scored the team's first six points and made six of his first seven shots. ... Phoenix's bench contributed 64 points. Dario Saric had 14 and Johnson added 13.","401267637"
"Donovan Mitchell makes a 3 to give the Jazz 27 3-pointers for the game, setting a franchise record. (0:19) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Once again, Utah overwhelmed Charlotte with a barrage of 3-pointers. Donovan Mitchell and the Jazz enjoyed another record-breaking performance from long range Monday night in a 132-110 victory against the Hornets. Utah set a franchise mark for 3s with 28, including 19 off the bench — the most by any team’s backups in NBA history, according to STATS. The Jazz set their previous mark for 3s with 26 in the first meeting between the teams on Feb. 5. Several of Utah’s outside shots this time came during a 26-2 run that erased a double-digit lead for Charlotte and put the Jazz (25-6) firmly in control after an uneven performance on both ends through the first three quarters. “The No. 1 team in the league wins a game like that,” Mitchell said. “That’s really where our head is at. That’s where we need to continue to be.” Mitchell, who had 23 points and eight assists, credited an uptick in defensive stops starting late in the third quarter with breaking open the floodgates on offense. “It looks good, but I think the biggest thing was our defensive energy,” Mitchell said. “Everything stepped up and made it tougher on them.” Joe Ingles and Georges Niang led the way from the perimeter, making a career-high seven 3s apiece. Both players finished with 21 points. Jordan Clarkson added 20. Gordon Hayward and LaMelo Ball each scored 21 points to lead the Hornets. Malik Monk added 20. Charlotte (14-16) lost despite scoring 25 points off 21 Utah turnovers. “I feel like we just all got tired,” Ball said. “We didn’t put four quarters together, we put three together.” The Jazz continuously attacked from the perimeter starting from the opening tip. They shot 29 3-pointers before halftime — a club record for attempts in a half. It paid off at times. Utah made eight 3s in the first quarter as 72% of its shot attempts came from behind the arc during the period. Still, the Jazz fell behind in the second quarter and trailed much of the third after getting lackadaisical on defense and committing repeated turnovers on offense. Charlotte finished with 21 fast-break points, 14 by halftime. “They made plays and took advantage of the fact that we weren’t as precise as we needed to be on the defensive end,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “I thought in the second half we cleaned a lot of those things up, a lot of those little things.” Charlotte built its first double-digit lead early in the third when P.J. Washington’s steal and slam capped a 12-1 run that put the Hornets ahead 81-70. Charlotte forced six turnovers during the spurt and scored four baskets off those turnovers — highlighted by 3-pointers on three straight possessions from Ball, Hayward and Washington. Utah erased the deficit and went back ahead on back-to-back baskets from Clarkson and Niang before the third quarter ended. Their buckets sparked the team’s decisive 26-2 run. The Jazz opened the fourth with baskets on five straight possessions. Consecutive 3-pointers from Mike Conley and Niang punctuated the run and gave Utah a 111-92 lead. “We could not score,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “And we could not set our defense. That’s the challenge with the young group is when you’re not scoring, can you come back and still have the same intensity?” TIP-INS Hornets: Hayward exited with a wrist injury with 10 minutes left. He did not return and is day-to-day. … Charlotte got charged a technical foul late in the third quarter for having six players on the court with an active ball. Jazz: Utah became the fastest team in NBA history to make 500 3-pointers in a season, reaching the milestone in just 31 games. … Rudy Gobert and Snyder were both called for technical fouls in the fourth quarter. PERIMETER PERFECTION Niang broke a shooting slump in spectacular fashion, making as many 3-pointers as he did in his previous four games combined. He shot 2 of 10 from the field during the two-game series against the Clippers a few days earlier. The reserve forward finished 7 of 7 from 3-point range in the second 20-point game of his NBA career. Niang’s 21 points were a season high. “I just like the fact he didn’t hesitate, and he kept shooting,” Snyder said. “That’s how you break through is if you keep shooting.”","401267638"
"Stephen A. Smith details whether LeBron James should be doing more with Anthony Davis out of the lineup. (1:52) LOS ANGELES -- — Bradley Beal scored six of his 33 points on three consecutive possessions late in overtime, and the Washington Wizards extended their longest winning streak in three years to five straight with a 127-124 victory over the slumping Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night. Russell Westbrook scored six of his 32 points in overtime for the Wizards, who rallied from a 17-point deficit in the second half. Washington then took advantage of a missed free throw by LeBron James late in regulation and went on to its first win over the Lakers at Staples Center since March 2017. “It feels different, in a great way,” Beal said of the Wizards' impressive five-game run against Boston, Houston, Denver, Portland and the Lakers. “It feels great, but at the same time, we still haven’t done a damn thing. We realize that, and we keep telling each other that. We’ve still got bad habits we need to break, but we don’t discount what we did.” Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit a 3-pointer with 36 seconds left in overtime to trim the Wizards' lead to 125-124. Westbrook made a layup before missing a free throw, but James and Kyle Kuzma missed late 3s before the buzzer. “It’s been tough, but we’ve been sticking together,” Westbrook said of the Wizards, who started the season 6-17. “That’s the main thing. If you get caught up with everything else going on, teams and players tend to come apart, but we’ve been sticking together and communicating on how to become a better team, and it’s been paying off for us.” James had 31 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds for the Lakers, who struggled in the second half of their fourth loss in five games. After carrying the Lakers back in the fourth quarter, James made a tying layup with 9.8 seconds left in regulation, but missed the ensuing free throw to put LA ahead. Beal missed a long jumper at the buzzer. Montrezl Harrell had a season-high 26 points and nine rebounds for the defending NBA champions, who have lost three straight for the first time this season — not coincidentally during three consecutive games without Anthony Davis and Dennis Schröder. “It takes a whole team to collectively get wins, and right now we have two of our main rotation guys out,” said Kuzma, who had 14 points. “Obviously there’s no excuses. You don’t want to lose to an under-.500 team like that, but this is the NBA and anybody can win. We just have to figure it out.” Davis missed his fourth straight game, and the All-NBA big man is out for at least three more weeks with a calf injury. Schröder will miss at least one more game under the NBA's health and safety protocols. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington hadn’t won even four consecutive games since its last five-game winning streak in February 2018. ... Former Lakers C Moe Wagner had six points, and former Lakers swingman Isaac Bonga didn't play. Lakers: Marc Gasol converted a four-point play in the first quarter. He finished with seven points in 27 minutes. ... Caldwell-Pope scored 21 points. THE KING'S MINUTES The 36-year-old James played over 43 minutes during the Lakers’ fourth overtime game in 17 days, all of them at home against teams with losing records. James is third in the NBA in total minutes, with over 200 more than anyone else on the Lakers' roster. He insists the workload doesn't bother him, even after learning he'll have to go to the All-Star Game instead of resting up. “It’s something I’ve done before,” James said. “I can continue to do it, but I would much rather us be whole.”","401267639"
"Atlanta rushes their shots late and Lamar Stevens makes them pay with a two-handed dunk with less than 5 seconds left to take the win. (0:52) CLEVELAND -- — Trae Young went from snubbed to stunned. Rookie forward Lamar Stevens drove for an easy dunk with 4.1 seconds left and Atlanta, which had burned its final timeout, failed to get off a final shot as the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Hawks 112-111 on Tuesday night to end their 10-game losing streak — the NBA's longest this season. After Young, slighted hours earlier when All-Star reserves were announced, missed a runner with 11 seconds left, the Cavs pushed the ball up trailing by one. Collin Sexton passed it on the left wing to Stevens, signed earlier this season to a two-way contract, and he dunked without any resistance. The Hawks, who had lost a timeout when they appealed a call with 19 seconds to go, had one last chance. Young hurried up court, but was well covered and passed the ball to the corner to Tony Snell, who didn't get off a final 3-pointer in time and the Cavaliers celebrated on their way to the locker room as if they had just won a playoff series. “The best part about that game is when you go up and down the stat sheet, literally everybody who played contributed to winning that game,” Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “That’s what made it even better and even sweeter, although they all taste sweet at this point.” The loss was a double blow for Young, who finished with 28 points (on 9-of-27 shooting) and 12 assists. He was already on the floor for pregame warmups when the NBA revealed the All-Star backups for next month’s showcase in Atlanta. An All-Star last season, Young came in averaging 35.3 points in his past three games, and 26.9 this season — the most of any player not picked. “It’s kind of confusing how I didn’t make it,” Young said. “But it happens. All I’ve been focusing on this year is my team and how we can improve. I’ve been an All-Star before and it’s all been about how I can improve and have our team win, so to me it’s more confusing.” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce felt Young deserved a spot. “It's unfortunate,” he said. “He's had an All-Star year, without a doubt.” It was Cleveland's first win since Feb. 1, and for long stretches of the fourth quarter it appeared in doubt. Sexton, who has his own All-Star case, scored 29 points to lead the Cavs. Darius Garland added 17 and Jarrett Allen had 13 points and 14 rebounds for Cleveland, which also got five 3-pointers from rookie Dylan Windler. Kevin Huerter scored 22 for the Hawks, and Clint Capela added 17 rebounds. COLLINS HURT Hawks starting forward John Collins played only 13 minutes. He left in the first half with a possible concussion. The loss of Collins depleted Atlanta even more because Cam Reddish sat out with soreness in his Achilles tendon. FRESH FACE With several power forwards injured, and center Andre Drummond sitting while the Cavs try to trade him, Bickerstaff started seldom-used Dean Wade, a 24-year-old who played in the G League last year and came in averaging 2.1 points per game. Wade made one of Cleveland's nine 3-pointers in the first half as the Cavs built a 13-point lead. He finished with five points — the 3-pointer and a follow dunk. TIP-INS Hawks: Pierce returned after missing three games for the birth of his second child last week. ... G Rajon Rondo returned after missing seven games with a lower back issue. He had seven points in 14 minutes. ... Atlanta came in leading the league with 21.9 made free throws per game. The Hawks hit 17. Cavaliers: F Kevin Love continues to be sidelined with a calf injury that has lingered longer than expected. Love, who has only played in two games this season, appeared to be close to returning last week but experienced some soreness. He's doing on-court activities, but not taking part in practices. ... F Taurean Prince missed his third straight game with a sore ankle. ... G Matthew Dellavedova sat on the bench. He's missed all season with a concussion and had his appendix removed last weekend.","401267640"
"Mason Plumlee leads Jerami Grant to the basket for a nice two-handed finish, then Grant returns the favor as he lobs to Plumlee for a dunk of his own. (0:21) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Not long after Saben Lee scored a career-best 21 points and helped the Detroit Pistons snap a three-game losing streak, the point guard was presented with a memento to ensure he won’t soon forget the game. Lee, a rookie out of Vanderbilt on a two-way contract, made 8 of 11 shots and all three of his 3-pointers as the Pistons started fast and dominated the second half in a 105-93 win over the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night. Following the 10th game of his NBA career, Lee was presented with the game ball by coach Dwane Casey in a joyous locker room celebration. “It was a great feeling, just having my teammates there congratulating me and coach Casey giving me the game ball,” said Lee, who topped his previous career high of 12 points set two nights earlier in Orlando. “It was definitely a moment that I’m going to remember. I’m just happy I got to experience that.” Detroit, which has an NBA-worst road record of 3-14, won for the first time since Feb. 14. Outplayed throughout a 105-96 loss to the Magic on Sunday, the Pistons raced to a 15-point first-quarter lead, dominated the third quarter and rode balanced scoring the rest of the way for the victory. Lee was pressed into duty the past two games after Delon Wright suffered a groin injury that is expected to keep him out for two weeks. Strong on Sunday with 12 points, five assists and three steals, Lee scored 13 points in the first half on Tuesday to key the Pistons’ strong start. He added four assists and two steals on Tuesday. “Like I said, he’s not your typical rookie because he’s come from a professional background with his dad going through the NFL,” Casey said of Lee. “He’s been around pro sports, he’s not caught up in the bright lights or overwhelmed with the NBA. And he’s a very intelligent young man and he doesn’t get rattled.” Detroit’s ninth victory of the season ended Orlando’s three-game winning streak and put a damper on Magic center Nikola Vucevic’s selection as a reserve for the NBA All-Star Game. Just two nights after battering the undersized Pistons for 37 points and 13 rebounds, Vucevic finished with 20 points and nine rebounds. He shot 9 for 22 shots and missed 6 of 8 3-point attempts. “It was one of the best feelings ever, a huge honor and it’s something I’m really proud to do in my career — make the All-Star team twice,” Vucevic said. “Especially this year, with all the guys in the East who could have made it. Just very humbled and hopefully it’s not the last one.” Josh Jackson had 18 points for a Detroit bench that came into the game first in the NBA in reserves scoring (41.2 ppg.). Jerami Grant had 17 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Dennis Smith Jr. added 14 points for the Pistons, who shot 46.6% despite 10-for-34 shooting from 3-point range. Detroit’s defense held Orlando to 37.5% shooting. The Magic dropped to 1-12 when failing to score 100 points. Magic guard Evan Fournier, who scored season-highs of 28 and 29 points in the previous two games, had 14 points in the loss. He left the game in the first quarter after being hit in the jaw by Jackson’s elbow. He returned in the second period and made just 4 of 14 shots in the game. TIP INS Pistons: Detroit held 33-year-old guard Wayne Ellington out on the advice of the analytics department, Casey said. Tuesday’s game would have been the eighth in 15 nights for Ellington, who has averaged 10.3 points in 23 games. Magic: Clifford has been consistent in saying his team wouldn’t make strides until defensive improvements were made. In their five games prior to Tuesday, the Magic went 4-1, largely because of a defensive rating that is second in the NBA since Feb. 12. On Tuesday, Orlando surrendered 20 points off turnovers and 16 fast break points.","401267641"
"James Harden connects with Bruce Brown on a long pass for a layup vs. the Kings. (0:21) NEW YORK -- — Bruce Brown scored 13 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Brooklyn Nets to a 127-118 win over the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night. The Nets had five players score in double figures. James Harden recorded his sixth triple-double with the Nets, finishing with 29 points, 11 rebounds and 14 assists. He ranks second in franchise history, one behind Jason Kidd. Kyrie Irving added 21 points as Brooklyn extended its winning streak to seven games and improved to 21-12. The Nets swept their regular-season series against Sacramento, which has lost eight in a row. De’Aaron Fox led the Kings with 27 points. Despite leading for much of the game, the Nets led by a point (110-109) after Fox hit a 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter. But, in a little more four minutes, the Nets went on a 14-1 run to put the game away. “It's all (defense),” lamented Harrison Barnes. “We have to be better at that.” On a star-laden squad, Brown played the role of closer. Brown, who has filled in for the injured Kevin Durant at power forward, knocked down two 3-pointers from in front of the Kings’ bench and added a jump shot for good measure. “He competes his butt off every single night,” Harden said of Brown. “He does it all.” TIP-INS: Nets: Harden was named as a reserve to the NBA’s All-Star Game. The announcement marks the ninth time in the 31-year old Harden’s 11 seasons that he was selected to be an All-Star. Entering the game, Harden was averaging 24.9 points and 11.4 assists in the 18 games he has played with the Nets since being acquired in a four-team trade on Jan. 13. “I don’t want to diminish how great he is because I kind of expected this,” Nets head coach Steve Nash said about Harden during his pregame availability. “It’s even more impressive when he’s on your team.” Along with the 31-year old Harden, the Nets will be represented at the Mar. 7 game in Atlanta by Irving and Durant. It will be the first time in franchise history that the Nets have three players selected to an All-Star team in a single season. Kings: Details matter. And the Kings have allowed the details of their game to slip. That, in essence, was Sacramento coach Luke Walton’s assessment of his team prior to the game. “Our guys want to start winning again,” Walton said. “They tasted it. We’re in a tough stretch.” Prior to the current eight game losing streak, the Kings had won seven of eight. “When we were winning games, we were doing those (detail things) at a pretty high level, and that’s dropped off with the losses. We have to understand, win or lose, we have to keep playing the same type of way. ... Walton’s pregame availability was delayed as the Sacramento coach was caught in traffic. “New York traffic still exists,” he said in a deadpan fashion. “Even in a pandemic.” ETC.: The game marked the first time in the truncated season that the Nets played in front of home fans due to the coronavirus pandemic. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced earlier this month that stadiums and arenas could open with limited capacity, and Tuesday night’s Nets and Knicks games were the first events in New York City to have fans in the building. The 324 fans who attended the game at Barclays Center had to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test administered three days before the event, and were socially distanced, sitting in the designated seats in the lower bowl. “It was definitely nice,” Nets forward Joe Harris said.","401267642"
"In a postgame news conference, Steph Curry explains how he dealt with the news of Tiger Woods' accident earlier in the day. (0:56) NEW YORK -- — There were only about 2,000 fans in Madison Square Garden, far fewer than would normally pack the place when Stephen Curry and the Warriors come to town. But in New York, even a small crowd can make a big sound — until Curry quieted it down. Curry scored 37 points to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 114-106 victory over the New York Knicks on Tuesday night in the first game this season with fans at the arena. “There were some fans heckling, which was awesome, and me and Draymond (Green) were talking about it: There’s no better feeling — I don’t care if it’s 19,000 or 2,500 or whatever it is — you love silencing a road crowd,” Curry said. “So that was a cool experience considering not many arenas have had fans this year and it does make a huge difference.” Curry, who owns a 50-point game and a triple-double at MSG, returned from a one-game absence to make the tiebreaking 3-pointer with 3:38 left. He scored 26 points in the second half and added six rebounds and six assists against one of the NBA's best defensive teams. “So they make it tough, but Steph found a way to score,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “It was not easy but he found a way and made some huge shots and created a lot of offense for us.” Curry's performance came in the first NBA game at Madison Square Garden with fans since the Knicks beat Detroit last March 8, days before the season was suspended as the coronavirus was about to begin pummeling New York. Julius Randle went from the high of his first All-Star selection to the low of getting ejected in the final seconds after picking up his second technical foul. He had 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Gov. Andrew Cuomo allowed New York's arenas to open to fans at 10% capacity, which meant roughly 2,000 at The Garden. They greeted the Knicks with loud cheers early on, but there were the familiar noticeable groans after a turnover during a dismal stretch of the third quarter, when the Warriors opened a 13-point lead. New York recovered from that and had the game tied at 97 before Curry's 3-pointer. He converted a three-point play about two minutes later to make it 105-100 and helped finish it off at the foul line, where he was 12 for 12. “I felt like we got good shots but to be honest, we weren’t getting the calls,” Knicks guard Derrick Rose said. “I felt like guys were going to the lane and we weren’t getting the same calls and that makes it hard when it’s that lopsided.” Kelly Oubre Jr. added 19 points and Andrew Wiggins had 16 for the Warriors, who got centers James Wiseman and Kevon Looney back from injuries and won for the first time after two rough losses on their four-game road trip. Randle was the first Knicks player selected to the All-Star Game since Kristaps Porzingis in 2018. Randle addressed the crowd before the game, but the start of his remarks were drowned out by fans chanting “MVP! MVP!” “It was really special. It was surreal in a sense,” he said. “Everything you can dream of and it seemed like it all came to fruition. It was amazing, honestly.” TIP-INS Warriors: Wiggins celebrated his 26th birthday. ... Juan Toscano-Anderson, the forward on a two-way contract who had started the last 10 games while the centers were out, didn't play. ... Wiseman missed 11 games with a sprained left wrist and Looney missed 10 with a sprained left ankle. Knicks: Elfrid Payton scored 20 points and Rose had 16. ... A message from Randle's mother congratulating him on his All-Star selection played during a timeout in the first half. BACK IN THE BUILDING Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau called the return of fans “a first step back toward normalcy.” “I think we all know what basketball means to this city, so we’re excited about it,” he said before the game. A Knicks spokesman said the game was a sellout and everyone who attended passed their health screening. Kerr said there was a different vibe in the games the Warriors had played in front of fans. “Even just having a couple thousand fans makes a difference,” he said. “It just feels more normal, more real. The crowd noise actually shows up at the exact right time and not canned laughter like in a sitcom.”","401267643"

"Luka Doncic puts the moves on Daniel Theis and knocks down a 3-pointer, then comes up clutch in the finals moments and drills the game-winning 3-pointer to seal the Mavericks' 110-107 win over the Celtics. (0:53) DALLAS -- — Luka Doncic slammed the scorer's table in joy this time, rather than anger. The Dallas sensation hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 0.1 seconds remaining — his second go-ahead 3 in the final minute — and the Mavericks avoided a fourth-quarter collapse in a 110-107 victory over the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night. The Celtics trailed by 11 points with three minutes to go before Jaylen Brown put them in front in the final minute with a short jumper. Doncic answered with a difficult 3 over 6-foot-8 Daniel Theis before Brown pulled Boston even at 107-all with another bucket. Doncic did it again — this time with Kemba Walker running at him on a step-back shot from the left wing — and turned to the scorer's table in the same way he had after a last-second loss to Phoenix. Devin Booker hit the go-ahead shot in the final seconds of that game before Doncic's desperation attempt missed. That 109-108 loss capped a six-game losing streak. After the latest dramatic shot similar to one Doncic drained to beat the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 4 of a first-round series in the playoff bubble, Boston's desperate inbound toss toward the basket hit the rim, sealing the Dallas win. “It's just something that I've been doing, I tried to do,” said Doncic, who missed a wide-open 3 that would have tied Portland late in a 121-118 loss on Feb. 14 before an eight-day break forced by two weather-related postponements. “But sometimes you're going to miss it, like the last game against Portland. Sometimes you're going to make it.” Doncic scored 31 points on 6-of-8 shooting from 3, while Brown had 29 and Jayson Tatum added 28 in an All-Star matchup for the trio after Brown and Tatum were named Eastern Conference reserves earlier in the day. Doncic is a West starter for the second straight season. Playing without Kristaps Porzingis for a second straight night on a back-to-back because of a tight lower back for his European sidekick, Doncic was steady to help Dallas build a fourth-quarter lead before another spectacular finish five days before his 22nd birthday. He had 10 rebounds and eight assists. “He’s just a very unique player, a very unique person,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “The wiring of people like Luka Doncic, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant, guys that have this laser-like focus in these situations. It’s difficult to explain how their minds and their brains work.” The Mavericks won for the seventh time in nine games to get back to .500 for the first time in almost a month while dropping Boston below the break-even mark for the first time since the third game of the season. The Celtics were coming off an overtime loss at New Orleans when they blew a 24-point lead in the second half. “It took two tremendous shots by a great player to beat us,” Boston coach Brad Stevens said. “Obviously that's another heartbreaking loss. But that feels a little bit different than it did Sunday.” Brown was 12 of 20 from the field on the same day he made his first All-Star team, while Tatum earned his second straight selection. Walker scored 14 of his 21 points in the fourth to help the Boston rally, but the Celtics ended up under .500 this late in the season for the first time since 2014-15. “I don't feel very much like an All-Star because we're below .500,” Brown said. “I think this is the most I've lost since I've been here. I'm hopeful that we'll string some games together and make a run. It's very much in our grasp to do so.” TIP-INS Celtics: Brown and Tatum are just the second pair of under-25 Boston teammates to make the All-Star Game, joining Bob Cousy and Ed Macauley (1953). At 22 years and 357 days, Tatum is the youngest Boston player with multiple All-Star bids. ... Brown and Tatum struggled from 3, combining to go 5 of 18. Mavericks: With Porzingis and fellow starter Maxi Kleber (sprained left ankle) out, James Johnson made his first start for Dallas after not playing the previous six games. He had eight points in 28 minutes, his most in a month. ... Jalen Brunson scored 22 points on 5-of-7 shooting from 3-point range, including 3 of 5 in the fourth quarter. EXPANDING AUDIENCE The Mavericks had their biggest crowd since they started allowing fans Feb. 8. The Mavericks said there were more than 3,000 fans attending for free, an increase from the original maximum of 1,500. The crowd had been limited to vaccinated essential workers, but the club now is allowing season-ticket holders as well while encouraging fans to have either a negative COVID-19 test or be vaccinated. Texas allows up to 50% capacity at sporting events. The current cap is about 13% of the basketball capacity at American Airlines Center. Before the pandemic, the Mavericks had a sellout streak that stretched to 2001, according to the club.","401267645"
"Stephen A. Smith is happy to see Chris Finch get the Timberwolves job but wants to see Black coaches get more opportunities to lead a team. (2:23) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks demonstrated the magnitude of the challenge facing new Minnesota Timberwolves coach Chris Finch. Antetokoumpo had 37 points, eight rebounds and eight assists as the Bucks won 139-112 on Tuesday to spoil Finch’s debut. The Timberwolves lost their fifth straight and ninth in their last 10 games as their record fell to an NBA-worst 7-25. “Every game’s a game to learn from,” Finch said. ""We’ve just got to try to up our physicality on defense. I think that’s what I’d like to see going into the next game.” Finch was working as an assistant coach with the Toronto Raptors before the Timberwolves hired him to replace Ryan Saunders,  who was fired Sunday night after a loss to the New York Knicks. His new team didn’t have nearly enough firepower to keep up with the Bucks, who shot 53.5% overall and went 20 of 42 from 3-point range. Antetokounmpo put up his huge numbers in just 29 minutes. The Bucks appeared intent on resting the reigning two-time MVP for the entire fourth quarter until putting him back in the game with 3:47 left after a 29-point lead had dropped to 16. Bryn Forbes added a season-high 23 points as the Bucks won their third straight and had seven players score in double figures. “I think the ball movement, the unselfishness stood out to me,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Karl-Anthony Towns and Malik Beasley each scored 26 points for the Timberwolves. Towns also had eight rebounds and a career-high 11 assists. They helped Minnesota stay competitive early. The game went back and forth until Milwaukee went on a 21-3 run that began late in the second quarter and continued into the third period, turning a 62-59 edge into an 83-62 advantage. “Obviously we're starting at square one again,” Towns said. “I think that for us, having to learn a whole new coach, how he works and how can we complement his vision best and how can we make it come to life, it's an (adjustment). We have to continue to find ways to figure this out on the fly.” TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota recorded its highest first-quarter point total of the season, though it still trailed 38-36 at the end of the period. ... The Timberwolves were shooting over 60% with just over four minutes left in the first half but cooled off dramatically the rest of the way. Minnesota shot 34.7% (17 of 49) in the second half. Bucks: Budenholzer said Jrue Holiday has started working out on an individual basis, a sign the veteran guard might be approaching a return. Holiday missed a ninth consecutive game Tuesday to due to the NBA’s health and safety protocols. … Khris Middleton wasn’t included on the list of All-Star reserves announced Tuesday. Middleton had made the All-Star Game each of the last two seasons. “A little disappointing, not going to lie,” Middleton said. “But I definitely want to just say congrats to all the guys who did make it, especially the first-timers.” ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT Towns was the first Timberwolves player to publicly address the coaching change, saying on a Zoom call with reporters after Tuesday’s morning shootaround that the firing of Saunders was “a shocking thing.” Towns also stumped for assistant coach David Vanterpool, who is Black, in expressing his disappointment that he was passed over for the job. But the team’s franchise player doubled down on his commitment to the organization and said he’s eager to work with Finch in trying to help bring the Timberwolves out of the league basement. “One of my biggest weaknesses is loyalty,” Towns said, adding: “I want to build something great here.”","401267646"
"Will Barton faces up and goes baseline for the reverse dunk vs. the Trail Blazers. (0:21) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic had 41 points and Jamal Murray celebrated his 24th birthday by scoring 19 of his 24 in the fourth quarter to lead the Denver Nuggets over the Portland Trail Blazers 111-106 on Tuesday night. Damian Lillard had 20 of his 25 points in the second half and added 13 assists but it wasn’t enough for the Blazers, who were coming off a 32-point loss Monday night in Phoenix. They have dropped three straight after a six-game winning streak. “It’s frustrating just because we want to win games,” Lillard said. “It’s as high as you can get when you’re having success. Sometimes you come out on the losing side. We were playing at a high level for a long stretch of games. It’s not easy to sustain that level.” Lillard had only five points at halftime but the Blazers rallied from 12 down to tie it at the break behind Carmelo Anthony’s big second quarter. Anthony hit six of eight shots and two of his three 3-point attempts, scoring 16 of his 19 first-half points in the period. He finished with 24. “We rode Melo in the second quarter,” Portland coach Terry Stotts said. “I thought he was outstanding in the second quarter. The game slowed down in the second half and their two best players played great. Murray had an outstanding fourth quarter when it counted.” Jokic had 23 points in the first half and 12 more in the third quarter to help Denver forge a tie heading into the final 12 minutes. Murray, held in check for the first three quarters, ended the night with a big fourth. He hit six of his next seven shots and three from deep, putting Denver ahead 93-90 with a step-back 3 with 5:59 left. “I’m never going to force it. Joker had it going and I was cool with the five points,” Murray said. “It’s weird for me to say but I’m not looking for the stats, I’m always going to hit the open man. I’m not going to force it to get my points up. Just pick my spots, and sometimes I pick them later.” Murray then made a layup off a bounce pass from Jokic and a turnaround jumper in the lane that gave the Nuggets a 99-92 lead. Murray also hit four free throws in the final 10 seconds to answer 3-pointers from Lillard and Anthony. “It’s impressive. It’s a sight to behold and tonight it was so welcome,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “I knew when I took Nikola out to start the fourth we were going to need Jamal to step up.” TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Monday marked the 10th anniversary of Denver trading Anthony to the New York Knicks. One of the assets the Nuggets received was a first-round draft pick, which they used to select Murray seventh overall in 2016. ... Portland has lost three straight for the first time this season. Nuggets: Denver was still without G Gary Harris (adductor), P.J. Dozier (hamstring), Paul Millsap (left knee strain) and JaMychal Green (right shoulder). With their top two power forwards sidelined, Michael Porter Jr. started at that spot. ... The Nuggets are 9-6 at home. ONE AND ONLY Denver finished with just one turnover, which was an NBA record according to the Nuggets. The one miscue came early in the second quarter when Murray lost the ball out of bounds. “I had the turnover?” Murray said postgame. “I’m sick. I had the one turnover on the team. That’s crazy.” Stotts was impressed by the stat. “I’m sure I’ve seen a one-turnover game but I can’t remember,” he said. “They take good care of the ball. Their two best players handle the ball, they took good care of it.” SLOWLY BUT SURELY Portland guard CJ McCollum has been out since Jan. 16 with a small fracture in his left foot but he was doing some on-court work before the game. Stotts said McCollum is still not close to returning. “He’s not doing much,” Stotts said. “The rehab is going well, they’re pleased with the way the foot is healing, but there’s not much more to that. He’s not running, stationary shooting. He needs to let it run its course.""","401267647"
"Ivica Zubac gets a standing ovation from his teammates as he flushes down a one-handed jam. (0:27) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and the Los Angeles Clippers routed Washington 135-116 on Tuesday night, snapping the Wizards’ season-high five-game winning streak. Paul George had 30 points before exiting with 7:19 remaining because of a minutes restriction after a toe injury. The Clippers had four bench players in double figures as their reserves outscored the Wizards’ subs 58-29. Bradley Beal, the NBA's leading scorer at 32.9 points per game, finished with 28 points and 10 assists. Russell Westbrook had 20 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. “Guys were pretty disappointed that we didn’t play better,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. Washington cut an 18-point deficit to five going into the fourth quarter. But the Clippers' bench was too much even with top reserve Lou Williams resting. Terrance Mann scored their first seven points in the period. “Missing Lou, we needed that and they did a really good job,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. Westbrook scored on his offensive rebound, getting the Wizards within nine. They never got any closer, and were outscored 21-8 as the Clippers went up 132-110. Reggie Jackson sandwiched consecutive 3-pointers between two dunks by Ivica Zubac, who had 12 points and 12 rebounds. Jackson finished with 17 points. “When we need big minutes and a big game out of him, he delivers,” George said of Jackson. “He pushed the pace and made us play faster.” Marcus Morris hit one of LA's eight 3s in the fourth. Mann made two and Leonard had one. “We’re playing the Clippers. They’re really, really good,” Wizards forward Moe Wagner said. “I don’t look at the fourth quarter, I look at the first half. You can’t let players like that get going or they’re going to pick you apart.” Leonard and George teamed up for the Clippers' first eight points of the third. The Wizards outscored Los Angeles 16-4 to cut their deficit to 99-94 going into the fourth. Rui Hachimura and Davis Bertans had five points each, Beal had four, and Wagner scored inside to end the period with 13 points. The Clippers maintained their momentum early in the second, extending their lead to 55-31. From there, the Wizards finally showed some life. Beal ran off seven in a row and hit a 3-pointer as part of a 24-17 run that left them trailing 72-55 at halftime. Washington's three young starters — Wagner, Hachimura and Garrison Mathews — combined to shoot 5 of 10 in the first half. George and Paul fueled a hot start for the Clippers. The two All-Stars combined to score their team's first 16 points on the way to a 36-20 lead after one quarter. The Wizards got off to a poor start, shooting 8 of 22 with just six rebounds. Beal and Westbrook were a combined 3 of 11. TIP-INS Wizards: Beal was coming off back-to-back games of 30-plus points against the Trail Blazers and Lakers. ... Bertans caught George's left elbow in his mouth, drawing blood in the second. ... Westbrook picked up a technical in the second, yelling from the sideline when he didn't like a defensive 3-second call. Clippers: Scored at least 130 points for the third time this season. ... Zubac's sixth double-double off the bench is second-most in the NBA. ... George was selected an All-Star reserve, his seventh career appearance and first since 2019. He's averaging career highs in assists (5.5), 3-point percentage (47%) and field-goal percentage (51%). He joins Leonard for the March 7 game. It's the first time since 2014-15 that at least two Clippers were chosen for the roster. SCORING LATE Mfiondu Kabengele played 3 1/2 minutes at the end of the game, hitting the Clippers' final 3-pointer. Twice before this season, he made a 3-pointer in a game. He appeared in just 13 games last season as a rookie. “Very excited for him,” Lue said. “He’s been putting the work in every day. All our guys are happy for Fi.”","401267648"

Green scored on two late dunks to start the decisive final run, defended hard and found a way to corral loose balls in the closing minutes as Golden State scored six straight points to finally fend off the Indiana Pacers 111-107 on Wednesday night. “I think in general we don’t really need Draymond to score,"" coach Steve Kerr said. “We need him to do what he needs energy wise but there are going to be some nights like tonight where we don’t make a lot of shots and if we get a few from Draymond it might put us over the top."" Green certainly bailed out the weary Warriors, who won the last two games on a four-game road trip. His numbers — 12 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds and three steals — only told part of the tale on a night Golden State made a season-low 19.2% from 3-point range. Curry scored 24 points but was just 7 of 21 from the field and 1 of 11 from beyond the arc. But at the end, Green cleaned up by doing the dirty work. “It's not pretty,"" Kerr said. “Draymond was just tremendous tonight. It was a hell of a grind out win."" Malcolm Brogdon led the Pacers with 24 points, and Domantas Sabonis had 22 points and 16 rebounds for his his 24th double-double of the season.

The Warriors failed to take advantage of earlier opportunities to take control of the back-and-forth contest. Instead, the Pacers fought back from an 81-75 deficit late in the third quarter to tie the score at 86 early in the fourth. And after Golden State scored four straight to take a 95-91 lead midway through the fourth, the Pacers got as close as 99-98 with 4:36 to play. That's when Green drove through the lane for an uncontested dunk to start the decisive run, and the Pacers never recovered. “We played hard, we just didn’t make baskets at the end,"" Pacers center Myles Turner said.

"Trae Young is looking to inbound the ball, so he bounces it off the back of Grant Williams back to himself for a floater. (0:25) ATLANTA -- — Danilo Gallinari set a Hawks franchise record with 10 3-pointers in a 38-point spree that carried Atlanta to a 127-112 rout of the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night. Gallinari broke the mark of nine 3-pointers by Steve Smith in a 1997 game against Seattle. The Hawks also eclipsed the overall team record by going 23 of 42. Trae Young played like an All-Star, adding 33 points as the Hawks built a 27-point lead in the first half and were never threatened by the lackluster Celtics, who have lost three in a row. Gallinari, one of the biggest free agents signed by the Hawks in an offseason spending spree, equaled the best scoring half of his career with 24 points over the first two quarters. He finished 10 of 12 from 3-point range and 13 of 16 overall. “It's always great to make history,"" he said. “I'm very happy for that. Of course, when you set these kind of records and win the game, it feels way better.” Gallinari knocked down jumpers from just about anywhere on the court — most notably swishing a 3 from at the edge of the special MLK Day half-court logo that was used on a night honoring historically black colleges and universities. “The dude was on fire,"" teammate John Collins said. “He could not miss.

We're going to keep giving it to him until he burns out.” The Hawks led 72-49 at halftime and maintained a comfortable margin the rest of the way. Gallinari turned in his best performance since joining the Hawks. His previous high was 20 points against Indiana on Feb. 13. It was much-needed rebound for Young and the Hawks, who lost 112-111 at Cleveland the previous night on a last-second shot — just hours after Atlanta’s star guard learned he had been passed over for a spot in the March 7 All-Star Game to be held on his home court. Young, an All-Star starter in 2020, ripped through the Celtics for 25 points in the first half. He is averaging 27.2 points a game, the most by any player passed over for the midseason showcase. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 17 points but missed all six of his attempts from 3-point range. Jayson Tatum was held to 13 points on 4-of-20 shooting. He made just 1 of 8 from long range. “It got away from us early,” Tatum said. “They played well and made a bunch of shots. But we didn’t come with it today."" NICE PASS The Hawks were having so much fun that Young doled out an assist to himself. On an inbounds pass from the baseline, Young threw the ball off the back of Boston's Grant Williams, caught the deflection and went in for an uncontested layup. SLUMPING CELTICS Boston has lost eight of its last 11 games to drop two games below .500 (15-17) for the first time this season. Coming off two tough defeats — an overtime setback at New Orleans and a three-point loss at Dallas — the Celtics totally fell apart against the Hawks. With four games left until the All-Star break, Tatum said the team feels a sense of urgency. “These are four very important games,"" he said. ""We've got to dig deep and figure it out.” TIP-INS Celtics: G Kemba Walker didn't dress in the second game of a back-to-back to help manage his comeback from a left knee injury. ... Boston briefly showed signs of life when the Hawks missed their first six shots of the third quarter. The Celtics closed to 73-56, but the Hawks snuffed out the rally with back-to-back 3s by Tony Snell and Collins. Hawks: Collins, who played only 13 minutes against the Cavaliers before leaving with a possible concussion, was cleared to play after undergoing an evaluation shortly before tipoff. He had 14 points and 11 rebounds in 25 minutes. ... F Cam Reddish missed his second straight game with a sore right Achilles. ... In addition to breaking out the special court for HBCU Night, the Hawks also wore their black uniforms with “MLK” across the front of the jersey.","401267650"
"Javale McGee blocks John Wall on one end, and Taurean Prince Eurosteps to a smooth finish on the other. (0:27) CLEVELAND -- — Jarrett Allen tied his career high with 26 points, grabbed 18 rebounds and blocked four shots as the Cleveland Cavaliers pulled away for a 112-96 win over Houston on Wednesday night, extending the Rockets’ losing streak to nine games. Allen, who leads the NBA making 67.2% of his field goals, went 10 of 11 from the floor as Cleveland won for the second straight evening after dropping its previous 10 contests. It beat Atlanta 112-111 on Lamar Stevens’ dunk with 4.1 seconds left Tuesday. “At 22 years old, Jarrett is not near his potential ceiling — and that’s the part I’m most excited about,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “He plays off his teammates well and he knows they’re looking for him.” Allen did it by himself in the third quarter, going coast to coast with a rebound and finishing with a one-handed dunk that reminded his coach of the legendary Julius Erving in the American Basketball Association. “I got the rebound and I took two dribbles, so it’s close, it’s close (to what Dr. J did),” Allen said, laughing. “We have the same first initial, we both had the afro and we both were soaring through the air.” John Wall scored 20 points and Victor Oladipo had 17 points and six rebounds in his return from a strained right foot for Houston, whose last victory occurred at Memphis on Feb. 4. Eric Gordon added 17 points off the bench. The Rockets were outrebounded 55-33 and didn’t start a player taller than 6-foot-6, which Wall and Oladipo both admitted frustration about. P.J. Tucker and rookie Jae'Sean Tate led Houston with seven boards apiece. “I’m used to playing with a traditional big that rolls and pops, just like John is, but we’ve got to figure out a way to win,” said Oladipo, who sat out the previous four games. The Cavaliers blew the game open with a 22-9 run in the fourth, capped by a 3-pointer by rookie Isaac Okoro that made it 106-89. Cleveland later extended its lead to 112-93 on a trey by Collin Sexton, who scored 23 points. Dean Wade scored 11 points and Cedi Osman had seven points and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers held an opponent below 100 points for the first time since Feb. 1, a span of 11 games. “Our defense wasn’t good and our offense was disjointed,” Houston coach Stephen Silas said. “It wasn’t very good all around.” Darius Garland collected 11 points and 10 assists for the Cavaliers, who shot 67.6% in the second half. Rookie Dylan Windler scored 13 points on 4-of-4 3-point shooting, extending his string of makes beyond the arc to nine. “Continuing to see growth as a player is my goal, game after game and year after year,” Windler said. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston will play 10 back-to-back sets in the second half of the season, which it opens on March 11 with a stretch of 11 games in 17 days. ... C Christian Wood (right ankle sprain), who has been out since Feb. 4 at Memphis, will return after the All-Star break. ... G Kevin Porter Jr., acquired from Cleveland on Jan. 29, is averaging 23.3 points for Rio Grande Valley in the G League. Silas said he will join the Rockets in March. Cavaliers: F Taurean Prince (left ankle soreness) saw his first action since Feb. 14, playing eight minutes before his injury flared up. ... Wade made his second straight start after not playing in the previous two games. ... Bickerstaff’s first head coaching job was on an interim basis with Houston in 2015-2016. “I learned the daily struggle of how hard it is to manage 15 guys there,” he said. “That was a big difference.”","401267651"
"Jimmy Butler gets the Raptors' defense on their heels and sinks the 3-pointer. (0:23) MIAMI -- — Jimmy Butler went to the foul line in the final moments of the fourth quarter Wednesday night, talking and smiling the entire time. There's a lot for Butler and the Miami Heat to be happy about right now. Butler scored 27 points, 14 of them in the final quarter, and the Heat won their fourth consecutive game by topping the Toronto Raptors 116-108 on Wednesday night. Butler also had 10 assists and eight rebounds for the Heat, plus a season-high three 3-pointers — two of them in the final minutes. Bam Adebayo had 19 points and 12 rebounds for Miami, Duncan Robinson added 17 points and Goran Dragic scored 15 in his return from an ankle injury. “We're just out there having fun,"" Adebayo said. It was the eighth win in the last 11 games for the Heat, who started the season 7-14. “Everybody that played really contributed at different points in the game,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “And then Jimmy's game was the quintessential, all-around winning basketball game."" Kyle Lowry, returning from a thumb injury, scored 24 for Toronto. Fred VanVleet also had 24 for the Raptors, Norman Powell scored 17 and OG Anunoby had 14 for Toronto. “I thought we outplayed them,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “I thought we outplayed them in almost all facets. ... The ball just bounced their way a lot."" Powell made a 3-pointer as the shot clock was expiring to get Toronto within 100-98 before Butler had the game’s next three plays of any significance — a 3-pointer, a steal on the ensuing possession and a layup to push Miami’s lead back to seven. Another 3-pointer by Butler with 3:23 left restored the seven-point edge, and Miami kept the lead the rest of the way. “He's our leader and we need him,"" Dragic said. Lowry scored 12 of Toronto’s first 20 points in the opening 6½ minutes, and he made a 31-footer over Miami’s zone midway through the second quarter to tie it at 48. The next 2:51 belonged to Miami. The Heat went on a 17-2 spurt in that time, six players scoring during the run, to open a 15-point lead and took a 66-56 edge into halftime. Toronto scored the first 10 points of the second half, erasing the deficit, but a 17-6 answer by the Heat helped them take a 92-85 lead into the fourth. And the Raptors never led at any point in the final 31 1/2 minutes. “It was fun to be back out there with the fellas,"" said Lowry, who acknowledged that his thumb was hurting at times after contact Wednesday. “We gave it a tough fight, but we didn't pull it out at the end."" TIP-INS Raptors: Pascal Siakam got his fourth foul with 1:18 left in the half, after Miami successfully used its challenge to overturn a blocking call that became a charge. It was a huge call; Siakam wasn't a factor in the second half and finished with a season-low five points. ... Toronto fell to 1-5 on the second night of back-to-backs this season. Heat: Tyler Herro (hip) remained sidelined. ... Capacity was increased for this game, and the Heat had about 3,000 fans in the arena including some in the upper deck for the first time this season. ... Andre Iguodala was 4 for 5 on 3-pointers for Miami. SPO KNOWS Spoelstra now has 667 wins, including playoffs, with Miami. That ties Red Holzman of the New York Knicks for the fifth-most by any coach with one franchise. The only others with more: Gregg Popovich with San Antonio, Jerry Sloan with Utah, Red Auerbach with Boston and Phil Jackson with the Los Angeles Lakers. SEE YOU The Heat won the season series over Toronto, 2-1. Miami has also finished its regular-season series against Washington, Oklahoma City, Sacramento and the Los Angeles Clippers. Toronto has also finished its season series with Milwaukee, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Sacramento and Minnesota.","401267652"
"The Bulls come up with a steal and get it to Coby White, who finishes with a big dunk on the other end. (0:23) CHICAGO -- — Zach LaVine is an All-Star for the first time, and he wants more. Same for the rest of the surging Chicago Bulls. LaVine scored 35 points against his original NBA team, helping the Bulls beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 133-126 in overtime Wednesday night. Chicago shot 59% from the field and had seven players score in double figures. Coby White had 20 points, and Wendell Carter Jr. finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds. The Bulls (15-16) won for the fifth time in six games, but felt they should have played better against the lowly Timberwolves (7-26). Looking for the franchise's first playoff appearance since 2017, just winning isn't enough anymore. “These guys have worked really, really hard, but I don't think that we played to the level of standard that we want to play to,” coach Billy Donovan said. LaVine, named an All-Star reserve Tuesday night, made 14 of 21 shots in his 16th game this season with at least 30 points. The dynamic guard was selected by Minnesota in the first round of the 2014 draft and spent three seasons with the Timberwolves before he was traded to the Bulls in June 2017. “You always want to go and play good against the team that traded you, but also have love for them as well,” LaVine said. Minnesota lost for the 10th time in 11 games despite a gutsy second-half rally while playing for the second straight night. New coach Chris Finch is winless in two games since taking over after Ryan Saunders was fired Sunday night. Malik Beasley scored 25 points for the Timberwolves, and Karl-Anthony Towns had 24 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Anthony Edwards added 21 points, and Jarred Vanderbilt matched his career high with 16. Towns fouled out on a questionable call with 12.3 seconds left in regulation, and the Timberwolves missed his presence in overtime. “We're not playing the best defensively right now, and we've got to find ourselves,” Towns said. Minnesota was down 119-116 when veteran guard Ricky Rubio was fouled by White on a 3-point try with 4.9 seconds remaining. Rubio calmly made all three foul shots and LaVine missed a 3 as time expired, sending the game to overtime. “I felt like I fouled him well before the shot,” White said. “He didn't even know I was fouling him. I fouled him, they called it five seconds later after he threw the ball.” Chicago responded with a 7-0 run. LaVine capped the spurt with a 3-pointer, making it 126-119 with 3:27 left. White made two free throws with 15.1 seconds remaining to help the Bulls hold on. Minnesota trailed by 14 early in the second half, but Towns had 15 points in the third quarter and Josh Okogie's layup trimmed Chicago's lead to 98-97 with 8:59 left in the fourth. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jarrett Culver (left ankle sprain) missed his 17th straight game. The No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 draft was listed as probable. ... Rubio finished with nine points and 10 assists. Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen (sprained right shoulder) isn't expected to return until after the All-Star break. He got hurt during a 123-119 loss at Orlando on Feb. 5. “He makes progress, but he has not done anything contact-wise,” Donovan said. “He’s done nothing that at this point in time would show us that he’s going to be back within the next week.” ... White and LaVine each committed seven turnovers.","401267653"
"Zion Williamson drives baseline and reaches back for a powerful one-handed dunk. (0:29) NEW ORLEANS -- — Zion Williamson scored 32 points in his first game since being named a first-time All-Star, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Detroit Pistons 128-118 on Wednesday night. “I didn’t know I was supposed to feel different, to be honest, because everyone’s been asking that,"" Williamson said in reference to how All-Star recognition affected his mindset on the court. ""If you know me, my goal is to go out there and try to win every game. Is it going to happen like that? Maybe not, but I just want to go out there and win and have fun with my teammates and enjoy each moment.” Williamson had many highlights to enjoy against Detroit. There were several quick, dribbling spin moves to elude multiple converging defenders in the paint before he finished near the rim with floaters or layups. There were also thunderous one-handed dunks on cuts down the lane or along the baseline. One of his flourishes featured his throw down of Lonzo Ball's alley-oop lob. Williamson made 13 of his 18 shots in reaching the 30-point threshold for the eighth time this season. “He’s a generational talent where you don’t know what you’re going to get from him every single night; it’s going to be something different. It’s going to be something exciting,” said Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram, who scored 27 points to go with eight assists and seven rebounds. Pelican center Steven Adams said than an “obviously super-talented, super-skilled player” like Williamson has ""a lot bigger goals than just the All-Star game, right? It’s a good little stepping stone for him, but I have a feeling he’s not finished.” Adams scored 14 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in his first action since missing two games with a sore right ankle. His putback gave the Pelicans a 121-111 lead with 2:15 left. The Pelicans' strong finish came after they'd trailed most of the first three quarters before thwarting the Pistons' bid to win two road games in consecutive nights. Josh Jackson scored 25, and Mason Plumlee added 21 points for Detroit, which led by 10 in the first half and nine in the third quarter. Saban Lee and Saddiq Bey each scored 13 points. “We couldn’t buy shots at the right time, but I was overall pleased with our approach,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “For whatever reason, we ran out of gas down the stretch.” The Pistons looked sharp early, combining for nine 3s and shooting 53.1% overall (26 of 49) in scoring a season-best 69 first-half points. Detroit got 36 first-half points from reserves including 10 from Jackson and nine from Svi Mykhailiuk on three 3s. The Piston's led by as many as 10 when Jackson's floater made it 43-33. Detroit was up by seven late in the half before Williamson scored on a dribble drive in the final seconds of the quarter to make it 69-64. TIP-INS Pistons: Fell to 3-15 on the road. ... Wayne Ellington started after resting a night earlier in Orlando. He had seven points and three assists in 24 minutes, missing six of seven 3-point attempts. ...

DEFENSIVE LIABILITIES While Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy credited his club's late-game defense in their previous two games — both victories — he said his team is far from a finished product on that end of the court. “It’s going to take a lot more defensively,"" Van Gundy said. ""We don’t have enough sense of urgency on a consistent basis yet. We haven’t built that habbit. I’m not sure we think of ourselves as a defensive team. ...

"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander makes his way through four Spurs defenders in the paint for a layup. (0:18) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored a career-high 42 points and Lu Dort hit a 3-pointer as time expired to give the Oklahoma City Thunder a 102-99 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night. San Antonio turned the ball over with 3.9 seconds remaining, giving Oklahoma City the ball with the score tied. Dort's corner 3-pointer dropped as the buzzer sounded, and his teammates mobbed him. Dort, known mostly for his defense as a rookie last season, has improved as a perimeter shooter this season. He made three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter against the Spurs. “Lu’s changed it around, obviously, changed the narrative,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. “It’s just him working hard, not getting down on himself, being confident. When you work hard, confidence comes with it because you believe in yourself.” Gilgeous-Alexander became the first Thunder player to score at least 40 points in a game since Russell Westbrook had 42 on March 20, 2019. He made 13 of 20 field goals, 10 of 11 free throws and shot 6 of 11 on 3s. Gilgeous-Alexander was one of the NBA’s highest-scoring players to be left off the All-Star rosters, but he said there was “no extra push or anything like that” to score a lot of points and make a statement about being snubbed. “I wouldn’t have known how much I had if my teammates weren’t telling me,” he said. “I was so locked into the game, honestly, just trying to win. Big nights are huge, but personally, if we didn’t win tonight, I wouldn’t feel close to what I feel right now.” Dort and Al Horford each scored 16 points for the Thunder. Dejounte Murray had 27 points and Patty Mills added 15 for the Spurs. San Antonio hadn't played since Feb. 14 because of health and safety protocols, and the Spurs were still depleted. DeMar DeRozan, the team’s leading scorer, sat out for personal reasons. Rudy Gay, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Quinnary Witherspoon and Derrick White were out because of health and safety protocols. Gilgeous-Alexander took over in the third quarter. He hit a 3-pointer while being fouled, and his free throw cut San Antonio's lead to 53-51. He later drained a 3 to tie the game at 65. His layup as time expired in the third put Oklahoma City up 76-73. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 points in the period on 5-for-5 shooting from the field and 8 for 9 at the free throw line. “I just wanted to be aggressive, try to put the defense on their heels, and from there, make the right play,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. “Oftentimes, I found myself in position to score in that quarter.” Horford's 3-pointer on an assist from Gilgeous-Alexander put the Thunder up 87-86 with about seven minutes remaining, and the game remained close from there. TIP-INS Spurs: LaMarcus Aldridge returned after missing six games due to hip soreness. He had 11 points and seven rebounds. ... San Antonio went 5 of 10 on 3-pointers in the second quarter. ... The Spurs made 10 of 15 free throws. Thunder: Made six 3-pointers in the first quarter while holding the Spurs to one. San Antonio didn't make one until the final minute of the period. ...

Still trying to figure it out, how to be ready to go. It’s definitely a different task coming off the bench, having very few minutes to get loose and kind of find a rhythm. I’m still figuring it out. It wasn’t perfect tonight, and I don’t think it’s going to be perfect for a while. It’s going to take some time for me to figure it out.” STAT LINE Thunder forward Darius Bazley missed all eight of his shots from the floor and went scoreless, but had 10 rebounds in 30 minutes.","401267655"
"LaMelo Ball puts the moves on Deandre Ayton and finishes at the rim with a two-handed dunk. (0:16) PHOENIX -- — The Charlotte Hornets looked as if they were in trouble early against the streaking Phoenix Suns. That's when Malik Monk got hot and put on a show that had him reminiscing about his AAU days. Monk scored 29 points — including 20 in the second quarter — rookie LaMelo Ball added 20 points and eight assists and the Hornets cooled off the Suns with a 124-121 victory Wednesday night. Monk was reminded of the time he scored 60 points in an AAU game when he was in 10th grade. “We needed a spark, man,” Monk said. “I was knocking shots down and my teammates kept finding me.” Phoenix lost for just the second time in 11 games. Suns star Devin Booker missed an off-balance 3-pointer at the buzzer with replays showing Gordon Hayward made contact with Booker's arm. There was no foul call and the play wasn't reviewed. Hayward also had 20 points, including two free throws with 5.8 seconds left. Phoenix led by 17 points in the first half but settled for a 67-66 lead at halftime. Monk scored 22 points on 7-of-11 shooting — including 4 of 7 from 3-point range — before the break. “I am more frustrated about our defense tonight,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “To give up that many 30-point quarters is unacceptable. The second quarter was when we lost it. I think we were up 17 points and started to goof around with the game.” Charlotte trailed for most of the first half, then rallied to take a 97-91 lead by the end of the third quarter. The Hornets pushed ahead by 11 points midway through the fourth but Phoenix scored 11 straight points — capped by Booker's dunk — to tie it at 110. Charlotte responded with the next seven points. Two came on a perfect alley-oop pass from Ball to Miles Bridges and then Bridges knocked down a 3-pointer on the next possession. After a Phoenix timeout, Ball slammed home a dunk after slicing down the lane and the Hornets didn't trail again. “He’s a winner,” Hornets coach James Borrego said about the 19-year-old Ball. “He makes winning plays – that’s the best way I can put it.” Booker was named to his second straight All-Star team as an injury replacement for Lakers forward Anthony Davis a few hours before Wednesday's game. He got a big ovation from the crowd during pregame introductions and got hot in the first quarter, pouring in 16 points on 7 of 9 shooting. Booker finished with 33 points on 13-of-24 shooting. Teammate Chris Paul — who also made the All-Star team for an 11th time — added 20 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. “We've got to close out better,” Paul said. “We kept fighting. We gave ourselves a chance to win, a chance to at least tie it up. Book got fouled on that three.

"LeBron James explains how the Lakers have been dealing with their inconsistent play and roster after suffering a blowout loss to the Utah Jazz. (1:55) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Utah Jazz are an offensive juggernaut that isn’t slowing down for anyone — including the defending NBA champions. Utah routed the Los Angeles Lakers 114-89 on Wednesday night after making a barrage of 3-pointers and shutting things down on the defensive end. The Jazz made 22 3-pointers and shot 46% from long distance. Defensively, they held the Lakers to 40% shooting, including 8 of 33 from 3-point range. ""It’s all about getting better,” center Rudy Gobert said. “We did a great job sharing the ball offensively. When we defend and we share the ball, it’s hard to beat us.” Gobert led the way with 18 points and nine rebounds to help Utah (26-6) win for the 22nd time in its last 24 games — with 20 of those victories coming by double-digits. Jordan Clarkson added 18 points and Bojan Bogdanovic chipped in 15 points. Mike Conley had 14 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists, and Donovan Mitchell finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists. As a team, the Jazz had 28 assists on 41 baskets. “The fact that we have a lot of guys that are capable of making plays, and our team likes to play that way, that’s part of who we are and part of our identity,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. LeBron James scored 19 points and Montrzel Harrell added 16 to lead the Lakers (22-11), who lost their fourth straight and fifth in six games. Los Angeles has struggled without Anthony Davis and Dennis Schroder in the lineup. Still, James is confident the Lakers can regain their form as the season progresses. “Everyone is put in positions that they wouldn’t be put in under normal circumstances,” James said. “It’s always about staying confident, continuing to give my teammates the courage and the confidence out there on the floor and to make plays. ""It’s a tough stretch for us, but this won’t define what we will be for the rest of the season and for the long haul.” Back-to-back baskets from James and Marc Gasol gave the Lakers a 17-13 lead as Los Angeles hung with Utah for a quarter. But the final three quarters belonged to the Jazz. Utah scored baskets on four straight possessions — starting with back-to-back buckets from Clarkson — to take a 35-25 lead early in the second quarter. Clarkson, Royce O’Neale and Conley each hit a 3-pointer in that stretch. That was a sneak preview of Utah’s barrage of outside baskets. The Jazz made eight 3-pointers during the second quarter and shot 14 of 23 (.609) from long distance in the first half. They built a 63-47 halftime lead after Mitchell drained a 3 and Gobert followed with back-to-back baskets over Utah’s final three possessions of the half. The Jazz slammed the door early in the third quarter when Gobert threw down back-to-back alley-oop dunks to extend Utah’s lead to 71-47. “They’re the hottest team in the league,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “Nobody’s playing as well as the Utah Jazz in the NBA right now, the way they’re shooting the ball, the way they’re connected defensively, the continuity bump that they’re getting by having the same team come back.” TIP INS Lakers: Talen Horton-Tucker made his first start of the season and the second of his NBA career. Horton-Tucker had a team-high five assists. … Los Angeles scored eight points off Utah’s first four turnovers in the first quarter. Jazz: Mitchell led Utah in rebounds for the first time this season. … The Jazz made at least 20 3-pointers for the 11th time this season, moving them into a third-place tie with the 2019-20 Dallas Mavericks for the most such games in a season. Utah shot 22 of 48 from 3-point range overall. ALL-AROUND IMPACT Both Conley and Mitchell came within striking distance of earning the first regular-season triple-double for the Jazz since 2008 before Snyder pulled his starters midway through the fourth quarter. Conley finished two rebounds and two assists shy of the mark. Mitchell came up two assists short. Conley, who got passed over for a spot on the Western Conference team for the upcoming NBA All-Star game, said the all-around effort from him and Mitchell made a case that Utah deserved more all-star selections beyond Mitchell and Gobert. “We’re making history in so many ways,” Conley said. “We should have been rewarded for that.” MILLSAP ACCUSATION Former Jazz player Elijah Millsap tweeted before Wednesday’s game that Dennis Lindsey, the team’s current executive vice president of basketball operations, used racially charged language toward him in April 2015 during a season exit interview with both Lindsey and Snyder present. Lindsey denied making that statement. Snyder said after the game he does not recall the specifics of that conversation from six years ago but doesn't believe the then-Jazz GM would use such language toward a player. “I can’t fathom Dennis saying something like that,” Snyder said. Millsap, the younger brother of Nuggets forward Paul Millsap, appeared in 67 games and made five starts with Utah over parts of two seasons from 2014-16.

(0:21) PHILADELPHIA -- — Ben Simmons clapped for his teammates and laughed with Joel Embiid as the 76ers' reserves put the finishing touches on a rout. The All-Stars had long done their part to keep Philly rolling atop the East. Embiid had 23 points and nine rebounds, Simmons scored 15 points and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Dallas Mavericks 111-97 on Thursday night. “Ben set the tone. Joel was phenomenal,” coach Doc Rivers said. Simmons and Embiid wrecked the Mavericks in the second quarter, and with each steal, dunk and drive showed why they were again selected as All-Stars and have led the Sixers to the best record (22-11) in the Eastern Conference. Luka Doncic scored 19 points for the Mavericks. The Mavericks committed 22 turnovers and shot 41% from the floor. The Sixers could soon have fans inside the Wells Fargo Center and the select few who get to watch will get a live look at perhaps the most dominant duo in the East outside of Brooklyn. Simmons and Embiid made 8 of 12 shots in the second quarter and combined for 22 points to help the Sixers turn this one into a rout. Simmons backed down Doncic, put a spin move on the big man and hit a pretty one-handed reverse under the bucket and drew a foul. He sank it for a 12-point lead. Simmons later sneaked behind Willie Cauley-Stein and stole the ball, threw a bounce pass just past midcourt and hit a streaking Embiid for a thunderous two-handed dunk. Simmons continued to make his case as a defensive player of the year and cut off the pick-and roll that limited Doncic to 3-of-9 shooting in the first half. “I was just being me. Doing what I do,” Simmons said. “I like taking those challenges. Just tell me who to guard.” Doncic, who averaged 28.9 points and has carried the Mavericks, brushed off Simmons' often-smothering defense. “I don’t really pay attention to who’s on me. I’m just trying to play my game,” Doncic said. ""Sometimes I’m going to play better, sometimes worse. Embiid did all of his damage in the second quarter — he missed 15 of 20 shots overall from the floor — but made 11 of 12 free throws. “At certain times, they both had their way,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. “We just weren’t consistent enough. There were times we contained Simmons well and other times we let him go right by us. We did some good things against Embiid early. We had him a little bit off balance and then he got into more of a groove in the second quarter.” Rivers coached against Simmons and Embiid during his stint with the Los Angeles Clippers and has enjoyed having them on his side. Embiid has worked his way into MVP contention and is having a career year, coming into the game averaging 29.8 points. “It’s funny, you know he’s big, but you don’t realize how big he is and then his post game is so much more efficient than I remember it,” Rivers said. “We were bothered by his post game, but I never knew it was that efficient.” Simmons has about perfected what he does best, playing elite defense, scoring around the rim and hitting an improved crop of shooters for open looks (and yes, he still won’t shoot the 3). “It’s very few guys that can play at the speed that he plays at downhill and transition, and then make bullet passes on target,” Rivers said. “I haven’t seen that, Jason Kidd actually comes to mind a little bit, but there’s very few players have been able to do both.” TIP-INS Mavericks: Kristaps Porzingis, involved in heavy trade rumors, missed his third straight game with back tightness. ... Made only 13 of 34 3-pointers. 76ers: Tobias Harris, who averaged 20.7 points, went to the locker room in the third quarter with a bruised right knee and did not return. There was no postgame update on the severity of his injury. ... Seth Curry scored 15 points after he sat out Tuesday’s win against Toronto with a sore ankle.","401267658"
"Kyrie Irving doubles down on calling for Kobe Bryant's silhouette to be the new logo for the NBA. (2:16) NEW YORK -- — Kyrie Irving had 27 points and nine assists, James Harden scored 20 points and the Nets extended their longest winning streak since moving to Brooklyn to eight games with a 129-92 rout of the Orlando Magic on Thursday night. The Nets have the longest current winning streak in the NBA and their longest since a franchise record-tying 14-game run late in the 2005-06 season. They moved from New Jersey to Brooklyn in 2012. This roll has come almost entirely without Kevin Durant, who missed his sixth straight game with a strained left hamstring. “We just want him to stay patient, stay peaceful and when he comes back the world will be on notice again,” Irving said. They're explosive enough with their other two All-Stars, improving to 7-2 when Irving and Harden play but Durant doesn't. Landry Shamet added 19 points and nine rebounds for the Nets, who blew open the game with a 26-4 run spanning halftime. The NBA's highest-scoring team reached 120 points for the 20th time, already tying a franchise record in only 34 games. Nikola Vucevic had 28 points and 12 rebounds for the Magic, who dropped their second straight after a three-game win streak. They committed 18 turnovers, giving the Nets 24 points when they score enough without any help. “We can’t beat ourselves and we can’t turn the ball over and that’s where it started,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Clifford predicted before the game that the Nets are so gifted offensively that there would be possessions where his team defended well and Brooklyn still scored. Orlando looked good early, holding Brooklyn to five points in the first six minutes. Even after straightening things out later in the period, the Nets were down 28-24 after the first quarter. That was about the only highlight for Orlando. The Nets surged ahead with a 12-2 burst midway through the second that gave them a 44-38 lead, with a 19-2 surge late in the period turning a three-point lead into a 65-45 bulge. “We can’t start every game like how we’ve started the rest of the games during this kind of streak,” Irving said. “So we've just got to turn the next page and we put a few possessions together and we ended the first quarter well and I feel like that put us in position to take control of the pace of the game.” The Nets outscored the Magic 41-19 in the second, shooting 16 of 22 (72.7%). Irving, who missed all five 3-pointers in the first half, then made one before his steal and layup capped a 7-0 start out of the locker room that made it 72-47. TIP-INS Magic: James Ennis III was 5 for 5 and scored 15 points, two off his season high. ... Orlando fell to 1-7 against the Atlantic Division, including 0-5 on the road. Nets: Coach Steve Nash said before the game he had no update on Durant's status. ... Brooklyn is 12-3 against Orlando at Barclays Center, its best record against any opponent. THROUGH 20 The Nets improved to 15-5 with Harden in the lineup. His first game with Brooklyn after being acquired from Houston was against the Magic, when he had a triple-double on Jan. 16 while playing with Durant while Irving was out. He finished with nine rebounds and seven assists in this one. KYRIE ON KOBE Irving discussed his desire to have Kobe Bryant become the NBA logo. He said he understands that not everybody would like the idea, but believes using Bryant's image would be meaningful to his generation of players who looked up the superstar, who died last year in a helicopter crash. “My thing is, paying homage to the example that has been set by that man,” Irving said. “He was the standard for our generation and he will continue on and I want that to be something in history that is changed forever, that our generation was part of that change.”","401267659"
"Alec Burks scores 19 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter as the Knicks top the Kings 140-121. (1:11) NEW YORK -- — Immanuel Quickley scored 18 of his 25 points in the first half, and Julius Randle had 21 points and 14 rebounds to power the New York Knicks to a 140-121 win over the Sacramento Kings on Thursday night. Quickley and Randle were two of six Knicks players to finish in double figures in scoring as New York improved to 16-17. Alec Burks had 24 off the bench, Derrick Rose finished with 18, RJ Barrett had 12 and Reggie Bullock chipped in with 10 as the Knicks had a season high for points. “That's the great part about this team,” Quickley said about the Knicks' unity. “Whoever, we roll with them.” While the Knicks cruised to their fifth win in their last seven games, Sacramento’s freefall continued. The Kings (12-20) dropped their ninth straight, a stretch in which they have allowed 126.3 points per game. “How smart are we playing defensively?” Harrison Barnes asked rhetorically following his 22-point effort. “We have to play the game within the game better.” De’Aaron Fox scored 29 points for the Kings. Marvin Bagley III added 19 and Tyrese Haliburton 17. Barring both teams making unexpected runs to the NBA Finals, the Kings and Knicks entered the second and presumably final matchup of the season on significantly different trajectories. Sacramento appears to be a team that is trying to learn about itself while the Knicks have clearly defined expectations as to how they play. And that was on full display. New York led 77-62 at halftime due to a team approach in which all but one player scored in the opening 24 minutes. The Knicks shot 65.9% from the field (29 for 44), 52.9% from 3-point range (9 for 17) and knocked down all 10 free throws they attempted. Of New York’s 29 first-half baskets, 15 came off of assists. In short, they were not a one-man gang — even if Randle and Quickley received “MVP” chants from the Madison Square Garden crowd. “(Hearing the fans) chant ‘MVP’ for some of our players (feels) just amazing,” Knicks guard Frank Ntilikina said about the crowd, which also revived the franchise's iconic ‘Dee-fense’ chant. “Just to feel that energy again and them chanting ‘Dee-fense,’ that's huge. That's huge.” New York extended its lead to as much as 18 midway through the third quarter after Randle knocked down a 10-footer with 6:59 left, but the Kings ended the period on a 22-11 run which was capped by Fox’s buzzer-beating layup. New York opened the fourth quarter with a 20-7 run to stretch its lead from 101-94 to 121-101. Burks capped the stretch with long 3-pointers on consecutive possessions. “We feel those moments,” Randle said about the Knicks' ability to overcome adversity. “I think the good thing is that we're recognizing those moments and we tighten up in those moments. And execute.” TIP-INS Kings: They wrapped up their two-game New York City excursion by saying goodbye to one teammate and hello to new one. Sacramento waived Glenn Robinson III on Wednesday and announced the signing of Norvel Pelle. In 23 games with the Kings, Robinson averaged 5.3 points, two rebounds, and 0.9 assists. Pelle, waived by the Nets on Feb. 16, averaged two points, 2.3 rebounds, and one block per game in three games with Brooklyn. “It has been a tough couple days,” Kings coach Luke Walton acknowledged during his pregame availability. Knicks: They entered the day with the same exact record and points percentage as the eighth-seeded Miami Heat and divisional rival Boston Celtics. But coach Tom Thibodeau is not planning a parade even though the franchise has been in the league’s wilderness for the better part of two decades. “I don’t want us to get lost (and look) too far ahead,” Thibodeau said before the game.","401267660"
"Ja Morant catches the Clippers' defense napping on his lob to the rim on Brandon Clarke's dunk. (0:18) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — The Memphis Grizzlies clamped down on the Los Angeles Clippers. Tyus Jones scored a career-high 20 points, Memphis slowed Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and the Grizzlies beat the Clippers 122-94 on Thursday night. Dillon Brooks finished with 19 points for Memphis, and Jonas Valanciunas and Ja Morant had 16 each, with Valanciunas adding 15 rebounds. Jones was 9 of 11 from the floor, including 2 of 3 from outside the arc. Leonard scored 17 points, and George and Serge Ibaka had 13 points each, although George was stymied by a 3-for-12 shooting night, part of the Clippers connecting on 41%. The Clippers were held to 12 of 34 (35.3%) shooting from outside the arc, below their 42% for the season. “Just urgency to defend the 3-point line,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said about the defense. “That’s been something that has come in waves with our group over the course of the season. “ying to deter catch-and-shoot 3s. Teams are still going to shoot it at a high rate. They still got 34 off, but we can upset those a little bit more.” The teams will complete the two-game set Friday night at FedExForum. “Absolutely,” Clippers forward Paul George said when asked if it helped ease the loss by playing the same team the next night, later adding: “They got stops. They shrunk the floor on defense. It’s a young team. You can’t give a young team life to play in transition. They got out. They ran the floor. They just showed their athleticism.” The Grizzlies, who lead the league in points in the paint, concentrated on that factor in the first half to build a lead, then carried it through the game finishing with 72 paint points. Leonard said the Grizzlies post play and passing to their bigs was a major factor. “You’ve got to give them credit,” Leonard said. While the Clippers are one of the strongest teams in the third quarter, it was Memphis that extended its lead to 17 in the third as the Grizzlies continued to shoot above 55%. Memphis managed to hold off a couple of pushes from the Clippers and take an 89-75 lead into the third. When the Clippers cut it to 92-83 with 10 minutes left, Memphis rattled off a 12-2 run for a 104-85 advantage with 6:27 left. “I feel like our energy was there,” Morant said. “I feel like we were all locked in and out there competing. I feel like our talk was very high level. We knew our teammates had our back while guarding the ball. That led to some stops and we were able to get out and run.” ASSISTS VS. POINTS Earlier this season, Jones recorded a career-high in assists with 14 against San Antonio. Now he has added a career-high 20 points. Asked which was better, the reserve guard replied: “That’s tough. Personally, the assists. I’m a team guy. I think anyone will tell you that.” Morant said it is just Jones’ make-up. “I feel like we need that from Tyus every game, but he’s a smart player. He knows when to attack and he’s aggressive and he knows to look for his teammates. Smart point guard.” TIP-INS Clippers: After shuffling through 12 different lineups for various reasons, Los Angeles has returned to the Patrick Beverley-George-Leonard-Nicolas Batum-Ibaka starters the last four games. …Missed their first eight 3-point attempts. …Entered the night with eight games of shooting at least 50% from 3. …Reggie Jackson had 12 points off the Los Angeles bench.

"Denver coach Michael Malone reacts to the Nuggets' loss to the Wizards. (0:50) DENVER -- — Bradley Beal had a sinking feeling his 33-point effort was all for naught Thursday night when he found himself as Washington's sole defender on Denver's 4-on-1 fast break in the final seconds with the Wizards clinging to a two-point lead. Jamal Murray was racing downcourt and Michael Porter Jr. looked as though he was heading toward the hoop for an easy bucket. “My initial thought was they'll probably get a damn layup and we're going into overtime,” Beal said. “That was honestly my initial thought as I was running toward Murray and I just knew he was going to throw a lob to Porter Jr. for an easy layup or a dunk. “Then, I saw him kind of slow down at the 3-point line and I was like, ‘Well, shoot. He’s trying to send us home. So, let me try to at least contest and force them to take the layup.” As Beal went to deny Murray the 3-pointer, however, Porter headed toward the right corner, giving Denver four players straddling the arc and nobody in the paint. Murray bounced a pass to Facundo Campazzo, who clanked a hurried 3 off the rim at the buzzer, leaving the Wizards to celebrate their 112-110 escape over the Nuggets. “I'm happy as hell, I can tell you that,” Beal said after Washington's sixth win in seven games. Murray got the ball with about four seconds left after Nikola Jokic rebounded Raul Neto's missed jumper. Murray had already hit six 3s and scored 34 points. But he'd end up regretting bypassing the 3-pointer and ruing the bad pass he skipped to Campazzo. “I just should have shot it,"" Murray said. “It's a 4-on-1. We've got to score.” He was thrown off when Porter headed not to the basket but to the corner. “Come on, guys. Lock in! We're playing basketball. We're 4-on-1, somebody should go to the rim,” Murray fumed. “I thought Michael was going to the rim. ... He might have thought I was shooting it and I should have shot it. I gave (Campazzo) a really bad pass. And I didn't run the clock, either.” When Campazzo's off-target 3 clanged off the rim, the Wizards had their second two-point win over Denver in eight days. Murray blamed himself for this one. “If I stop for the 3, I've got to shoot it,” he said. “And if Mike's running the lane, he's got to go to the rim, especially when there's other guys behind him. So, I guess it's just a tough play where we didn't know what we were doing. We've just got to score.” After his interview with reporters on Zoom ended, Murray posted a still shot on his Twitter account  showing him, Porter, Campazzo and Monte Morris all setting up behind the 3-point line with 2.9 seconds left. “My fault Nuggets nation.. on to the next one.. STICK WITH US!!” he wrote. Rui Hachimura added 20 points for the Wizards, who swept the season series with the Nuggets and completed a 3-1 trip out West. Denver got 24 points from Jokic and 18 from Porter. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington had its five-game winning streak snapped by the Clippers on Tuesday night but has been playing much better of late, including a 130-128 win over Denver last week in which Davis Bertans set career highs with nine 3s and 35 points. Bertans didn't play in the rematch because of a sore knee. Nuggets: Denver was still without Gary Harris (left adductor), P.J. Dozier (right hamstring), Paul Millsap (left knee strain) and JaMychal Green (left shoulder). With the team's top two power forwards sidelined, Porter started at that spot again. ... The Nuggets started out 4 for 17 from the field, including 1 for 12 by players other than Jokic. TURNOVER TURNAROUND The Nuggets committed 18 turnovers two days after turning the ball over just once in a victory over Portland. The Wizards turned those takeaways into 23 points and committed just 11 turnovers themselves, which led to 15 points for Denver.","401267662"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo puts up an impressive 38 points and 10 rebounds as the Bucks eke out a win at home vs. the Pelicans. (2:15) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 38 points, Khris Middleton added 31 and the Milwaukee Bucks outlasted the New Orleans Pelicans 129-125 on Thursday night. It was the fourth straight win for the Bucks, who finished their first half of the season in third place in the Eastern Conference. Zion Williamson scored 34 points and Brandon Ingram added 23 for the Pelicans, who had won two straight. The Bucks won their previous three games by an average of 17.7 points. In those games, Antetokounmpo averaged 34.7 points, 15 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 1.7 blocks and 1.3 steals. But Thursday’s game was tight. There were 15 ties and 23 lead changes. “Last two years, we were beating teams by 15, by 20, by 30, but at the end of the day, that did not make us better,” Antetokounmpo said. “I think when you’re getting a game every single night, it’s a dogfight, you fight to win, it helps you. It helps you in the long run, we build good habits and hopefully it can help us in the playoffs.” New Orleans took a 125-124 lead with 2:01 to play in the fourth quarter on a layup by Williamson. But after Antetokounmpo hit a jumper and then took a rebound the length of the court for a dunk, Milwaukee led 128-125 when New Orleans called timeout with 1:10 left. Ingram and former Buck Eric Bledsoe missed 3-pointers and Ingram committed a charge before time ran out. “I thought we got some really good looks down the stretch, passed up two good looks, I thought, but had some other good looks that could have gone down,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “I don’t think down the stretch that we were having trouble getting shots. ""We just didn’t make them.” Milwaukee's Donte DiVincenzo had a career-high 24 points. Antetokounmpo and Williamson showed their knack for getting to the hoop, with their first-quarter performances as evidence. Williamson’s 11 points included a drive past Antetokounmpo to score with a right-hand layup, two dunks and a putback of his own missed dunk. Antetokounmpo’s 13 points included a turnaround hook and three layups. It was the third matchup between the two superstars, with Antetokounmpo outscoring and outrebounding Williamson in both previous matchups. Antetokounmpo is the first Bucks player with three straight 35-point games since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1973, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Info. The teams entered Thursday among the top five in the league in field-goal percentage — with the Bucks ranked second at 48.8%; the Pelicans fifth at 48.3%. But they shot even better than their season averages, with Milwaukee shooting 54.2% and New Orleans 50% from the floor. The Bucks have generally dominated their opponents in rebounding, entering with a league-leading average of 48.5 per game. But they were outrebounded by the Pelicans 47-42. New Orleans' Steven Adams had 13 rebounds. The Bucks prevailed without guard Jrue Holiday for the 10th consecutive game (health/safety protocol). Holiday, who was acquired from New Orleans in a four-team trade in November that sent Bledsoe to New Orleans, is averaging 16.4 points and a league-leading 1.9 steals per game. TIP-INS Pelicans: “I haven’t noticed it, I’ve got to be honest, I just haven’t,” Van Gundy said about fans being back in NBA arenas. “I don’t know that I ever do, unless you’re in a place that’s absolutely packed and going crazy.” Bucks: G Bryn Forbes entered shooting 46.9% from 3-point range and 48.1% from the field, both career highs.","401267663"
"Harrison Barnes steps back and knocks down a huge 3-pointer to put an end to the Kings' nine-game losing streak. (0:16) DETROIT -- — De'Aaron Fox scored 27 points and the Sacramento Kings snapped a nine-game losing streak with a 110-107 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. Sacramento blew a 17-point first-quarter lead, then rallied from an eight-point deficit in the final quarter. The Kings held on after Detroit missed two late free throws intentionally — earlier than the Pistons probably needed to employ that desperate strategy. The Kings were up 106-104 when Harrison Barnes missed from the perimeter. Buddy Hield swooped in for a tip-in for Sacramento with 12.9 seconds left, but the play was challenged by Detroit and the call was reversed. A foul was called on Hield, and Josh Jackson went to the line at the other end with a chance to tie it. Jackson missed the first free throw, then missed the second on purpose. Nemanja Bjelica rebounded for the Kings and was fouled, and he made one of two free throws to push the lead to three. Sacramento fouled Jerami Grant immediately, and he made both free throws. Then Bjelica got free for a layup to make it 109-106, and the Kings again fouled with a three-point lead, putting Dennis Smith Jr. on the line with 8.1 seconds left. Smith made the first free throw, but his intentional miss on the second didn't hit the rim. The ball went over to Sacramento. “That was miscommunication on all of us,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said of the intentional misses. ""It wasn’t good communication, period. Learning experience, to learn from that, closing games.” Barnes was fouled with 7.4 seconds left, but he only made one of two free throws, giving the Pistons one more chance down three. Grant's contested 3-pointer missed everything, though. “It was a good way to end a really tough trip for our guys,"" said Kings coach Luke Walton, whose team was playing the last of five straight games on the road. ""That should hopefully make the flight a little easier, but with the understanding that we have to build on this.” Sacramento led 31-14 late in the first quarter before Detroit began gradually working its way back into the game. “Just wanted to come out there, try to set the tone as early as possible,"" said Richaun Holmes, who finished with 19 points and 17 rebounds for the Kings. ""Thankfully we were able to snap the losing streak.” Grant led all scorers with 30 points. TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento is 2-5 in the second game of back-to-backs. ... G Tyrese Haliburton (left calf soreness) was out for the Kings. Sacramento was also without C Hassan Whiteside and F Jabari Parker because of health and safety protocols.

"Celtics coach Brad Stevens believes the team wouldn't have beaten the Pacers without Kemba Walker's will. (0:48) BOSTON -- — The Boston Celtics have been searching for a spark to pull them out of one of their worst stretches of the season. Kemba Walker answered the call with his best game of the season. Walker made two late free throws and scored a season-high 32 points to help the Celtics snap a three-game losing streak with a 118-112 win over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. Daniel Theis added 17 points and Jaylen Brown finished with 15. “It felt good,"" Walker said. ""We played hard. We had a slow start, but we stayed together. That was the best part about it."" Indiana led by as many as 14 points in the first half, but never led in the final 24 minutes in losing for the third time in four games. Domantas Sabonis had 24 points and nine assists to lead the Pacers. Justin Holiday added 19 points and five rebounds. A 12-4 run by the Celtics, capped by a driving layup by Walker, gave Boston a 110-101 cushion in the fourth quarter. Indiana pulled within 112-109 on a layup by Sabonis with 1:23 to play. A turnover by Jaylen Brown then gave the ball back to Indiana. Holiday missed a 3-pointer from the corner and Theis hit one on the other end. But on Indiana’s next possession Sabonis got a friendly bounce off the top of the backboard on a deep 3 that trimmed Boston’s lead to 115-112. The Celtics nearly got an 8-second violation, but Walker hustled the ball up the court and was fouled, and connected on his two ensuing free throws with 11.6 seconds remaining to help seal it. One of the things Celtics coach Brad Stevens believes has hampered his team at times is doing too much ball watching when primary scorers Jayson Tatum, Brown and Walker have the ball in their hands. There was a lot more movement from their teammates, who pressed the action in the half court, aggressively attacking the interior of Indiana’s defense. “It’s good to get a win in a day that ends in 'y' right now,"" Stevens said. ""We played closer to what we want, but still lets back it up with a bunch of games in a row of playing that way.” The Pacers started fast, scoring the game’s first 12 points, which included a pair of 3-pointers and a three-point play by Myles Turner. Indiana’s lead grew as high as 18-4, but Boston responded by closing the quarter on a 28-13 run to take a 32-31 lead. “There’s a lot of plays in the first half we’d like to have back,"" Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. Tatum and Brown combined to shoot just 2 for 8 from the field for seven points in the period. Most of the heavy lifting for the Celtics’ comeback came from another source. Their bench stepped up, contributing 27 points in the first half to help Boston take a 61-60 lead into the break. For the night Boston's reserves held a 39-34 edge in bench scoring, led by Robert Williams and Jeff Teague, who had 14 points each. “We believe,” Teague said. ""We just gotta continue to keep working. I think the locker room is even getting even closer. It’s pretty amazing how the losses bring you closer than the wins do.” TIP-INS Pacers: Were outscored 48-32 in the paint. … JaKarr Sampson was added to the health and safety protocol Friday.

Utah got got 17 from Bojan Bogdanovic, 15 from Rudy Gobert and 14 from Mike Conley. “Tonight, we ran up on a team that really just out-executed us down the stretch,"" Conley said. “They made plays when it mattered most."" Jordan Clarkson and Joe Ingles scored 13 apiece for the Jazz, who were outrebounded by a 50-36 count — the second-largest differential any team has had against Utah this season — and shot 15-for-46 from 3-point range. “Tonight, we just tried to take away their easy shots,” Dragic said. “And we did.” There were 14 lead changes and 10 ties, the last of those coming when Clarkson made a 3-pointer with 8:20 left to knot the game at 103-103. Dragic sparked an 11-4 Heat run that put Miami ahead for good, capping that flurry by finding Andre Iguodala for an open 3-pointer, then making another himself on the next Heat possession for a 114-107 lead. Bogdanovic’s 3-pointer with 3:39 left started the last Jazz gasp, Conley got a layup on the next Utah possession and Gobert made two free throws on the next. Just like that, the Jazz were within 116-115. But they got no closer, with Dragic taking a charge to erase what would have been a basket by Conley with 1:58 left. The Jazz wound up missing their last seven shots and were 3-for-16 from the floor in the final eight minutes. “We just made a lot of mistakes, had too many breakdowns on both ends,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. Miami led 96-94 lead after three quarters — the prerequisite for beating the Jazz this season. Utah came into Friday 24-0 when leading after three quarters, 2-6 when trailing. They’re 2-7 now. “There were a lot of things that we can do better,"" Snyder said.

Gobert had a free throw 1:53 into the game for his 6,000th career point. Heat: Adebayo was listed as questionable coming into the game because of a knee issue. ... Tyler Herro (bruised hip) missed his third straight game with that injury and 11th missed game this season overall. ... It was the sixth game in Heat history in which both teams had at least 94 points through three quarters. Three of those have come since Feb. 26, 2020. FUNDAMENTALS The teams were a combined 14 for 14 from the foul line in the first half. It was the second time the Jazz had been part of a game in which both teams shot 100% from the line in the opening 24 minutes this season, and the first such game for the Heat since a “home” game in the bubble last season against Toronto. RAINING 3’S Utah has more 3-pointers through 33 games, 559, than any other NBA team has ever made through not just 33 games — but even 35 games. Houston had 554 3’s made through the first 35 games of the 2017-18 season. The previous 33-game mark was 522, by those 2017-18 Rockets.","401267667"
"Chris Paul gives to Deandre Ayton, who finishes with a dunk as the Suns rally past the Bulls. (0:17) CHICAGO -- — The Phoenix Suns’ All-Star duo got a couple of nice assists Friday night. Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton each scored 22 points and the Suns rallied to beat the Chicago Bulls 106-97, on Friday night. Chris Paul, who’ll join Booker at the All-Star Game, added 14 points, 15 assists and six rebounds, and Frank Kaminsky had 15 points off the bench to help the Suns win for the 10th time in 12 games. Zach LaVine scored 24 points for Chicago. The Bulls had won three in a row. Phoenix wiped out an 87-80 deficit with a 9-0 run early in the fourth quarter, then took the lead for good with five minutes to play on Paul’s short jumper. That started a 10-0 spurt that included 3s from Mikal Bridges and Cameron Johnson. Ayton was strong at both ends of the floor to help the Suns outscore Chicago 66-44 in the paint. Coach Monty Williams said the influence of Paul seems to be rubbing off on the second-year center. “You saw his ability to guard smaller players,” Williams said. “Even if a guy made a shot, it was a tough, tough shot. Tonight he was a force in the paint. That’s a sign of growth; he’s learning a ton from Chris. All of that is going to make him a better player and more seasoned.” Ayton had a team best seven rebounds and three blocks. The Suns were 6 of 22 from 3-point range after averaging 19 3-pointers in their last four games. Their streak of 120-point games ended at five. Both Paul and Williams were quick to credit the bench -- especially Kaminsky -- for helping to turn the game around late in the third quarter. “In the third quarter we thought we weren’t being aggressive. Our second unit talked about it on the bench,” he said after a 14-minute night. “When we were able to do that, we went on a nice little run.” It added up to a 43-20 rally in the game’s final 14 minutes. Bridges added 14 in the first of a three-game road trip. Chicago scored six points in the final five minutes and only 15 in the last period after going 5 for 16 from the floor. Coby White added 19 points for the Bulls, and Thaddeus Young had 13 points and 10 rebounds. The Suns scored 10 points off Chicago’s 10 fourth-quarter turnovers. “We just turned the ball over at an alarming rate. It broke our momentum,” coach Billy Donovan said after his team finished with 19 giveaways. “We just didn’t make good decisions with the ball.” The Bulls finished the second quarter hot, making nine of their last 11 shots to take a 58-46 lead. LaVine had eight points during the 19-4 run that ended the half. TIP-INS Suns: Paul was assessed a technical foul late in the first half after appearing to complain about the lack of a call against a defender. He more than made up for the moment of indecorum by finishing four rebounds short of his 16th career triple double. … F Dario Saric did not play after spraining his right ankle late Wednesday night in a home loss to Charlotte. Bulls: Coach Billy Donovan drew a technical foul during a third-quarter timeout after some apparently sharp criticism of the officiating. ... F Lauri Markkanen missed his 11th straight game because of a right shoulder sprain, two days after Donovan said it was unlikely he’d return to action before the All-Star break.","401267668"
"Kawhi Leonard goes coast to coast, then finishes with a big jam for the Clippers. (0:27) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — The Los Angeles Clippers' poor shooting from a night earlier improved to gain a split in a two-game set with the Memphis Grizzlies. And they added a strong defensive effort as well. Kawhi Leonard scored 30 points, Lou Williams added 17 and the Clippers beat the Memphis 119-99 on Friday night to split a two-game series. Terance Mann, Nicolas Batum and Paul George each had 13 points for the Clippers, 122-94 losers on Thursday night. A night after shooting 41% from the field, Los Angeles connected on 55% overall and 40% from 3-point range. “We wanted to come out tonight with a hit-first mentality,” Leonard said, adding: “It pretty well worked out for us.” Jonas Valanciunas led Memphis with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Ja Morant scored 20 points before he was ejected, receiving a pair of technical for arguing a no-call with 2:18 remaining. De’Anthony Melton scored 16 points. “They made a focus on the paint, limiting our paint touches,” Valanciunas said about Los Angeles' defense. “They did a great job of packing the paint. …They made some right adjustments.” It was evident from the start that the Clippers were going to be much more aggressive on both ends of the floor than they were a night earlier. While the teams played even in the first quarter, Los Angeles held the Grizzlies to 17 points in the second. Memphis was 7 of 22 from the floor, making only one of its 10 shots from outside the arc in the frame. “I thought we matched their intensity,” George said. “We looked like the fresher team tonight. I though our pace was great, and I just thought defensively, we shrunk the floor.” The Clippers concentrated on guarding the paint better than the previous game when Memphis amassed 72 paint points. Los Angeles was willing to see if the Grizzlies could make enough outside shots. Memphis still managed 54 points inside but was only 9 of 28 from 3-point range. “I thought we had great physicality in that first quarter,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “They still scored 30 points, but you can live with how they were scoring because we were aggressive. We were into them, and they had to work for everything they got.” The active Los Angeles defense contributed to more contested shots and turnovers by Memphis. Eventually, the pressure paid off as the Clippers closed the half on a 13-1 run for 63-47 lead at the break. The shooting struggles for Leonard and George from the previous night weren’t evident as they combined to shoot 11 of 16 from the floor for the first two quarters. The Grizzlies managed only 40% shooting in the half. “It’s hard to win an NBA game when you shoot 17 more shots than a team and don’t make them,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “I thought we got great looks. They didn’t fall. I think our defense was average. …Your defense has got to be consistent night in and night out.” The second half continued the theme as the Los Angeles defense continued to thwart Memphis shooters, who were stuck in the 40% range. The Clippers never lost their double-digit lead in the second half, extending it to 20 on several occasions. TIP-INS Clippers: Williams passed Bob Kauffman for 17th on the franchise’s career points list. Kauffman had 4,850. … Leonard has 10 games of at least 30 points. … Are 23-3 when hold they 10-point lead this season. Grizzlies: Justise Winslow took off the second night of the back-to-back part of his recovery from a left hip injury. … Valanciunas, who took a knee to the left thigh in Thursday night’s win, was active after being listed as questionable pregame. POSTSEASON REMINDER Before the game Lue said playing the same team on consecutive nights is “sort of like a playoff game. You get a chance to go home and see what you did wrong. …Playing the same team back-to-back reminds you of the playoffs. So we’ve got to come out with a playoff mentality and do things better.”","401267669"
"After the Thunder wore jerseys similar to what the Hawks were wearing in the first half, Oklahoma City changed to white jerseys for the second half. (0:29) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Atlanta Hawks 118-109 on Friday night after changing uniforms at halftime because a mix-up left the teams wearing similar colors at the start. The Thunder began the game wearing their sunset orange uniforms while the Hawks wore red, making it difficult to distinguish between the teams. “You could definitely tell playing on the court,” Oklahoma City's Kenrich Williams said. “Just kind of just -- you see somebody, and it’s like, ‘Oh. That’s not my teammate.’” Oklahoma City said in a statement that the Hawks wore the incorrect uniform color. The team said the league should have caught the error, but because the Hawks only brought red uniforms on their trip, the Thunder changed to white for the second half. “I certainly didn’t notice it or even think about it, to be honest with you,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “It was a league mandate that we just reacted to. They made me aware of it at halftime. When I went into the locker room, the guys were in white uniforms.” Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce was in no mood to talk about uniforms after the loss. He felt his team had a poor approach to the game. “A lot of technical things, a lot of just effort things that we need to clean up,"" he said. ""We need to have that sense of urgency. We need to communicate a lot better than we did tonight.” Lu Dort scored 19 points and Darius Bazley added 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Thunder. John Collins scored 25 points and Clint Capela had 17 points and 21 rebounds for the Hawks. Trae Young, who played at the University of Oklahoma, finished with 17 points on 7-for-21 shooting. The Thunder were fine before the uniform switch — they shot 60% in the first half to lead 63-55 at the break. Oklahoma City got off to a strong start in white and led 96-80 after three quarters. The Hawks cut the deficit to six in the fourth quarter, but the Thunder regained control. Bazley drove to the hoop, rose, clutched to his left, then threw down a monster two-handed jam that put Oklahoma City up 116-105. “He’s a freak athlete,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""He can do so many things in the air and get so high. He just made a regular basketball play for Baze, which is kind of crazy.” TIP-INS Hawks: Forward Danilo Gallinari helped the Thunder make the playoffs last season but was traded in the offseason. He finished with eight points in 25 minutes. ... Collins had 12 points and five rebounds in the first quarter. Thunder: Center Al Horford rested on the front end of Oklahoma City’s back-to-back. ... Guard Hamidou Diallo sat out with right groin soreness. ... Guard Ty Jerome scored for the first time as a member of the Thunder. He was called up from Oklahoma City's G League team and finished with nine points, seven assists and five rebounds in 22 minutes. STAT LINES Theo Maledon’s 12 assists tied Russell Westbrook’s Thunder rookie single-game record, set on Jan. 7, 2009 against Minnesota. Daigneault said Maledon used his speed to put the Hawks in binds. “That’s kind of the mode that we’d like him to play in is foot on the gas, stay aggressive, don’t worry about mistakes, gain advantages. Because when he does, he can obviously really pass the ball.” QUOTABLE Daigneault on Gilgeous-Alexander being left off the All-Star rosters: “There’s obviously more great players than there are All-Star spots, so every year, there’s people that are worthy that don’t get in because there’s a fixed number of spots, and I think we had one of those guys.”","401267670"
"Kelly Oubre Jr. rises up to ferociously dunk over Jalen McDaniels with two hands in the lane. (0:25) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Do-everything Draymond Green vowed to make up for losing his cool and costing Golden State a win at Charlotte last weekend. He delivered with a triple-double of a career-high 19 assists, 12 rebounds and 11 points to help the Warriors to their first three-game winning streak of the season with a 130-121 victory against the Hornets on Friday night. “Revenge game would be a bit of a stretch,” Green said. “Just me coming out and making it right. Trying to do whatever I can to help this team get a win. Can't just forget about what happened last week."" Stephen Curry added 29 points and eight assists after he sat out with an illness Saturday night in his hometown of Charlotte. “With Curry back, it changes our defense,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. Green notched his franchise-leading 25th career triple-double and first this season — dishing on each of Kelly Oubre's six first-quarter dunks as he finished with 27 points on a night seven Warriors reached double figures. Green credited Oubre's timely cuts helping the cause. “Just trying to exploit the lack of focus in certain areas,"" Oubre said of Charlotte's defense. Green, especially, wanted a big game after he was hit with two technical fouls and ejected with 9.3 seconds left last Saturday for arguing the outcome of a jump ball. Terry Rozier made an off-balance jumper from the left corner as time expired for a 102-100 win by the Hornets. “Kind of a sour ending,” is how Andrew Wiggins described it earlier Friday. Added Oubre: “We owed them.” The Warriors matched a franchise record with 16 assists on their 17 first-quarter baskets — Green dishing out eight of those to tie the most he’s had in a single quarter — while shooting 77.3%. They led 66-51 at halftime. “It started right at the beginning of the game. He was just picking the defense apart,” coach Steve Kerr said of Green. “He’s on top of his game right now. I just think he’s been playing better and better over the last couple weeks.” Wiggins scored 17 for the Warriors in a quick visit home from a 2-2 East Coast road trip before another four-game trip all against the Western Conference. Golden State snapped a three-game skid to Charlotte, led by Rozier's 24 points. Rookie James Wiseman and fellow big man Kevon Looney boosted the rotation after they were both still sidelined from injuries before returning Tuesday against the Knicks. The Warriors have won three straight after having consecutive victories seven different times previously without winning a third in a row. “I kind of like the fact that nobody in the locker room was really that happy with the way we played. We had some good moments and some good individual performances but it was a wild game, an awkward game,” Kerr said. “The locker room’s quiet, that’s a good sign. We’ve won three in a row and nobody’s that happy. We know we can play better and it’s a sign that we think there’s more to come.” A hard foul by Green on PJ Washington at the 9:43 mark of the opening quarter went to review and was ruled a Flagrant 1 foul. Green had his fourth game in February with 15 or more assists. His assists were the most by a Warrior since Baron Davis had 19 against Memphis on Jan. 11, 2008. CURRY'S MARK With his first points of the night on a layin with 8:04 left in the opening quarter, Curry became the fourth player in franchise history with 6,000 career made field goals. He joined Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain (7,216), Rick Barry (6,466) and Chris Mullin (6,150) on that list. TIP-INS Hornets: C Cody Zeller sat out with a bruised left hip and was listed as day to day. “We’ll see how he feels tomorrow,"" Borrego said.

"LeBron James answers Zlatan Ibrahimovic's comments that the Lakers' forward should ""stay out of politics."" (2:13) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James had 28 points, Dennis Schröder added 22 in his return to the Lakers' lineup, and Los Angeles snapped its four-game losing streak with a 102-93 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night. Montrezl Harrell had 17 points, while James added 11 rebounds, seven assists, four steals and three blocked shots as the defending NBA champions avoided their longest losing streak since March 2019. The fresh-legged Schröder was outstanding after a four-game absence under the NBA's health and safety protocols, scoring 13 points in the second half and leading the Lakers' decisive surge on both ends of the court. “His energy alone gives us a spark,” James said of Schröder. “His competitive nature gives us a spark. To have him back in our lineup just means so much to our team. It was big-time.” Los Angeles pushed ahead in the third quarter and hung on comfortably for only its second win since losing All-Star selection Anthony Davis to a calf injury 12 days ago. Damian Lillard scored 24 of his 35 points in the first half for the Blazers, who lost their fourth straight. Portland committed 16 turnovers while losing to the Lakers at Staples Center for the first time since November 2018. “Tonight was about our offense,” Portland coach Terry Stotts said. “There’s always room to improve defensively, but the Lakers did a really good job of being aggressive on us, creating turnovers in the third quarter, and we weren’t able to capitalize on some of the opportunities that we did have.” The Lakers broke open a close game with a 14-4 run led by Schröder late in the third quarter. The German point guard also teamed with Alex Caruso to play solid defense on the largely unstoppable Lillard, who got just one shot while playing the entire third quarter. “In the first half, we pretty much had our way,” Lillard said. “I was able to get in the paint, play pretty free. In the second half, they just loaded up. They were blitzing, and I didn’t really have any space.” TIP-INS Trail Blazers: CJ McCollum missed his 19th straight game with a broken foot. ... Robert Covington had four points on 1-of-8 shooting in 40 minutes. Lakers: Damian Jones didn't play after driving from Phoenix to Los Angeles earlier Friday when the Lakers signed him to a 10-day contract. ... They opened a three-game homestand, and they won't play outside California again until March 21. DENNIS' DETOUR Schröder was frustrated with the NBA's testing procedures after returning from his enforced absence. He said he never tested positive for COVID-19, but was only possibly exposed to someone at his home whose tests later came back negative. “The NBA, I think, has got to do better,” he said. Schröder said he had to spend several days in the guest house on his property playing video games and working out. He also texted his thoughts to his teammates and coaches while watching the Lakers' losses without him. “I missed my teammates, coaches, just the whole routine we have, going into the facility,” Schröder said. “We don't want that to happen again.”","401267672"
"Ben Simmons drains a rare 3-pointer late in overtime, only his second make from beyond the arc this season. (0:21) PHILADELPHIA -- — Collin Sexton flashed three fingers on each hand as he walked off the court a winner and simply said “that's game.” And who saw that game coming for Cleveland? Yes, the Cavaliers rebounded from a 10-game losing streak with wins against lowly Atlanta and Houston. But undermanned — and arguably outmatched — Sexton, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro helped grind out an upset. “You're going to see these type of moments again,” Okoro said. Sexton scored 28 points, Garland had 25 and the feisty Cavaliers beat the East-best Philadelphia 76ers 112-109 in overtime on Saturday night. The Cavaliers earned their first road win since Jan. 7 at Memphis and No. 4 on the season. They got one against a Sixers team that built the best record in the Eastern Conference (22-12) on the strength of a 14-2 mark at home. Make it 14-3. “Any time you get a tough win like this, it validates what you’re capable of,” Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. Okoro scored the first three points of OT and had 15 when he fouled out. The Cavs led by three and turned the ball over only for Ben Simmons to get whistled for an offensive foul. Garland hit a floater for a five-point lead and the 11-point underdog Cavaliers were on their way to their third straight win. Joel Embiid had 42 points and 13 rebounds for Philadelphia. Simmons scored 24. “That's a win we've got to get,” Simmons said. Sexton hit a 3 late in regulation that put the Cavs ahead 92-90, but Embiid answered with a tying dunk. The score went back-and-forth all quarter and the Cavs had a chance to win late. Sexton missed a long 3 coming out of a timeout and Matisse Thybulle grabbed the defensive rebound. Embiid missed a step-back 15-footer with one second left and the game went into OT tied 92-all. Embiid, who seems good for one injury scare a game, sure enough came up limping late in the first quarter. He stayed in the game after a timeout and promptly passed out of a double team to Danny Green for a 3. Embiid’s ability to draw fouls — he’s been accused of flopping — at an elite level continued against the Cavs. Embiid let out an “ahhh!” as he tangled with JaVale McGee and went to the line. McGee was whistled for three fouls in 1 minute that led to four made free throws by Embiid, and Jarrett Allen also had three fouls by halftime. Embiid was 11 of 12 from the line in the half; the Cavs just 10 of 13. Sixers coach Doc Rivers yelled, “Wake up! Let’s go!” with the Sixers down 39-30. The Sixers needed time to snap out of their slumber. ”We were running our offense like it was a walkthrough,"" Rivers said. Embiid and Simmons carried the Sixers in the first half and combined to score 33 of their 47 points. The other three starters scored just seven points and the Cavs led 56-47 at the break. The Cavaliers ran and ran after Sixers’ misses and scored 17 fast-break points in the half. The Sixers shook off a 13-point hole and got rolling in the third, in large part because Embiid and Simmons had help from the bench. Mike Scott hit a 3 that pulled them within one. Shake Milton hit the floater that tied it at 65. The Cavs pushed the pace and shut down every Sixer outside of Embiid and Simmons to get a win they hope will prove better days are ahead. “Are we there yet? No, we’re not finished,” Bickerstaff said. “But we’ve got to continue to answer the bell when tested.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: Andre Drummond again sat out for “personal reasons” as the Cavs look into a trade. ....

"DeMar DeRozan drives inside and makes the and-1 floater vs. the Pelicans. (0:23) SAN ANTONIO -- — DeMar DeRozan returned to the court Saturday night and it was exactly what San Antonio’s veteran guard needed after a chaotic and sorrowful two weeks. DeRozan had 32 points and 11 assists and the short-handed Spurs held on to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 117-114. DeRozan returned after missing a game after his father’s death. He posted a tribute on Instagram Feb. 19 after his father, Frank, died following a long illness. “All I cared about was making you proud,” wrote DeRozan, who was not available following the game. “Over the past three years I seen you display the ultimate measure of a man fighting to the end. Wish I could tell you thank you one last time.” DeRozan responded with his fifth game of least 25 points and 10 assists since joining San Antonio in 2018. He had only one turnover in 36 minutes against New Orleans. “It just showed he’s a real professional, real vet,” said Spurs guard Dejounte Murray, who had 18 points. “This is his happy place, because what he was going through, I can only imagine. I talked to him the whole time he was gone, letting him know I’m here for him, the team’s here for him. We’re brothers.” Brandon Ingram had 29 points and Zion Williamson added 23 points and 14 rebounds for New Orleans. The Pelicans have lost two straight and seven of 10. DeRozan’s return was a needed boost for the Spurs, who played their first home game since Feb. 9 before embarking on what was supposed to be seven-game trip. San Antonio’s annual month-long excursion was shortened when the team had to postpone four games after multiple players contracted COVID-19 or encountered someone with the virus. Rudy Gay, Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Devin Vassell and Quinndary Weatherspoon all missed their sixth straight game while following the league’s mandate for COVID-19. The Spurs leaned on DeRozan with two starters and two key reserves sidelined. The 12-year veteran had his fifth 30-point game and third in his last seven outings. “To be gone that long and not show any rust and be able to have wind and play as much as he did and as hard as he did ... he was special,” San Antonio coach Popovich said. LaMarcus Aldridge added 21 points off the bench in his second game back after missing six games because of a sore right hip. “We were a little bit better (defensively) down the stretch, but today we couldn’t make shots and our defense isn’t good enough over the course of the game to win for us,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We are totally dependent on our offense to win games and you’re not going to go far with that.” TIP-INS Pelicans: G JJ Redick missed the game with right hamstring tightness. Redick had nine points and seven rebounds in 26 minutes in Thursday’s 129-125 loss to Milwaukee. It is the first game Redick has missed due to injury, but he did not play in three games due to coach’s decision. … Adams played in his second consecutive game after missing two games with an ankle injury. He averaged 10.5 points and 10.5 rebounds in those two games. Spurs: Popovich said he is unsure when the five players sidelined by COVID-19 protocols will return, but he expects it to be a slow process. “They’re not all going to come back at the same time,” Popovich said. “Some may be back before the break, maybe some of them won’t, I just don’t know. But we won’t have a whole group before the break, for sure.” ... Lonnie Walker IV had 17 points and set a career high this season with 44 3-pointers in 27 games. He had 41 3-pointers in 61 games last season. … The Spurs have used seven starting lineups this season, including a change to their starting unit in each of their past two games.","401267674"
"Fans celebrate in the streets after the Knicks' win over the Pacers.  New York sits at the 4th seed in the East. (0:22) NEW YORK -- — Julius Randle scored 28 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lift the New York Knicks back to .500 with a 110-107 win over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night. RJ Barrett added 24 for New York, which improved to 17-17 with its sixth win in its last 10 games. Derrick Rose had 17 points and Immanuel Quickley 10 as the Knicks reached the .500 mark for the first time since they were 8-8 on Jan. 21. “It means a lot for us,” Barrett said about the Knicks getting to .500. “We want to win.” Whereas the Knicks appear to be gaining positive traction, the Pacers were frustrated by their inability to finish out a game. “They want to win really bad,” Indiana coach Nate Bjorkgen said. “It doesn't feel good at all.” Doug McDermott had 20 points for Indiana, which fell to 15-17 with its third straight loss. T.J. McConnell finished with 17, Domantas Sabonis had 15 points, seven rebounds, and nine assists, Justin Holiday had 13 points and Myles Turner 11. The third and final regular-season meeting between the Eastern Conference teams did not have the stakes that their iconic playoff series in the mid-1990s had, but that did not stop the franchises’ antecedents from playing a hard-nosed, possession-by-possession game that seemed familiar. Indiana appeared to be the sharper team for much of the first half after coming off a nationally televised 118-112 loss in Boston on Friday night. But New York, which hadn't played since routing Sacramento on Thursday night, took a 54-52 lead into halftime thanks to a 17-3 run over the final 4:38, capped by Rose’s buzzer-beating pull-up 3. “We couldn't stop a nosebleed on that run,” McConnell said. “We've got to buckle down and grow up and get some stops.” During the spurt, New York forced Indiana into four missed shots and five turnovers prompting the 1,981 at Madison Square Garden to chant “Dee-fence!” “We kind of imposed our will and our physicality on the game,” Randle said. “That's how we kind of got back in the game.” New York maintained its advantage for most of the third quarter, and began the fourth with a 81-78 lead. But Indiana outscored the Knicks 18-12 over the first seven minutes of the final quarter and held a 96-93 advantage when Sabonis drew a charge from Randle. On the ensuing possession, Turner scored on a layup to push the lead to five. It didn’t last as Barrett drilled a 3 and converted a three-point play to put the Knicks ahead 99-98. Following a timeout, Randle knocked down a 3 and Barrett converted a layup to extend the Knicks’ lead to 104-98. Indiana responded with a layup by McConnell and a 3 by Edmond Sumner to close within one at 104-103. That was as close as the Pacers would come as Nerlens Noel and Randle each made two free throws to push the lead to 108-103. Sabonis responded with a 3, but Knicks reserve guard Frank Ntiliknia made two free throws with 2.9 seconds left to seal the win. TIP-INS Pacers: A little more than a half-hour before the game was scheduled to start, Indiana announced guard Malcolm Brogdon would not play due to a sore right knee. He was replaced in the starting lineup by McConnell. Brogdon, who had played in every game this season before Saturday night’s loss, is averaging 21.3 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 6.4 assists in 35.9 minutes per game. Knicks: Despite Randle’s suggestion after Thursday’s win over Sacramento that New York’s defense had slipped in its last two games, the Knicks entered Saturday night leading the league in fewest points per game with an average of 104.4. “You’re going to have slippage in different areas,” coach Tom Thibodeau said. “You’re not going to be able to work on everything every day, so you’re going to have to prioritize on the things you have to focus in on, and try to correct those things but it’s never-ending.”","401267675"
"Michael Carter-Williams drops to the floor while trying to guard Jordan Clarkson, who finishes with a scoop layup. (0:33) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Donovan Mitchell scored 31 points and Joe Ingles filled in well again at point guard in place of Mike Conley to help the Utah Jazz beat the Orlando Magic 124-109 on Saturday night. Utah bounced back from a loss a night earlier in Miami, improving to 6-1 following a defeat. The NBA-leading Jazz have lost consecutive games just once all season and not since Jan. 6 when they were 4-4. “We’re not allowed to be tired, for one thing,” said Utah coach Quin Snyder, whose team improved to 5-1 this season on the second night of a back-to-backs. Mitchell shook off a scoreless first quarter and scored 25 of his 31 points in the second half. He 15 points in the third quarter when Utah pushed a four-point halftime lead out to as much as 14. The Jazz improved to 25-0 when leading after three periods and won by double digits for an NBA-best 23rd time this season. “I had a few lapses in the first half and a few bad shots and then it was like, `OK, this is what I see,'” said Mitchell, who made 9 of 13 shots after halftime. “At the end of the day, I’ve seen every coverage and it’s just about adjusting.” Ingles had 17 points, six assists and three 3-pointers. The Jazz are 7-0 this season when he starts at point guard in place of Conley, who was out with right hamstring injury management. That’s the same injury that kept the point guard out from Feb. 2-12, a six-game stretch where Utah won each game with Ingles sharing ball-handling duties with Mitchell. “I try to play the same game, but I realize I’m going to have the ball more in certain situations,” said Ingles, who had four assists to center Rudy Gobert in the first half. “I’m just making sure I’m getting guys involved and getting them in the right spots.” Gobert had 12 points and 16 rebounds. Jordan Clarkson, the NBA’s top-scoring reserve, had 18 points for Utah, which shot 52.9% and made 17 of 45 3-pointers. Magic All-Star center Nikola Vucevic scored 34 points, but missed out on his 24th double-double by two rebounds. Orlando was pounded 52-37 on the glass and surrendered 24 second-chance points to the Jazz. “That was the key tonight, giving up 24 against a team that’s already the best team offensively right now in the NBA,” Vucevic said. Evan Fournier (16 points) and Terrence Ross (10 points) combined to shoot just 11 of 36 from the floor and made only 1 of 13 from 3-point range. INEXPERIENCED CREW Veteran referee Bill Kennedy was forced to leave the game with 2:48 remaining in the first half because of an apparent back injury, leaving an inexperienced crew on the floor. Natalie Sago, one of five female referees in the NBA, is in her second season as a full-time referee, while Nate Green is in his first NBA season after four years in the G League. Kennedy did not return in the second half. TIP INS Jazz: Utah, which came in to the game averaging 42.7 3-point shot attempts a game, got up 20 shots from beyond the arc in the game’s first 17 minutes. … The Jazz missed their first six free throw attempts of the game. Magic: James Ennis III did not play because of a sore calf, allowing Dwayne Bacon to start for a fourth time. … If the Magic are going to make the playoffs a third straight year, they are going to have to do it against the NBA’s toughest remaining schedule. Twenty of their 36 games after the All-Star break will be on the road and there are nine back-to-backs. … Mo Bamba (11 points) had the highlight of the night when he caught an off-target alley-oop pass with his left hand and dunked.","401267676"
"Russell Westbrook drives down low but Anthony Edwards stays on him and denies him the layup. (0:16) WASHINGTON -- — Bradley Beal scored 34 points, Russell Westbrook added 19 as part of his NBA-leading 10th triple-double, and the Washington Wizards used a 44-point third quarter to pull away for a 128-112 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night. Westbrook added 14 rebounds and 12 assists for the Wizards, who have won seven of eight to move back into playoff contention following a 6-17 start. “It’s big for everybody, confidence-wise,” Beal said of the recent surge. “But at the same time, we still know we haven’t done much. We haven’t done anything. That’s what I keep telling our guys.” Davis Bertans scored 12 of his 19 points in the third quarter, including four of his five 3-pointers. Garrison Mathews scored 18 points in Washington's first home game following a four-game West Coast trip. “I thought he had some great looks in the first half, but shooters have to keep shooting,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of Bertans. “He made some shots that kind of broke it open for us.” Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who dropped their seventh straight, matching their longest slide of the season. Anthony Edwards added 21 points for NBA-worst Minnesota, as starting guard Malik Beasley served the first of a 12-game suspension. The Timberwolves were in it until Washington's third-quarter outburst, which included an extended 35-12 run. The Wizards scored nine straight to start it, with Westbrook's running dunk and Beal's 3-pointer from the top of the key giving them a 72-67 lead and coaxing newly installed Minnesota coach Chris Finch into a timeout. “When teams make a run on you, you’ve got to fight back,” said Finch, following his third game in charge. “That’s what we have to be. We need to learn how to be a little more resilient right now.” It was a five-point game before the Wizards made six 3-pointers over a 4:20 stretch. Bertans' last 3 of the quarter, off Westbrook's 11th assist of the game, made it 98-79 with just under a minute left. “I feel like we’re kind of bringing together everything we’ve been talking about at the beginning of the season,” Bertans said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Dropped to 3-5 in the opener of back-to-back games. ... G Jarrett Culver (ankle) returned after a 17-game absence, though he was available for Wednesday's loss in Chicago, Finch said. ... Jarred Vanderbilt had 12 points and 11 rebounds. Wizards: Improved to 3-6 in the opener of back-to-back games. ... Westbrook nearly achieved his triple-double by halftime, entering the break with 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. He also received his 11th technical foul of the season with 9:36 to play in the game ... Bertans (knee) returned after missing Thursday's win in Denver. CENTER OF ATTENTION Wizards Center Thomas Bryant, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear in January, made his first appearance on the bench since the injury, to the delight of teammates. “That was definitely the best part about the first half — just seeing him in the locker room,” Brooks said. “I was walking on the court with about four minutes to go (until tip-off.) Gave him a great big hug. He’s definitely missed and loved by all of us.” ""LIKE FOR LIKE?"" With Beasley serving the first of a 12-game suspension related to a guilty plea to a felony count of threats of violence, guard Josh Okogie returned to the starting lineup. Finch won't ask anyone will serve as a “like-for-like” replacement for Beasley, who is averaging 20.5 points and just over 33 minutes a contest. “We don’t expect any one person to come in and fill that void,” Finch said. “We’re going to put out lineups out there that suit ourselves to start, and then go from there.”","401267677"
"R.J. Hampton puts Darius Bazley on a poster late in the fourth quarter. (0:17) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Jamal Murray continued his hot scoring with 26 points and Nikola Jokic had his eighth triple-double of the season to help the Denver Nuggets rout the Oklahoma City Thunder 126-96 on Saturday night. Murray, averaging 30.1 points in his previous seven games, made 9 of 15 field goals and Denver shot 55%. Jokic had 19 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists. Michael Porter Jr. added 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Will Barton scored 15 points. Darius Bazley had 22 points for the Thunder. Ty Jerome and Isaiah Roby added 15 each. Denver, loser of four of its past six games and six of seven on the road, controlled this one from the outset in beating the Thunder for the third time in three tries this season. “I felt tonight was Denver Nuggets basketball,” coach Michael Malone said. “We played for each other. I told the guys, we have to get back to being a team that’s hard to guard.” Oklahoma City had no answers. Porter, who had an 18-10 double-double in a home loss to Washington on Thursday night, made all four of his 3-point shots in the first quarter and scored 14 points as the Nuggets led by as many as 23. The two-point loss to Washington was painful, as the Nuggets had a 4-on-1 breakaway opportunity in the final seconds but settled for a 3-pointer that missed badly. “It just shows what kind of team we can be when we’re locked in and focused and all on the same page,” Barton said. Jokic said that in the NBA, “you need to forget things really quick. The next one is coming so fast you can't think about it.” The Thunder’s second unit, led by Jerome and Roby, helped cut the deficit to 47-36 midway through the second quarter. But the Nuggets ended the half on an 18-7 run, including 3-pointers by Porter and Murray, and held the Thunder to one basket in the final 3:45. “We got off to a rough start, but it’s a long game,” Bazley said. “Defensively we were just trying to figure it out.” That didn’t happen. Jokic scored nine of his points in the third quarter when Denver pushed the lead beyond 30, which allowed Jokic, Murray and the other starters to take it easy the rest of the way. “I think we moved the ball really well, we were finding open shots, we were making the shots,” Jokic said. “We had some flow in our offense, so it was really easy to play when you play like that.” TIP-INS Nuggets: P.J. Dozier, who had missed 15 games with a right hamstring strain, scored nine points. … The Nuggets were again without Paul Millsap, JaMychal Green and Gary Harris, all nursing injuries. … This was the first of a four-game trip before the All-Star break. … Thunder: The Thunder were 11 of 47 from 3-point range. … The game ended a four-game homestand. The Thunder do not play at home again until March 11, following the All-Star break. SHUTTING DOWN SHAI Gilgeous-Alexander came in averaging 23.6 points per game. He had scored a career-high 42 against San Antonio on Wednesday and 24 Friday against Atlanta. STAT LINE The Nuggets went 15-of-31 on 3-pointers. Denver led 13-0 after 3 minutes, thanks to 3-pointers by Porter, Barton and Monte Morris, and 24-6 after 7 minutes. … The Nuggets outrebounded the Thunder 49-37, and had 30 assists.","401267678"
"James Harden goes in-depth on the similarities between him and Luka Doncic. (0:43) NEW YORK -- — With one star back for Dallas and another one sidelined for Brooklyn, the NBA's longest winning streak was halted rather easily. Luka Doncic scored 27 points, Kristaps Porzingis added 18 in his return from injury and the Mavericks snapped the Nets' eight-game run with a 115-98 victory Saturday night. James Harden had 29 points for the Nets, but only four after halftime while playing as Brooklyn's solo superstar with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving sidelined. “Obviously, they had two great players out but he’s an amazing player. It’s very tough to stop him,” Doncic said. “We did a great job in the second half. I think it was way better.” Durant missed his seventh straight game with a left hamstring strain and Irving rested his surgically repaired right shoulder. That took more than 56 points per game away from the NBA's highest-scoring team and Brooklyn managed just 34 points after halftime. “Look, I know they’re down a couple of superstars, but to hold them to 18 and 16 in the second half is pretty damn good,” Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. Porzingis missed last three games with lower back tightness and shook off his rust after halftime to help Dallas break open the game. Leading by four at halftime, the Mavericks came out for the third quarter focused on throwing the ball inside to the 7-foot-3 Latvian, who has 7 inches on any starter in the Nets’ small-ball starting lineup. He responded with 10 points in the quarter, including a three-point play that capped an 11-2 spurt and pushed Dallas’ lead to 85-74. It became 91-76 when Dorian Finney-Smith blocked Harden’s shot to lead to Tim Hardaway Jr.’s basket. Dallas put it away with 12 straight points early in the fourth, making it 106-84 and soon after Harden was removed for good. “That second half we just didn’t have any legs,” Harden said. Jalen Brunson scored 14 points for the Mavericks, who split games against the East's top teams after losing at Philadelphia on Thursday, when they committed a season-high 22 turnovers. They had only nine Saturday. Doncic and Harden each scored 15 points in the first quarter, but the Mavs gave more help to their point guard and led 38-26 after shooting 61%. Brooklyn cut it to 68-64 at halftime, when Harden had 25. TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic turns 22 on Sunday. He had seven assists and six rebounds. ... Hardaway had 13 points. Nets: It was a historically late night in Brooklyn for the NBA's Saturday night game of the week. The Nets said that going back 30 years — as far as Elias has tracked game time records — it was the first time they tipped off a home game at 8:30 p.m. EST or later. ... Brooklyn had won nine straight against West teams. IRVING'S INJURY Coach Steve Nash said he didn't believe Irving's injury was serious, calling it a maintenance issue. It's the second game Irving has sat out to rest the shoulder, which limited him to 20 games last season. “I would expect him to play next game and if not, I don’t think this is a thing that will linger into the All-Star break,” Nash said. NASH AND NOWITZKI Nash and Dirk Nowitzki, former Mavericks stars who are close friends, were supposed to attend the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, together with their families last March. Nash was already in California because Nowitzki canceled his trip and the tournament became the first major sports event called off in the U.S. because of coronavirus concerns. “You could kind of sense it coming and it was one of those things I think where we all had that kind of disbelief that this was actually going to snowball into this, but here we are a year later and it’s more real than ever,” Nash said. “So tough, tough time for everyone. We’ve lost a lot of people and we’re not through this thing in the slightest yet.”","401267679"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo drops 36 points with 14 rebounds to go along with the game-sealing dunk in the Bucks' 105-100 win over the Clippers. (2:31) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks showed they can still rally in the fourth quarter to win games with their defense. Antetokounmpo scored 36 points and sparked a game-closing 9-0 run as the Bucks rallied to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 105-100 on Sunday for their fifth consecutive victory. Milwaukee led the NBA in defensive efficiency while posting the league’s best regular-season record each of the last two years. The Bucks generally haven’t performed quite as well on defense this season but stifled the Clippers down the stretch. The Bucks held the Clippers scoreless over the final four minutes of the game and won for the first time in 11 games this season when trailing after three quarters. “It's great when you go against the best in the world down the stretch,” said Antetokounmpo, who also had 14 rebounds and five assists. “You're trying to get a stop, and they're trying to score on you to win the game. ... I love just taking that individual pride in guarding the best players."" Kawhi Leonard’s potential tying 3-point attempt bounced off the front rim in the closing seconds. Khris Middleton got the rebound and sealed it by making two free throws with 2.1 seconds remaining. “It’s a step in the right direction,” said Middleton, who had 19 points, eight assists and six rebounds. “We have to prove it by doing it over and over again, not just one game or two games. But I think tonight was a great sign that we’re headed in the right direction as far as defensively.” After trailing by seven points in the fourth quarter, the Bucks regained the lead 101-100 when Antetokounmpo made two free throws with 1:57 left. The Clippers had the ball with a chance to take the lead on three separate occasions after that but couldn’t convert. Paul George missed a contested layup with 1:35 remaining. Leonard missed a 3-point attempt with 1:05 left. George missed a 3-point try with about 35 seconds left. Middleton found Antetokounmpo for a dunk to make it 103-100 with 10.3 seconds left. Antetokounmpo high-stepped up the court in celebration as the Clippers called a timeout. George said after the game that the Clippers should have picked up the pace on offense down the stretch. Leonard agreed. “I thought we came down too slow,"" Leonard said. ""As a team, I don't feel like we're there yet. We're looking to the sideline a lot for plays. I feel like our pace has pretty much slowed down. You've got to give them credit, though. They locked in.” George had 16 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the Clippers. Serge Ibaka had 15 points and 11 rebounds. Lou Williams added 14 points. Donte DiVincenzo had 11 and Brook Lopez added 10 for the Bucks. HOLIDAY'S RETURN Bucks guard Jrue Holiday returned to action after missing 10 games due to the NBA’s health and safety protocols. Holiday acknowledged after the game that he had tested positive for COVID-19. “I had symptoms,” Holiday said. “It wasn’t fun, but I’m glad everyone’s OK and that I’m OK now.” Holiday came off the bench midway through the first quarter and finished with two points and three assists in 18 minutes. “Conditioning is just a little behind,” Holiday said. “I felt like I was a step slow."" TIP-INS Clippers: Leonard and George carried Los Angeles in the first half by scoring 30 of the Clippers' 48 points. They got much more help in the second half, particularly from Ibaka and Williams. Ibaka scored 12 points during an 18-4 run that helped the Clippers carry an 81-77 lead into the fourth quarter. But everything fell apart in the last four minutes. Bucks: Antetokounmpo has scored at least 35 points in four straight games, making him the first Bucks player to accomplish that feat since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar from Jan. 6-14, 1973. ... The Bucks' five-game winning streak follows a five-game skid that marked their longest losing streak since 2017. The Bucks went 5-5 in their 10 games without Holiday.","401267680"

At 18-17, the Knicks have the fourth-best record in the Eastern Conference and have won seven of their last nine games. They had an easy time with the last-place Pistons, taking an 11-point lead into halftime and extending that to 24 in the second half. “I think the first unit is really finding some chemistry together and I think they’re reading the game well,"" New York coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""Offensively, when we share the ball, we’re hard to guard.” This is the first time the Knicks have been above .500 this far into the season since they were 54-28 at the end of 2012-13, according to SportRadar. “Honestly, in our locker room, it’s expected,” Randle said. ""I’m not really surprised where we’re at as a team.” Derrick Rose scored 14 points, less than a month after he was traded from the Pistons to the Knicks. Dennis Smith Jr., who went to Detroit in that deal, started and scored seven. Jerami Grant scored 21 points for the Pistons. They shot just 38% from the field and went 9 of 32 from 3-point range.

Kendrick Nunn scored 24 points, Bam Adebayo had 16 points and 13 rebounds, and the Heat extended the NBA’s longest current winning streak to six games by beating the Atlanta Hawks 109-99 on Sunday night. “That was a big-time game for us,” Nunn said. “Took a step in the right direction.” Previous Achiuwa had 14 points in 12 minutes for Miami, which used a 10-0 run late in the fourth quarter to pull away from a game that was tied at 95 with 3:00 left. Tyler Herro had 12 of his 14 points for Miami in the fourth and Goran Dragic scored 13 for the Heat (17-17). John Collins led all scorers with 34 points for Atlanta, plus grabbed 10 rebounds. Clint Capela finished with 20 points and 14 rebounds for the Hawks, while Trae Young added 15 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. But Young shot just 3 for 14. “He's seen the pressure,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. “He knows teams are going to throw different defenses at us. A lot of it's focused on taking the ball out of his hands. And we have ways to punish, but again, if you don't make shots there's nothing really we can do."" Kevin Huerter scored 13 for the Hawks, who were just 8 for 35 from 3-point range. The teams play again Tuesday in Miami when the Heat — who have won 10 of their last 13 — will try to get over .500 for the first time all season. Miami played Sunday without Jimmy Butler, sidelined by right knee inflammation. “With Jimmy out, I thought guys really stepped up and filled in in a lot of different places,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Miami led 54-44 at the half, a big part of that because of their defense on Young. He was scoreless until 2:53 remained in the half, the deepest he’s gone into a game this season without a point. Collins was 4 for 4 in the second quarter, helping keep the Hawks within striking distance. He stayed dominant in the third. Collins had 19 in that quarter alone — the second-most any player has had in a quarter against Miami this season, one shy of the 20 that Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid had in the third quarter of the 76ers’ win over the Heat on Jan. 12. Capela added 10 in the third quarter and the Hawks briefly recaptured the lead before going into the fourth down just 78-77. Collins and Capela were 13 for 18 in the third; the rest of the Hawks were 1 for 8 and Young — just as he was in the first quarter — was scoreless. “JC was really setting the tone by being aggressive,"" Capela said. TIP-INS Hawks: Young’s scoreless first quarter was his fifth of the season. The Hawks are 0-5 in those games this season and 0-13 in those games since the finale of his rookie year. ... Rajon Rondo’s last seven games in Miami have come with him playing for seven different teams: Boston, Dallas, Sacramento, Chicago, New Orleans, the Lakers and now Atlanta. Heat: The six straight wins is Miami's longest such regular-season streak since a seven-game run midway through the 2017-18 season. The Heat had a seven-game win streak in last season's playoffs as well. ... Among those in the crowd of about 3,000 was celebrity chef Guy Fieri. ...

Spoelstra said Butler was with the team for shootaround Sunday morning and the knee “didn’t loosen up the way he wanted it to.” Spoelstra added that he believes the issue is minor. FLORIDA MEN This game was the first of four consecutive the Hawks will play in Florida — they’re at Miami again Tuesday, at Orlando on Wednesday and vs. Toronto in Tampa to start the second half on March 11. They are scheduled to play four straight in California from March 20-26, and have had only one four-game stretch in Georgia so far this season.","401267682"
"Jayson Tatum scores a layup, pressures Bradley Beal to step out of bounds and then scores the go-ahead bucket to lift the Celtics. (1:06) BOSTON -- — Jayson Tatum made two twisting, driving baskets in the final 15 seconds and finished with 31 points Sunday night, leading the Boston Celtics to a 111-110 comeback victory over the Washington Wizards despite Bradley Beal's 46 points. Kemba Walker scored 21 for the Celtics, and Daniel Theis had 20 points and nine rebounds. Boston, which beat Indiana on Friday, has won consecutive games for the first time since late January. Russell Westbrook had 24 points and 11 rebounds for the Wizards, who had won seven of eight. Davis Bertans added 20 points. The Wizards led 110-105 after Beal’s driving basket with 47 seconds left before the Celtics sliced it to one on Tatum’s acrobatic shot in the lane with 15 seconds remaining. Washington then turned the ball over before Tatum’s twisting bucket gave the Celtics a 111-110 edge with 4.7 seconds left. “I think it's just a feel for the game,” Tatum said of his clutch shots with players around him. “You use your instincts. I've been playing basketball since I was 3 years old.” “He's a special talent,” Beal said of Tatum. “He's an All-Star for a reason.” Beal got trapped in front of Boston’s bench and fired up a shot that bounced off the rim as the buzzer sounded. “It was a hard-fought effort by both teams. Somebody had to lose,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. “They made big plays. Tatum made big plays.” Tatum had struggled the previous two games, scoring just nine and 13 points, respectively. “Just the person he is, I knew he was going to come back strong,” Walker said. “We just needed to get a basket and JT got some unbelievable baskets. That's the type of player he is.” Coming off his NBA-leading 10th triple-double on Saturday, Westbrook added four assists. Boston trailed 106-98 after Westbrook’s 3-pointer from the left corner with 2:58 to go, but Tatum’s fadeaway capped a 7-0 spurt with 1:34 to play. “It means a lot,” Walker said of the comeback. “Just the way we handled ourselves in the huddle. We showed some poise.” Robin Lopez then nailed a short hook shot and Beal had a driving basket. “We should have won that game. We were up five,” Beal said. “We did everything we needed to do to put ourselves in position to win that game.” Beal’s four-point play made it 95-94 with just over five minutes left. He followed a basket by Walker with a 3-pointer and had a three-point play, making it 101-96 with 3:57 left. Coming off a victory at home a night earlier against Minnesota, the Wizards took a while to get going, but after an extremely slow start they opened the final quarter with an 11-2 spurt to take their first lead of the game. The Celtics matched their largest lead of the game on Walker’s 3 from the right wing, giving them a 68-57 edge early in the third quarter, before Beal scored eight of Washington's points during a 12-2 run over a 5:03 stretch. TIP-INS Wizards: Bertans has hit two or more 3s in team-record 16 consecutive games. … Missed their initial eight shots of the game and didn’t get their first basket until Bertans’ 3 just past halfway into the opening quarter. Celtics: Jaylen Brown missed the game with left knee soreness. Boston coach Brad Stevens said Brown “is very much day to day.” Javonte Green replaced Brown, making his fourth career start and second this season. POSTER TIME Tatum, a 6-foot-8 forward, drove the lane around Rui Hachimura and delivered a powerful dunk over the 7-foot Lopez, bringing a boisterous response from the Celtics’ bench.","401267684"
"Eric Gordon can't handle a pass, and Desmond Bane is off to the races for a huge one-handed dunk. (0:17) HOUSTON -- — Justise Winslow scored 20 points and the Memphis Grizzles pounded Houston 133-84 on Sunday night for the Rockets’ 11th straight loss. In just his fourth game back after missing more than a year because of a hip injury, Winslow — playing in his hometown — had his best scoring night since October 2019. “I think every day, Justise is feeling more comfortable,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. “He’s making strides every day. He’s healthy, playing hard and putting in the work. I give him a lot of credit for the journey he’s had to undertake to get back on the floor.” Winslow said he was embraced by Memphis after being traded from Miami last February. “It gave me life, gave me energy and helped me believe in myself again,” Winslow said. “It just felt like home, it just clicked to me, and I felt like I could truly be myself here.” Memphis had lost three of four before blowing out the slumping Rockets by 49 points, the largest margin of victory in franchise history. Houston has its longest losing streak since a 15-game skid in November and December 2001. The 84 points are the Rockets’ lowest total since Nov. 8, 2018, in a loss to Oklahoma City. Houston was 4 of 45 3s on 3-pointers. John Wall and Jae’Sean Tate each had 14 points for the Rockets. Houston’s field goal percentage of 27.7% was a franchise low. Rockets coach Stephen Silas was asked whether the loss was rock bottom. “I hope so,” Silas said. “This was embarrassing.” Brandon Clarke added 16 points for Memphis, Desmond Bane had 15, De’Anthony Melton 14 and Kyle Anderson and Tyus Jones 13 each. The Grizzlies led 25-18 lead after the first quarter, then outscored the Rockets 38-19 in the second for a 63-37 lead. After the break, the Grizzlies quickly scored two easy baskets, leading to a timeout by Houston just 54 seconds into the third quarter. Memphis outscored the Rockets 35-8 on fast-break points and 74-36 on points in the paint. “Very impressive victory by our group,” Jenkins said. “I give them a lot of credit. I thought our energy was phenomenal on the defensive end.” TIP-INS Grizzlies: SG Grayson Allen (concussion protocol) remained sidelined after taking an elbow to the head on Friday night against the Clippers. Bane started in Allen’s place, scoring 11 points in 23 minutes. . C Killian Tillie made his NBA debut and made down a late 3-pointer to loud cheers from the Memphis bench. Rockets: Center Justin Patton made his first career start. He had 10 points and five rebounds in 26 minutes and was the Rockets’ only starter to make a 3-pointer. BENCH SCORING Memphis’ reserves scored 85 points, which represented a franchise record, Jenkins said after the game. All eight bench players -- and all five starters -- scored in the game for the Grizzlies. Winslow’s 20 led bench scoring, following by 16 from Clarke, 14 from Melton, 13 from Jones and 12 from Dieng. BLACK HISTORY NIGHT The Rockets celebrated Black History Night at Toyota Center, which featured a performance of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” by the Houston Gospel Choir, video montages of key Black history moments in Houston, and the “First Shot” was performed by Kenneth Huewitt, Interim President of Texas Southern University. HE SAID IT “The missing of shots is really plaguing us this season. To go 4 for 45 from 3, there’s not a word for it.” — Rockets coach Stephen Silas","401267685"
"Devin Booker gets inside and takes a hit as he finishes through contact for the basket vs. Minnesota. (0:23) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Devin Booker scored 21 of his season-high 43 points in the third quarter to carry Phoenix in a 118-99 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night, the 14th win for the Suns in their last 17 games. Booker made 15 of 26 shots from the floor, repeatedly blowing by his defenders for smooth pullup jumpers and traffic-beating, twisting layups to hit the 40-point mark for the 13th time in his six-year career and help the Suns overcome a sluggish start against the NBA's worst team. “He’s the complete offensive player,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “The way he scored the ball is not something I took for granted, and no one should. It's a gift, and we certainly are grateful for it.” The two-time All-Star Game pick — each as an injury replacement — went 12 for 13 from the free-throw line for the surging Suns (22-11). They are a half-game out of third place in the Western Conference, with the same winning percentage as the Los Angeles Clippers (24-12). “Once we got it going, we got it going, but obviously we want it to be sooner than later and step on our opponent,” Booker said. Deandre Ayton added 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Chris Paul had 11 points and 15 assists for the Suns. They smashed open the game with a 21-3 run over a 3:48 span bridging the third and fourth quarters. Anthony Edwards made a 3-pointer for Minnesota to cut the lead to 76-74, but Booker assisted on a 3-pointer by Cameron Johnson on the next possession and scored seven more points himself before the end of the period. “He can score. He can pass. He can do everything. Just the sky is the limit for him, I think,” teammate Dario Saric said about Booker. “I hope he will continue to play like this, because we will win the games.” Edwards scored 24 points on 8-for-22 shooting for the Timberwolves, who were doing a decent job of defending everybody but Booker until fading hard in Finch's first home game. “He just kind of took the ball and put his head down and went and just made a play for himself,” said Finch, who replaced Ryan Saunders a week ago. Minnesota has allowed 518 points in four games under Finch. Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Timberwolves (7-27), who lost their eighth straight game and finished the month of February at 2-14. With D'Angelo Russell sidelined after left knee surgery, the offense is running often through Edwards, the first pick in the draft who has been urged by Finch to attack the basket more. Edwards made all six of his free throws, drawing contact more often than that. “I’m a rook. I may not get those calls this year, but it’s coming,” Edwards said, smiling as he admiringly changed the subject to Booker. “He was getting great calls, and that’s just respect. He’s good enough to earn those calls.” GOING TO TOWNS Ayton's improving defense was on display, as the Suns — with help from Saric and Frank Kaminsky — limited Towns to two shots inside the 3-point arc in the first half. “D.A. did an exceptional job just trying to make it tough for him to get the ball so he couldn’t get to his sweet spots,” Williams said. BACK AND FORTH Kaminsky — who had nine points in 16 minutes — took the first turn at power forward for the Suns, continuing an alternation with Jae Crowder. The Suns are 10-1 with Kaminsky starting. TIP-INS Suns: Saric, who missed the last game with a sprained right ankle, had 13 points in 16 minutes against one of his two former teams. ... Crowder was scoreless in 27 minutes. Timberwolves: Rubio, playing against the Suns for the first time since he was traded to Oklahoma City for Paul and acquired by Minnesota two days later, had six points, six assists and three steals. Rubio was the team's fourth-leading scorer in his only season with Phoenix. ... Jake Layman scored 11 points off the bench.","401267686"
"LeBron James pulls up from way downtown and knocks down a 3-pointer as the first half comes to an end. (0:36) LOS ANGELES -- — The Los Angeles Lakers blew a 14-point, fourth-quarter lead in their first meeting against the Golden State Warriors. They were determined not to let that happen Sunday night. LeBron James scored 19 points in his 1,300th regular-season appearance as the Lakers routed the Warriors 117-91. He was one of six Los Angeles players to score in double figures in a game that was never in doubt. The Lakers were up 20 at the end of the first quarter and had a 73-44 lead at halftime. “Our starters played terrific,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""They had a mindset to make sure they took care of business against a team that stole one from us the last time.” Forward Markieff Morris was a little more direct about the revenge factor. “We remember getting up big last time and then coming back,” he said. “We wanted to make our mark early and just keep our foot on their neck throughout the game.” Vogel said the best thing to come out of the game was that James played a season-low 24 minutes and sat during the fourth quarter. Kyle Kuzma had 12 points and 11 rebounds for his eighth double-double this season, while Morris and Alex Caruso each scored a season-high 13 points. The defending NBA champions had dropped five of six since Anthony Davis suffered a right calf strain on Feb. 14, but have won their last two. ""When you lose a mega piece like AD, it is going to take some time offensively and defensively on how we want to play. Over the last couple games, we have done a good job,” said James, who's the 23rd player in NBA history to appear in at least 1,300 regular-season games. Eric Paschall scored 18 points for Golden State, which had its three-game winning streak snapped. Stephen Curry added 16 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. 14. The Warriors rallied for a 115-113 victory on Jan. 18 at Staples Center, but were dominated from the opening tip. Los Angeles went on a 16-2 run to take a 20-5 lead with 7:23 remaining in the first quarter as four of its first six field goals were 3-pointers. The Lakers ended the quarter with 12 straight points to go up 41-21. James had 10 points in the quarter, including two on free throws as Los Angeles was 13 of 16 from the line in the quarter. Los Angeles had a season-high 73 first-half points as it extended its lead to 29 at halftime. Its largest lead was 35 late in the third quarter. “We were just never in it. Right from the start, we were fouling them like crazy,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “There are going to be a handful of games that are inexplicable. You don’t spend too much on this one. You flush the toilet and move on.” GREEN INJURED Draymond Green suffered a left ankle sprain during the second quarter and did not return after scoring six points in 13 minutes. Green also received his eighth technical foul of the season during the first quarter. Kerr said after the game that Green didn’t think the injury was serious. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State tied a season low with three offensive rebounds. ... They were 8 of 34 from beyond the arc. The 23.5% accuracy rate is their fourth worst of the season. ... The 20 turnovers marked the fourth time this season they have had 20 or more. Lakers: Los Angeles finished with season highs in rebounds (60) and steals (14) ... Dennis Schröder scored 12 points and Talen Horton-Tucker 11. ... Damian Jones finished with eight points, three rebounds and two blocks in eight minutes in his LA debut. ...

"Harrison Barnes drives the open lane, powers up and takes on two defenders with the two-handed rim-rattling finish. (0:29) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — PJ Washington scored a career-high 42 points, Malik Monk converted a three-point play with 1.4 seconds remaining and the Charlotte Hornets stunned the Sacramento Kings 127-126 with a late rally Sunday night. Monk finished with 21 points to help Charlotte come back despite playing without leading scorer Gordon Hayward, who sat out with a hand injury. LaMelo Ball added 24 points and a career-best 12 assists for the Hornets, who trailed the entire fourth quarter before Monk’s game-winning play. “It goes back to that term of resiliency, never dropping the sword, never giving in and fighting until the final second,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “They had to miss some free throws to help us out, but we found a way. Down men, we found a way to win. Just proud of our group.” Sacramento led 123-115 following a dunk by Harrison Barnes, but coach Luke Walton’s team couldn’t close it out. The Kings missed five free throws over the final 69 seconds and lost for the 10th time in 11 games. “Come to an end of a game, that’s where we have to step up and put teams out and we didn’t do it,” Walton said. “Give Charlotte credit. They hit 3s and made every free throw down the stretch. That’s a painful loss for our guys. We didn’t finish it out.” Terry Rozier hit a 3-pointer and then added three free throws after being fouled by Barnes with 33.7 seconds left. After Washington’s fifth 3 cut the lead to 125-124 with 17 seconds remaining, Buddy Hield hit one of two free throws for the Kings. Monk followed by driving down the lane and flipping the ball off the backboard with his right hand. He was fouled by Richaun Holmes. “It was a play for me or PJ,” Monk said. “I told (Ball) to pass it to P and he was like, nah. I had to make something happen.” Washington’s previous career high was 27 points against Chicago on Oct. 23, 2019. “I feel like I got it going early and my 3-point felt good so I kept shooting,” Washington said. “It always feels good when your shots are falling. Whenever my teammates found me I tried to make the defense pay.” Hield missed a desperation heave from beyond midcourt as time ran out. Hield scored 30 points and Barnes had 28. De’Aaron Fox added 20 points and 14 assists for Sacramento. Ball gave the Hornets a scare just before halftime when he crashed into the Charlotte bench after catching an inbounds pass from the opposite end of the court. Ball tried to flip the ball backward, then tumbled over chairs and into a cooler stand before he was helped up. ROOKIE SHOWDOWN ON HOLD An anticipated matchup between Ball and Sacramento guard Tyrese Haliburton was postponed when Haliburton sat out a second straight game with a sore left calf. Both are among the early leading candidates for NBA Rookie of the Year. During a pregame ceremony at midcourt as the Hornets warmed up nearby, Haliburton wore a light blue suit and was presented with the rookie of the month award for games played in December and January. FASTEST TO 1K Hield became the fastest player in NBA history to reach 1,000 career 3-pointers, doing so in his 350th career game. Stephen Curry of the Warriors was the previous fastest at 369 games. TIP-INS Hornets: Washington’s 15 field goals were a career high. … Monk picked up a technical foul for yelling at referees after scoring in the second quarter. … Jalen McDaniels was called for an inbounding violation midway through the first. Kings: Fox picked up two fouls in the first six minutes.","401267688"
"Luka Doncic goes behind the back to give Dorian Finney-Smith another easy layup. (0:17) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Luka Doncic had 33 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, Kristaps Porzingis played a nearly flawless second half and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Orlando Magic 130-124 on Monday night. Jalen Brunson scored 17 of his 24 points in the second half as the Mavericks broke open a close game. Dallas has won four of its last five and nine of 12. “We played great team basketball and that’s always satisfying,” said Doncic, who made 12 of 22 shots and five 3-pointers. Nikola Vucevic had 29 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists for the Magic, who dropped their fourth straight. The Mavs shot 52.2% from the floor and made 17 of 46 3-point attempts. They improved to 13-4 when leading at the half and 5-1 when shooting better than 50%. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was impressed by the display of behind-the-back and no-look passing from Doncic, who turned 22 on Sunday. “You’re constantly talking to players about not jumping in the air and trying to make decisions, but this guy defies a lot of logic when it comes to conventional coaching theories and that’s why we give him the ball and let him go,” Carlisle said. “He just does some amazing things.” Porzingis missed his final eight shots of the first half, but responded after halftime by making four straight shots, two 3-pointers and four free throws. He finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Dallas had a 50-37 edge in bench scoring and a 13-2 advantage in second-chance points. “I really loved the way we played overall because the ball moved in a wonderful fashion,” Carlisle said. “We mixed in individual attacks with team ball movement.” Orlando briefly tied the game early in the third quarter on a 3-pointer by Evan Fournier, but the guard left the floor for several minutes after aggravating groin and back injuries that have bothered him all season. Dallas took advantage and pushed its lead to as much as 13 points in the period. “I just thought we’d be better defensively, and that was the difference in the game,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Fournier finished with 26 points, 18 of those in the first half. Terrence Ross added 18 points for the Magic, while Michael Carter-Williams had 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists. TIP INS Mavericks: Doncic led Dallas in points, rebounds and assists for the 11th time this season. He's already done that 46 times in 2 1/2 seasons, well ahead of the 38 times Dirk Nowitzki did it in 21 seasons with the franchise. ... Maxi Kleber had 13 points and six rebounds and was awarded the team’s top defensive player “belt” after the game for the job that he did on Vucevic, Carlisle said. ... Reserve Trey Burke scored 11 points in 10 minutes. Magic: Clifford said forward Aaron Gordon — who has been out since Jan. 31 when he severely sprained his left ankle — has returned to some on-court work, but there is still no timetable for his return. ... James Ennis III missed his second straight game with a sore left calf. ... Orlando fell to 4-10 against the West and 0-2 against the Mavs.","401267689"
"Shake Milton runs the fast break and tees up Matisse Thybulle for the two-handed alley-oop dunk. (0:18) PHILADELPHIA -- — Shake Milton shook off a defender with a crossover that sent the 76ers into a frenzy, and Furkan Korkmaz buried 3-pointers that sent them on their way toward a romp. This win belonged to the bench. Milton scored 26 points, Korkmaz had 19 and the reserves sparked the Philadelphia 76ers to 130-114 win over the Indiana Pacers on Monday night. “The ball was hopping,"" Milton said. “Everybody was getting a feel for it.” The Sixers followed one of their worst losses of the season to the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday with a smackdown of the mediocre Pacers. Joel Embiid had 24 points and 13 rebounds on a sore left ankle. Ben Simmons had 18 points and six rebounds. The All-Stars got their numbers. The reserves got their highlights. Milton sank three 3-pointers and Korkmaz hit six 3s in a game in which they got some time, turning it into a rout. Korkmaz and Milton blew the game open for the Sixers in the second quarter and built a 20-point lead. Korkmaz, averaging 7.6 points, and Milton 13.4, about crushed those numbers in the quarter. Milton was 4 of 6 for nine points; Korkmaz sank four 3-pointers and scored 13. “It's what we need,” 76ers coach Doc Rivers said. “We’re still working with that group, trying to figure out what we can run that fits us the best.” Embiid passed out of a couple of double-teams to find Korkmaz -- nicknamed both Furky and Korky, you pick -- and he buried 3s that opened up a double-digit lead. Milton -- in a move that would have made Allen Iverson proud -- hit a crossover on Myles Turner that left him stumbling toward the basket. Milton buried the 21-footer that sent the bench into a towel-waving frenzy. Public address announcer Matt Cord even chuckled when he said Milton’s name for the basket. Matched up mostly against Embiid, the bad night continued for Turner when he was roasted by Embiid. “I say this respectfully, but that’s a matchup I’ve dominated since I got to the league,” Embiid said. Milton hit fellow reserve Matisse Thybulle on an alley-oop and found Embiid for an 11-footer to give the Sixers a 72-55 lead at the break. The Sixers' bench scored 26 of their 39 points in the second and made five of their six 3s. The Pacers had no answers. “When a bad play happens, we can't let it snowball and let if affect other things that we do,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. The Sixers, who still have the best record in the East at 23-12, were stunned by the Cavs in OT on Saturday. Rivers said the Sixers treated that one like a “walkthrough.” They woke up against a Pacers team that has lost four straight games. Malcolm Brogdon returned from a one-game absence because of a sore right knee and led the Pacers with 20 points. “This is not a losing team or a losing culture,” Brogdon said. “This is not what we’re used to.” TIP-INS Pacers: Doug McDermott left the game with a broken tooth. ... Jeremy Lamb sat out with a sore left knee. 76ers: Tobias Harris, who averages 20.2 points, sat out a second straight game with a bruised right knee. He could return for Wednesday's game against Utah. FAN APPRECIATION Pennsylvania eased restrictions Monday on large gatherings to reflect a sustained slide in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The Wells Fargo Center said it would quickly allow fans into Flyers and 76ers games if city officials give the go-ahead. Under the relaxed gathering limits announced by Gov. Tom Wolf, indoor occupancy will be 15% of maximum capacity, regardless of venue size. “We want to see our fans here,” Rivers said. “We have proven here in Philadelphia that it is a home court. Our fans are phenomenal. We need them here. It would be awesome in the second half of the season if we could have fans. It could really boost us.”","401267690"
"Jamal Murray connects with Nikola Jokic, who drives in for a dunk plus a foul late in the fourth quarter. (0:18) CHICAGO -- — Nikola Jokic dominated with 39 points and 14 rebounds, and the Denver Nuggets beat the Chicago Bulls 118-112 on Monday night. Jokic finished with nine assists, just missing his 50th career triple-double. The three-time All-Star came up huge in the fourth quarter, scoring 17 to help the Nuggets come away with the win after blowing a 15-point lead. “That's the luxury of having an MVP candidate,” coach Michael Malone said. “I see all these conversations about who would you want to start a franchise with. I've never seen Nikola's name mentioned, and I'm dumbfounded by that. My nominee — I've got a write-in nominee. Nikola Jokic is a guy I'd like to build a franchise with, like we've done here in Denver and had great success with."" Jamal Murray scored 24. Michael Porter Jr. added 17 points and 15 rebounds, and the Nuggets won for the third time in four games. All-Star Zach LaVine led Chicago with 23 points and grabbed nine rebounds. Coby White added 20 points and 10 rebounds. The Bulls performed better down the stretch in this one after getting dominated late in a loss to Phoenix on Friday. But they dropped their second straight after winning three in a row. “I thought we certainly played a lot better against these guys the last eight minutes than we certainly did against Phoenix, with all the turnovers,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I think just the totality of the game, the way we came out, was disappointing.” JOKIC DOMINATES Jokic simply took over in the fourth. “We were sloppy, I think,” he said. “I just wanted to be aggressive, change the rhythm, probably. I think I did.” He scored 10 points during a stretch of 3 minutes, 20 seconds after a big run by the Bulls that bridged the third and fourth quarters. Jokic also put Denver back on top with a three-point play off a dunk with two minutes remaining, and Murray then nailed a 3-pointer to make it 112-108. Thaddeus Young scored on a follow shot for the Bulls but Jokic hit a jumper to make it 114-110 in the closing minute. LaVine hit two free throws to cut the lead to two with 16 seconds left. But Will Barton and Murray each made two, preserving the win for the Nuggets. BULLS RUN The Bulls trailed by as much as 15 in the first half and were down 10 late in the third when they made their move. They went on a 21-5 run that stretched into the fourth. Young's driving hook and layup on the Bulls' first two possessions of the quarter put Chicago on top. White's pull-up jumper and Denzel Valentine's running layup made it 95-89 with just under 9 minutes left in the game. TIP-INS Nuggets: Malone said he does not expect F Paul Millsap (sprained left knee), G Gary Harris (strained left adductor) or F/C JaMychal Green (sprained left shoulder) to return before the All-Star break. ... G Facundo Campazzo and F Markus Howard missed the game because of health and safety protocols. Bulls: Donovan said the Bulls found out about 10 a.m. Sunday that their game against Toronto in Tampa, Florida that night was called off because of the Raptors’ COVID-19 issues. The team landed in Chicago around 4:30 p.m. HONORING NOAH Top basketball executive Arturas Karnisovas said he will “for sure” reach out to longtime Chicago center Joakim Noah about retiring as a member of the Bulls. Noah played his first nine seasons with the Bulls after being drafted out of Florida with the No. 9 overall pick in 2007. He made two All-Star teams with Chicago and was the 2014 Defensive Player of the Year. Noah has averaged 8.8 points and 9 rebounds over 13 seasons with Chicago, the New York Knicks, Memphis Grizzlies and Clippers. Los Angeles waived him prior to the start of the season. Noah also played on back-to-back NCAA championship teams at Florida under current Bulls coach Billy Donovan. The Athletic, citing sources, reported Monday that Noah plans to retire as a member of the Bulls. “It just came out that he retired,” said Karnisovas, Chicago's executive vice president of basketball operations. “We will get together and we will talk about it.”","401267691"

(1:55) HOUSTON -- — Collin Sexton scored 39 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers handed the hapless Houston Rockets their 12th straight loss with a 101-90 victory on Monday night. The Cavaliers have won a season-high four straight after losing their previous 10 games. “It gives our guys belief that they can,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Our guys put in a lot of work (and) because of their continued belief in one another... that puts us in a position to get the wins we’ve gotten the past few games."" Cleveland had a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter before John Wall scored all of Houston’s points in a 6-2 run that cut the deficit to 95-89 with 3 minutes left. The Cavaliers scored the next four points with the help of a steal by Darius Garland to push the lead back to 10 a minute later. “We’re hot right now. So we just have to keep playing like we did the last four games,"" said Cedi Osman, who had 11 points after missing the last game with back spasms. It’s Houston’s longest losing streak since dropping 15 in a row in 2001 and the first time the Rockets have lost five straight at home since March 2006. Wall's performance was the only thing that kept the Rockets in this one. He had 23 points by halftime finished with a season-high 32. Houston led by one early in the fourth quarter after a 3-pointer by Ben McLemore when the Cavaliers used a 13-0 spurt to take a 90-78 lead midway through the period.

Osman made a 3 for Cleveland after two free throws from Tucker before Mason Jones finished the quarter with a three-point play to cut Houston’s deficit to 74-70 entering the fourth. Though they couldn't pull it out late, the Rockets played better than they did in a 49-point loss to Memphis. They made just 4 of 45 3-point attempts on Sunday night in a game where they shot a franchise-low 27.7% overall. On Monday they’d made four 3s by early in the second quarter and finished 10 of 31 from long range. “I believe in this group's competitiveness and their fight, especially coming off the loss we had last night,"" Houston coach Stephen Silas said. “I’m disappointed in the loss obviously and I’m disappointed the streak has continued, but I’m proud of these men who gave it everything they had and they just didn’t have enough tonight.""

"Zion Williamson misses his initial shot but gets his own rebound and lets out a shout after the and-1 basket. (0:25) NEW ORLEANS -- — Zion Williamson showed no fear of renowned Jazz rim protector Rudy Gobert and spearheaded a relentless — and effective — assault on the Utah basket. Williamson had 26 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, and the New Orleans Pelicans held off a late Utah comeback bid to beat the NBA-leading Jazz 129-124 on Monday night. “My mindset was, whatever I can do to give my teammates energy, I’m going to do it,"" said Williamson, whose dominant third quarter gave New Orleans a double-digit lead heading into the fourth. “After the first two quarters of me kind of reading their defense, I really got a feel for it and I just was on the attack.” And the defenders he attacked included the 7-foot-1 Gobert, a two-time NBA defensive player of the year. “Rudy Gobert is a phenomenal defender and phenomenal shot-blocker. So, it’s not easy making shots over him,” Williamson said. ""Honestly, I looked to draw the foul initially, but somehow I finished those shots.” Brandon Ingram scored 26 points and Lonzo Ball added 23 points to go with eight assists, seven rebounds and two blocks, giving New Orleans three starters with 20-plus points. “Any time we all pay like this, I definitely like our chances,” Ball said. Pelicans reserve JJ Redick scored 17 points, highlighted by a pair of four-point plays on 3-pointers as he was fouled. Bojan Bogdanovic hit seven 3s and finished with a game-high 31 points for Utah (27-8), which was outscored 74-56 in the paint in losing for just the eighth time this season, but also the second time in three games. “We’ve got to own the paint and we didn’t do that in any way shape or form,” said Utah guard Donovan Mitchell, who scored 21 points. “This is a tough loss. I think we’re all pretty upset about this because it’s stuff that we knew. It wasn’t like we were tired. It wasn’t like they did anything (unexpected). We just didn’t have the urgency, and that can’t happen.” Ball, however, said the Pelicans “knew we can get to the rim against pretty much anybody. It’s one of our strengths.” New Orleans led by as many as 17 in the second half and was still up 14 when Ball's 3 made it 122-108 with 3:54 left. But Utah steadily chipped away during the next three minutes, pulling to 125-124 on Royce O'Neale's 3 with 46.7 seconds left. Mitchell, who scored eight of his points in the final minutes to help give the Jazz a chance, missed a driving floater with a chance to put Utah back in the lead. Gobert, who had 22 points, nine rebounds and five blocks, was called for a loose-ball foul trying to get the rebound and Williamson hit two free throws to put New Orleans up three. Utah's last chance to tie went awry when New Orleans swarmed perimeter shooters and Mike Conley was forced to attempt a leaning, double-clutch 3 from the corner that missed the rim. Williamson directed the rebound to Ball, who fired his final assist downcourt to Josh Hart for a game-sealing dunk that had the socially distanced crowd of just less than 3,000 jumping out of their seats in full voice. TIP-INS Jazz: Jordan Clarkson scored 20 points in 27 minutes off the bench. ... Conley finished with 10 points. ... Utah had its highest scoring second quarter of the season with 41 points ... Utah shot 45.5% (46 of 101), including 17 of 43 from 3-point range. Pelicans: Hart scored 13 points to go with seven rebounds. ... Eric Bledsoe scored 11 points. ... New Orleans shot 56.5% (52 of 92), including 7 of 11 from 3-point range. TURNING POINT The Pelicans trailed 64-59 at halftime but entered the fourth quarter with an 11-point lead after outscoring Utah 40-24 in the third period. Williamson scored 15 points and added a pair of assists in the quarter. His spurt was marked by his conversion of Ball’s three-quarter-court lob, with Williamson catching it off balance to the left of the rim and putting it in just before he crashed over the baseline. “The moment he caught (the inbound pass), I knew he was throwing it,” Williamson said of Ball’s long lob. “When he released that pass, I knew it was on the money. I wasn’t able to dunk it so I did a little soft layup.” Williamson also converted a three-point play on a strong drive to the basket as he was fouled, and one of his assists came after he drew three defenders with a spin move inside and slung the ball out to Redick for a 3.","401267693"
"James Harden knocks down a 3-pointer in overtime as the Nets survive a late scare to beat the Spurs. (0:17) SAN ANTONIO -- — While Kevin Durant has to sit down, James Harden keeps stepping up. Harden had 30 points, 15 assists and 14 rebounds and the Brooklyn Nets overcame a collapse in the final seconds of regulation to beat the Spurs 124-113 in overtime on Monday night, snapping a 17-game losing streak in San Antonio. Harden had his seventh triple-double in 22 games with Brooklyn since being traded from Houston, where he plays again Wednesday. “Honestly, I just try to find ways to impact the game and not just scoring the basketball,” Harden said. “We have a number of guys that can put the ball in the basket. Just being a distributor of getting guys shots, getting guys easy buckets. ""I feel like it’s my job. Just playing the game right way, not forcing anything, trying to make the right play, trying to get guys shots. That’s kind of my mindset every single game and it’s been working.” Despite recent injuries to Durant and Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn remains second in the Eastern Conference at 23-13. “He’s a brilliant basketball player,” Brooklyn coach Steve Nash said. “He makes others better. He can get to the line. He can finish in the paint and he’s always a threat from 3. He literally can do almost everything there is to do out there. He’s been a great leader for us.” Irving added 27 points and Bruce Brown had 23 for Brooklyn, which bounced back after a loss to Dallas on Saturday ended its eight-game win streak. The Spurs closed the fourth quarter on a 10-0 run to force overtime, with 3-pointers by Lonnie Walker IV and Patty Mills and a driving layup by DeMar DeRozan. “I thought they were great,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “Really worked hard. They have dug down deep all year and never gave up.” Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray tied the game at 108 to close regulation after initially losing the ball near the 3-point line while attempting to drive to the paint. Murray was able to gather the loose ball behind him, quickly turning and rising to hit a 21-footer with Harden defending as time expired. “We felt like we gave up that lead too easily down the stretch,” Irving said. “Just a few miscues, a few miscommunications. Just things that we want to clean up. We’ve just got to take this one on the chin. I don’t want to call it laziness, but just our focus level wasn’t matching the intensity in terms of where San Antonio was trying to get back in the game.” Brooklyn scored the first eight points of overtime to regain command and went on to win a regular-season game in San Antonio for the first time since Jan. 22, 2002. DeRozan had 22 points and 11 assists, while Murray and Walker each had 19 points. All five starters scored in double figures for San Antonio. Playing just their second game since being sidelined for two weeks by health and safety protocols due to COVID-19, the Spurs got off to a sluggish start against the active Nets. San Antonio is still without Rudy Gay, Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Devin Vassell and Quinndary Weatherspoon, who are sidelined due to the league’s health and safety protocols. The Nets were not at full strength either, with Durant missing his eighth straight game with a left hamstring strain. TIP-INS Nets: Durant has not played since scoring 20 points in 33 minutes against Golden State on Feb. 13. … Irving and Harden held up tip-off momentarily to greet and speak to Popovich. Irving first spoke to the veteran Spurs coach and then Harden joined in as the trio enjoyed some laughter during a brief conversation. Spurs: The Spurs announced fans can return to the AT&amp;T Center beginning March 12 against Orlando. Attendance had been limited to family members and staff previously. Seating will be limited to 3,200 fans initially. … Murray collected his 700th career assist in his 215th game with the Spurs. In franchise history, only Tony Parker, Johnny Moore, Andre Robertson, Johnny Dawkins and Willie Anderson have more assists in that span.","401267694"
"LaMelo Ball shoots the high-arcing trey and knocks it down in the first quarter. (0:18) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — After Portland's Carmelo Anthony scored 29 points against Charlotte, he exchanged jerseys with Hornets rookie LaMelo Ball, who had 30. It was a bit of mutual Melo admiration. Anthony had six of Portland's franchise-record 24 3-pointers and the Trail Blazers snapped a four-game losing streak with a 123-111 victory on Monday night. “I try to embrace the next generation of guys and the young players,” Anthony said of the jersey exchange. ""It was fun playing against (Ball) tonight. I've been watching him since he was in high school. Just being across from him tonight, getting a chance to really see his game up close in person, getting to see him and what kind of person he is, so it was only right that we did that tonight."" At one point Ball hit a 3-pointer and did Anthony's signature 3-to-the-dome gesture. “He can do it. He can only do it one time, but he can do it,” Anthony laughed. “I blessed him, let him know that he can carry it on.” Ball said: “Pretty much it's just all love and respect both ways.” Damian Lillard had 21 points and 10 assists and Robert Covington contributed a season-high 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Blazers, who got off to a sluggish start but led by as many as 19 points in the final quarter. Lillard also had six 3s. The Hornets have not won in Portland since March 2008. The Blazers are 25-6 against Charlotte in Portland. Portland had fallen into sixth place in the Western Conference, a half-game back of San Antonio. But the Blazers were hoping a quick three-game homestand before the All-Star break puts them back on track The Hornets had just nine players available for the game, with top scorer Gordon Hayward (hand contusion) and Cody Zeller (hip contusion) both unavailable. Devonte Graham missed his sixth straight game with left knee soreness. “That's all we have, this is our roster. These are the active bodies and we will continue to fight with what's available,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “That's all we can do.” Charlotte, playing the second of a back-to-back, was coming off a 127-126 victory at Sacramento the night before. P.J. Washington scored a career-high 42 points. The Hornets jumped out to a 26-17 lead in the opening quarter, led by Ball with eight points, and pushed the lead to as many as 11. Portland chipped away, pulling into a 40-all tie on Anthony's dunk. He followed that with a basket and a free throw that put the Blazers in front. The two sides wrestled for the lead the rest of the opening half, going into the break knotted at 59. Covington led all scorers with 16 points and seven rebounds. Gary Trent Jr.'s 3-pointer put the Blazers in front 68-61 early in the second half. Portland stretched it to 92-81 on Lillard's 3 pointer and the Blazers cruised the rest of the way. Anthony had 17 points in the fourth quarter. “I like the way Melo stuck with it. He got off to a slow start in the first half, but he ended up making a lot of plays in the first half and obviously his shooting in the second half really got us over the hump,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “I always like it, no matter who it is, but when Melo gets on a roll it's fun to watch.” Lillard went into the game averaging 29.8 points and eight rebounds. He ranks third in the league for scoring, behind Washington's Bradley Beal and Philadelphia's Joel Embiid. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte's losing streak in Portland is now at 13 games. ... It was the fifth game of a six-game road trip for the Hornets. Trail Blazers: Portland was coming off a six-game road trip, wrapping it up with a 2-4 record. ...

"Ja Morant rocks the baby after he races down the court and draws the contact on Raul Neto as he sinks the and-1 bucket. (0:31) WASHINGTON -- — Ja Morant had 35 points and 10 assists, De'Anthony Melton and Dillon Brooks each added 20 points, and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Washington Wizards 125-111 on Tuesday night. Jonas Valanciunas had 11 points and 16 rebounds for Memphis, which has won back-to-back road games for the first time since winning four in a row away as part of a seven-game win streak from Jan. 8 to Feb. 1. After a dominant second quarter, the Grizzlies led by double digits for all but 44 seconds of the second half to follow a 133-84 victory at Houston with another comfortable win. “In the past, we've got up big and we've let teams come back, let teams have confidence,” Melton said. We really are just working on attacking from the jump, dominating every minute of the game we can, honestly. Russell Westbrook had 23 points and 15 assists for the Wizards, but also committed eight of Washington's 22 turnovers. “We had too many turnovers that led to easy points,” said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. Bradley Beal also scored 23 points for Washington, which has lost two in a row after winning seven of eight. Robin Lopez added 14 while hitting all six of his field goal attempts. Aided by Washington's nine second-quarter giveaways, including five by Westbrook, Memphis used a 27-6 run to turn to build a 17-point lead. Brooks and Brandon Clarke hit 3-pointers before Morant’s pull-up made it 60-50. Then Morant found Justise Winslow for a dunk and kicked out to Melton for another 3 to stretch it to 69-52 with 33 seconds remaining, and the half ended with the Grizzlies still up 71-56. “They were running their offense,” Brooks said. “They weren't worried about going through us. There just wasn't enough physicality. Not necessarily that you have to foul, but you've got to make them think about their reads instead of just playing through them.” Washington scored the opening six points of the second half, but was never again within single digits after that. “Credit to us, learning from past mistakes to continue to keep our foot on the gas to come out with the win,” Morant said. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Started their 10th different lineup as F Kyle Anderson sat with a respiratory illness. ... G Grayson Allen (concussion) missed his second game but is “progressing really well” through the league's concussion protocol, said coach Taylor Jenkins. Wizards: Fell to 7-3 with their most-used starting five of Beal, Westbrook, Rui Hachimura, Garrison Mathews and Moe Wagner. ... Westbrook was involved in each of the Wizards' first eight baskets, assisting five and hitting the other three. MORE MORANT Morant recorded a double-double while scoring more than 30 points for the first time in his career, and his 11-of-14 foul shooting set season highs for makes and attempts. “I thought Ja was special tonight,” coach Taylor Jenkins said of the Rookie of the Year. “(He had) great control of the game. Offensively I thought he got the team organized, took what the defense gave him, he found the right time to be aggressive. This is something that's he's know that's just part of his overall growth.” NO DOUBTERS The Grizzlies picked up a fourth consecutive win decided by double digits. They have gone seven games since they had a win or loss decided by fewer than 10 points, the last being a 122-113 home victory over Oklahoma City on Feb. 17.","401267696"
"Ivica Zubac finds Reggie Jackson sneaking behind the defense on the baseline as he gets the easy layup. (0:15) BOSTON -- — The Celtics have had trouble at times this season holding on to leads late in games. Boston benefited from the surprise absence of one of the league's top stars to avoid that and post its first winning streak in a month. Kemba Walker had 25 points and six assists, and the Celtics took advantage of a late scratch of All-Star Kawhi Leonard and held off the Los Angeles Clippers 117-112 on Tuesday night. Jaylen Brown finished with 18 points. Jayson Tatum and Payton Pritchard each added 14 as the Celtics posted three straight victories for the first time since January. “I’m just playing the right way. Taking whatever the defense gives me. The shots are just falling. That’s it,"" Walker said. ""At the end of the day the overall goal is to win. We’ve been doing that.” Coach Brad Stevens said he's proud of how his team has responded after a stretch that saw them lose nine of 14. “They've stayed together when they could have been pulled apart by the noise,"" he said. The Clippers, who have lost five of eight, played without Leonard after he was ruled out shortly before the game due to back spasms. Paul George led Los Angeles with 32 points. Reggie Jackson took Leonard’s place in the starting lineup and finished with 25 points and seven assists. Leonard was listed as a starter before the game, but never took the floor during warmups. The team announced late in the first quarter that he had been ruled out. Coach Tyronn Lue said he didn't know Leonard's status for Thursday's game against the Wizards. Leonard has missed seven previous games this season, including two for a mouth laceration, two while in the health and safety protocols and three for a bruised leg. His absence comes with Los Angeles on the tail end of a five-game road trip, which concludes Thursday at Washington. He was coming off a game in which he played 37 minutes in the Clippers’ loss at Milwaukee on Sunday. Jackson said with Leonard out, the Celtics used their length to their advantage. “They were comfortable switching and also comfortable playing one-on-one defense,” Jackson said. ""A lot of teams right now have been hurting us with the switching.” In a game that featured 16 lead changes, the Celtics took a 91-89 edge into the fourth quarter. It grew to 111-100 on a layup by Tatum with 4:23 remaining. A 3-pointer by Jackson and free throw by Patrick Beverley got Los Angeles within 113-109 at the 1:53 mark. George hit a 3 to cut it to 114-112. Daniel Theis was fouled, but calmly sank two free throws to help seal it. The Celtics took advantage of not having to contend with Leonard on the defensive end and started the game 9 of 10 from the field to take an early 20-13 lead. But George picked up the offensive slack for the Clippers, scoring 21 points in the opening 24 minutes to put Los Angeles in front 63-62 at the half. Walker said he likes they way his team is trending with one game to go before the break. “We’ve just been playing well, playing tough. Not letting little things affect us throughout the course of the game,"" he said. “That’s the difference.” TIP-INS Clippers: Lou Williams made a 3-pointer with 1 second left in the third quarter. … Marcus Morris walked off the floor under his own power but did not return after taking an inadvertent elbow from Brown to the head with 46 seconds left in the first half. He was diagnosed with a concussion, Lue said. Celtics: Walker has scored at least 20 points in a season-best four consecutive games. ... Outscored the Clippers 42-32 in the paint. GETTING CLOSER Stevens said Marcus Smart, who missed his 17th consecutive game with a left calf tear, is getting closer to a return. Smart worked out before the game, doing some shooting and footwork drills. With three practices planned between their first two games following the All-Star break, Stevens said it will give them a better idea of when he’ll be ready.","401267697"
"Trae Young connects on three straight 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. (0:37) MIAMI -- — Trae Young took over late and made sure Nate McMillan would win his debut as interim coach of the Atlanta Hawks. Young scored 18 points, including 13 straight for his team in the fourth quarter, and the Hawks snapped Miami’s six-game winning streak by beating the Heat 94-80 on Tuesday night. John Collins scored 17 for Atlanta, which lost at Miami on Sunday and fired coach Lloyd Pierce on Monday. Kevin Huerter scored 16 for the Hawks and Clint Capela had 10 points and 17 rebounds. “Losing Coach Pierce, we all had to do better,"" McMillan said. “And that was the challenge to this team tonight. He took a hit because we didn't do what we were supposed to be doing out there. And I thought tonight, they did better."" Duncan Robinson and Goran Dragic each scored 14 for Miami, which missed a chance to get over .500 for the first time this season. Bam Adebayo scored 11 for the Heat, who shot 37% — their fourth-worst showing of the season. “We had been trending much better offensively,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “It just was a flat offensive game. It was not a fluid game for us on that side of the floor."" Tony Snell added 11 for the Hawks. “Ugly game, but in the end you win a lot of games giving up 80 points,"" Huerter said. “Great bounceback from the last 24 hours. And now we've got to finish the first half of the season strong tomorrow in Orlando."" Miami was outrebounded 47-26, by far its worst margin of the season, and was held to a season-low in points. The Heat were again without Jimmy Butler, who missed his second consecutive game with right knee inflammation. Miami shot 29% in the opening quarter and 36% in the half, including a 2-for-15 start from 3-point range. But by limiting Young for the second consecutive game — he had just two points by halftime and five points after three quarters — the Heat hung around, trailing 44-37 at the break and leading 66-63 going into the fourth. Then Young got hot in the fourth, when the Heat shot just 5 for 18, and just like that what had been the NBA’s longest active winning streak entering the night was finished. It was Miami's lowest point total in its home building since scoring 79 against Milwaukee on Jan. 19, 2016. The Heat were held to 85 or fewer points for the fifth time this season, by far the most in the NBA — with Butler missing four of those five games. “Defenses are going to be disruptive and do different things to try to guard us,"" Robinson said. “But there are always counters and ways to be effective. We just have to find solutions."" TIP-INS Hawks: Bogdan Bogdanovic returned after missing 25 games with an avulsion fracture in his right knee. He had five points in 16 minutes. ... Atlanta had 23 turnovers to Miami’s nine and won anyway. “You're not going to win many games with that amount,"" McMillan said. Heat: Tyler Herro has a 3-pointer in 32 straight games, tying for the fifth-longest streak in team history. He’s one shy of matching Tim Hardaway — who had two separate 33-game streaks. ... Robinson is four away from 400 career 3-pointers. He’s played 123 games; Young is the fastest to make 400 3s in NBA history, and it took him 159 games. SLOW FIRST Just as he did Sunday in Miami, Young went scoreless in the first quarter. The last time he was blanked in the opening quarter of consecutive games was Dec. 10 and 11, 2019, against the Heat and Chicago. The Hawks had lost 13 consecutive games when he was scoreless in first quarters. SLOW HALF The 81 combined points at the half were the fourth fewest by halftime in an NBA game this season. Miami-Dallas had 77 on Jan. 1, New York-Cleveland on Jan. 29 had 80 and Toronto-Minnesota on Feb. 19 also had 80. The 37 points allowed matched Atlanta’s best first-half defensive effort in its last 145 games. The last time they gave up that few was Jan. 6, 2019 — also against Miami.","401267698"

(1:59) MILWAUKEE -- — Nikola Jokic reached a career milestone and helped the Denver Nuggets snap the Milwaukee Bucks’ five-game winning streak in emphatic fashion. Jokic had 37 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for his 50th career triple-double and the Nuggets trounced the Bucks 128-97 on Tuesday. Jokic has nine triple-doubles this season. The only other NBA player to collect at least 50 triple-doubles while primarily playing center was Wilt Chamberlain. “It just speaks to his greatness.,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “The guy doesn’t get fatigued. He doesn’t get tired. When he was out of the game, he was in the huddles, he’s on the bench imploring his teammates to rebound and play defense and move the ball. When your best player is doing that, that really sends a message.” Jamal Murray added 24 points as the Nuggets earned their third straight victory and showed no signs of wear one night after winning 118-112 at Chicago.  Denver handed Milwaukee its most lopsided loss of the year and shot 55.8%, the highest field-goal percentage by any Bucks opponent this season. “It’s definitely up there for best win of the year,” Malone said. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and eight rebounds for Milwaukee as the Bucks finished an eight-game homestand in which they went 5-3. Khris Middleton added 20 points. The Bucks were held below 100 points for just the third time this season. Their 97 total points were one off their season low as they struggled early. “We just were not good against the zone,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We’ve got to do everything better.” Antetokounmpo had his string of four straight games with at least 35 points end. The reigning two-time MVP was one off the team record owned by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who scored at least 35 points in five straight games on two separate occasions during the 1972-73 season. P.J.

But the Bucks couldn’t slow down the Nuggets, who led 37-23 after going on a 15-2 run to close the first quarter. Denver extended the margin to 21 in the second quarter and led 64-50 at halftime as the Nuggets continually got open looks near the basket. “I thought we played with great pace, in the first half especially,” Murray said. “With all those missed shots that they had, we got out and ran and got some quick buckets and changed the tempo on them a little bit.” The Nuggets stayed in control the rest of the way and maintained a double-digit lead throughout the second half.

"Trey Lyles scores a team-high 18, draining four 3-pointers in the Spurs' rout of the Knicks. (0:47) SAN ANTONIO -- — San Antonio has discovered its depth amid the injuries and health problems that have plagued the team all season. Trey Lyles scored a season-high 18 points, Dejounte Murray added 17 and the Spurs used a balanced effort to beat New York 119-83 on Tuesday night, ending the Knicks’ three-game winning streak. Lyles is the ninth player to lead San Antonio in scoring this season, tying Memphis for most in the league. The Spurs have needed that depth with Derrick White, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Keldon Johnson among those missing time with injuries or due to health and safety protocols for COVID-19. “I think it just goes to show Coach that we have a lot of depth,” Lyles said. “We’re able to play guys that usually aren’t playing, but they’re ready. Just goes to show that we stay prepared in the gym and are ready for the moment.” San Antonio had eight players score at least eight points, with Patty Mills and Luka Samanic each adding 14 points in the Spurs’ seventh straight home victory over New York. Immanuel Quickley led New York with 26 points. RJ Barrett added 15 and All-Star Julius Randle had 14. The Knicks had won seven of nine entering Tuesday’s game, but were never able to find a consistent rhythm in its most lopsided loss of the season. “You get what you deserve,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. New York had 16 turnovers while failing to score 100 points for the first time since a 107-89 loss at Orlando on Feb. 17. “I think it was an impressive win on a back-to-back,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. Coming off a 124-113 overtime loss to Brooklyn on Monday night, San Antonio got off to a slow start but was aided by New York’s own troubles. The Knicks committed four turnovers in the opening six minutes, but the game remained close as the Spurs labored to hit open looks. “Obviously, we didn’t play our best,” Thibodeau said. “When you’re on the road, you got to play well for 48 minutes. We didn’t do that.” San Antonio eventually found its touch, with seven players making at least one 3-pointer. The Spurs finished 18 for 42 on 3-pointers, with Lyles shooting 4 for 6 and Mills going 4 for 8. Samanic was 3 for 5 in scoring his season-high point total. After averaging less than three minutes in the first two months of the season, Samanic is averaging 17.5 minutes in the past four games as the team has been without Aldridge and Gay. Keldon Johnson had nine points in his return after having not played since Feb. 14 due to the league’s health and safety protocols. The Spurs are still without Gay, White and Devin Vassell, who were also following the league’s mandates for COVID-19. Aldridge sat out with a stomach ailment. The Knicks were without Derrick Rose, who missed the game due to health and safety protocols. Taj Gibson also sat out with a sprained left ankle.

Booker scored 17 points before getting ejected for arguing with 7:10 left in the third quarter, but the Suns (23-11) still took charge down the stretch and cruised to their 15th victory in 18 games. Phoenix also moved past the defending NBA champions (24-12) into second place in the Western Conference by winning percentage after completing an unbeaten three-game road trip. “You gain confidence when a guy like Book doesn’t play or gets tossed, and you’re able to pull a game out on the road at the end of a trip,” Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. “That’s a recipe for mailing it in ... but that was a big-time character win. We got better. I think we played good tonight, but we probably got more confidence that we can pull a game out without Devin or Chris (Paul) saving the day.” Booker was whistled for two technical fouls in remarkably rapid succession, resulting in the All-Star’s second ejection in just over five weeks. “We weren’t nervous,” Bridges said of Booker's sudden departure. “We knew we had to go out there and do what we do. We had to lock in for the rest of the game and do it for our teammates. ... Our best player goes out, and we just kept staying the course and fighting all the way to the end. I feel it was a great road trip.” LeBron James scored 38 points for Los Angeles, which has lost five of seven with mounting injury problems. Dennis Schröder added 17 points, but the Lakers couldn't keep up without regulars Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Marc Gasol. Kuzma was a late scratch with a bruised right heel, while Gasol missed his first game under the NBA's health and safety protocols. The Lakers dropped to 3-6 since Davis was injured during a loss to Denver on Valentine's Day. “We play so well the last two games, we get back into a rhythm, and then we find out today that two of our big guns were out,” James said. “It’s definitely deflating, especially when you were playing poorly and then you get in a good rhythm.” Moments before Booker’s ejection, James and Lakers coach Frank Vogel got simultaneous technicals for arguing a no-call on Paul. “I’m happy with how we’re competing,” Vogel said. “Our guys are giving great effort and great hustle and great fight. You understand there’s a big picture here, and guys are keeping the big-picture mindset.” TIP-INS Suns: Snapped their five-game skid against the Lakers at Staples Center since November 2017. ... Booker replaced Davis among the NBA's All-Star selections last week. ... Šaric was questionable before the game with a right ankle sprain. Lakers: Talen Horton-Tucker had 16 points, one off his career high. ... Alex Caruso had seven points and six rebounds before leaving late with neck spasms. ... Damian Jones played just seven minutes against his former team. LEBRON IN THE LANE James, who led the NBA in assists last season, repeatedly scored in the paint against Phoenix while taking an uncharacteristic off-ball role on many possessions. His highest-scoring performance since Jan. 25 still wasn’t enough for the Lakers, who are struggling to generate offense with Davis sidelined by a calf injury. James got no help from two struggling swingmen: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had four points in 31 minutes, and Wesley Matthews went scoreless in 23 minutes.","401267702"
"Collin Sexton goes flying under the basket as he almost hits his head sinking the layup. (0:24) CLEVELAND -- — T.J. McConnell set an NBA record with nine steals in the first half and posted his second career triple-double with 16 points, 13 assists and a franchise-best 10 steals, leading the Indiana Pacers to a 114-111 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night. McConnell also went 8 of 8 from the field in 36 minutes off the bench as Indiana rallied from a 19-point deficit in the third quarter to end its four-game losing streak. Malcolm Brogdon scored 29 points and Domantas Sabonis had 18 points for the Pacers. “That’s as good of an all-around game from T.J. as you’re going to see in the NBA with the multiple ways he affected it,” Brogdon said. “He’s the ultimate teammate, as well, so we were all very happy for him.” The NBA record of 11 steals in a game is shared by New Jersey’s Kendall Gill on April 3, 1999, against Miami, and San Antonio’s Larry Kenon on Dec. 26, 1976, at Kansas City. McConnell’s previous career best was six steals on two occasions, the last on Feb. 12, 2018, against New York, when he had his first triple-double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. The sixth-year pro leads the league in steals with 2.0 per game. “The guys showered me with water after the game, but I don’t remember much about it because it was so cold,” McConnell said, laughing. “It was not enjoyable, but it was enjoyable at the same time, if that makes any sense.” Collin Sexton had 32 points, 10 assists and three steals, and Jarrett Allen had 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who committed 26 turnovers and had their four-game winning streak snapped. They held an 81-62 lead midway through the third. Indiana went up for good at 108-106 on a 3-pointer by Justin Holiday with 1:18 left. After a Dylan Windler layup pulled Cleveland within 112-111, Brogdon made two free throws with one second left and the Cavaliers were unable to get off a potential game-tying shot. “This was very, very big for us and a really impressive game by T.J.,” Indiana coach Nate Bjorkgren said. “You’re always going to get the effort from him at both ends. He’s got that look in his eye every night.” Indiana stole the ball on six straight Cleveland possessions in the first period -- five by McConnell -- and rattled off 11 consecutive points. The Pacers scored 35 points off turnovers, more than offsetting their first half total of five rebounds. “McConnell earned it, he earned it tonight,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “He’s a pest all the time. He’s super competitive all the time.” Cleveland point guard Darius Garland scored 16 points in 19 minutes before exiting with a strained left groin. Sexton had 14 points and 10 assists at halftime and became the first Cavaliers player to have double-digit assists in the opening half since LeBron James on Feb. 6, 2017, at Washington. HISTORY LESSON McConnell is the first NBA player to record a point-assist-steal triple-double since Atlanta’s Mookie Blaylock had 14 points, 11 assists and 10 steals against Philadelphia on April 14, 1998. “I was just playing with our defensive principles and trying to help run the team, I wasn’t going out of my way to make steals,” McConnell said. “We kind of dug ourselves a hole, so I’m happiest about the win.” TIP-INS Pacers: G Doug McDermott (broken tooth) visited the dentist Tuesday and was in the starting lineup. … G Jeremy Lamb (left knee soreness) returned to action after missing one game. … G Caris LeVert (left kidney carcinoma) and F T.J. Warren (left foot stress fracture) remain out, but LeVert could make his Indiana debut later this month after being acquired in the James Harden mega-trade. Cavaliers: F Dean Wade made his fifth consecutive start and scored a career-high 17 points with five 3-pointers. “Dean is a real likeable dude, to be honest with you, and that’s why the other guys are so happy about his success,” Bickerstaff said. … F Taurean Prince (left ankle soreness), who had been limited to one game and eight minutes since Feb. 14, was Cleveland’s fourth player off the bench.","401267703"
"Dwayne Bacon drives down the court as far as he can get before he beats the halftime buzzer vs. the Hawks. (0:30) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks haven’t had much to smile about this season — until now. The star guard scored 32 points and hit the go-ahead free throws with eight seconds remaining as Atlanta rallied from 19 down in the second half to beat the Orlando Magic 115-112 on Wednesday night. Coupled with Tuesday’s win in Miami, the Hawks improved to 2-0 under interim coach Nate McMillan and won consecutive games for the first time in 5 1/2 weeks. McMillan took over Monday when Atlanta fired Lloyd Pierce following a 14-20 start. “It feels good and I think this is my first win going into the All-Star break, and for us it’s good momentum,” said Young, who had 20 points after halftime to lead the Hawks back from a 61-42 deficit. “We were talking, wanting to finish out strong and saying, `Don’t start the break too early.’ For us, you could tell how much it meant to us to win that game.” All-Star center Nikola Vucevic, who had 29 points and nine rebounds, briefly put Orlando ahead 112-111 with a follow-up layup with 18 seconds to play. Seconds later, Atlanta put the ball in Young’s hands and he was fouled by Michael Carter-Williams on a drive to the rim. All night long, it was Young who had trouble with hard drives by Carter-Williams (20 points). This time, Young got the last laugh. Terrence Ross, who made his second start in three seasons and scored 28 points, missed a runner in the lane in the closing seconds. The Magic lost their fifth straight after Atlanta outscored them 73-51 in the second half. “We talk all the time about playing 48 minutes and it took all 48 minutes of playing this game to get it,” McMillan said after the Hawks improved to 2-5 on the second night of a back-to-back. “Our guys did not give up and it’s a testament of our character. It took all 48 minutes, but we got it.” Atlanta shot 9 of 13 on 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and made 21 of 45 from beyond the arc overall. Danilo Gallinari hit five 3s and scored 15 of his 23 points in the second half. John Collins had 15 points and Kevin Huerter added 13. All five Hawks starters made at least three 3s. Young was 4 of 7 on 3s and sank 10 of 11 free throws. “Our defense wasn’t at the level that it was at for three quarters,” Vucevic lamented. Atlanta took its first lead at 111-110 when Tony Snell drilled a corner 3 off a feed from Young with 1:09 to play. “It’s no statement to anybody but ourselves that we can win games,” Young said. “We can all go out there and make plays. If it’s a statement to anybody it’s to us that we can win some games.” TIP- INS Hawks: Clint Capela, the NBA’s leading rebounder (14.2 per game), didn’t play because of a sore foot. McMillan said Capela was inadvertently kicked in his heel Tuesday at Miami and the injury worsened. … Snell had 11 points and three 3s. Magic: Evan Fournier missed his 15th game, this time because of a groin strain sustained Monday while scoring 26 points. Fournier previously missed 14 games with back spasms. The Magic are 10-11 with Fournier, but 3-12 when he’s out. … Orlando set a franchise record by making all 27 of its free throws, topping the previous mark of 22 without a miss in April 2019 at Boston.","401267704"
"Stephen A. Smith unloads on NBA officiating and the ejection of Donovan Mitchell. (1:38) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid isn’t content with being one of the NBA’s best players. He wants more for himself and the 76ers — and it showed. Embiid had 40 points and 19 rebounds and hit a tying 3-pointer late in regulation, Tobias Harris scored 11 of his 22 points in overtime, and Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia beat the West-leading Utah Jazz 131-123 on Wednesday night. Ben Simmons added 17 points for the 76ers, who improved to 24-12. The game included four players who will be participating in Sunday’s All-Star game in Embiid and Simmons, and Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert of the Jazz. Embiid rose above the rest. “Those are the matchups you want to dominate and prove we have a great team,” Embiid said. The four-time All-Star is eager to add the NBA’s top defensive award to his mantel. “I want to dominate on the offensive end but mainly on the defensive end,” he said. Once again, he did both to help Philadelphia avenge last month’s loss to the Jazz. The Jazz beat Philadelphia 134-123 on Feb. 15 in Utah when Embiid sat with a back injury. Simmons had 42 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists in that game, but Jordan Clarkson hit eight 3-pointers and scored 40 points for Utah. All the stars were available for this one, and they put on a show. Philadelphia tied it early in the fourth, and the teams went back and forth down the stretch with neither leading by more than five. Mike Conley’s two free throws put Utah ahead 118-115 with 21.5 seconds left in regulation. The 76ers couldn’t free their shooters for a tying 3, so Embiid stepped back and drained one himself with 5.9 seconds remaining. Conley quickly drove the length of the court and had a chance to win it, but his runner from the foul line rimmed out. “Very comfortable shot and one I’ve made a thousand times,” Conley said. “It’s just unfortunate it didn’t go in.” Harris took over offensively for Philadelphia in the extra session, scoring the 76ers’ first eight points and giving them a 126-123 advantage on a turnaround jumper with 1:37 left. “That’s why I’ve been preaching for him to be an All-Star,” Embiid said. “He dominated in overtime.” Philadelphia all but clinched it on their next possession when Mitchell was whistled for a technical and Seth Curry made the free throw, and Embiid made one of two earned from the original foul to make it 128-123. Mitchell had 33 points, eight rebounds and six assists for the Jazz, who lost their second straight. Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic added 18 points apiece for Utah. Mitchell was ejected with 30.8 seconds left in overtime after picking up his second technical. He got his first with 57.5 seconds remaining in the extra period after arguing a foul call and didn’t hold back afterward. “I’m never ever one to blame the refs, but this is getting out of hand,” he said. “We continually get screwed. It’s getting ridiculous that this is what’s happening. I’m sick of it, we all are. It eats at me, man. It’s really, really, really getting out of hand. The league needs to do something about this.” HIGHLIGHT REEL Simmons and Mitchell delivered All-Star-worthy highlights on consecutive third-quarter possessions. First, Simmons stole the ball near Utah’s foul line, dribbled the length of the court and finished with a dunk after being fouled. Then, Mitchell attempted to posterize Embiid, rising high and trying to dunk over the 7-foot-2 center. Embiid denied the dunk while fouling Mitchell, whose attempt bounced around the rim and into the basket. BREAK IN NAME ONLY While most in the NBA will have a few days off this weekend, 76ers coach Doc Rivers and Utah coach Quin Snyder will be leading Team Durant and Team LeBron in Sunday’s All-Star game. Rivers said he’ll find time to get in a few rounds of golf, and both coaches said the break will be a chance to recharge emotionally — even if they’re still coaching. “You still get a mental break, if nothing else,” Rivers said. “I’ll take advantage of that.” Said Snyder: “It’s an opportunity to collect yourself.” TIP-INS Jazz: Gobert had 12 points and nine rebounds. ... Utah is 12-7 on the road. 76ers: Wednesday’s game was expected to be the last in Philly without fans. Beginning with their home game against the Spurs on March 14, the 76ers can host 3,100 fans. ... Harris returned after missing the last two games with a right knee bruise. ... Philly improved to 16-3 at home.","401267705"
"James Harden gets the ball at the top of the arc and steps back for a 3-pointer in his return to Houston. (0:32) HOUSTON -- — The No. 13 on his jersey, James Harden won so many games for the Houston Rockets. On Wednesday night in the first meeting with his former team, No. 13 had a triple-double for the Brooklyn Nets to send the reeling Rockets to their 13th straight loss. “A lot of mixed emotions from the fans but I knew that was going to happen,"" Harden said. “I just wanted to come out here and give them a show."" He did that with 29 points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists in the 132-114 victory. The Nets set a franchise record with their seventh straight road victory. They've won 10 of their last 11 overall. Harden has meshed well with his new team and the Nets are 17-7 since the trade. “So far, so good,"" he said. “It's everything that I signed up for. Top to bottom it’s been great."" It’s the longest skid for the Rockets, who had just eight players available because of injuries, since they dropped 15 in a row in 2001. They’ve had a tough time since Harden was traded Jan. 14 and haven’t won since Feb. 4. The Rockets used a 10-0 run, with five points from John Wall, to cut the lead to eight with about eight minutes left in the fourth. But the Nets scored the next eight points, with two 3s from Harden, to extend it to 113-97 midway through the quarter. It’s the eighth triple-double for Harden this season and his second straight after he had 30 points, 14 rebounds and 15 assists without a turnover in an overtime victory at San Antonio on Monday night. He didn’t play as clean of a game Wednesday when he had eight turnovers. Harden got a mixed reception from the crowd. Many of the 3,615 fans booed when he was introduced before the game and more boos came the first few times he touched the ball. He said it was a “little weird” being on the visitor's side but denied having any extra emotions. “Once I get on that court I’m just trying to win,"" he said. “So that was kind of my feeling. I wasn’t trying to show off. I wasn’t trying to do anything out of the ordinary that I haven’t been doing. Just playing my brand of basketball."" The Rockets played a video showcasing some of the countless highlights of his eight seasons in Houston during a timeout in the first quarter. There were more cheers than boos as it played. Harden stepped out of the huddle and raised his arms before placing his hands in a praying position to acknowledge the fans as it ended. “You could tell it meant something to him,"" coach Steve Nash said. “This place is special to James. Houston means a lot to him ... so I know it was a big game for him. I was proud of the way he handled it."" Wall had a season-high 36 points, and Victor Oladipo also set his season high with 33. Houston coach Stephen Silas said the strong play of those two stars is an encouraging sign amid this difficult stretch. “It lets us know that when we get back and we’re healthy and we’re whole and we are in a position where we have enough guys to compete we’re going to be just fine,"" he said. TIP-INS Nets: Kevin Durant missed his ninth game in a row with a strained left hamstring. ... Kyrie Irving had 24 points, and Joe Harris 19. Rockets: Eric Gordon missed a second straight game with a sore left knee. ... David Nwaba will be out at least six weeks after right wrist surgery on Wednesday. ... Danuel House sat out with a bruised right knee. HARDEN'S JERSEY Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta told the Houston Chronicle this week that the team will retire Harden's number later this season. He will be the seventh player in franchise history to receive the honor. He said he learned about it on the internet and was asked what that will mean to him. “That hopefully I did something right,"" Harden said. “Obviously, I came up short of a championship but the work I put up the past eight years was elite... I think the only thing I didn’t accomplish was a championship.”","401267706"
"Karl-Anthony Towns gracefully navigates to the basket and puts in a finesse layup around a defender for a Timberwolves' bucket. (0:21) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Terry Rozier scored 31 points and Gordon Hayward added 23 as the Charlotte Hornets headed into the All-Star break with a 135-102 win over the skidding Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night. Rozier was instrumental in helping the Hornets pull away in the third quarter. He hit three 3-pointers in a span of 1:29, the last of which pushed the lead to 79-65. Yet another 3 from Rozier capped an 18-0 run that made it 89-65. The Hornets have alternated wins and losses for the past 11 games, with Wednesday’s victory coming after a loss Monday at Portland. Charlotte now heads into the break hoping to get healthy for the second half. “I think this win just validates our first half of the season,"" coach James Borrego said. “It validates what we're doing, how we're playing. And tonight was a validation of the hard work and the togetherness of this group.” The Timberwolves have lost nine in a row and 13 of 14. Minnesota is 0-5 since Chris Finch replaced Ryan Saunders as coach. “Tonight’s performance was completely unacceptable,” Finch said. Four starters scored in double figures for the Timberwolves. Karl-Anthony Towns had 16 points and 15 rebounds, while Ricky Rubio finished with 20 points and nine assists. Rubio also had a team-high five turnovers. Minnesota committed five turnovers during Charlotte’s 18-0 run in the third. The Wolves finished the game with 19 turnovers, one shy of their season high. The Timberwolves limp into the break with an NBA-worst record of 7-29. “We've just got to take a long look at ourselves and solve the problem,"" Towns said. “This is not the way we should be playing.” Charlotte’s offense benefited early from the return of Hayward, who missed the previous two games with a right hand injury. Hayward set the pace for the Hornets in the first quarter, scoring 10 of the team’s first 12 points. “I thought he was fantastic tonight,” Borrego said. “He gave us great leadership and momentum. He really steadied us early on.” Hornets forward P.J. Washington left in the fourth quarter with a right ankle sprain and did not return. Borrego didn't have an update postgame but said he thought Washington will be good to go when the season resumes. PAIR OF RISING STARS The 2021 NBA Rising Stars rosters were announced Wednesday, and the Hornets-Timberwolves matchup featured two players on the Team USA roster. Minnesota rookie Anthony Edwards and Charlotte guard LaMelo Ball, the respective first and third overall picks in last year’s NBA draft, were both selected. However, this year’s Rising Stars game will not be played as part of All-Star weekend in Atlanta. Both players scored 19 points in Wednesday's game. TIP-INS Hornets: C Cody Zeller was initially listed as questionable with a bruised left hip but was later downgraded to out, missing his fourth straight game. … Rozier has scored 30 or more points seven times this season. He had 41 against Minnesota earlier this year. Timberwolves: Towns tallied his 13th double-double of the season. … Rubio’s first rebound of the game was the 2,500th of his career.","401267707"
"After the Pelicans' loss to the Bulls, Zion Williamson spends time postgame getting up shots. (0:26) NEW ORLEANS -- — Zach LaVine capped a 36-point performance with a driving layup and four free throws during the final minute, and the Chicago Bulls held off a late rally to beat the mercurial New Orleans Pelicans 128-124 on Wednesday night. “I’ve got to stay aggressive,"" LaVine said, noting that he might have been too eager to pass when the Pelicans tightened the game up in the final five minutes. “It makes the play a little bit easier, because if they don’t stop me, then obviously I’m at the rim or have an open shot. “I feel comfortable taking those free throws at the end of the game,” LaVine added. Coby White scored 25 for the Bulls, who led by as many as 19 and were still up 18 in the fourth quarter before the Pelicans' late surge pulled them as close as 117-113 on Jaxson Hayes alley-oop dunk as he was fouled with 1:49 left. Hayes missed the free throw, however, and Zion Williamson, who scored 28 points, missed two free throws with a chance to cut it to two with 1:23 left. “I really feel like I let my team down, man,” said Williamson, who missed eight of 16 free throws in the game and returned to the empty court afterward to work on his foul shots. “I’ve got to be better in that situation. If I want to be one of those great players and I take a lot of responsibility, I’ve got to be ready for those moments.” The Bulls, pulled out of a three-minute dry spell that included five missed shots and three turnovers when Wendell Carter Jr.'s putback made it 119-113 with 1:05 to go. “Obviously, we wish it were a little bit easier than that because we worked so hard throughout the game and we had them down,” LaVine said. “But I think we responded well.” It was the middling Bulls' second victory this season over the mystifying Pelicans, who came out flat after knocking off the NBA-leading Utah Jazz on Monday night. New Orleans missed 16 of 22 3-point shots and 12 of 38 free throws. “We got absolutely destroyed on the boards,” said Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy, whose team was outrebounded 45-35 and allowed the Bulls to turn 13 offensive rebounds into 20 second-chance points. “We didn’t give ourselves a chance. ... It’s all right there on the stat sheet.” Brandon Ingram scored 21 points in 25 minutes, but sat out much of the fourth quarter while the Pelicans rallied back into the game, helped by Hayes’ 10 points and three blocks. “I probably should have played him earlier,"" Van Gundy said of Hayes. ""We finally got some life with that unit. Our starters had been absolutely dominated all night.” Thaddeus Young scored 18 points and Carter grabbed 15 rebounds for Chicago, which began to pull away for good when White's four-point play on a 3-pointer as he was fouled by Ingram pushed the Bulls' lead to 51-41 with 3:37 left in the first half. Young's layup as he was fouled by Williamson and Garrett Temple's free throws capped a 20-4 run to close the half and put Chicago up 64-45. TIP-INS Bulls: LaVine hit 12 of 19 shots, going 4 of 8 from deep and hitting all eight of his free throws. He also had eight assists. ... Patrick Williams scored 13 points and Denzel Valentine scored 11. ... Chicago improved to 8-8 on the road. ... The Bulls shot 51.1% (48 of 94), hit 12 of 28 3s and 20 of 22 free throws. ...

STRESSING PRIORITIES While Van Gundy praised Williamson individually for working on his free throws after the game, he expressed concern about his offensively prolific squad's priorities. “One of our problems is our guys will beat themselves up about missing shots, missing free throws, all of that, but the defensive stuff just doesn’t get to them in the same way,"" Van Gundy said. ""It doesn’t bother them that we gave up 128 points tonight. ... I'm not sure individual players are holding themselves accountable for the right things.”","401267708"
"Kristaps Porzingis fakes out his defender and drives in to finish with a dunk. (0:22) DALLAS -- — Kristaps Porzingis had 19 points and 13 rebounds with European sidekick Luka Doncic sidelined by a back issue going into his second All-Star appearance, and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 87-78 on Wednesday night. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 19 points, Josh Richardson added 16 and Dallas cruised most of the second half without the NBA's sixth-leading scorer. Doncic had averaged 31.6 points in the previous nine games, with Dallas winning seven to get above .500 for the first time since Jan. 22. The Mavericks kept that roll going, winning for the 10th time in 13 games going into the All-Star break. Dallas lost six in a row before that. Coach Rick Carlisle said he expected Doncic, who was in a white Air Jordan hoodie in his usual spot in one corner of the spaced-out bench, to play in Atlanta on Sunday. The Slovenian sensation was voted a starter for the second straight year. Porzingis, who averaged 27.2 points and 11.8 rebounds in 10 games without Doncic in their first season together in 2019-20, started quietly but finished 7 of 15 from the floor, including 3 of 6 from 3-point range. “I didn't want to force anything,” Porzingis said after this third game since returning from his own back problem. “I knew the ball was going to come back to me. At the end, some easy shots, easy ones came to me. For us, it's important that we're moving the ball.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 15 points for Oklahoma City, which was held to a season low in points on its worst shooting night so far at 33%. The previous lows were 80 points and 37%. “I think the thing we can take away from this game is we've just got to keep playing,” said Kenrich Williams, who scored all eight of his points in the first half playing not far from his college home at TCU. “They're going to hit tough shots and offensively the ball's not always going to go in. You've just got to stay together defensively.” For the first 2 1/2 quarters, the Mavericks also missed Doncic's 46.1% shooting from 3-point range during those nine games before he finally had to sit with a back issue that's been bothering him for a couple of weeks. Dallas had missed 22 of its first 23 from long range when Hardaway hit one for Dallas' first 10-point lead at 62-52 in the third quarter. At that point, Hardaway was 2 of 5 from beyond the arc while his teammates had missed all 18 attempts. That second basket from long range by Hardaway got other Dallas players going, though. Trey Burke, Porzingis and Richardson hit three in a row in the third quarter, and Porzingis drained a pair on back-to-back possessions for Dallas' first 20-point lead at 84-64 in the fourth quarter. The Mavericks ended up at 20% from beyond the arc (8 of 40). “I liked the looks,” Carlisle said. ""Some nights you’ve just to keep firing them up there. We’ve been shooting the 3 well, particularly the last three, three and a half weeks. I just liked the way we stuck to the process in the second half. TIP-INS Thunder: Despite the low-scoring night, Oklahoma City had five players in double figures. The others were Ty Jerome with 13, Darius Bazley and Theo Maledon with 11 apiece and Al Horford with 10. ... Bazley also had 10 rebounds. ... Isaiah Roby, who ended up with the Mavericks as a second-round pick in 2019, had five points and eight rebounds in his first game against his former team.

Jalen Brunson was the other double-figure scorer with 11 while Trey Burke had nine points and a team-high six assists without Doncic, who is fifth in the NBA in assists per game. QUIRKY SCHEDULE The first meeting between these teams this season ended a run of four consecutive games in Oklahoma City. The final two games of 2018-19 were at the home of the Thunder, as were the first two of last season before the coronavirus shutdown. Dallas and Oklahoma City split those four games.","401267709"
"Damian Lillard pulls up from way downtown and knocks down the 3-pointer to give Portland the lead late. (0:27) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Played tough by the Warriors all game, Damian Lillard needed to make something happen. And that's exactly what he did. Lillard hit a deep 3-pointer with 13.7 seconds left to give the Portland Trail Blazers a hard-fought 108-106 victory over Golden State on Wednesday night. “Now is the time where I've got to force it, I've got to create the opportunity, even if it's a tough one,” Lillard said about his thinking as the clock ticked down. “Whatever happens I've got to put my foot on the gas a little bit more, and try to make something happen.” Lillard and Carmelo Anthony each had 22 points for the Blazers, who kept it close most of the way after the Warriors jumped out to an early lead. Stephen Curry led the Warriors with 35 points. His 3-pointer gave Golden State a 101-96 lead with 3:57 remaining. Lillard, stifled by the Warriors through the first three quarters, made a 3 that tied it 103-all before Draymond Green's 3 put Golden State in front with 1:43 to go. Lillard made free throws to get Portland within a point, then hit a 29-footer to give the Blazers a 108-106 lead with 13.7 seconds left. He took a charge from Green, which prompted an unsuccessful challenge by Golden State, and Portland won its second straight after a four-game losing streak. “He hit a huge shot, a deep shot,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “That’s what he does. That’s the kind of player he is. Even on a bad night he can get going at any time, so that’s why you have to stay alert the entire 48 (minutes).” The Warriors were without Kelly Oubre Jr. because of a sprained wrist. Oubre, averaging 15.5 points and 5.9 rebounds per game, was injured in practice Tuesday. Kent Bazemore made his first start of the season in Oubre's place. All eyes were on the matchup between Lillard and Curry, who are among the NBA's top scorers. Lillard went into the game ranked third in the league with 29.6 points per game, just ahead of Curry at 29.5. Washington guard Bradley Beal tops the list with 32.9. “He's a super competitor and never thinks he's out of a game, and he's always willing to put himself on the line to make the play, at either end,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said about Lillard. “I think those last two plays speaks volumes for the type of player that he is.” The Warriors took a 15-2 lead on Green's layup. Portland chipped away, tying the game at 26 before the end of the opening quarter on Rodney Hood's 3-pointer. Curry had 16 points in the period and 23 for the half. Hood's floater gave Portland a 30-29 lead early in the second quarter, but the Blazers were unable to pull away and Golden State led 56-55 at halftime. The teams battled for the lead the rest of the way. Anfernee Simons gave Portland an 87-84 lead with a 3-pointer early in the final quarter. The game got heated at times down the stretch, with Portland's Gary Trent Jr. and Juan Toscano-Anderson exchanging words. TIP-INS Warriors: Rookie second-round draft pick G Nico Mannion along with G Jordan Poole arrived in Portland a day ahead of the team after being promoted from the G League Santa Cruz Warriors and went through their COVID-19 testing protocols to join the team, participating in Wednesday’s morning shootaround. “Those guys are ready to hoop, you guys been watching them?” second-year guard Mychal Mulder asked earlier in the day. Trail Blazers: It was the third and final meeting between the teams this season. They split the previous two, with Portland winning the first and the Warriors winning the second — powered by Curry's 62 points. ... The game could have tiebreaker consequences down the line in the tight Western Conference standings. Portland is 9-9 against West opponents. THE CHARGE Kerr said he challenged the charge on Green, believing it was a block. “It looked like a block to me. I thought he was sliding underneath, but the referees got a look at it and made the call,” he said.","401267710"
"Montrezl Harrell misses a putback layup for the Lakers with seconds remaining down by one to the Kings. (1:04) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Buddy Hield shook off a sore ankle to score 29 points and the Sacramento Kings beat the short-handed Los Angeles Lakers 123-120 on Wednesday night. Hield’s status for the game was in doubt because of a sprained right ankle, but he decided to play through it and helped the Kings win for just the second time in the past 12 games. “We've been in a bad funk,” Hield said. “If I'm hurt, I can play through that. I don't like taking games off and I hate losing.” They took advantage of a banged-up Lakers team missing LeBron James and Anthony Davis to bounce back from Sunday’s late-game collapse against Charlotte when they missed five foul shots in the final 69 seconds to blow an eight-point lead. “We needed that win,” guard Cory Joseph said. “After last game with the mental collapse we had at the end of the game, I felt like we did a good job of the whole 48 minutes staying mentally locked in.” Sacramento held on at the end to win this one with Harrison Barnes’ layup giving the Kings a 121-120 lead with 30.1 seconds remaining after De’Aaron Fox had just fouled out. Dennis Schröder and Montrezl Harrell then both missed short shots at the other end and Sacramento got the ball back with 3.0 seconds to play. Barnes made two free throws and Kyle Kuzma's desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer was off target to seal the win for the Kings. “Guys are hurt. They’re hurting,” coach Frank Vogel said. “They competed their tails off and fought hard enough to get the win. ... Our guys wanted to win this game very badly and are disappointed.” Fox finished with 23 points and Barnes had 20 for Sacramento. Schröder scored 28 to lead Los Angeles, Harrell added 26 and Kuzma scored 25. But it wasn’t enough for the Lakers, who lost for the sixth time in eight games to fall into a tie for third place in the Western Conference. “The offense wasn't really the issue,” Kuzma said. “It was the defense. Throughout the game we had a few mental lapses. ... We just didn't stop them. Offensively, it wasn’t an issue.” NO REPLAY Replays showed Hield had a foot on the line on a 3-pointer in the second quarter, but the play never got overturned. Vogel said the officials told him that by the time the play was reviewed it was determined to be too long after the play to change the call. INJURY REPORT James missed his first game of the season for the Lakers with a sore left ankle. James is still expected to play in the All-Star Game Sunday but the Lakers decided to give him a day off. “He’s pretty banged up right now, so we took this opportunity to keep him home for this game,” Vogel said. The Lakers were also missing Davis (right calf strain), Marc Gasol (health and safety protocols) and Alex Caruso (neck spasms). The Kings were also short-handed with rookie Tyrese Haliburton missing his second straight game with an injured left calf. Haliburton is expected to miss one more game before returning after the break. TIP-INS Lakers: Los Angeles made 12 of its first 18 shots. ... Harrell was called for a technical foul after yelling “And 1!” after scoring a basket early in the second quarter. Kings: Hield scored eight straight points in a span of 50 seconds in the second quarter to help the Kings erase a 14-point first-quarter deficit to take a 45-43 lead.","401267711"
"Jayson Tatum splits the defense with a behind-the-back dribble and then throws down a thunderous one-handed jam. (0:26) BOSTON -- — Jayson Tatum had 27 points and 12 rebounds and the Boston Celtics won their fourth straight game, outlasting the short-handed Toronto Raptors 132-125 on Thursday night. Jaylen Brown added 21 points and seven rebounds, and Kemba Walker finished with 15 points. Coach Brad Stevens recently challenged his players to finish the final four games before the All-Star break strong after a stretch in which the Celtics lost nine of 14. He said he likes how they've responded, though he said they also have room to grow. “Any of these four games could have gone the other way,"" Stevens said. ""We have a lot to improve on if we want to be the kind of team we want to be.” Part of that, Brown said, will be continuing to find different ways to win games, which has been a challenge at times. “I think we’re learning and growing as the season goes on,"" Brown said. ""I think we’ve definitely made improvement in different categories and that’s that it's all about.” Toronto, which played without starters Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby, along with Malachi Flynn and Patrick McCaw as they remained in the health and safety protocols, has lost four of five. Coach Nick Nurse and several members of his staff were also in the protocols, leaving the coaching duties to assistant Sergio Scariolo. The Raptors hit 21 3-pointers and led early before being outscored 35-22 in the third quarter. Chris Boucher led Toronto with 30 points. Norman Powell finished with 25 points and Terence Davis added 22. Despite the loss, Powell liked the progress the team made following Wednesday's lopsided loss to Detroit. “We gave ourselves a chance to win down the stretch,” Powell said. “We've got to continue to play like that no matter who's in and out of the lineup.” Boston's lead grew as high as 121-109 in the fourth before a 10-1 run by Toronto cut it to 122-119. But a free throw by Brown, step-back jumper by Tatum and runner by Jeff Teague gave Boston back a cushion and it was able to close it out at the line. Being short-handed didn’t stop the Raptors from starting fast. They got 21 first-half points from Powell and connected on 11 3-pointers to take a 70-66 lead into halftime. The Celtics had eight 3s and shot 58% (23 of 40) from the field in the opening 24 minutes. They also had nine turnovers, leading to 10 Toronto points. Boston trailed by as many as nine before outscoring Toronto 19-14 to end the half. The run included some nice defensive plays, including a block by Robert Williams on Kyle Lowry that started a fast break and ended with Williams on the receiving end of an alley-oop from Walker. TIP-INS Raptors: Had 36 assists on 45 made field goals. ... Had 55 bench points. ... Had six 3-pointers in the first quarter. … Rookie Jalen Harris rejoined the team’s G-League affiliate, Raptors 905, to participate in the playoffs. Celtics: Outscored the Raptors 54-44 in the paint. … Finished with 16 turnovers. … Had six turnovers in the first quarter.

"Jamal Murray comes up with a steal and finishes at the other end with a one-handed dunk. (0:28) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Denver forward Michael Porter Jr. struggled at the start of the the Nuggets' recent 10-game stretch. He finished it with a flurry. Porter had 24 points and 11 rebounds Thursday night, outshining Nikola Jokic, in leading the Denver Nuggets past Indiana 113-103. “Every great player goes through stretches like this,” Porter said. “But I knew I would get out of it and I couldn’t wait to have that one big game. Then once you get it, it just starts flowing.” Porter has five double-doubles in the last six games, a stark contrast from an 0 for 8 performance Feb. 16, the first of eight road games in a 10-game stretch. But with Porter rolling and Jokic playing at his usual All-Star level, the Nuggets are rolling. They’ve won four straight road games for the first time since 2011-12. And everyone has a part. While Jokic had 20 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists, Jamal Murray finished with 23 points, his 12th straight with 22 or more. “We’ve been a team that thrives in adversity,” coach Michael Malone said. “We’re very resilient, a ton of grit and we never find excuses. We find solutions.” The Pacers need to find some fixes, too, after losing for the fifth time in six games and their fifth straight at home. Indiana was led by Myles Turner's 22 points and a season-high tying 12 rebounds. Domantas Sabonis had his fourth triple-double of the season with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Denver made it look relatively easy, too. It took control early in the second quarter then pulled out to a 66-54 lead early in the third. But after the Pacers tied the score at 68, Denver outscored Indiana 14-6 over the final 5 1/2 minutes of the third and sealed the victory with a 12-0 spurt midway through the fourth. “They came out and made shots,"" Sabonis said. “They were well prepared and they made shots."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Will Barton had 16 points and six rebounds. ... Denver had 19 turnovers but shot 58.4% from the field and was 12 of 28 on 3s. ...

This is the latest in the season the Pacers have been under .500 since going 39-40 in 2016-17. PULLING THROUGH The Nuggets won despite being severely short-handed Thursday. Three players — guards Facundo Campazzo, R.J. Hampton and Markus Howard — all missed the game because of the COVID-19 protocols. Forwards Paul Millsap (sprained left knee) and JaMychal Green (sprained left shoulder) also sat out, along with with guard Gary Harris (strained left abductor muscle). Harris played high school basketball at nearby Hamilton Southeastern and was the state's 2012 Mr. Basketball Award winner. INJURY UPDATE Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said recently acquired forward Caris LeVert participated in Tuesday's light workout and has been doing one-on-one work at practice. LeVert was acquired in a January trade from Houston but has not played since the deal after having a cancerous growth removed from his kidney. “He’s been back in contact for a few days now,"" Bjorkgren said. “That practice (Tuesday) wasn’t a lot of competing and physicality, but he was in everything we did and he was in one-on-one.

"Ivica Zubac gets the entry pass and goes up strong to finish a dunk right over Davis Bertans in the paint. (0:21) WASHINGTON -- — Bradley Beal scored 33 points and the Washington Wizards pushed ahead with a late run to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 119-117 after All-Star Paul George was a late scratch Thursday night. Russell Westbrook had 27 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds while Moe Wagner added 12 points as the Wizards snapped a two-game skid. Washington won eight of 11 heading into the All-Star break to move into the fringes of contention in the bunched Eastern Conference. Beal, an All-Star and the NBA’s leading scorer, was 9 of 23 from the field but made 14 of his 15 free throws. Westbrook, who is shooting a career-worst 60% from the foul line, missed a few late to keep the Clippers in the game until the end. He made 7 of 15 overall. “I still trust him,” coach Scott Brooks said. “He’s working on it. We’re going to get it back. He does so many great things for us.” Kawhi Leonard scored 22 points, Patrick Beverley had 17 and Ivica Zubac had 13 points and 13 rebounds. The Clippers have lost six of nine heading into the break but are still one of the top teams in the West. George was listed as a starter but was replaced moments before tipoff due to dizziness. Reggie Jackson, who started on Tuesday in Boston for Leonard, finished with 12 points. It was the second consecutive game in which the Clippers had a late scratch from an All-Star. Leonard sat out Tuesday’s loss in Boston with back spasms. George, who scored 32 points in 28 minutes on Tuesday, has missed ten previous games this season, including one for right ankle soreness, two for health and safety protocols, and seven for right toe bone edema. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said he found about George right before the game. Lue felt the turning point was on both sides of halftime as the Clippers went from leading 61-45 with 1:28 left in the second quarter to trailing 66-63 with 8:14 remaining in the third. “Closing the second quarter was the biggest thing,” Lue said about a game that featured 19 lead changes and nine ties. The Clippers led 106-102 after two free throws by Lou Williams with 4:36 left. Davis Bertans and Wagner made back-to-back 3-pointers, Beal made a foul-line jumper and Bertans added two free throws during a 11-0 run that gave Washington a 113-106 lead. Bertans finished with 11 points. TIP-INS Clippers: F Marcus Morris was out with a concussion that he suffered in Tuesday at Boston. Morris had previously missed eight games this season with other issues. ... Luke Kennard picked up a technical foul in the second quarter. Wizards: Westbrook moved past Walt Bellamy into 42nd place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list with a jumper in the second quarter. Westbrook now has 20,959 points. SEAL THE DEAL The stat sheet won't reflect a game-sealing play by Westbrook. With Washington up 119-117 with 7 seconds left, Rui Hachimura missed a free throw, but Westbrook timed his run outside the 3-point line perfectly and tipped the ball to Beal, who held on as time expired. Had he been credited with the rebound, Westbrook would have finished with his 11th triple-double of the season. CLIPPER GOALS “Just trying to get wins, pretty much,” Leonard said about the team's goals for the second half. “Get some continuity, some chemistry, execution, trying to get these wins so we’ve got some carryover into the playoffs.” DESTINATIONS KNOWN All-Star team captains LeBron James and Kevin Durant drafted their squads during the game. Beal and Leonard will start for Team Durant while George will suit up for Team LeBron in Atlanta on Sunday.","401267714"
"Ja Morant puts the Grizzlies up momentarily with a layup, but Jrue Holiday responds with the go-ahead basket. (0:39) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — With seconds remaining, no timeouts and down a point, the Milwaukee Bucks knew they had to push the pace. Jrue Holiday took care of the rest. Holiday’s 11-foot baseline jumper with two seconds remaining gave the Bucks a 112-111 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday night in a game where the teams exchanged leads five times in the final minute. “I was the first one down the court, so … it was pretty much me and (Grizzlies forward) Dillon Brooks,” Holiday said. “I just took the opportunity. I thought I made a nice play and knocked down the shot.” Memphis rookie Desmond Bane had a final chance for the Grizzlies, but his 3-pointer hit the front of the rim, giving the Bucks their sixth victory in seven games. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 26 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and Khris Middleton added 22 points and 10 rebounds. Holiday and Pat Connaughton finished with 15 points each, both connecting on key baskets in the final minute. Ja Morant led Memphis with 35 points, 28 of them in the second half. Brooks finished with 23 points, and Jonas Valanciunas had 13 points and 12 rebounds. “I thought our guys were phenomenal. Offensive execution, defensive execution,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “A couple of plays didn’t go for us, but I thought it was a great experience.” A 3-pointer from Connaughton – the only one of the second half for Milwaukee -- gave the Bucks a 108-107 lead with 39 seconds. With 25.1 seconds left, Brooks was given a layup for Memphis after Antetokounmpo was called for goal tending, giving Memphis a 109-108 lead with 25.1 second remaining. Middleton’s two free throws gave the lead back to Milwaukee, but Morant answered on a drive with 7.3 seconds left, setting the stage for Holiday’s winner from the left baseline 5 seconds later. “He went into attack, got to a great spot and a great look. Huge shot,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said about Holiday’s shot. “I think he’s a big-time player. A pestering Milwaukee defense caused shooting problems for Memphis in the first quarter as the Grizzlies stayed below 25% from the floor. A 15-point Bucks lead in the quarter, extended to 18 in the second as Milwaukee continued shooting at a better-than-50% clip. Meanwhile, Valanciunas and Morant, Memphis’ leading scorers were a combined 1 of 13 to start the game. Memphis was able to pick up the shooting pace enough to bring it to single-digit deficit before the Bucks carried a 61-51 lead at the break. Still, despite the shooting woes, Memphis made a third-quarter run to pull even at 84 heading into the fourth quarter. Morant got untracked to score 16 in the period. “I feel like we’ve got a lot of guys that’s capable of doing a lot on the floor,” Morant said. “I thought we showed our hustle, our dog, our fight.” TIP-INS Bucks: Final contest of a seven-game stretch against the Western Conference. Milwaukee finishes 6-1 in the run. … With a dunk near the 4-minute mark of the first quarter, Antetokounmpo passed Sidney Moncrief (11,594) for third place on Milwaukee’s career scoring list. Grizzlies: The one-point margin ended a stretch of 18 straight games where Memphis games were decided by at least nine points. That matched the longest in NBA history. …Grayson Allen missed his third game under concussion protocol. … Morant started the game 0 for 8, missing his first six shots from beyond the arc.

Do I get something?” he asked. “Do I have to wear the suit now?” Then he added: “It’s a compliment.” NICKNAME FOR MORANT Antetokounmpo said if Morant doesn’t have a nickname yet, he’s got one for the second-year guard. “He’s the Matrix.

"While being heavily guarded by Patty Mills, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander somehow manages to drain a 3-pointer from the wing. (0:21) SAN ANTONIO -- — Oklahoma City and San Antonio are fighting fatigue and injuries, but the Thunder found a way to win a battle of attrition heading into the All-Star break. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 33 points and Oklahoma City rallied in the second half to beat San Antonio 107-102 on Thursday night and snap a two-game losing streak. “Our guys did a heck of a job hanging in there,” Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. “The thing that stood out to me was just our resiliency. We were down 11 at halftime. It’s easy to pack it in. You have a break two quarters away but our guys buckled down and continued to play.” Mike Muscala added 18 points, and Luguentz Dort had 15 for the Thunder. San Antonio veteran DeMar DeRozan had 20 points, Trey Lyles added 15 points and 10 rebounds and Dejounte Murray had 14 points. The Spurs had won three of five entering the game. San Antonio took an 61-50 lead at the half while playing their first game before a sizeable crowd of just over 1,000 fans. Any jolt the team may have received from those fans faded at halftime. The Thunder outscored the Spurs 57-41 in the second half. “I think the start of the third quarter was important,” Muscala said. “I thought the first unit did a great job coming out of the gate and set the tone.” Gilgeous-Alexander scored 20 points in the second half, shooting 7 for 10 to rally Oklahoma City to just its fourth win in 10 games. San Antonio had 19 turnovers, which led to 26 points. “No excuses when it comes to them,” Spurs guard Patty Mills said. “They’re all mental turnovers. Could be a lack of execution and just mental. We’ve got to be able to be strong with the ball and execute.” After committing just eight turnovers in a 119-93 victory over New York, San Antonio had seven in the third quarter alone against Oklahoma. “We’re not a team that gives up 26 points on turnovers,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “It’s a clear indication of being sloppy, of being tired. Its’ going to happen.” San Antonio and Oklahoma City were hobbled heading into the final game before the All-Star break for both teams. San Antonio was without LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, Derrick White and Devin Vassell. Gay, White and Vassell have not played since Feb. 14 due to the league’s health and safety protocols involving those who have contracted or been in contact with COVID-19. Aldridge missed his second straight game with a stomach ailment. Oklahoma City forward Al Horford sat out the second night of a back-to-back and three others were injured, including George Hill.

"Josh Hart doesn't even hit the backboard as he drains the half-court buzzer-beater at the end of the third quarter. (0:19) NEW ORLEANS -- — Jimmy Butler had 29 points and nine assists, and the Miami Heat took advantage of Zion Williamson's absence to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 103-93 on Thursday night. With a repertoire of strong inside moves and accurate mid-range shooting, Butler made 10 of 14 shots and eight of nine free throws to help the Heat keep the Pelicans at bay. Butler added a late step-back 3 to give him 10 points during an 11-2 run that put Miami up 98-87 with 2:50 to go. “You can see we trust him, we want him to have the ball in those moments and he always comes through,” Heat guard Goran Dragic said. “It's really awesome to watch him, what he's able to do. He can manipulate the game, get to the free throw line, make shots.” Kelly Olynyk hit his first four 3-point shots and finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds. “He's been taking his shots aggressively and that's what you want your shooters to do,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “He's a great shooter. He really does create some spacing for us.” Dragic scored nine of his 13 points in the second half for Miami. Brandon Ingram scored 17 points and Steven Adams scored 15 for New Orleans. Nickeil Alexander-Walker scored 13 and Josh Hart 12 for the Pelicans, who've lost two straight. “The majority of our 3s were pretty good looks that we didn't make,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “Guys played well and we just had trouble getting the ball in the basket.” Hart, normally a reserve, was inserted in the starting lineup after Williamson was scratched because of a toe injury. The Pelicans struggled mightily to make shots during the first three quarters and Miami built a lead as large as 17, but the Heat was unable to put New Orleans away in the second half. When Hart made a half-court shot as the horn sounded to signal the end of the third period, the Heat's lead was just 77-70. Alexander-Walker then pulled the Pelicans to 77-73 with a 3 to open the fourth quarter, which was largely competitive until Butler began asserting himself more in the final five minutes. Butler said his mentality at that point was “just win at all cost, get some stops, score some buckets and continue to make the right plays.” TIP-INS Heat: Andre Iguodala scored 10 points, highlighted by a late driving dunk that virtually sealed the victory. ... Heat coach Spoelstra is now 16-17 against Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy, his longtime friend and mentor. ... This is the fourth time in the last seven seasons that the Heat haven’t been better than .500 at the All-Star break. But during Spoelstra’s 12-year tenure, Miami has won 62% of its games after the break. Only San Antonio and Houston have better post-break records in the Spoelstra era. ... Miami shot 49.3% (36 of 73) but missed 20 of 30 3-point shots. Pelicans: In addition to being without Williamson, New Orleans also played without JJ Redick, who was bothered by a sore right heel. ... The Pelicans shot just 39.8% (33 of 83) and missed 33 of 43 3-point shots. ... Rookie Kira Lewis Jr. scored 11 points in 17 minutes off the bench. ... Lonzo Ball scored 10 but missed nine of 11 shots from deep. WILLIAMSON'S INJURY Van Gundy said Williamson's toe injury wasn't something new, but rather something he had been playing through until finally sitting out against Miami. “I just know that he was hurting. I know that he's had it for a while. I know it was getting worse,” Van Gundy said. “As far as how close he was to playing or anything else, I don't really have any idea.” It remains unclear whether the injury will affect Williamson's availability to play in Sunday's All-Star Game, for which Williamson was selected as a reserve. He was picked to play for Team Durant.","401267717"
"Buddy Hield receives a warning from NBA for this flop. (0:33) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Damian Lillard had 44 points, including 10 straight at a key moment down the stretch, to give the Portland Trail Blazers a 123-119 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Thursday night. Enes Kanter added 22 points and 21 rebounds for the Blazers, who have won three straight and are 21-14 heading into the All-Star break. It's the Blazers' best start through 35 games since 2015. Lillard said the difference in the first half was that the team never got down after CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic were injured. “When CJ and Nurk went down, we just said `Let's not feel sorry for ourselves. Let's show up and let's get the job done. Let's come together, let's lean on each other, count on each other and find a way to get it done.' And we did that,"" Lillard said.

Sacramento wasn't quite done, pulling within 119-118 on a 3-pointer with 6.6 seconds left. After Gary Trent Jr. made two free throws for the Blazers, Fox hit one then appeared to miss the second intentionally. After a review over whether the ball hit the rim, Portland got the ball back with 3.7 seconds left and Lillard was fouled to close it out. Lillard finished with eight 3-pointers. “On the whole it was a really really difficult game to play because of their style of play, they push the ball, they get to the paint,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “We had trouble rebounding the ball. In some ways, it was a little bit like our previous game where we just kind of hung around, made some plays at the end.” Both teams were also playing the second of a back-to-back heading into the All-Star break. The Kings had won two of their last three games after a nine-game losing streak. Sacramento was still without reigning NBA rookie of the month Tyrese Haliburton, who missed his fourth game with a calf injury. “We don’t want to take any moral victories. We wanted to win tonight and we didn’t,"" said Harrison Barnes, who finished with 17 points. "" Some calls didn't go our way, some shots didn't go our way.” Nemanja Bjelica's 3-pointer gave the Kings an early 21-16 lead. Lillard's 3 late in the opening quarter put Portland up 28-27, and the All-Star had 15 points by the end of the period. “Dame's a great player. He had it going there,” Barnes said. “We tried to throw a bunch of different coverages at him but we couldn’t touch him with the way the whistle was going tonight. Dame is gonna score but you’ve got to limit the rest of the team.” TIP INS Kings: Hield was questionable for Sacramento with a right ankle sprain but he started. He had 29 points against the Lakers on Wednesday. Trail Blazers: The game was delayed for a time in the second quarter when the shot clocks at the Moda Center went out. ... Portland has won five straight against the Kings. HELP ON THE WAY The Trail Blazers announced that McCollum, who has been out with a left foot fracture, has been cleared for contact practice. McCollum has been out since Jan. 16 when he injured his foot in a game against Atlanta. McCollum, who was averaging 26.7 points before he was hurt, will be key to Portland's playoff push. The Blazers also said Nurkic continues to rehab his right wrist fracture and will be evaluated next week.","401267718"
"Damian Lillard drives baseline by Russell Westbrook and rises up for a big dunk on Rui Hachimura. (0:31) WASHINGTON -- — Damian Lillard scored 32 points, Gary Trent Jr. added 26 while hitting seven 3-pointers and the short-handed Portland Trail Blazers held on for a 132-121 victory over the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. Enes Kanter had 14 points and 15 rebounds for Portland, which improved to 2-2 on its six-game road trip. Carmelo Anthony had 21 points off the bench and Robert Covington added 19 for the Blazers, who have been without starters CJ McCollum (foot), Jusuf Nurkic (wrist) and Derrick Jones Jr. (foot) for at least three games each. Interim starter Nassir Little was also out Tuesday with a sprained left knee, and even Lillard indicated afterward he was dealing with an abdominal ailment. “We've been having guys dropping left and right, dealing with a lot,"" Lillard said. ""And I've been dealing with some nagging things myself, where coming into tonight, I felt like I could barely move out there to start the game. And I was even thinking, ‘Should I have sat last night? Or sat tonight?’ ""I was pushing and fighting that the whole game, because I knew how important this one was for our season."" Russell Westbrook had a triple-double with 17 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for Washington, the only NBA team without five victories this season. Bradley Beal scored 37 points and Rui Hachimura added 24 for the Wizards, who were attempting to record consecutive wins for just the second time. But the Blazers leaped to an early 26-7 lead with an 18-0 run, even as Lillard started slowly. Trent made two 3-pointers during the spurt, and Rodney Hood and Covington each added one. “We were late to everything,” Beal said of Washington's defense. “We were late on our defensive rotations. Offensively we weren’t playing fast enough or playing hard enough. They were just kicking our (butts). They got their butts kicked last night by Milwaukee and they came in tonight with a different mindset out of the gate.” Lillard finally scored his first points on a baseline jumper with 3:45 during a first quarter that ended with Portland holding a 40-23 advantage. Washington got no closer than six until the fourth, when Beal, Hachimura, Davis Bertans and Deni Avdija all hit 3-pointers during a 14-6 run to close it to 122-118 remaining. Bertans missed an open baseline 3 on Washington’s next possession, and Trent sank one from nearly the identical spot on the other end before Lillard followed with a dunk that stretched the lead to nine with 2:12 left. “We needed everybody tonight, and so many guys stepped up,” Covington said. “That was an overall great team win.” TIP-INS Blazers: Coach Terry Stotts said Little suffered his injury in the fourth quarter of Monday's loss in Milwaukee. ... Hood made his third start in Little's place. ... Covington had nine rebounds and Lillard had eight assists.

C Thomas Bryant had “successful” surgery on his partially torn left ACL earlier Tuesday, said coach Scott Brooks. Bryant suffered injury on Jan. 9 against Miami. MELO KEEPS CLIMBING With his performance, Anthony moved into 13th place on the NBA all-time scoring list with 26,675 points, passing Dominique Wilkins (26,668 points). ""I actually found out that I passed somebody through one of the gentlemen at the scorers' table,"" Anthony said. “I was checking into the game, and he said something like, ‘congratulations.’ I said ‘Thank you,’ first. And then I went back and said, ‘Congratulations for what?’” BEAL IN MJ TERRITORY Beal's performance marked his 16th consecutive game with 25 points or more to begin the season, tying Michael Jordan's NBA record.","401282283"
"Bradley Beal takes flight for a one-handed slam. (0:20) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Terry Rozier has quickly put an ankle injury behind him. Rozier looked as fast and aggressive as he has all season scoring 26 points behind five 3-pointers, while Gordon Hayward added 25 points as the Charlotte Hornets routed the Washington Wizards 119-97 on Sunday. LaMelo Ball followed up a career-best 34-point effort against the Utah Jazz with another strong game, finishing with 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists as the Hornets handed the Wizards their seventh loss in the last nine games. With Devonte Graham out with a groin injury, Rozier was asked to play more point guard against the Wizards than he has all season, and the sixth-year NBA veteran responded to the challenge. “It felt good being on the ball a lot today,” said Rozier, who had four assists in his second game back since suffering a right ankle sprain. “I will do whatever my coaches ask me to do.” Coach James Borrego said Rozier has had a great season regardless of where he has played, which he said is a reflection of his versatility and how hard he worked this past offseason. “He came back better, came back more aggressive,"" Borrego said. “I like him offensively. He’s moving the ball and sharing the ball. His shot-making was big today. I mean, he’s really matured in his play-making ability.” Bradley Beal, the NBA’s leading scorer coming in at 33.3 points per game, led Washington with 31 points on 11-for-22 shooting after being held to seven points on 1 of 14 from the field by the Heat in his last game. Russell Westbrook had 12 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists, falling short of his sixth triple-double of the season. Beal expressed frustration after the Wizards were blown out again after losing 122-95 to Miami on Friday night. “We have to have some pride, some dog (in us),"" Beal said. ""We kind of let teams walk over us. ... We got our butts kicked twice in a row and that is never appealing to anybody."" Beal said it us up to each player to improve their game. “It's tough because I can't do it for guys, I can only do it for myself,” Beal said. Ball started strong against the Wizards, helping the Hornets build a 69-52 halftime and later increased the lead to 29 entering the fourth quarter as Rozier and Hayward got hot in the second half. Ball had averaged 15.9 points and 5.7 assists over the Hornets’ past 10 games. While there have been criticisms about Ball's shooting form, he's showing that he can be effective and is 14 of 28 on 3s over the last five games. TIP-INS Wizards: Charlotte’s previous four opponents averaged 18 3-pointers per game while shooting 44% from beyond the arc. But the Wizards were limited to 9 of 40 on 3s. ... Robin Lopez had 14 points off the bench. ... Bench outscored Charlotte 43-30. Hornets: P.J. Washington returned to the starting lineup after missing two games with a foot injury and had three points on 1-of-7 shooting. ... Miles Bridges had 11 points and 14 rebounds. As a team, the Hornets had 59 rebounds. “I just tried to bring more energy,” Bridges said. WIZARDS DEFENSE Coach Scott Brooks said that while he needs to do a better job, it's also up to players to take pride in individual defense. “Teams are attacking players and we have to step up and take the challenge and make them miss shots and not get beat by one or two-dribble drives and those are the things that are bothering us right now,” Brooks said.","401282286"
"Kemba Walker says he needs to do a better job at preparing his teammates after the last two disappointing losses. (0:56) WASHINGTON -- — Bradley Beal returned from a rare night off to score 35 points, Russell Westbrook was a rebound short of a triple-double, and the Washington Wizards beat the Boston Celtics 104-91 on Sunday. Beal, the NBA’s leading scorer who sat out Friday night’s loss to the New York Knicks, appeared rejuvenated as he hit 10 of 18 from the field, converted four 3-pointers and made all 11 of his free throws. “It was a mental unwind, it was a physical unwind,” Beal said. “My body was a little beat up. It’s always good to be able to get away from the game for a minute. “I put so much pressure on myself to do well, try to be the best I can possibly be, try to come out to win every game. I just needed a little break. You can’t do everything by yourself.” Westbrook had 13 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds. Rui Hachimura added 15 points for Washington. Kemba Walker and Jalen Brown each scored 25 points for Boston, which has lost 10 of 16. Brown conceded that things aren’t going well, and that the Celtics could be bottoming out. “It could be. It’s up the mentality of everybody. You let it be rock-bottom mentality and that’s what it’s going to be,” Brown said. “Today we weren’t very good.” The Wizards, who led except for the early moments, ran off 11 straight points to take a 77-53 lead midway through the third quarter. This was the first time this season Washington held an opponent to fewer than 100 points. Jayson Tatum, who entered the game averaging 26.6 points, was held to a season-low six points. TIP-INS Celtics: Coach Brad Stevens said he’s often under internal pressure to play Tatum and Brown even more than he does. “Sometimes my 15-year-old asks me when I get home, ‘Why isn’t Tatum in here? Why isn’t Brown in here?’ Because they have to sit sometimes. You can’t play those guys 48 minutes a game every single night,” Stevens said. ... G Marcus Smart missed his eighth straight game with a torn right calf. ... Walker’s 25 points were a season high. Wizards: G Ish Smith was out with a strained right quadriceps. He’ll also miss Monday’s game, coach Scott Brooks said. ... F Anthony Gill was held out with a stomach virus. ... C Moe Wagner started for the first time this season. He scored 11 points. MOVING ON Beal said he wasn’t thinking about longtime Wizards guard John Wall’s return on Monday. Wall was traded to the Houston Rockets for Westbrook before the season, and the longtime fan favorite will return to an empty arena. Washington lost 107-88 at Houston on Jan. 26. “It’s the Wizards versus Houston, we’re past that,” Beal said. “I think it would be different for fans to be in the building, for them to be able to show their love for John.” STEVENS’ INTERNAL CLOCK Stevens would normally be getting ready for the All-Star break. Instead, he’s in the midst of his busiest month of the season. The Celtics are playing 16 games in 28 days, including four back-to-backs. “My body clock is not used to this, but it has nothing to do with the break (not) being right now because we started a lot later,” Stevens said. “The normal clock, the normal management of the season, all that stuff is way out of whack.”","401282752"
"Saddiq Bey is completely forgotten about in the corner as he drains a long 3-pointer to tie the game. (0:19) DETROIT -- — Mason Plumlee was closing in on his first career triple-double. He realizes individual stats can be a distraction during a game, but this was a special circumstance. “I think you know when you have nine of something,” he said. ""I was close enough, I had to tune in.” Plumlee finished with 17 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Detroit Pistons spoiled Stan Van Gundy’s return to Motown, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 123-112 on Sunday night. Plumlee's final rebound came with about 2:30 remaining, sealing his milestone, and the Pistons have now won back-to-back games for the first time this season. Van Gundy was the coach and president of basketball operations for the Pistons from 2014-18. He’s coaching the Pelicans now, and Detroit became the latest team to blitz New Orleans from 3-point range. “We did not defend well enough or play hard enough at the defensive end to deserve to win,” Van Gundy said. The Pistons had six players with at least 15 points, and Detroit went 17 of 35 from beyond the arc — 13 of 21 during the final three quarters. Josh Jackson led Detroit with 21 points, and Svi Mykhailiuk added 18. The Pelicans also lost their previous two games, allowing 25 3-pointers in each of those. Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram scored 26 points each for the Pelicans, but New Orleans couldn't hold on after an impressive start. The Pelicans shot 79% from the field in a 40-point first quarter. The Pelicans led by 10 after the first, but they scored just 22 points in the second and trailed by two at halftime. Detroit was up 97-89 after three. “Offensively, we weren't making shots, and I think it trickled down to the defense a little bit,"" Ingram said. ""Whenever they had momentum, they kept pushing.” Mykhailiuk made a couple 3s to give the Pistons a 108-97 lead in the fourth. Detroit has won three of four. “You just feel it coming together — the trust, the belief in the system,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. “We still have work to do to get better.” Van Gundy indicated it might be time to consider altering his rotation, but he doesn't seem sure who he can turn to for defensive improvement. “I don’t know how many of our guys really have a defensive mentality,"" he said. Plumlee, who missed the previous two games with elbow issues, became the first Pistons center with a triple-double since Greg Monroe on Nov. 7, 2012. At 30 years, 346 days old, Plumlee was the oldest center to achieve his first triple-double since Patrick Ewing did it at 33 years, 258 days old in 1996, according to STATS. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans allowed 129 and 143 points in its previous two games. ... The Pelicans shot 35% for the final three quarters. Pistons: Plumlee became the fourth Pistons center with a triple-double since 1965, joining Monroe, Ben Wallace and Bob Lanier. ... Delon Wright scored 17 points, Saddiq Bey added 16 and Jerami Grant contributed 15. BACK IN TOWN Van Gundy, who still has family in Michigan, had plenty of nice things to say about the area before the game. “We loved Detroit — loved the time living here,"" he said. ""Regrets, from my end, that we didn’t win enough games and didn’t get the job done that we were hired to do. You feel bad about that, because not only loving the area, but I had great respect for our ownership group.” UNSELFISH The Pistons had 34 assists on 45 made field goals.

"Ja Morant throws a lob pass to Brandon Clarke for the alley-oop finish for Memphis. (0:18) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Grayson Allen and Jonas Valanciunas each scored 22 points and Ja Morant posted his first triple-double of the season as the Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 122-113 on Wednesday night. Six Memphis players scored in double figures. Kyle Anderson had 20 points, Dillon Brooks scored 17 points and Morant finished with 15 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists for the third triple-double in his career. “Ja makes the game easier for a lot of people when he’s aggressive, whether he’s scoring the ball or sharing it, setting us up with easy shots,” Anderson said. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 22 points in his return after missing four games with a left knee strain. Mike Muscala added 21 points, including 5-for-9 shooting from 3-point range. Darius Bazley finished with 18 points as Oklahoma City lost for the fifth time in six games. The game was close through three-plus quarters as neither team built the lead to double digits. But a 19-3 run by Memphis early in the fourth quarter lifted the Grizzlies to a 105-90 lead near the midway point of the frame. The Thunder chipped away but never really threatened the rest of the way. “The ball didn’t go in our favor. They got a couple of offensive rebounds. We didn’t make enough shots,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “Nights like that happen. … We just didn’t do enough defensively and offensively.” Both teams were playing the second night of a back-to-back after losing on Tuesday. The Thunder lost to Portland, and the Grizzlies by 31 to the New Orleans Pelicans. “It was very important that we came back with a win after a tough night (against New Orleans),” Anderson said. And the Thunder had another issue, being unable to get out of Oklahoma City after Tuesday’s loss. The team flew into Memphis on Wednesday afternoon, arriving about two hours before game time. While Oklahoma City players continually said there were no excuses, they were outscored in the fourth quarter 36-28 as Memphis built its lead. “We shot the ball well,” Muscala said. “I’m unhappy with how I rebounded. At the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth, too many second-chance opportunities that (the Grizzlies) had. … If you can’t get stops, it doesn’t mean much.” For the Grizzlies, the stretch run was much better than some recent losses in which they let games slip away in the fourth. “We’re just learning from the past,” Morant said. TIP-INS Thunder: F Al Horford, the Thunder’s second-leading scorer did not play (rest on the second night of the back-to-back). Isaiah Roby started his ninth game of the season in Horford’s absence and scored 10 points. … As for the late arrival, coach Mark Daigneault said: “We’re just kind of taking our direction from the league. There’s a lot of forces outside of our control right now.” Grizzlies: Memphis had allowed a limited number of fans to attend games over the last month. However, the team announced Wednesday that no fans would attend the game because of the inclement weather. … A block late in the fourth quarter gave Valanciunas 600 for his career. … The Grizzlies, who lead the league with 9.8 steals, had 12 in the first half and 14 in the game. … Anderson had five steals in the first half, tying his career best. JENKINS EJECTION With less than a minute left, Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins picked up his second technical of the game. The first came at the end of the third quarter. “Heck of a game. Wish I was there at the end to be there to celebrate,” Jenkins said. Meanwhile, forward Kyle Anderson who spent time with the San Antonio Spurs and saw some Gregg Popovich techs laughed when asked for a comparison. “I’m sure (Jenkins) will get some better ones in the future,” Anderson said. “He’ll definitely have some better ones. I like it though.”","401283399"
"Deandre Ayton goes underhand from half court and sinks the shot as he runs off to the locker room. (0:16) PHOENIX -- — Phoenix coach Monty Williams loves saying that he isn't going to get “happy on the farm” because his team's won a few games in a row. After the Suns won for the 16th time in their last 19 games on Thursday night by cruising past the Golden State Warriors 120-98, even he had to admit things are going pretty darn well in the desert. “When you’re winning games you feel it,"" Williams said. ""You know your team is doing what it takes to win games. We’ve won at home, we've won on the road.” Cameron Payne scored 17 points, Devin Booker added 16 and the Suns entered the All-Star break as one of the NBA's hottest teams. They're 16-3 since Jan. 28 and improved to 24-11 this season, which puts them second in the Western Conference. “I wouldn’t say for one second it’s been easy, but we’ve been relentless,"" Payne said. The Warriors were missing a big chunk of their usual production: Stephen Curry (rest), Draymond Green (ankle) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (wrist) were all out of the lineup. Because of that, they predictably struggled. “Everybody on our team is tired and needs a mental break, needs a physical break,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “We got guys who are excited to see family and go home and maybe stay home for a few days without having to practice. It will be good for the group.” Jordan Poole led all scorers with 26 points on 10-of-16 shooting, including 5 of 10 from 3-point range. But he didn't get much help: The Warriors shot just 44% and were outrebounded 52-39. Seven Suns players scored in double figures and Williams was able to rest the starters in the fourth quarter. Jae Crowder had 14 points and made 4 of 7 3-pointers. Deandre Ayton had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Payne added 10 assists. The Suns led by 20 points on the way to a 62-51 halftime lead and never trailed after the opening minutes. There were some sloppy moments with 16 turnovers, Williams found it hard to complain. “It’s one of those games you’re grateful to get,"" Williams said. ""You wish it was prettier. But at the end of the year you don’t have pretty wins or ugly wins.” BRUISED BOOKER Booker banged knees with Golden State’s Kent Bazemore during the first quarter, falling to the floor with a grimace on his face. He stayed in the game a few more minutes before checking out and walking back to the locker room. The two-time All-Star guard returned but didn’t have his usual burst. He finished just 6-of-20 shooting from the field. MANNION GETS START Warriors rookie guard Nico Mannion got the first start of his career against the Suns. The 6-foot-2 Mannion has plenty of Arizona ties. He played one season in college for the Arizona Wildcats before declaring for the NBA draft and was a star during his high school days in Phoenix. He finished with a career-high nine points and six assists in 31 minutes. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said pregame that Curry's rest against the Suns had been planned for about a week.

"Jamal Murray sets a regular-season career high with 50 points in the Nuggets' 120-103 win over the Cavaliers. (1:56) CLEVELAND -- — Not himself of late, Jamal Murray got a lecture from Nuggets coach Michael Malone about being more aggressive and not passing up open shots. He listened — and launched. Murray scored a career-high 50 points and became the first player in NBA history to get that many without trying a free throw as Denver adjusted to a schedule change by handing the Cleveland Cavaliers their ninth straight loss, 120-103 on Friday night. Following the game, Murray was unaware that he had done something unique. “I was just making my shots,” he said nonchalantly between sips of a postgame smoothie. “It's kind of cool to make history. It's a cool stat.” Murray was cooler than cool. While All-Star starter Nikola Jokic added a triple-double on his birthday, it was Murray's night. The smooth guard made 21 of 25 shots, including 8 of 10 3-pointers and scored 30 in the second half. He added six rebounds and two steals during 38 electrifying minutes. “To do it as efficiently as he did it is really remarkable,” said Malone. “That's an incredible stat line.” With the Cavs still hanging around in the fourth, Murray made three 3-pointers in a 65-second span to push Denver's lead to 21. He celebrated his third straight long-range make — an off-balance number from 33 feet — to open the fourth by pounding his chest and screaming toward fans in Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. “That's what we live for as players,” Murray said, “that atmosphere.” Murray scored Denver’s first 13 in the last quarter, and then passed his previous career best of 46 points by draining another 3 — on Jokic’s 10th assist — with 4 minutes left. Murray capped his incredible performance with a resounding dunk before being replaced with 2:23 left. Collin Sexton scored 23 and Jarrett Allen 20 for Cleveland, which had a couple days to prepare for the Nuggets but still couldn’t stop them. Not the way Murray was shooting. The Cavs tried several different defenders on Murray, who was hardly bothered. “It never matters,” he said. After a strong start, the Cavs have fallen near the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings. “With the exception of Murray, we took some steps in the right direction,” Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. Michael Porter Jr. added 22 points for the Nuggets. Jokic celebrated turning 26 with 16 points and 12 rebounds in getting his seventh triple-double this season. A stopover in Cleveland was not originally part of Denver's travel itinerary for a four-game trip. However, when the league postponed three San Antonio games — including one against the Cavs on Wednesday — earlier this week because of virus cases on the Spurs, the Nuggets were re-routed. They made their first 12 shots, opened a 22-point lead in the second half and then let Murray close out the Cavs. The Nuggets thrashed the Cavaliers on Feb. 10, beating them by 38 points and prompting Bickerstaff to criticize his players for being “embarrassed.” He expected a better effort in the rematch between the teams. “I hope our guys respond,” he said 90 minutes before tip. Cleveland played better, but didn't have enough firepower to stay with the Nuggets. Or Murray.

"Dennis Smith Jr. hits the step-back and-1 two and then drains a 3-pointer as the Pistons are in the lead vs. the Bulls. (0:28) CHICAGO -- — Zach LaVine scored 37 points and the Chicago Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 105-102 Wednesday night on short notice. The Bulls were scheduled to visit Charlotte, with the Pistons at Dallas. Those games got called off Tuesday by the NBA because of COVID-19 contact tracing concerns with the Hornets and power outages in Texas. The Bulls and Pistons were then scheduled to play each other, instead. Bulls coach Billy Donovan benched his young players at the start of the second half but they came through with big shots late. “As professionals you hope they go to the locker room, they regroup, they realize there’s going to be some changes made,” Donovan said. “When my number’s called, I have to be ready and prepared, and I thought those guys did that.” Chicago made two 3-pointers late in the game to hold off Detroit. Coby White made his shot from the corner to give the Bulls a 100-96 lead with just over a minute left before Patrick Williams knocked down a 3-pointer with 29 seconds remaining to make it 103-98. White was one of the players that Donovan pulled. “It was a learning experience for me,” White said. “I had to accept the challenge and do what I needed to help my team win.” LaVine made a free throw to ice the game in the final seconds. He scored 15 points in the third quarter to help Chicago rally from a 25-point, second-quarter deficit, the biggest comeback in the NBA this season. Wendall Carter Jr. added 18 points while Williams had 15. Chicago won its second straight game overall and fifth in a row against Detroit. Jerami Grant scored a career-high 43 points for the Pistons, who cooled off after a strong start. “I think we could’ve done a better job in the third quarter and I thought we gave up the lead,” Grant said. “Down the stretch, we missed some shots that we normally make. We gave up the game.” Delon Wright scored 10 of his 12 points in the first half while Dennis Smith Jr. added 10 points off the bench. Detroit started the second quarter on a 12-0 run and Chicago failed to score until Carter's follow dunk midway through the period.

On Tuesday, instead of flying to Charlotte, the NBA announced the Hornets’ next two game were postponed because of the league’s health and safety protocols. As the Bulls planned to return back to Chicago for practices, the NBA announced Tuesday Chicago would play Detroit, forcing a quick adjustment. “There was a lot to get ready for because as a staff, you have guys working on Charlotte to get prepared to play them,” Donovan said. “Now, all of a sudden, you’re playing a team that wasn’t even on your schedule so there was no reason to prepare.” Detroit had Dallas on its mind Tuesday morning before severe weather in Texas forced the game to be postponed and sent the Pistons to Chicago. “It’s like I said at the beginning of the year, the only thing that’s going to be usual about this year is the unusual,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said.","401299015"
"Julius Randle's block leads to an R.J. Barrett dunk. (0:19) NEW YORK -- — The All-Star Game is up next for Julius Randle. The playoffs might be there later for his team. Randle capped his breakout first half with 27 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists, sending the New York Knicks into the break with a winning record after a 114-104 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night. RJ Barrett added 21 points to help the Knicks improve to 19-18 in their first season under Tom Thibodeau. They have missed the playoffs for seven straight years but finished the first half in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. “As a group we’re not satisfied,” Randle said. “We haven’t accomplished what we want to accomplish.” It's been an unexpected rise for the longtime losers fueled by Randle, the workhorse power forward who was rewarded with his first All-Star selection. “He’s a great worker and sets a great example for the team,” Thibodeau said. “So he’s been terrific and the impact on winning has been huge.” So has Thibodeau's, the former Coach of the Year whose players have taken to his style of outworking the competition. “We still have a lot of things that we have to clean up, but I think hard work is always going to make up for it,” Barrett said. Elfrid Payton had 20 points after missing the last four games with a sore right hamstring. Wayne Ellington scored 17 points for the Pistons, who came nowhere near duplicating their play from a night earlier, when they routed Toronto 129-105. They had 43 points after one quarter in that game but barely surpassed that by halftime of this one, reaching the midpoint of their schedule at 10-27, worst in the East. Coach Dwane Casey pointed to the growth of the Pistons' many young players and sees good things ahead for the franchise. “It’s just so many good things that are going on and unfortunately they’re not coming out as ‘Ws,’” Casey said. Mason Plumlee, one of two Pistons with triple-doubles against Toronto, followed that with 12 points and 13 rebounds. New York's lead was 48-44 after Isaiah Stewart's follow shot with 3:52 remaining in the half. The Knicks then ran off 11 straight points, most of the baskets at or near the rim, to open a 15-point cushion and took a 59-46 lead to the break. The Knicks made 15-of-23 shots (65%) in the third, opening a 20-point lead before taking a 93-74 advantage to the fourth. Detroit cut it to 10 in the fourth and was about to get closer when it got the ball underneath to an open Plumlee, but Randle swooped in to block the shot and the Knicks found Barrett alone on the other end to make it 103-91. The Pistons were the opponent in the last NBA game played at Madison Square Garden in front of a full crowd. The Knicks beat them 96-84 last March 8 before beginning a three-game road trip they never finished because the season was suspended three nights later because of the coronavirus. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit has dropped four straight against New York after winning the previous eight meetings. ... Former Knicks guard Dennis Smith Jr., who also had a triple-double Wednesday, scored 12 points but had just two assists and two rebounds. Knicks: Derrick Rose missed his second straight game for health and safety protocol reasons. ... The Knicks showed highlights of some dunks by Obi Toppin on the overhead video screen during a timeout late in the first quarter and congratulated him on being chosen to compete in the All-Star slam dunk contest. They also wished a happy birthday to the rookie, who turned 23 Thursday. NOT ON SCHEDULE The Pistons closed the first half with a back-to-back, when originally they weren’t scheduled to play either night. Detroit was supposed to close its first half Tuesday with a road game against Toronto, before that game was pushed back a day because of the Raptors’ coronavirus issues. The game Thursday in New York was originally targeted for the second half before the NBA recently added it to Thursday’s schedule.","401302775"
"Ja Morant shows off some amazing ball fakes before passing to Xavier Tillman for a jam. (0:18) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — The Washington Wizards wanted to concentrate on keeping Memphis from scoring in the paint. Grizzlies center Jonas Valanciunas made sure the strategy didn’t work. Valanciunas scored a season-high 29 points and matched his season best with 20 rebounds to lead the Grizzlies to a 127-112 victory over Washington on Wednesday night. With Valanciunas controlling the middle and Ja Morant adding 21 points and 10 assists on drives to the basket, Memphis managed 78 paint points. Rookie Desmond Bane complemented the inside scoring with a season-high 20 points, going 5 of 8 from 3-point range. “It was four days without basketball,” Valanciunas said of getting back on the court. “It was great to play basketball again. Great to be with the group, win a game and have some fun playing.” Bradley Beal scored 21 points for the Wizards but was 6 of 22 from the field, including only 1 of 8 from 3-point range. Russell Westbrook finished with 20 points, while Davis Bertans and Deni Avdija scored 13 apiece. “They face-guard him. They put their hand on him,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of the defense on Beal, primarily from Grizzlies forward Dillon Brooks. “I thought (Beal) did a good job of getting to the free throw line eight times in the first half. He did the same thing in the second half and didn’t get any calls. They were physical with him.” The game tipped off the second half of the season for both teams sitting outside of the playoff picture, looking to rally for a postseason spot. The Grizzlies benefitted from some Washington shooting struggles in the early stages of the first half, building the lead to 19 points in the second quarter. “They dared us to make shots,” Scott Brooks said. “Until we start making shots consistently from 3, they are going to put a lot of bodies on (Beal).” The Wizards closed the half with a 21-7 rally to cut the deficit to 67-62 at the break. That came with Beal, the NBA’s leading scorer, going 1 of 9 from the field in the half. While the Wizards would make a second-half run, even taking the lead on a couple of occasions, Memphis pulled away in the fourth quarter. “Even after they took that lead,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, “we just talked about getting together, regroup, go out there and focus on what we (had) to do. Execute our game plan.” TIP-INS Wizards: Beal passed Phil Chenier for fourth on the Wizards’ career steals list. Chenier had 667. … Beal has scored at least 33 points in four of the last six games. The only two he didn’t were against the Grizzlies, including 23 on March 2. … Bertans has made multiple 3-pointers in the last 19 games he has played. Grizzlies: Have won four straight in the series, which Memphis now leads 28-21, its winningest record against any NBA team. … G Grayson Allen missed his fourth game under the league’s concussion protocol. Dillon Brooks has a steal in each of the last 13 games he’s played. …Valanciunas recorded his 21st double-double in 28 games played this season. JACKSON STATUS Memphis forward Jaren Jackson Jr. has not played this season recovering from left knee meniscus surgery. There was some hope he could return after the All-Star break, but he remained on the injury list. Jenkins said Jackson hasn’t done anything contact-wise in the last week or so. “It’s not a concern for us at all,” Jenkins said. “I think we’re still doing good in terms of all the work that he’s been putting in, we’ve been putting in, to get back to fully healthy enough and 100%.” DEFENSIVE DILLON Brooks has done a good job of guarding Beal during the last two games with the Wizards, holding the league’s leading scorer to 23 and 21 points. Beal has gone a total of 14 of 40 from the field, including 2 of 12 from 3-point range. “I just rise to the occasion,” Brooks said. “Take the challenge and see if he can last the full 48 (minutes) with a lot of physicality.”","401307309"
"Kristaps Porzingis grabs an offensive rebound and puts it back in for the hoop and the harm. (0:25) DALLAS -- — Luka Doncic had 22 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists in his 33rd triple-double, Kristaps Porzingis had 28 points and 14 rebounds and the Dallas Mavericks used a late run to pull away and beat the San Antonio Spurs 115-104 on Wednesday night. Dallas finished with a 17-4 run against a Spurs team that will no longer have seven-time All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge in the lineup. Before the game, coach Gregg Popovich announced that Aldridge, 35, in his sixth season in San Antonio, would no longer be with the team by mutual agreement. “He’s been a great teammate,” said Popovich, who added that Aldridge is healthy. “We just think this is a win-win for both LaMarcus and for the club.” Spurs veteran guard Patty Mills also played with Aldridge in Portland. “He might the longest teammate that I’ve had,” Mills said. “He’s obviously well respected by this group particularly and every team that he’s played for. As a teammate, you just wish the best for him.” DeMar DeRozan had 30 points, 11 assists and four steals for the Spurs. Mills added 14 points and Rudy Gay had 13 for San Antonio, which was outrebounded 51-30 and outscored 21-2 on second-chance points. “We lost the game on the boards,” Popovich said. “Porzingis was great on the boards. I thought we did a good job on Doncic. Played hard, played well, but too many mental mistakes and a little bit uneven flow and uneven performance offensively.” During the Mavericks’ late spurt, the Spurs missed 11 straight shots over a period of almost eight minutes. Porzingis, who had offseason knee surgery, has double-doubles in three straight and seven of his last 12 games. “I feel like I’m getting there,” Porzingis said. “I still have to keep working on it. After surgery, the leg, it’s not feeling the same.” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle called Porzingis “tremendous.” “He was great on defense. He passed the ball. He cut. He moved. He did virtually everything,” Carlisle said. Doncic is tied with Bob Cousy for 11th place in career triple-doubles. The Mavericks’ late spurt began midway through the fourth quarter when the Spurs’ Derrick White fouled Josh Richardson with 1.2 seconds left on the shot clock. The Spurs led 59-52 at intermission, which matched their largest lead of the half, led by DeRozan’s 14 points, eight assists and three steals. TIP-INS Spurs: Aldridge was a three-time All-Star while with the Spurs. He played in 21 of San Antonio’s 32 games this season, averaging 13.7 points and 4.5 rebounds in 25.9 minutes – a career low in rebounds and his fewest points and minutes since he was a rookie. Mavericks: Dallas changed its attendance policy coming out of the All-Star break and admitted about 3,500, an increase of about 1,000. Everyone inside American Airlines Center is still required to wear a mask in accordance with NBA rules. BENCH BATTLE Reserves predictably didn’t disappoint in scoring, with the Spurs’ bench outscoring the Mavericks’ 39-35. San Antonio went in ranked fifth in the NBA averaging 39.2 bench points. Dallas was ninth, averaging 38.0.","401307310"
"Miles Bridges takes flight to abuse the rim on an explosive one-handed dunk against the Pistons. (0:15) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Some NBA players tend to shy away from taking big shots with the game on the line. Terry Rozier clearly isn't one of them. P.J Washington had 20 points and nine rebounds, while Rozier continued to build on his reputation as Charlotte's closer by scoring 12 of his team's final 15 points to lead the Hornets to a 105-102 win over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night. Hornets coach James Borrego called him “fearless.” “He's very comfortable in those moments,” Borrego said. “It's almost like he is more locked in the tighter the game is. That's rare at any level, much less at this level.” Rozier was 2 of 9 from the field before going 4 of 5 in the final 3:11 with the NBA's ultimate finisher, six-time champion and team owner Michael Jordan, sitting courtside. Rozier said he hasn't always been on teams where he's the first option to take the big shot, but said that doesn't mean he wasn't ready. “That is what separates the good from the greats,” said Rozier, who finished with 17 points. “If you want to be great you have to have that confidence down the stretch.” Teammate Gordon Hayward said he's seen that from Rozier all season. “He's not afraid of any moment,” Hayward said. “He was pretty quiet and then at the end of the game he just went off and won the game for us.” Raptors coach Dwane Casey expressed frustration with his team's inability to defend Rozier with the game on the line. “That’s what he does. That's what he’s been doing all year. It’s no surprise,” Casey said. “But we’ve got to do a better job of being physical, getting into him, riding him over screens, make him put it on the floor multiple times and make it hard for him.” Hayward added 17 points and Cody Zeller chipped in with 15 points and a key rebound for Charlotte (18-18). Jerami Grant had 32 points on 11-of-24 shooting for the Pistons. With Charlotte trailing 96-94, Zeller grabbed a big offensive rebound in traffic and kicked out to an open Washington for a corner 3-pointer with 2:22 left to give the Hornets the lead for good. After a Pistons turnover, Rozier took over. He drove the left side of the lane and knocked down a soft bank shot while drawing a foul, pushing the lead to four. Then he added a 3 from the wing on the next possession to push the lead to five and sank a floater in the lane with the shot clock winding down to give the Hornets a 105-100 lead with 9.1 seconds left. TIP-INS Pistons: Saddiq Bey, who grew up in Charlotte, had 14 points. ... Committed 14 turnovers leading to 19 Charlotte points. Hornets: Borrego said he plans to stick with the starting lineup of LaMelo Ball, Rozier, Hayward, Washington and Zeller moving forward. ... Devonte Graham returned to the floor after missing nearly a month with a knee injury. ... Made 23 of 24 foul shots. SOME FANS ALLOWED The Hornets distributed 500 complimentary tickets to frontline workers from healthcare partner Novant Health for the game. They're the first spectators allowed in at the Spectrum Center in more than a year. About 3,000 general public fans will be allowed in for the next home game on Saturday. “It was great to have some people in the stands,” Hayward said. “I am glad we were able to win for them.” GOING DEEP Casey played 12 players against the Hornets, which he said was the plan going in. “First of all, we haven’t played in almost a week.” Casey said. ""Guys were a little winded, they were in the same thing, I don’t know how many guys they played. But I think both teams were just trying to get fresh bodies in, and you know getting guys a blow and I thought everybody who came in the game did an excellent job.”","401307311"
"While driving to the basket, Kyrie Irving fights off Jayson Tatum and somehow sinks the reverse layup. (0:18) NEW YORK -- — Kyrie Irving scored 40 points to lead the Brooklyn Nets to a 121-109 victory over the Boston Celtics on Thursday night. James Harden had 22 points and 10 rebounds for Brooklyn, which improved to 25-13 with its 12th win in 13 games. Landry Shamet added 18 points and fellow reserve Jeff Green finished with 11. Joe Harris added 12 as the Nets won without Kevin Durant and newcomer Blake Griffin. “We have a multitude of guys who can take us home and carry it out, and we trust in them,” Shamet said. “It’s just a matter of us putting an entire game together and putting us in the best position possible.” Jayson Tatum scored 31 points but Boston had its four-game winning streak snapped. Marcus Smart added 19 in his return from injury, Daniel Theis had 17 and Jaylen Brown chipped in with 13. “That's a really good team,” Tatum said. “A couple of us didn't shoot it well so obviously there's some things we could do better.” The first meeting between the Atlantic Division rivals since Christmas emphasized the gulf between the teams — specifically, Brooklyn’s quick strike offense. The Nets began the fourth with an 88-86 lead, but it took just more than 3 minutes to extend the advantage to 100-90 even as Irving sat on the bench. After Boston cut the lead to five following Tatum's jumper, Irving and Harris checked back into the game and the Nets promptly outscored Boston 21-14 for the remainder of the game. In that 7:34 stretch, Irving made two 3s and two free throws against his former team, and when Green slammed a two-handed dunk with 43 seconds left, the outcome was basically decided. “That’s what makes the game beautiful,"" Irving said. ""Being able to have spurts. It’s just the flow of the game. When it gets to that quarter, when it’s winning time, I’ve always said it throughout my career I enjoy it more than anything else.” Smart had missed 19 games dating back to Jan. 30 with a strained left calf. He played 21 minutes after Boston coach Brad Stevens said before the game that the guard would be limited to 20-22. How did the Celtics settle upon that time frame? “What I do is I get told and I follow instructions,” Stevens deadpanned. “It’s a lot like being married, right? My wife tells me what to do and I do what she says. That’s pretty much how this all works with the minute restrictions.” TIP-INS: CELTICS: Boston began the second half in fourth place, just a half-game up on the surprising New York Knicks. But that does not mean Stevens is publicly lobbying GM Danny Ainge to be active in the trade market. “I coach the team, right,” Stevens said. “My job with the guys that are here, to help them be the best that they can be and hopefully put them in a position to succeed individually and collectively. Sometimes that takes time to figure out how that all fits together. Sometimes that takes time for people to impact the way they’re best able to. That’s my task. My task is to put the puzzle together that is on our roster.” NETS: The Nets announced Wednesday that Durant would not play due to an injured hamstring, the 10th straight game he has missed. Griffin, who signed Monday, did not play against Boston due to the fact Detroit deactivated him beginning on Feb. 12 in an attempt to trade him. before making the decision to buy out the former All-Star. “Everyone’s excited to have him,” Nets coach Steve Nash said before the game. “We’ll see how he can impact our team. He’s a talented, intelligent player.”","401307312"
"With the Hawks down two, Trae Young passes out to Tony Snell, who knocks down a 3-pointer as the buzzer sounds to give Atlanta the win. (0:46) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Tony Snell hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer Thursday night and the Atlanta Hawks came back from a 15-point deficit in the final six minutes to beat the Toronto Raptors 121-120. Trae Young scored 37 points for the Hawks, who won their third straight. It was Young's sixth assist of the game that set up Snell for a clean look just before the final horn. ""Trae draws so much attention, but he didn’t have anything (open),” said Hawks coach Nate McMillan. “So he trusted his teammate, kicked it back out, and Tony did what he’s been doing for us — he hit a big 3.” Norman Powell scored 33 points for Toronto and Chris Boucher had another big game off the bench with 29 points and nine rebounds. Kyle Lowry, who moved into second place on Toronto's career scoring list, finished with 17 points and 12 assists. Boucher followed his career-high, 30-point game on March 4 to help Toronto come back from an early 19-point deficit, hitting 10 of 15 shots. Toronto shot 9 for 25 with five turnovers in the final quarter, losing for the fifth time in six games. The Raptors knew they had to get the ball out of Young's hands for the final shot. “We threw the farm at him,” Powell said. “We were trying to make somebody else make a play, and they did.” Lowry’s 17 points moved him ahead of Chris Bosh into second place on Toronto’s scoring list with 10,292 points. DeMar DeRozan is first with 13,296. The Raptors played again without Fred VanVleet, Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby because of the NBA's coronavirus safety protocols. Coach Nick Nurse, who had missed the two preceding games along with most of his staff for the same reason, was back on the bench Thursday night. “We have to adjust to what we have on the floor and take what the defense gives us,” said Powell, who missed two free throws with 56 seconds left. “Right now I have to be an aggressive offensive player and I kind of like it. But I've got to make those free throws. That's totally on me.” The Raptors made only eight of their first 26 shots, and when Solomon Hill's 3-pointer completed an 11-0 Atlanta run early in the second quarter, the Hawks led 48-29. Boucher scored twice and Powell hit a 3-pointer on a 12-0 run to help the Raptors get back in it, but they never led until Powell's 3-pointer made it 78-76 midway through the third quarter. The Hawks were down 112-97 when Boucher hit another 3-point shot with 6:13 left. Young hits four shots late in the fourth quarter, including a driving layup that brought the Hawks within two.

"Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman react to the NBA suspending Meyers Leonard for one week and fining him $50K for his anti-Semitic comments. (1:55) MIAMI -- — For the first time this season, the Miami Heat have a winning record. They hope that's just the beginning. Jimmy Butler had 27 points and 11 assists, Kelly Olynyk scored 20 points and the Heat beat the Orlando Magic 111-103 on Thursday night — getting to 19-18 on the season after winning for the eighth time in their last nine games. “It's been an objective of ours for several weeks,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “A small hurdle. It was something that we wanted to do."" Miami opened the season with a loss to Orlando, and had gone 0-6 in opportunities this season to move over .500 — until Thursday. Tyler Herro scored 17 points, Kendrick Nunn had 13 and Goran Dragic added 11 for the Heat. Butler had 10 points in the fourth quarter, and led a defensive charge that limited Orlando to 8-for-28 shooting in the final 12 minutes. “Jimmy just controlled the game down the stretch for us,"" Olynyk said. All-Star Nikola Vucevic finished with 24 points and a game-high 17 rebounds for the Magic, who have dropped six straight. Dwayne Bacon scored a season-high 21 for Orlando and Michael Carter-Williams had 17 for the Magic — who lost despite outrebounding Miami 57-44. The Heat were without Bam Adebayo (knee) and Avery Bradley (calf), while Orlando was without Terrence Ross (knee), Evan Fournier (groin), James Ennis (calf) and Cole Anthony (rib). Aaron Gordon, who hadn’t played since Jan. 31 because of a sprained left ankle, had nine points for Orlando. He had two seven-minute stints to start the first and third quarters and did not play otherwise because of a minutes restriction. “AG coming back is huge for us. ... Definitely good to have him back,"" Vucevic said. Even with the Magic being short-handed, the game was close the whole way. The Heat had a pair of seven-point leads in the first quarter, Orlando had a four-point lead early in the second, and those were the extremes for either side until the final minutes. They went to the fourth quarter tied at 82, and Miami's lead was just 93-92 when Bacon made a 3-pointer midway through the final period. Orlando then missed its next eight shots, Olynyk hit a 3-pointer with 57.7 seconds left for the first double-digit lead of the evening at 108-98, and the Heat could exhale. “This is a game we definitely should have won,” Bacon said. “We can’t keep letting it slip away like this in the fourth quarter.” It was Miami’s first game since center Meyers Leonard used an anti-Semitic slur while livestreaming a video game earlier in the week. He was fined $50,000 by the NBA, the maximum allowed, and will remain away from the Heat indefinitely — even being edited out of the team’s pregame introduction video shown Thursday night. TIP-INS Magic: Gordon’s 15-game absence was the second-longest of his career. He missed 32 games as a rookie in 2014-15 with a broken foot. ... Bacon’s previous season high for scoring was 20, at Golden State on Feb. 11. ... Orlando started the season 6-2. The Magic are 7-22 since. ...

"Shake Milton sends one up to Dwight Howard for an alley-oop flush. (0:16) CHICAGO -- — Tobias Harris scored 24 points and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Chicago Bulls 127-105 Thursday night even though they were missing stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons for contact tracing. With Harris and six other Sixers in double figures, the Eastern Conference leaders had more than enough to get by. “I don't know if it was the best (win) because I don't rate them, but definitely one of the big ones,” coach Doc Rivers said. “Heck, even at the All-Star break, listening to all the other guys, ‘Man, you guys are gonna be in trouble your first two.’ Well, we were not. And we played great.” Dwight Howard scored a season-high 18 and grabbed 12 rebounds, and Tony Bradley chipped in with a season-high 14 on 7-for-7 shooting. The 6-foot-10 center also got this shoutout on Twitter from Embiid during the game: “That’s it!!! I’ve seen enough. Build around Tony Bradley @sixers”. Furkan Korkmaz added 16 points, and the Sixers came out on top even though their stars were not available. “I think it shows how deep we are as a team, how connected we are,"" Howard said. “Missing our two best players, we still got the job done tonight. We believe in each other.” Embiid and Simmons both traveled to Atlanta for Sunday’s All-Star game, only to learn the night before they were flagged for contact tracing. Though neither player tested positive for COVID-19, the barber they visited before leaving did. Embiid, who scored a career-high 50 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in a win over the Bulls last month, is expected to return Friday at Washington. Simmons is to miss one more game. LISTLESS BULLS Lauri Markkanen, back from a sprained right shoulder, led Chicago with 23 points. The 7-footer from Finland made all seven 3-pointers in his first appearance since Feb. 5. All-Star Zach LaVine scored 19, and Coby White finished with 18 points. But coach Billy Donovan called it a “huge step backward"" for the Bulls. They were dominated in the paint 78-42 and committed 19 turnovers compared to just 11 for Philadelphia. It was just a listless effort overall. “We didn't deserve to win the game, and we didn't deserve to be in the game,"" Donovan said. “We just didn't. We didn't do anything that was of a high enough standard in terms of what winning requires. There was nothing. ... We didn't do anything well enough tonight to even think about deserving to want to win or be in a position to win.” PULLING AWAY Matisse Thybulle capped an 8-0 spurt with a 3-pointer to make it 84-69 with 5:43 left in the third quarter, and the 76ers remained in control the rest of the way. Milton hit a layup at the buzzer to start a 13-0 run, capped by a dunk by Howard's alley-oop dunk to make it 108-85 with 9:40 left in the game. TIP-INS 76ers: Rivers coached the team after missing practice the previous day because of an illness. ... Rivers said Embiid and Simmons have been working out on their own: “They feel great. I guess that's the most important thing.” Bulls: The Bulls were basically at full strength with Markkanen and Otto Porter Jr. available. Porter had three points in 18 minutes after being sidelined since Feb. 1 because of back spasms. “We just haven't been healthy for a good portion of the year,” Donovan said. “We haven't had the full complement of players, so it's good to have everybody back.” ...

We were aggressive. We tried to go downhill, finding one another. We were just playing good basketball, just having fun out there.” The Bucks have won seven of their last eight and now prepare to begin a three-game road swing. Antetokounmpo was playing for the first time since earning MVP honors at Sunday’s All-Star Game  by shooting 16 of 16  from the floor (3 of 3 on 3-point attempts) and scoring 35 points. That marked the first time in All-Star Game history that someone had shot 100% from the floor with at least 10 attempts. He went 8 of 12 from the floor and made all seven of his free throws Thursday. Antetokounmpo was one of seven Bucks to score in double figures. ""We didn’t take care of the transition,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “We didn't take care of the paint. We didn't take care of covering the line. And then we didn't finish our defense with rebounding well. They pretty much got everything that they wanted.” RJ Barrett had 22 points, Alec Burks 17 and Immanuel Quickley 15 for the Knicks. Brook Lopez scored eight points during a 14-0 run in the first quarter as the Bucks turned a 16-12 deficit into a 26-16 lead they never relinquished. Milwaukee gained a measure of revenge after falling 130-110 at New York on Dec. 27. The Bucks shot a season-low 18.4% (7 of 38) in that game while New York was 16 of 27 from beyond the arc. The Bucks were 18 of 38 and the Knicks went 13 of 37 on 3-point attempts Thursday. “I think we were locked in defensively, which made it a lot easier on the offensive end,” Forbes said. “The last time we played them, they had a large amount of 3's, and they were flowing on offense. I think us stopping them on defense let our offense kind of go from there.” TIP-INS Knicks: Derrick Rose missed a third straight game due to the league’s health and safety protocols. Taj Gibson returned from a sprained left ankle and had seven points in 26 minutes. Gibson had missed the Knicks’ last three games before the All-Star break. ... Julius Randle had seven points, eight rebounds and six assists but shot just 3 of 12. Randle had 29 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists in the victory over the Bucks back in December. Bucks: Jrue Holiday returned to Milwaukee’s starting lineup for the first time since missing 10 games due to COVID-19. Holiday returned to action Feb. 28 but had come off the bench in his first three games back. … The Bucks announced that local health officials will allow them to have about 3,200 spectators – 18% of Fiserv Forum’s capacity – for home games beginning March 20 against San Antonio. The Bucks currently are permitted to fill 10% of the arena’s capacity, which gives them about 1,800 spectators. ...

"Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy opens up after the Pelicans were trounced by 30 points against the Timberwolves. (1:36) NEW ORLEANS -- — Jaylen Nowell hit six 3-pointers on his way to a career-best 28 points, top overall draft choice Anthony Edwards scored 27 points, and the Minnesota Timberwolves rallied from an early 16-point deficit to rout the New Orleans Pelicans 135-105 on Thursday night. “It also was the most fun that I had,” Nowell said. “We all were having fun, just happy for each other. And that's what kind of led to me feeling good, so I just decided to turn it up, get more buckets. ... When I felt it was the right time to start scoring, I did it.” The remarkable 46-point swing gave Timberwolves coach Chris Finch, a New Orleans assistant the previous three seasons, his first victory in six games since taking his first NBA head-coaching job with Minnesota on Feb. 22. “It was great. You know, we threw a little water on him,” Edwards said of the celebration in the locker room. “He was freezing cold, so he got out of there real fast.” Rookie Jaden McDaniels hit his first four 3s and finished with a career-high 20 points for Minnesota, which won for just the eighth time this season — and second time against New Orleans. “Finally, we get to go back and have something to smile about, splashed coach with the water,” Nowell said. ""It’s a great feeling. Honestly, I forgot what this feeling felt like. So it's great to find that out again.” Karl-Anthony Towns scored 16 points and former LSU standout Naz Reid added 15 for the Timberwolves, who combined for 19 3-pointers on 40 attempts (47.5%). Zion Williamson scored 24 points for New Orleans. Steven Adams had 13 points and 12 rebounds and Brandon Ingram added 13 points. But the Pelicans struggled to shoot from 3-point range, going 6 for 32. They compounded that by committing 18 turnovers, which led to 31 Minnesota points. “We're so bad defensively that we can't have a bad offensive night,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “If we have a bad offensive night, we're going to get crushed like we did. “We didn't compete. We didn't help each other,” Van Gundy continued. “A really embarrassing evening for us tonight. They played well. They were inspired to play. We didn't seem to care and we got what we deserved.” After Edwards' dunk and 3 in succession gave Minnesota an 88-70 lead in the third quarter, boos could be heard emanating from the socially distanced crowd of about 3,700. New Orleans led 26-10 with 4:03 left in the first quarter. Williamson got going with eight early points inside, highlighted by his thunderous dunk on a baseline cut. But the Wolves methodically rallied, helped by reserves McDaniels and Reid. McDaniels made his first five shots, including two 3s, while Reid made five of his first six attempts. “The second group came in with aggressiveness,” Edwards said. “They led us down a really, really good path.” Towns, who'd missed his first six 3s, finally made one as time expired in the first half to give the Wolves a 40-point second quarter and 67-60 lead. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns' buzzer-beater at the end of the first half extended his streak of games with at least one 3 to 51. ... Jake Layman scored 12 points, hitting three 3s. ... Minnesota got a season-high 72 points from reserves, marking the eighth time this season the Timberwolves' bench exceeded 50 points. ... The Wolves' point total was their highest this season. ...

STAYING POSITIVE Williamson, who said going into the All-Star break that he believed the Pelicans were on the cusp of winning more consistently, said the lopsided loss to the last-place Timberwolves did not change his outlook. “I do feel like we're almost there,” Williamson maintained. “I hate to say this, but this is the NBA, man. Losses like that happen every so often. “Hopefully we'll show the world why I said what I said,” Williamson added. “We're all adults ... You can't sulk over a loss like this. We've just got to move on.”","401307357"
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander drives to the basket and draws the contact as he puts up a lofty shot that somehow finds its way to into the basket over a defender. (0:25) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 32 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder held on for a 116-108 victory Thursday night against a Dallas Mavericks team that rested Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis. The Thunder made five of their first six 3-point attempts and built a 35-19 advantage after one quarter, then held off a late Dallas rally. Dallas cut the deficit to 103-101 with just under 2 minutes remaining but Gilgeous-Alexander scored on back-to-back possessions and made six consecutive free throws in the closing minutes. “He made it look so easy,” veteran Al Horford said. “His shot-making ability and poise continue to impress me. We needed those buckets, and he took us home.” Oklahoma City outrebounded Dallas 21-5 in the first period and finished the half making 10 of its 14 3-point attempts (71%). The Thunder cooled off from there but still finished 16 of 32 behind the arc. “We were sharp early and I give our guys credit with how they handled themselves during the break,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “They were ready to play from the jump.” Josh Richardson scored 27 points for the Mavericks. He scored to cut the deficit to 67-59 early in the third, but Al Horford responded with a three from the top of the key and a traditional three-point play on consecutive possessions. Horford added 21 points and was 4 for 5 on 3-point attempts. Jalen Brunson scored 26 and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 24 for the Mavericks, who fell to 19-17. TIP-INS Mavericks: The loss drops them to 2-5 on the second night of a back-to-back. … Richardson grew up in the Oklahoma City suburb of Edmond.

"On the Clippers' first possession of the second half, Serge Ibaka drives straight to the bucket for a layup plus the foul. (0:17) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 28 points in three quarters and the Los Angeles Clippers routed Golden State 130-104 on Thursday night, sending the Warriors to their season-worst fourth consecutive loss. Paul George added 17 points and Serge Ibaka had 16 points and 14 rebounds for the Clippers, who ended their own three-game skid to begin the second half of the season. “We've just got to keep improving,” Leonard said. “We're not where we want to be.” Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 15 points each for the Warriors, who fell to 19-19. Steph Curry was held to 14 points on 6-of-16 shooting. He missed seven of eight shots from long-range after winning the 3-point contest at last weekend's All-Star Game. “Nobody likes the feeling of getting smacked,” Curry said. “We had an opportunity to set the tone for the second half of the season and obviously we didn’t do it.” The Clippers rode a dominant third quarter to a 104-68 lead heading into the fourth. They scored 45 points and hit seven 3-pointers. Los Angeles opened on a 13-3 spurt, in which Nicolas Batum and George made back-to-back 3-pointers. The Clippers closed with a 29-13 run that featured a combined 17 points from Leonard and George. “Just being focused and just being ready to adjust and just try to come out and hit first in the second half,” Leonard said, describing the Clippers' mindset. Curry scored seven points in the third, when the Warriors were limited to 25 points, before sitting out the fourth. The Clippers rested their starters over the final 12 minutes. “The beginning of the third quarter was disappointing,” Kerr said. “We gave away some easy hoops right away and by the time we kicked into gear defensively and started fighting, we were already down 25 points and it was too late.” Curry exhorted his teammates on the sideline, raising his arms while trying to inject some energy. “Early in the year, it felt like we just had a long way to go, so there was frustration but we knew we were going to get better,” Kerr said. “The frustration was greater tonight because we have proven we can be competitive and win games. That was a really disappointing, poor effort.” Leonard scored the Clippers' final 14 points to end the first, while Curry had three. He didn't score his first basket until nearly eight minutes into the game. TIP-INS Warriors: Got beat on the boards, 56-44. ... Their lone edge was in the paint, where they outscored LA 46-38. ...

TEACHING A LESSON James Wiseman was benched for the first three quarters after missing mandatory COVID-19 testing during the All-Star break. He played the entire fourth, scoring 14 points on 6-of-7 shooting and grabbing seven rebounds. “I made a huge mistake and I most definitely will not do that again,” said Wiseman, a 19-year-old who was the overall No. 2 pick in the NBA draft. “I made sure I apologized to coach. I was mad so I had to make sure I just went out there and played hard.” Wiseman wasn't allowed to practice a day earlier because of the missed testing. “You've got to take care of your business. Everything matters,” Kerr said. “He responded exactly as I had hoped he would. He competed with energy and that bodes well.” Curry said the players discussed Wiseman's mistake, although the punishment was Kerr's decision. “There are learning curves for everybody in this league,” he said. “The quicker you learn those things and just make it about basketball, the better.”","401307359"
"Devin Booker is left unguarded as he drains a 3-pointer to extend Phoenix's lead to 10 points in the fourth quarter. (0:16) Devin Booker returned from the knee injury that kept him out of the All-Star Game to score 35 points and the Phoenix Suns beat the Portland Trail Blazers 127-121 on Thursday night for their fifth straight victory. Chris Paul added 19 points for Phoenix, and Mikal Bridges scored 16 of his 18 points in the first half. Second in the NBA behind the Utah Jazz, the Suns have won 17 of their last 20 games. It was Booker’s 100th career game with 30 or more points. Paul, who didn’t think Booker would play Thursday night, called it “smooth.” Phoenix outscored the Blazers 37-27 in the final period. “I think we had some good energy going into the fourth quarter,” Booker said. “We were really animated in the huddle right before the fourth quarter. I was saying ‘This is winning time, time to lock in.’ That’s what we did.” Damian Lillard had 30 points for Portland, and Enes Kanter added 16 points and 11 rebounds. They had won three in a row. The Suns trailed by 11 points in the third quarter, but pulled to 96-95 early in the fourth on Abdel Nader's 3-pointer. Cameron Payne followed up with a 3 of his own to put Phoenix in front. Paul's 3 stretched the Suns' lead to 104-99 with 7:44 left. Booker added another with five minutes to go that made it 114-104 and Portland couldn't catch up. Booker did not play in the All-Star Game on Sunday night because of a sprained left knee, which he injured in the Suns' 120-98 victory at home over Golden State. “He comes out focused on the task at hand,” Payne said. “It’s amazing to watch — even as a teammate — to see him get going.” Booker was fouled late in the fourth quarter against the Blazers and came up limping after falling to the floor, but he remained in the game. Suns coach Monty Williams said that Booker “seemed OK,” following the game. “That's part of the game,” Booker said afterward. “That's what comes with it.” Portland led by as many as 13 points in the opening half but the teams went to the break tied at 60. Williams said he was impressed with his team's steadiness throughout the game. “I thought we grew tonight in our emotional stamina, especially on the road against a good team,” Williams said. It was the second of three games between the teams this season. The Suns won the first, 132-100 in Phoenix last month. “We played them better this time than last time, which was encouraging,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “We'll see what happens next time.” The teams played in Portland on March 10 of last year, the last game for both teams before the league was suspended by coronavirus concerns. The Blazers won 127-117. TIP INS Suns: Stotts praised Paul in his pregame chat with reporters, saying he has shown this year and last year in Oklahoma City what a great player he is. ... The Suns had seven players in double figures. Trail Blazers: The Blazers wore their gray and black Nike “earned” jerseys for the first time.

"Stephen Silas explains why P.J. Tucker didn't play for the Rockets on Thursday night and says Tucker is unlikely to return to the team. (1:24) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — De’Aaron Fox had 30 points, nine assists and seven rebounds, and the Sacramento Kings sent the Houston Rockets to their 14th consecutive loss, 125-105 on Thursday night. Buddy Hield added 20 points, seven assists and six rebounds for Sacramento, which had dropped 11 of 13 before the All-Star break. Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes each had 20 points and 11 rebounds. The Kings won despite 15 turnovers and getting outscored 41-24 in bench points. “It was a good effort from our group but we know we’ve got to get a lot better,” said coach Luke Walton, whose team committed 15 turnovers. “At times it was sloppy.” Victor Oladipo had 23 points and eight assists but couldn’t help Houston end its longest losing streak in nearly two decades. Kevin Porter Jr. added 13 points and a career-best 10 assists. The hard-luck Rockets, already without starters John Wall and P.J. Tucker, lost Eric Gordon to a groin strain midway through the third quarter. Gordon, who scored 17 points, had missed the previous two games with a left knee injury. It’s been that kind of season for coach Stephen Silas’ team. The Rockets’ slump is their longest since losing 15 straight in 2001. Houston’s last win came Feb. 4 against Memphis. After the game, Silas said the Rockets are attempting to trade Tucker. “At some point there was some mutual agreement with P.J., his agent, (Rockets general manager Rafael Stone) and the organization that P.J. will not be with the team anymore,” Silas said. Sacramento never trailed after a 15-0 run early in the second quarter. Fox and Barnes had six points apiece during the run. “It was a good win,” Holmes said. “We did a good job of executing, a good job of communicating and helping each other out.

"Joel Embiid attacks the basket and throws down a ferocious dunk by both Russell Westbrook and Moritz Wagner. (0:17) WASHINGTON -- — On pace for their best season and first conference championship in two decades, the Philadelphia 76ers are suddenly “praying” for the health of their best player. Joel Embiid scored 23 points but departed midway through the third quarter following an apparent leg injury in the 76ers' 127-101 victory over the Washington Wizards on Friday night. Embiid, an MVP candidate for his role on the Eastern Conference-leading Sixers, was in his first game back following a week-long absence for contract tracing. He entered Friday averaging 30.2 points and 11.6 rebounds. He had also grabbed seven rebounds before his exit with 6:20 left in the third. “It looked like a hyper-extension. That's what we all hope it (is),” said fellow starter Tobias Harris. “We're just praying that he'll be OK and be healthy tomorrow.” Following a dunk for his last points, Embiid landed awkwardly on his left leg, his knee joint appearing to bend slightly forward. He writhed in pain on the floor for several minutes, and a stretcher was briefly brought onto the court, but the center eventually limped off under his own power. Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said Embiid would be examined Saturday in Philadelphia. “We don’t do anything right now, because we don’t have any information,” Rivers said. “Listen, it’s a long season. At the end of the day, hopefully it’s not something where we lose him, obviously. But our guys will be good. We’ll be ready."" Even with Embiid's exit and Ben Simmons also out for contact tracing after both players were exposed to the same barber who tested positive for COVID-19, the 76ers cruised to a second straight comfortable win following the All-Star break. Shake Milton scored 18 points off the bench for Philadelphia, which led by 17 after the first quarter, 10 at halftime and 18 after the third. Furkan Korkmaz added 12 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter as the Sixers completed a three-game season sweep of the Wizards. Philadelphia outrebounded Washington 49-32, and had a 56-38 advantage in bench points. “I thought our guys did a pretty good job focusing,"" Rivers said. ""I thought it took us a couple minutes (after the injury) to get going, but once we did I thought we took care of the game.” Russell Westbrook scored 25 points and Bradley Beal added 19 for the Wizards, who lost their second straight after the break and had their home win streak against the Sixers snapped at 10 games. “We’ve got to get back to defending,"" Beal said. ""We can’t guard nobody right now again. We’ve got to get back to guarding people.” TIP-INS 76ers: Improved to 10-1 when scoring more than 120 points. ... Simmons could be cleared to return to team activities as early as Saturday ... Embiid finished shooting 8 of 11 on a night the Sixers shot 54.4% from the floor (49 for 90). Wizards: Beal was a game-time decision due to left knee soreness. He shot 8 of 13 a game after his second-worst shooting night of the season, but was limited to 29 minutes as the game got out of reach. ON A MISSION Harris had 14 points and eight rebounds in 23 minutes before sitting for all of a non-competitive fourth quarter. After he missed out on Sunday's All-Star Game, finishing 13th overall in frontcourt voting, the forward says he has a point to prove “When me and Doc talked about it, I just told him, ‘Look, I’ve got a bounty out for all the coaches that didn't vote for me. All the national media that skipped over me,'” said Harris, who entered averaging 20.3 points and 7.5 rebounds. “It is what it is. But me and Doc both discussed this. You make your name known in the playoffs. And leading this team and being solid what you do day in and day out, and that was my mentality.” SERIES-LY SPEAKING Philadelphia's sweep was its first of Washington since winning all four of the teams' meetings in 2008-09. The Wizards last swept the 76ers in 2015-16.","401307362"
"Ja Morant drives to the basket for a chance to give the Grizzlies the lead, but can't score and is frustrated with some contact from Nikola Jokic. (0:26) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Nikola Jokic led the Denver offense, but it was his defensive play in the closing seconds that preserved the Nuggets' fifth straight victory. Jokic had 28 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists, and his defense thwarted Memphis guard Ja Morant at the rim with about three seconds left as Denver escaped with a 103-102 victory over the Grizzlies on Friday night. Jokic had scored the final five Denver points for the 103-102 advantage, but Memphis had a chance to re-take the lead in the closing seconds when Morant went to the rim against Jokic but came up short against the Denver center. The Nuggets then ran out the clock for the victory. The Grizzlies were upset about Morant not getting a call on the drive, but official Rodney Mott said there was no foul. “On Morant’s drive to the basket, the defender, Jokic, jumps vertical and maintains a legal guarding position and there was no foul on the play,” Mott told a pool reporter. “As far as the last play of the game, I’ll look for the 2-minute report,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Will Barton and Michael Porter Jr. had 21 points each for Denver. Jamal Murray was held to a season-low three points, missing 13 of 14 shots. “We won that game and Jamal Murray was 1 for 14,” Porter said. “I think that just shows how good of a team we are because Jamal is one of our best players, one of our best scorers. “If we can scrape out wins when one of us doesn’t play well, that’s really encouraging.” Brandon Clarke and Dillon Brooks led Memphis with 20 points each, Clarke adding three blocks. Morant had 16 points — on 5-of-16 shooting — and nine assists, and Jonas Valanciunas added 14 points and 11 rebounds. Playing its first game after the All-Star break, Denver used a strong defensive effort in the third quarter to force poor Memphis shooting and sloppy ballhandling. The combination led to the Nuggets outscoring Memphis 28-22 in the third, including a 20-7 run that led to Denver’s first double-digit lead and eventually an 81-77 advantage. “When we win game, we win third quarters,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “I think there’s a definite correlation to that. That first 10 minutes of that third quarter were really impressive.” The Nuggets entered the game 14-2 when leading after three quarters this season and still held the advantage midway through the fourth until Memphis began connecting on 3-pointers. It was tied at 95 before a 3-pointer by Barton with 2:08 left, and Denver never trailed again. “It was a heckuva basketball game,” Jenkins said. “Two team playing at a very, very high level, especially (going down the stretch). We regrouped, came back and did a lot of great things there at the end of the game. …I thought we executed beautifully on a number of possessions to stay within striking distance.” TIP-INS Nuggets: Ended a five-game trip (split by All-Star break) 5-0. …F JaMychal Green, who was listed as questionable with a left shoulder sprain, was a late scratch with a stomach illness. …Murray reached 1,250 career assists in the second quarter. …Jokic went down holding his ankle in the third quarter, causing some concern as he left the game.

"Kevin Love drains a 3-pointer in his first game back to the court since December. (0:15) NEW ORLEANS -- — Brandon Ingram scored 28 points, Zion Williamson added 23 and the New Orleans Pelicans bounced back from a lopsided loss with a 116-82 rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night. “The energy in the room was good,” Ingram said about the locker room before the game. “We knew exactly what we wanted to do. We played loose. We played free. Everybody got to their strengths on the basketball court.” Ingram played just 25 minutes and Williamson 18 because of how lopsided the game became. Steven Adams had 10 points and 17 rebounds in his 21 minutes on the court. The Cavs welcomed forwards Kevin Love and Larry Nance Jr. back to the lineup after extended absences. Both announced their returns with early 3s. But their roles were relatively limited and did not significantly influence the result against a Pelicans squad determined to redeem itself after a demoralizing 30-point loss to Minnesota a night earlier. “It’s a pretty natural response,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We were all embarrassed. I was embarrassed. They were embarrassed. ... Our guys are resilient and they respond to games like that pretty well, but you just don’t want to have to have a response.” Love, who'd missed 33 games since injuring his right calf in late December, played 10 minutes and had four points and a rebound. He also got caught a step behind Williamson a couple times on the defensive end. “It just felt great to feel like I was playing meaningful basketball,” Love said. ""Just happy more than anything to be out there. I could have shot 0 for 50 and I would have been fine with it. “It’ll probably take me a few, couple weeks maybe to feel like myself, but just wanted to get out there and get up and down the floor more than anything.” Nance, who missed 12 games after injuring his left hand, had 11 points, four rebounds and a block in 28 minutes. Collin Sexton scored 19 points, which proved inconsequential in a game that saw New Orleans take a 100-60 lead with about seven minutes remaining. “That grit and scrap could have been better,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “You can live with some of the mistakes of guys not being used to playing with one another. We have guys who have been out for months ... but our focus needs to be on that grit and how hard we play.” New Orleans built a 21 point lead by halftime and widened that during a third quarter that saw Cleveland hit just two of 23 shots and score a total of nine points. The Cavs shot just 34.1 % (30 of 88) for the game, missing 25 of 32 from 3-point range. “They were just struggling tonight to find rhythm and all that sort of stuff,"" Adams said of the Cavs. ""But we’ll take a bloody win.” Williamson's highlights included an alley-oop dunk over Love and a reverse layup as he was fouled by Love. Williamson later added a floater after drawing a foul from JaVale McGee with an in-air ball fake. The first-time Pelicans All-Star also mixed in a couple of the feisty put-backs for which he's become known since making his NBA debut in the middle of last season. Ingram hit three 3-pointers, added some mid-range jumpers and also attacked the rim, most notably when sank a left-handed finger-roll off the glass after soaring across the paint. Pelicans reserve center Jaxson Hayes scored all of his season-high 13 points in the first half, highlighted by a pair of alley-oop dunks.

We actually really struggled from the perimeter. We did it with our defense and our rebounding tonight.”","401307364"
"Chris Silva meets Wendell Carter Jr. at the rim and rejects his dunk attempt. (0:21) CHICAGO -- — Jimmy Butler scored 28 points against his former team, Goran Dragic added 20 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, and the Miami Heat beat the Chicago Bulls 101-90 Friday night for their ninth win in 10 games. Butler, who played his first six seasons in Chicago, scored 25 through the first three quarters. The five-time All-Star was more than willing to let Dragic take over from there. “I knew it was Goran's time,” said Butler, who had eight assists. “He had made a couple shots earlier. He was getting into the paint at will so it was time for him to take it up a notch.” Butler implored Dragic to be more aggressive. And he sure did assert himself down the stretch. Dragic made three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and shot 4 of 8 in the game. He shot 9 of 15 overall and finished one point shy of his season high, helping Miami come out on top on a night when both teams looked as if they were finishing back-to-backs. “We needed it,” coach Erik Spoelstra said. “This game was in the mud. Back-to-backs, they are what they are. Both teams had to deal with it. ... This was a game you just had to stay the course, have some mental toughness. Guys had to make some plays. And Goran was just sensational, obviously, in that fourth quarter.” The Heat improved to 20-18 after moving above .500 for the first time this season by beating Orlando on Thursday. The Bulls delivered another sluggish performance coming off a blowout loss a night earlier to Philadelphia with Sixers Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons unavailable due to contact tracing. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 30 points. Lauri Markkanen scored 20 in his second game back after missing more than a month because of a sprained right shoulder. The Bulls lost for the fourth time in five games. “I wanted to try to set the tone because I knew they were gonna be physical,” LaVine said. “That's their whole identity. I just tried to match it and tried to get us off to a good start.” CARRYING MIAMI Dragic said he was “passive” in the first half. He credited the Bulls and Tomas Satoransky in particular. “Jimmy told me at one point, Hey G, we need you to be more aggressive and to be more involved,” Dragic said. He certainly delivered in the fourth. Dragic scored eight in a row in a span of just over a minute early in the quarter, hitting two foul shots and back-to-back 3s to turn a one-point lead into an 81-72 advantage with 8:50 remaining in the game. He added 12 more in a stretch of about three minutes, capped by a 3 with 3:26 left to make it 96-82. “Goran can get like that,” Butler said. “Feed the hot hand. The game's simple.” TIP-INS Heat: Miami has won four straight in Chicago. ... The Heat were without C Bam Adebayo (knee) and G Avery Bradley (calf) as well as F Meyers Leonard, who was suspended Thursday by the NBA and fined $50,000 for using an anti-Semitic slur. Adebayo missed his third game in a row, while Bradley has not played since Feb. 3. Bulls: F Garrett Temple walked off the court with an ankle injury after fouling Dragic early in the fourth and is scheduled for an MRI on Saturday, coach Billy Donovan said. ... Chicago had six turnovers in the first quarter after giving the ball away seven times in the opening period against Philadelphia on Thursday. ... Otto Porter Jr. was scoreless in 12 minutes in his second game back. He had been sidelined since Feb. 1 because of back spasms.","401307365"
"Spurs' Keldon Johnson goes right down the lane for the ferocious one-handed jam. (0:18) SAN ANTONIO -- — San Antonio played its first home game with fans and welcomed back four players who sat almost a month due to COVID-19 protocols. Basketball life is starting to return to normal for the Spurs even as they face more change. Rudy Gay had 19 points, Dejounte Murray and Derrick White each added 17 and theSpurs overcame a sluggish start to beat the short-handed Orlando Magic 104-77 on Friday night. San Antonio held an opponent under 80 points for the first time since beating Golden State 89-75 on March 19, 2018. “We just picked it up,” White said. “Started with Patty (Mills) and Dejounte (defensively). Those two really set the tone for us and we all just rallied behind them.” The Spurs opened the AT&amp;T Center to the public for the first time since beating Dallas on March 10, 2020, the day before the league shutdown operations due to COVID-19. Seating was limited to 3,200. “It’s awesome,” White said about the fans. “We feed off their energy. They helped us out when we started off a little slow.” Nikola Vucevic had 26 points and nine rebounds for the Magic in their seventh straight loss. They had seven players out with injury or illness. “Part of it tonight was we had nine guys play big minutes,” Vucevic said. “They were just pressing us, getting to the ball. It wasn’t easy.” Gay and White, along with Keldon Johnson and Devin Vassell, all were forced to sit out due to the league’s health and safety protocols after contracting or coming in contact with COVID-19. Johnson returned March 2, Gay and White were back Wednesday and Vassell returned against Orlando. The quartet combined for 55 points on 20-for-36 shooting. “To be honest with you, in Dallas, I was a little bit more excited than I was out of breath,” Gay said. “Just being back on the court. The nerves were out of me with this game.” Gay was 5 for 9 from the field. While that quartet returned fully, San Antonio was without veterans DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge. DeRozan left the team to attend funeral services for his father, Frank, who died Feb. 19 after a prolonged illness. San Antonio is attempting to trade Aldridge after agreeing to part ways with the veteran forward after his role was lessened. Orlando opened with a 7-0 run and extended that advantage to 29-16 while shooting 5 for 10 on 3-pointers. Dwayne Bacon finished with 15 points, shooting 3 for 8 on 3-pointers. Orlando, which was without Aaron Gordon, did not have any other player score in double figures. “It’s hard,” Vucevic said. “We have players playing out of position.” San Antonio closed the first half on a 14-2 run and took its first lead and extending it to 47-39 to close the second quarter. The Spurs scored the first six points of the second half to extend that run. Orlando was held to 10 points in the second quarter, the 19th lowest output in any quarter by a San Antonio opponent under Popovich. “More intensity, more competitiveness, more grunt,” Popovich said. TIP-INS Magic: Gordon sat out as he continues to rehab a left ankle injury that kept him out of 15 straight games. … Orlando was also without Terrence Ross (sore left knee), Cole Anthony (fractured right rib), James Ennis III (sore left calf), Evan Fournier (strained left groin), Markelle Fultz (torn left ACL), and Jonathan Isaac (left knee rehabilitation). … Rookie forward Chuma Okeke had eight points in his first career start. Okeke previously appeared in 21 of 37 games, averaging 4.5 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 0.4 blocks in 22 minutes. Spurs: Devin Vassell played for the first time since Feb. 14. The rookie forward was one of five players sidelined due to contracting or coming in contact with COVID-19. … San Antonio is 16-2 when leading by 10 points at any time in the game.","401307366"
"Kevin Porter Jr. races down the court and beats Derrick Favors to the basket to make a difficult reverse layup at an awkward angle. (0:19) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Utah Jazz returned with a win, though not one they felt like celebrating. “We didn’t do a good job tonight and I guess it’s a good thing we won but we have to be better,” Donovan Mitchell said. Mitchell had 28 points, eight assists and seven rebounds, and the Jazz opened the second half of the season by beating the Houston Rockets 114-99 on Friday night. “Very poor on a lot of levels,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""We gave up the paint, gave up everything, gave up 3s. We were lucky they didn’t make more shots, because we were porous defensively. … They had everything they wanted on the offensive glass. We turned it over 20 times. There wasn’t a lot that we did well tonight,” he said. The only bright spot Snyder allowed was: “We executed the last three minutes.” Playing for the first time since March 3, the NBA leaders handed the Rockets their 15th straight loss. Mike Conley added 20 points and Rudy Gobert had 14 points, 13 rebounds and six blocks as the Jazz got back on track after dropping their final two games of the first half. Bojan Bogdanovic and Jordan Clarkson each scored 15 but the Jazz needed a late run to close out the Rockets. Kevin Porter Jr. scored a season-high 27 points for Houston. He was 1 of 9 from 3-point range and 11 of 25 overall. Sterling Brown and Kenyon Martin Jr. each had 15 points. “They were playing free, without John (Wall), without Christian (Wood) without Vic (Oladipo) — they were playing free, and they were coming to attack us. Everybody’s coming to attack us and we got to be ready,” Mitchell said. The Rockets’ slump is their longest since losing 15 straight in 2001. Houston’s last win came Feb. 4 against Memphis. After losing three of four games before the All-Star break, the Jazz were looking to recapture the form that won them 22 of 24 games and vaulted them to the top of the NBA standings. The short-handed Rockets had just nine healthy players — most of whom had been at the end of the bench or out of the league this year — but the Jazz still looked disjointed and rusty at times. After falling behind by 23 in the third quarter, the Rockets cut the lead to 94-90 early in the fourth on Jae’Sean Tate’s 3-pointer and David Nwaba’s layup. “We were getting big stops, rebounding, even though we were undersized. I thought we did a good job just fighting and just staying positive,” Nwaba said. During the 16-2 run, the ragtag Rockets forced three Jazz misses in a row and then a trio of turnovers to make their comeback. “We have group of guys that play hard and just leave it on the floor. We knew they were the No. 1 team in the West. We have young talent and we just tried to go out and show what we can do without everybody,” Martin said. After watching the Rockets’ unlikely rally from the bench, Mitchell returned to the court with a flourish, assisting on 3-pointers by Clarkson and Royce O’Neale to build the lead back to double digits but then got hit in the chest on his next drive, fell to the court and slowly made his way to the bench during the ensuing timeout. He continued playing but only scored one point the rest of the way. The Jazz finished the game on a 12-3 surge, highlighted by Conley’s timely playmaking and Gobert’s defense. Meanwhile, the weary Rockets missed 10 of the final 11 field goal attempts. Justin Patton had a career-high 13 points for Houston. Already down to nine players, McLemore, Tate and Brown all had at least two fouls with 3:46 left in the first quarter as the Jazz repeatedly drove to the basket. The Rockets stopped fouling but also ceased defending effectively. By halftime, Mitchell had 18 points and the Jazz had made 19 of 21 free throws to take a 65-48 lead. TIP-INS Rockets: Coach Stephen Silas unsuccessfully challenged a foul where Porter bumped Mitchell on a drive with 3:12 left. … The Rockets outscored the Jazz on second-chance points, 24-9, on 19 offensive rebounds. … The Rockets went 9 for 43 on 3-point shots and just 8 for 13 from the free throw line. Jazz: Utah now allows 5,600 fans in the arena, up from the 3,900 capacity before the break. … Veteran forward Ersan Ilyasova, who hasn’t played in the NBA this season, joined the Jazz during the All-Star break but didn’t play Friday. … The Jazz had 20 turnovers, including several unforced. DEPLECTED RANKS The Rockets were without Wood (ankle), Wall (knee), Danuel House Jr. (knee), and Eric Gordon (groin). Gordon planned to undergo an MRI in Utah and early reports predicted him out for a month or more. Less than four days after his release, rookie guard Mason Jones was back in uniform on a 10-day contract signed the day of the game. LONGTIME MASSAGE THERAPIST’S DEATH AFFECTS JAZZ Doug Birrell, who was a massage therapist for the Jazz for more than 20 seasons and a personal therapist for John Stockton and Karl Malone for years before that, died this week at age 51 from cancer. Players said his passing affected them, especially those who have been with the team for a few seasons. He had an enthusiastic and fun personality that was a big part of the organization off the court. Joe Ingles said, “It was a tough week. Doug has been such a massive part of our organization for 21 years and to not have him with us for the first time is extremely sad. It’s not an excuse but I was thinking about it a lot.”","401307367"
"Lakers coach Frank Vogel says the team will continue to be patient with Anthony Davis' recovery from tendinosis and a calf strain in his right leg. (0:20) LOS ANGELES -- — Kyle Kuzma scored 15 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter, LeBron James added 18 points and 10 assists, and the Los Angeles Lakers rallied late for a 105-100 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. Montrezl Harrell had 17 points and Kuzma added 13 rebounds as the defending NBA champions returned from the All-Star break with just their fourth win in 11 games. Los Angeles trailed by 12 points early in the fourth quarter before Kuzma led a strong rally to keep the Pacers winless against the Lakers at Staples Center since November 2015. Kuzma went 5 for 8 with two 3-pointers and four rebounds in the fourth. “It’s all about growth, and the game has just slowed down every year for him,” James said. ""He knows his role with this team and he does it to a high level, and tonight was another example of that.” Malcolm Brogdon scored 23 of his 29 points in the first half for the Pacers, who opened a three-game road trip with their 11th loss in 16 games. Domantas Sabonis added 20 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists, but Indiana wilted down the stretch. “I thought there was a four-minute stretch there where we let it get away from us,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. The Pacers still had the ball at midcourt down 103-100 with 9.9 seconds left, but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope stole Brogdon's inbounds pass and hit two free throws to ice it. “I saw the opening to get the steal, so I tried to get in front of him,” Caldwell-Pope said. “We needed stops. They kept going on their runs, and we needed more energy. Rebounding the ball and getting out in transition is what we’re best at. I think we did it over the last few minutes.” “They knew the play,” Brogdon said. “They switched to deny it. I just threw a bad pass.” Brogdon lit up the Lakers for 18 points in the first quarter. Indiana had an 86-74 lead early in the fourth, but the Lakers made a 22-4 run and seized the lead on Kuzma's back-to-back 3-pointers. Los Angeles won without starters Anthony Davis and Marc Gasol. Davis missed his 10th consecutive game and will be out for at least two more weeks with leg injuries, while Marc Gasol is still out under the NBA’s health and safety protocols. TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana went 7 for 20 with seven turnovers in the fourth quarter. ... LA-area native Justin Holiday went 1 for 10 on 3-pointers, scoring five points. Lakers: Alex Caruso was sidelined with a bruise on his head during the first half. ... Damian Jones scored seven points in his second start for Los Angeles. The big man signed a second 10-day contract Thursday. LEVERT'S RETURN After the game, Caris LeVert said he will make his Pacers debut Saturday at Phoenix. LeVert underwent surgery in late January to remove a cancerous growth from his kidney nine days after he was traded to Indiana from Brooklyn in the James Harden/Victor Oladipo trade. The Pacers have been cautious with LeVert's recovery, but he is eager to help his struggling new team. “It’s been a while, and I miss the game for sure,” LeVert said. “I always saw the light at the end of the tunnel. I knew the pain I was feeling after the surgery, that wouldn’t last forever. I knew this day would come where I felt up to playing again. I’ve got a great support system with my family and my teammates. ... It’s just going to be a joy to play the game tomorrow. I’m sure it’ll be a great night for all of us.”","401307368"
"Immanuel Quickley puts a move on his defender and splashes a long 3-ball for the Knicks. (0:18) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — RJ Barrett scored a career-high 32 points and Julius Randle had a triple-double to lead the New York Knicks past the Oklahoma City Thunder 119-97 on Saturday. Randle finished with 26 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists. The Knicks trailed by nine after one quarter with the Thunder shooting 70.6% from the floor, but they outscored the Thunder 97-66 over the final 36 minutes. Al Horford had 16 points to lead seven Oklahoma City players in double figures. The Knicks overcame the deficit by forcing 18 turnovers while committing just 10 of their own. New York also outrebounded Oklahoma City 45-40 and grabbed seven more offensive boards than the Thunder. “Obviously, we started the game slowly,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “That was a big concern, particularly with the early start. But we responded well after that, and I thought we played strong in the second half. I thought our willingness to share the ball, once we got our defense going, it got us into the open floor and we were able to get some good scoring opportunities.” The Knicks were coming off their worst defensive performance of the season, a 134-101 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday. Following a challenging opening quarter, the Knicks held the Thunder to just 42.4% from the floor in the last three periods. “In Milwaukee, we weren’t really us,” Barrett said. “We didn’t feel like we played as hard as we could. Today, we just tried to show who we are. Just be tough on both ends of the floor.” The Thunder, missing leading scorer Shai Gilgeous Alexander, started fast with Luguentz Dort scoring eight of his 14 points in the first frame. The Thunder couldn’t sustain their pace though, and the Knicks took command in the second quarter, outscoring Oklahoma City 34-23 to take a two-point lead into halftime. Oklahoma City briefly retook the lead at the start of the third quarter, but it wouldn’t last. Barrett knocked down a 3-pointer with 10:19 left in the quarter and the Knicks led the rest of the way. RARE COMPANY Randle became the first Knick to post two triple-doubles in the same season since Mark Jackson in the 1988-89 season. When asked about the accomplishment, Thibodeau was admittedly surprised it had been that long since a Knick notched two triple-doubles in the same season, but he complimented the first-time All-Star’s play in his seventh NBA season. “Julius had a monster game,” Thibodeau said. “To score the way he did, the assists, the all-around play, I think that’s what leaders do. This season, the numbers speak for themselves, but his impact on winning is huge. His leadership has been terrific.” BIG ADJUSTMENT Oklahoma City’s 7-foot-2 center, Moses Brown, played a career-high 27 minutes off the bench and frequently drew attention from the Knicks’ defense in the low post “It’s only his second real game of NBA minutes, and he continues to be pretty productive and a factor,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “It was interesting to see the amount of bodies that they committed to him on the offensive end.” Brown nearly posted a double-double with nine points and nine rebounds in just his second game since he was called up from his G-League assignment with the Oklahoma City Blue. TIP-INS Thunder: Isaiah Roby returned to the team’s starting five. He finished with 10 points on 5-of-8 shooting. … The Thunder move to 2-7 in the first game of a back-to-back and 11-18 when their opponent scores more than 100 points. Knicks: Nerlens Noel received a warm welcome from the Thunder public address when starters were announced Saturday afternoon. Noel, who played for Oklahoma City the past two seasons, posted eight rebounds and two points. … Elfrid Payton (hamstring), Austin Rivers (personal) and Derrick Rose (COVID-19 health protocols) were unavailable. … Frank Ntilikina started for the second time this season. He had one assist and no points in seven minutes.","401307369"
"James Harden shows his surprise at the postgame news conference when informed that he passed Larry Bird on the all-time scoring list. (0:49) NEW YORK -- — James Harden scored 12 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter and had his ninth triple-double with the Nets to help Brooklyn beat the Detroit Pistons 100-95 on Saturday night. Harden also added 10 rebounds and 10 assists in his 55th triple-double as Brooklyn improved to 26-13 with its 12th win in its last 16 games. “I play the game the right way,” Harden said, “and hopefully good things happen for me.” Kyrie Irving added 18 points and Landry Shamet had 15 off the bench. DeAndre Jordan chipped in with 14 and Joe Harris contributed 10 points. Whereas the Nets rolling, the Pistons are stuck in neutral. “We want to win these types of games,"" said Delon Wright, who finished with 13. Jerami Grant scored 22 points as Detroit fell to 10-28. Saddiq Bey chipped in with 13. Mason Plumlee added 11 and Rodney McGruder had 10. “It's a good thing that we're staying close in these games,” Wright said. The second of three regular-season matchups between the Eastern Conference teams was Brooklyn’s chance to get even for its 122-111 loss in Detroit on Feb. 9. That loss was part of a stretch in which the Nets dropped three of four. Thirteen games later, the Nets have jelled into a legitimate championship contender while Detroit has myriad weaknesses, such as 3-point shooting. After Wayne Ellington knocked down a 3 about 2 1/2 minutes into the game, the Pistons missed 19 straight 3-point attempts until Wright’s straightaway attempt from 26 feet out 4:42 into the third quarter ended the drought. “We have to make shots,” Wright said. “We got good looks so that's a good thing. We just have to knock them down.” The Nets only had 61-60 lead after Grant’s layup with 4:31 left in the third, but then ended the quarter on a 17-6 run. But the Pistons would not go away. Detroit outscored Brooklyn 25-12 over the first 9:01 of the fourth quarter to take a 91-90 lead on Plumlee’s putback dunk. “We have a chance to to extend the lead,” Wright said. “We didn't just come away with it.” Harden made two free throws which allowed Brooklyn to regain the lead and after Plumlee tied the game with a made free throw of his own, Harden connected on a layup and a floater on consecutive possessions. Bey made one of two free throws to cut Brooklyn’s lead to 96-93 but Harden's floater extended the advantage to five. After Detroit sliced the deficit to 98-95 on Plumlee's layup, Harden knocked down two free throws to put away the game. “We're more than capable of winning basketball games different ways,” Harden said. “We can be a team that's making shots and everything is going smooth or we can be a team that (has to) get down and do the dirty work. ...We held them to 95 (points). That's great defense. Our shot wasn't falling but we found a way to win. I think that's going to be key going into the postseason because everything isn't going to be sweet.” TIP-INS: Pistons: Before the game, Detroit formally announced the acquisition of Hamidou Diallo in a trade with Oklahoma City for Svi Mykhailiuk and a future second-round pick. Diallo, 22 is averaging 11.9 points on 48.1% shooting from the field in 32 games this season “He’s a wing defender,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “He can guard one through three, four, the smaller fours. He’s an excellent wing runner. Quick, athletic, probably one of the most athletic wings in the league.” NETS: Brooklyn has won 19 of 26 games following the four-team blockbuster trade on Jan. 14 in which the Nets acquired Harden. “The wins speak for themselves but moreso the look and feel (of the team). It feels better,"" coach Steve Nash said. ""The care. The fight. The togetherness, connectivity. All those things.”","401307370"
"Raptors head coach Nick Nurse carelessly gets called for a technical while nicely discussing the foul with an official. (0:24) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — LaMelo Ball had 23 points and nine rebounds, and Charlotte defeated the short-handed Toronto Raptors 114-104 Saturday night in the Hornets' first game with the general public allowed to attend. Devonte Graham and Terry Rozier each added 17 points for the Hornets, who seemed to feed off having fans — about 3,000 of them — in attendance for the first time in more than a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Charlotte jumped out to a 25-4 lead and set a franchise record with 11 3-pointers in the first quarter in building a 44-24 lead. “There's no question our guys felt that energy before the game,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “It felt like NBA basketball was back tonight. Our players felt it and they played off it. It’s a credit to the energy our fans brought.” Ball, who finished 6 of 9 from 3-point range and continued to bolster his NBA rookie of the year resume, said he got excited during pregame warmups seeing and hearing fans. “It was amazing,"" Ball said. ""Every game with fans is way more fun. The intensity just rises up.” Kyle Lowry finished with 19 points and eight assists to lead the Raptors, who lost their fourth straight game without Pascal Siakam, Fred Van Vleet, Patrick McCaw, OG Anunoby and Malachi Flynn due to health and safety protocols. Coach Nick Nurse said he believes all five players will miss Sunday's game against the Chicago Bulls as well. Ball, Rozier and Graham each had three 3s in the opening quarter and combined for 15 in the game. “They got pretty much everything they wanted (in the first quarter) and it seemed like they weren't missing a 3,” Raptors forward DeAndre' Bembry said. Ball made one notable highlight reel 3-pointer when he caught a look-ahead pass from P.J. Washington in the corner, did a 360-degree turn to avoid a defender and still knocked down the shot. “That is just how he plays,” Graham said of Ball. “It doesn’t surprise me.” Malik Monk added 16 points for the Hornets (19-18), who moved above .500 for the first time since Jan. 11. This is the latest into the season the Hornets have had a winning record since the 2016-17 season. Charlotte led by 25 entering the fourth quarter and the only question at that point was if they would set a franchise record for 3-pointers. But the Hornets, who played their reserves most of the fourth quarter, made just one 3 in the fourth quarter and finished the game 21 of 49 from beyond the arc. TIP INS Raptors: Chris Boucher needed three stitches in his lip after taking a shot during the second half. ... Were outrebounded 51-46. Hornets: Rozier left the game late in the third quarter with a lower left leg contusion. With the Hornets comfortably ahead, he did not return. ... Were 16 of 30 from 3-point range in the first half. ... Committed a season-high 28 turnovers and 30 assists. GRAHAM OFF THE BENCH This was Graham's best game since returning from a knee injury. “He looked much more comfortable out there and his shot looked much more in rhythm,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “It’s great to have him back. It’s great for our spirit. Borrego said he has no worries that Graham — who has been replaced by Ball in the starting lineup — will play well in a reserve role. “He’s not fighting it, he’s embracing it,” Borrego said. “He feels comfortable in that role. I have no worries that he can handle this role.”","401307371"
"Jrue Holiday passes to Giannis Antetokounmpo in transition, who gets to the bucket for a tough layup plus the foul. (0:19) WASHINGTON -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 33 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds for his sixth triple-double of the season to help the Milwaukee Bucks to a 125-119 victory over the short-handed Washington Wizards on Saturday night. Jrue Holiday added 10 of his 18 points during the fourth quarter for the third-place Bucks, who have won eight of nine to move a game-and-a-half back of second-place Brooklyn and two behind Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference standings. And Khris Middleton sank four crucial late free throws as part of his 16 points and also helped get a key late stop on defense for Milwaukee. “For the last minute, (it's) can you execute now? Can you find the open guy? Can you make the tough shot? Can you get a stop?” Antetokounmpo said. “We were able to do that today, and I’m happy, I’m very happy. And hopefully we can carry over to the next game.” Russell Westbrook scored 42 points — including 15 of Washington's last 18 — and added 10 rebounds and 12 assists while posting his NBA-leading 11th triple-double. Rui Hachimura added 29 points and 11 rebounds, but Washington lost its third straight while resting All-Star guard Bradley Beal with a sore left knee. “I thought we played hard,” Westbrook said. “When you play hard you give yourself a chance to win the game. I thought we did that from the get-go.” Westbrook twice helped Washington fight back from multiple-possession deficits inside the final six minutes, and his 3 from the left wing tied it at 119-all with 41 seconds left. “I don't think we were terrible, I don't think we were great,” said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. “If there was anybody that was great tonight, it was Westbrook.” Middleton answered with a pair of free throws, and defended as Westbrook missed a contested driving layup on the other end. Middleton added two more foul shots with 9.4 seconds left to increase the lead to four, Hachimura’s 3 attempt from the left wing rimmed out, and Holiday’s free throws sealed the game. “I was just trying to keep him front, not foul him and try to contest.” Middleton said of his late sequence guarding Westbrook. “At the end of the day, I just wanted him to shoot the shot over me instead of blowing by me.” TIP-INS Bucks: Improved to 2-10 when shooting worse from the floor than their opponent. ...

"Clint Capela posts up against Nemanja Bjelica and drains the easy two points down low. (0:18) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 17 of 28 points in the third quarter, Clint Capela had 18 of his 24 in the first half, and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Sacramento Kings 121-106 on Saturday night for their fourth straight victory. The Hawks improved to 4-0 under interim coach Nate McMillan, using a 24-2 run in the first half to overcome a 14-point deficit — taking a 46-35 lead on Kevin Huerter’s corner 3. “You don’t want to be satisfied with just winning four in a row, but anytime you can win a game in this league, we’re going to take it,"" Young said. “This was a big win for us."" Capela’s 25th double-double included 14 boards for the NBA's rebounding leader. De’Aaron Fox finished with 32 points for the Kings, who began the night with three wins in five games since dropping nine straight last month. Richaun Holmes scored 20 for Sacramento. Young’s 3 from the right wing put the Hawks up 15 early in the third. Young followed with consecutive 3s coming out of a timeout to make it 81-64. A couple of minutes later, Danilo Gallinari hit a short runner to give the Hawks a 19-point lead. Atlanta led by as many as 23. “Until we realize and until we get better at playing defense, it’s going to be hard to win,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. “Tonight it’s like, I can point at a lot of things we can do better, and that’s pretty much every game, but we shot 20% from 3. Most nights that’s not going to happen, but the message to our guys is, ‘Listen, we can’t just rely on scoring to either stay in games or win games.' ""Right now, that’s kind of what we’re doing most nights out."" Sacramento pulled within 10 with 5:03 remaining on Fox’s layup, but the Kings got no closer. The Kings took their first double-digit lead on Fox’s pair of free throws midway through the first and were up 33-22 entering the second. Sacramento missed 11 of its first 13 shots beyond the arc. Atlanta was no better, going 0 for 7 early in the second, but Capela and Rajon Rondo got hot, and the Hawks kept adding momentum. The Hawks never trailed after Rondo’s 3 made it 36-35. John Collins scored 16 for Atlanta. Gallinari had 15 points and Rondo 10. “You’re not going to play a perfect game for 48 minutes, and we got off to slow start,"" McMillan said. “We gave up 33 points in that first quarter, 30 in the third. We don’t want to give up 30-point quarters, but we continue to stay with it. We continue to believe, continue to work together and we’ve been able to find a way by getting stops defensively and executing on the offensive end of the floor.""

"Carmelo Anthony scores 24 points, passing Hakeem Olajuwon for 11th on the all-time scoring list, as the Blazers fend off the Timberwolves. (0:48) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Carmelo Anthony scored 26 points and Damian Lillard added 25 points and 10 assists as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 125-121 on Saturday night. Enes Kanter had 20 points and 11 rebounds for Portland. Karl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 34 points and 10 rebounds, while rookie Anthony Edwards had 21 points and eight boards. The Timberwolves have lost 14 of 16 and are 1-6 under new coach Chris Finch. Anthony, who passed Hakeem Olajuwon for 11th place on the NBA’s career scoring list, shot 7 of 12 from the field and went 8 for 8 from the free throw line. But his biggest play of the night was a pass that helped the Blazers seal the victory. Leading by three in the final minute, Portland worked the ball around to Anthony at the top of the key. He immediately fired a pass to Derrick Jones Jr. alone under the hoop for a dunk that sunk Minnesota’s comeback hopes. “I knew DJ was in the corner before the ball even swung to me, and I know what he likes to do — he likes to cut back door,” Anthony said. “I’m just playing off of instincts. If somebody had stepped over, I would’ve made the pass to the corner. It’s just playing off instincts and trying to make the right play.” It’s a play the Blazers have become accustomed to seeing from Anthony. “Melo’s a savvy vet,” Jones said. “He knows the reads to make and what to do on the floor. … It was a great pass. I just had to finish it.” Lillard, the NBA’s third-leading scorer at 29.9 points per game, was held to 10 on 2-of-6 shooting in the first half, but Portland still led 66-57 at the break, thanks in part to Anthony’s 10 points off the bench. “Having a guy like Melo on nights like this, he can really get it going,” Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “To have a guy who can get you 26 points off the bench is a luxury.” Towns scored 13 points in the first 6 1/2 minutes of the second half, including nine in a 12-0 run that tied the game at 76. Portland quickly regained control, as Lillard hit a long 2-pointer and set up Gary Trent Jr. for a 3 that put the Blazers up 83-76. But the Timberwolves wouldn’t go away. Naz Reid, giving Towns a breather, scored six points and Jaden McDaniels hit a 3-pointer with 4.6 seconds left in the quarter to give Minnesota a 94-93 lead heading into the fourth. “I think we played well in stretches, but one thing we’ve struggled with all year long is being able to sustain that level of focus, that level of high-quality play,” Lillard said. “This might’ve been a game where we go to the hotel (angry), but we got it done. In the end, we got the job done, and that shows growth.” CLIMBING THE LIST When Anthony hit a 3 with 8:37 to play, it didn’t just tie the game at 101. The basket also moved him past Olajuwon. “I always say he’s a Hall of Fame player, and every game we give him a game ball for passing someone on the charts,” Lillard said of Anthony, who at 36 is in his second season with the Blazers and 18th overall in the NBA. Anthony has 26,955 career points. Next up on the list is another Rockets big man, Elvin Hayes, with 27,313 points. “It’s a great feeling to know that I’m still able to do this and continue to have an opportunity to move on that list,” Anthony said. “Any time anyone can start creeping up on a top-10 list, that’s when things start getting special.” TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Kanter matched his season average of 12 points per game in the first eight minutes. … Lillard is the only player in the NBA this season averaging at least 29 points and seven assists. Timberwolves: Jaylen Nowell, who scored a career-high 28 points on Thursday in a victory over New Orleans, followed that performance with 17 points in 28 minutes off the bench. … Minnesota continues to play without its second-leading scorer, guard Malik Beasley, who is serving a 12-game suspension after pleading guilty to a felony count of threats of violence stemming from an incident in September. Beasley is eligible to return on March 27. He’s averaging 20.5 points per game.","401307374"
"After a slow start to the season, Jamal Murray has turned things around and has the Nuggets looking like legitimate contenders. (1:33) DENVER -- — Luka Doncic had 21 points and 12 assists, and Kristaps Porzingis scored 25 points to lead the Dallas Mavericks to a 116-103 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night. Nikola Jokic finished with 26 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds for the Nuggets, who had their five-game winning streak snapped. Michael Porter Jr. scored 17 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and Will Barton also had 23 for Denver. The Nuggets were coming off a 103-102 victory in Memphis on Friday night and got into town early Saturday. Coach Michael Malone said there was an issue with the team’s COVID-19 testing in the morning, which impacted Denver’s energy against Dallas. “They tested in the morning, and because of a mistake (the players) had to come back to the arena, probably between 12 and 1, which I’m sure messed up a lot of their game-day routines,” Malone said. “The bottom line, especially that second and third quarter, we did not play nearly well enough on either end of the floor.” The Nuggets looked fresh early, scoring the first 10 points of the game, but the Mavericks recovered to trail by one after the first quarter and outscored Denver 33-22 in the second. “You take away the first three minutes of the game, it was a very good effort,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. The Mavericks led by seven early in the third and pulled away from long range. Dallas was 9 of 18 on 3-pointers in the period and took just six shots from inside the arc. Josh Richardson hit all three of his 3-point attempts and Maxi Kleber made both of his, including one at the end of the period to put the Mavericks ahead 93-73. Richardson finished with 20 points. “They started getting offensive rebounds and they just started playing harder than us,” Porter said. “Just a bad night all around. We’ve got to bounce back. We’ll be all right.” The Nuggets got within 14 on Porter’s 12 straight points. Dallas pushed the lead back to 18 but Jokic and Porter hit 3-pointers to make it 105-93. The Nuggets couldn’t get any closer and Porzingis hit a deep 3-pointer with 2:24 left to put the Mavericks up 17. “When he’s rolling on both ends it gives us a lot of energy,” Richardson said. “He’s blocking shots, he can score from anywhere, and even when he’s not scoring he understands he draws doubles and he’s a good teammate. These last few weeks he’s been great for us.” TIP-INS Mavericks: Porzingis and Doncic were back in the lineup after sitting out at Oklahoma City on Thursday night. ... Dallas won the season series with Denver 2-1, with both of the victories coming on the road. Nuggets: G Monte Morris (quad strain) was inactive.

F JaMychal Green returned to action after missing seven games with a shoulder injury and another with a stomach issue. He had five points. COLD FRONT Jamal Murray had another tough shooting night, going 4 for 13 from the floor a night after missing 13 of 14 shots. Murray made just one shot in the first half and finished with 10 points Malone isn’t worried about his guard’s recent slump. “Prior to a 1-for-14 outing, Jamal’s numbers and consistency have been remarkable,” Malone said. “Obviously, we know he is going to get back to that.”","401307375"

Doug McDermott added 22 points for the Pacers, who improved to 17-20. Sabonis also had four steals and a block and shot 9 of 13 from the field. Caris LeVert made his much-anticipated Indiana debut following surgery to remove a mass on his kidney. He was in the starting lineup and played well, scoring 13 points in 27 minutes. The Pacers were efficient on offense, shooting 53% from the field, but McDermott said the team's success started on defense. The Suns had 16 turnovers and Indiana turned them into several easy baskets. “Sometimes guys are hanging their heads on offense because shots aren’t falling,” McDermott said. “I think the main thing you can do to get your offense going is bringing energy on the defensive end and we were able to do that.” Devin Booker had 20 points and Dario Saric came off the bench to score 17 for the Suns, who had their five-game winning streak snapped and fell to 25-12. The Suns led 33-29 after the first quarter but the Pacers opened the second with a 12-0 run, hitting five of their first six shots to take a 41-33 advantage in the first three minutes. The Pacers had a 62-57 lead at halftime. Phoenix went cold in the third quarter, hitting only seven shots in 22 attempts. The Pacers capitalized, taking a 97-77 lead into the fourth. In the final period, the closest the Suns got was nine. “They were a bit more urgent and desperate than we were tonight from the jump,” Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. “We had it in spurts but they had it more consistently.” Indiana acquired LeVert on Jan. 16 as part of a four-team trade that sent James Harden to Brooklyn and Victor Oladipo to Houston. It was during the post-trade physical that a mass on LeVert’s left kidney was discovered. Tests showed it was a renal cell carcinoma and LeVert had surgery on Jan. 26 to remove the mass. “Today was maybe my second time going 5-on-5 since everything happened,” LeVert said. “A little bit of heavy legs and the condition and everything like that, but that will come back.” Prior to the trade, the 6-foot-6 LeVert averaged 18.5 points and six assists in 12 games with the Nets this season. “It was great to see him back out there. The players really enjoyed him being there and the things he can do,"" Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. ""You can see he is dynamic with the basketball. That was just the beginning. He did a lot of nice things. I thought he looked great out there.” TIP-INS Pacers: Improved to 10-9 on the road. … Indiana is 5-3 when playing on the second night of a back-to-back. … The last time Indiana lost in Phoenix was January 2014.

Gilgeous-Alexander, who missed Saturday’s 119-97 loss to the Knicks with a left quad contusion, went 8 for 17 from the field. The Thunder had seven players score in double figures and shot a season-high 57.5% from the floor, including 16 of 31 from 3-point range. “I thought we showed really good resilience there,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “The first thing we weathered was right out of halftime, (the Grizzlies’ lead) went to 12 and got a little dicey. We just played through it, got a couple of stops. Turned the game a little bit and got it back under control.” Ja Morant had 22 points and seven assists for Memphis, which lost for the third time in four games. Dillon Brooks scored 19 points, and Jonas Valanciunas had 16 points and 14 rebounds. The Grizzlies opened a 102-90 lead on Justise Winslow’s driving layup early in the fourth quarter.

Darius Miller added another 3 to push the Thunder ahead by four on their next possession. The Grizzlies never recovered, allowing 38 fourth-quarter points. “We give them a lot of credit, I thought the Thunder played great today,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. “We couldn’t get in a rhythm, I felt, offensively. We put them on the free-throw line too much. ... They got hot, you gotta give them credit.” AHEAD OF HIS TIME The 19-year-old Pokusevski, who made five 3-pointers, became the second-youngest player in NBA history to make five-or-more 3s in a single game. He trails LeBron James, who achieved the mark in 2003. The 7-foot Pokusevski also grabbed 10 rebounds in his third game since he was called up from his G-League assignment with the Oklahoma City Blue. “Now he knows what a game like tonight feels like, which gives him confidence,"" Daigneault said. “So, the next time he takes a step back, which he will, it’s part of development and it’s a part of competition, he’ll know that he can turn a corner.

Green also had four steals in his second triple-double of the season. Stephen Curry had 32 points with six 3-pointers to go with nine assists. “Now it matters what we do coming out of it,” Green said. “This could be a turning point.” Andrew Wiggins added 28 points as Golden State returned home for a rare Sunday matinee at Chase Center, where the Warriors had played just one time over the previous 24 days. Rudy Gobert had 24 points and a career-high 28 rebounds for Utah (28-10), which became the league's last team to reach double-digit losses. “I think he’s keeping his focus and there’s times when Rudy can let what’s happening on one end of the floor impact the other,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""He’s just been much more consistent that that. When he does that he’s obviously very impactful.” Donovan Mitchell added 24 points, Mike Conley 23 and Jordan Clarkson 21. Utah had won the last five against Golden State and two in a row on the Warriors' home floor. The Warriors won for the first time since Feb. 26 against Charlotte, a stretch that included an embarrassing road 130-104 loss to the Clippers on Thursday night as the team returned from the All-Star break. “A big part of competing is learning how to bounce back from losing,” coach Steve Kerr said. Curry shot 6 for 9 from deep after he went 1 of 8 on against the Clippers on the heels of winning the 3-point contest at the All-Star Game. Kerr wanted to see energy from his group to keep Utah from getting comfortable. “We wanted to be the aggressor the entire night. I think when you do that you have a better chance of establishing a front, kind of a wall, a mentality, who you’re going to be,” Kerr said. “That’s how you win games, how you dig out of a four-game losing streak, with your defense.” CURRY 1 OFF TEAM ASSISTS MARK Curry is right on the cusp of the franchise record for assists.

"Ben Simmons, Dwight Howard and Tobias Harris show off their dunking skills as they complete slams. (0:24) PHILADELPHIA -- — Tobias Harris grabbed the mic and welcomed fans back to Philly. Then the 76ers put on a show to make up for the 368-day wait. Ben Simmons flexed after a dunk, Dwight Howard exhorted 3,071 fans to get loud as they won free ice cream and fries, and the Sixers made their home court come to life again. And they did it all without Joel Embiid. Harris scored 23 points, Seth Curry had 21 and the 76ers won their first game since Embiid was lost with an injury, beating the San Antonio Spurs 134-99 on Sunday night. It won't always be this easy without their franchise player. “We’re a great team when we have everybody,” Harris said. “This team needs everybody.” The Sixers’ hold on the top spot in the Eastern Conference appears tenuous with Embiid out for at least two weeks with a bone bruise on his left knee. Embiid had emerged as an MVP candidate, averaging 29.9 points and 11.5 rebounds in 31 games until he was injured Friday at Washington. The Sixers were relieved the injury wasn't worse than first feared. “He was happy that it isn’t as bad as a lot of people thought it was, probably including himself,” coach Doc Rivers said. “Now that he knows all it takes is rehab, he has a game plan, we have a game plan and we’re moving forward with it.” With Embiid out, the 76ers welcomed back Simmons after he missed the first two games after the All-Star break because of COVID protocols. Simmons and Embiid were set to play in the All-Star game only to learn the night before they were flagged for contact tracing. Though neither player tested positive for COVID-19, the barber they visited did. Simmons had 14 points and nine assists in the romp and the oft-maligned guard for his inability to shoot beyond 15 feet -- 4 for 31 lifetime on 3s -- has a defender in San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. “It would enhance his game, obviously. That can’t be argued with,” he said. “He’s so elite already, who gives a damn if he can’t shoot.” Simmons didn’t need to flex his long-range skills in a game the Sixers largely dominated -- and their first one in Philly with fans since the pandemic. “We missed you,” Harris told the crowd before the game. “We look forward to seeing you guys in the second half of the season and into the playoffs.” The crowd cheered and was energetic for most of the game -- breaking out a familiar anti-ref chants when calls went against the home team -- waving rally towels and dancing to the Carlton Cam. The Sixers gave them plenty of reason to have fun. The Sixers went just 1 of 3 from the free-throw line while the Spurs were 12 of 13 and still led 60-52 at the break. The reserves got the bulk of the scoring time in the second half and built a 35-point lead. The Sixers won their fifth straight game, a needed cushion without Embiid before they leave for a six-game trip later this month. “We wouldn’t bring him back earlier or later,” Rivers said. “We would bring him back when it’s time to play.” Derrick White and Drew Eubanks led the Spurs with 17 points. “They punched us in the face,” Spurs guard Dejounte Murray said. ""They didn’t let up. I felt like we just couldn’t get the ball to go in and we couldn’t get stops. That makes it hard.” Simmons waved for fans to get loud after a dunk and flexed his muscles after a bucket in the third that sent a crowd of 3,000 into as much of a frenzy as a crowd of 3,000 can get. Simmons will need to carry the load with Embiid out -- even if that means weeks or more without the big man. “We’ve got to hold it down,” Simmons said. “We’ve got all the pieces to win.” TIP-INS Spurs: DeMar DeRozan remained out of the lineup because of personal reasons. 76ers: Tony Bradley started for Embiid and scored four points ... The Sixers outscored San Antonio 46-21 in the third quarter. ... Furkan Korkmaz made all four 3s off the bench and scored 16 points. Danny Green also hit four 3s for 16.","401307379"
"Nikola Vucevic knocks down a jump shot despite being fouled by Kelly Olynyk. (0:19) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Jimmy Butler started Sunday night’s game against Orlando by winning the opening tip and ended it with a steal and win-sealing layup as the Miami Heat topped the Magic 102-97. In between, the standout guard was pretty good, too, helping the Heat win their fourth straight and for a 10th time in 11 games. “He has very disciplined gambles and I know that’s counterintuitive, but Jimmy’s a disciplined team defender’’ Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said of Butler, who had 29 points, nine assists, seven rebounds and five steals for the suddenly surging Heat. “He has a knack, that super-high IQ and that cat quickness that you can’t teach, and it surprises everybody.” Tyler Herro came into the game listed as questionable because of a shoulder strain, but he came off the bench and contributed 22 points, eight rebounds and four 3-pointers. Ten of his points came in the fourth quarter. Miami trailed by as many as six points in the second half and faced a four-point deficit at the start of the fourth. The Heat are 3-12 when trailing after three periods. The teams traded the lead five times in the fourth period before the Heat pulled away in the final three minutes behind their defense and Butler’s scoring. A 7-0 run — started by a Butler jumper and a Herro 3 — gave Miami a 100-94 lead. Orlando missed five straight shots and went three minutes without a point. Butler’s steal of a Michael Carter-Williams pass and subsequent layup with four seconds remaining sealed the win. Butler’s defense led to 23 Orlando turnovers and 26 points off those mistakes for the Heat. “We should have taken care of the ball better,” said Magic guard Terrence Ross, who had 31 points and made 8 of 13 3-point shots. “That was the game right there — turnovers.” All-Star center Nikola Vucevic scored 17 of his 38 points in the third quarter for Orlando, which lost its eighth straight. The Magic, who are 1-2 this season against the rival Heat, haven’t won since Feb. 21. Vucevic finished with 10 rebounds for his 26th double-double. Said Spoelstra of Vucevic, who has repeatedly bedeviled Miami through the years: “It feels like you’re looking at the modern-day Dirk Nowitzki.” Replied Vucevic, who hit six 3-pointers: “Dirk? That's one of the nicest thing anybody has ever said to me. To hear him say that, it means a lot.” Ross’ 28-footer that could have tied the game with 16 seconds left fell well short. Miami’s Kelly Olynyk had 18 points and seven rebounds, and Duncan Robinson chipped in 14 points, with four 3-pointers. The Heat won despite shooting 41.6% from the floor. EUPHORIC FOR EWING Magic coach Steve Clifford was a part of a couple of group text chats that included Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy, Rockets coach Stephen Silas, ABC analyst Jeff Van Gundy and others who were rooting for former NBA star and assistant coach Patrick Ewing as his Georgetown Hoyas went on to win the Big East championship on Saturday. Ewing was on coaching staffs with Clifford in Houston, Orlando and Charlotte for 15 years. “He’s one of my closest friends and this will give you and idea — (Ewing) texts with my parents and they will tell you he’s an incredible person,” said Clifford, who noted that he also shared text messages with Charlotte owner Michael Jordan on Saturday while the two were rooting for Ewing’s Hoyas. “He attacked becoming a terrific coach the same way he attacked becoming a terrific player. … He deserves all of this because he’s made himself into a terrific coach.” TIP INS Heat: Andre Iguodala’s one basket was a 3-pointer that gave Miami a 93-92 lead with 3:42 to play. He added six rebounds. … Miami is 5-9 this season when shooting worse than 44%. Magic: Clifford said that Evan Fournier (groin strain), Aaron Gordon (ankle sprain) and James Ennis III (sore calf) “weren’t close for today.” … Orlando had more turnovers (seven) than field goals (six) in the first quarter. … GM Anthony Parker and head coach Stan Heath of the G League champion Lakeland Magic attended Sunday’s game.","401307380"
"Trae Young's pass goes to exactly the right spot for John Collins to finish with a nice and-1 bucket. (0:17) ATLANTA -- — John Collins scored 22 points, Danilo Gallinari had 20, including a 3-pointer that helped Atlanta extend its lead in the fourth quarter, and the Hawks beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 100-82 on Sunday night for their fifth consecutive win under interim coach Nate McMillan. The Hawks have their first five-game winning streak in more than four years. McMillan said the Hawks are learning to finish games, including against Cleveland. The Hawks lost close games in the first two meetings of the season. “We continue to show growth,"" McMillan said. “We continue to understand how to finish, how to win these games and play in the fourth quarter."" The Hawks led only 69-66 before opening the final quarter with 12 consecutive points to stretch the advantage to 15 points. Gallinari's 3-pointer during the run gave Atlanta its first double-digits lead at 77-66. “When you win a couple of close games, three or four in a row, it gives you confidence to keep doing that,"" Gallinari said. “... You’ve got to believe you can do it every night."" Gallinari said it's too soon to say the Hawks, still one game under .500 at 19-20, are playing like a team ready to have success in the playoffs. “It's still a long process and a long season,"" Gallinari said. “When you think about the strides we’ve made since the start of the season ... the fact we’ve been winning those close games we were losing at the start of the season is a huge step."" Collins set a season high with 13 rebounds. Trae Young scored 14 points. Collin Sexton had 15 points for the Cavaliers, who have a three-game losing streak. Darius Garland added 11 points. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love, making only his second start after missing 33 games with a right calf strain, played only two minutes and didn't attempt a shot. The Cavaliers reported Love “didn't feel right” and didn't want to risk a setback. “When a guy leaves that early in the game, it’s always concerning,"" Cavaliers coach B.J. Bickerstaff said. Love played 10 minutes and scored four points in his return, a 116-82 loss at New Orleans on Friday night. Forward Larry Nance Jr., who also returned against New Orleans after missing 12 games with a left hand injury, had four points in 26 minutes.

"Tacko Fall gets the basket to drop in while drawing a foul, and his teammates love it. (0:16) HOUSTON -- — Jaylen Brown scored 24 points and Jayson Tatum added 23 as the Boston Celtics coasted to a 134-107 win over the struggling Houston Rockets on Sunday night. “It was a good win for us,"" Brown said. “Everybody is back healthy now. So that was a good confidence booster for us."" It’s the 16th straight loss for Houston, which was playing without John Wall and several others because of injuries. The losing streak is the second-longest in franchise history behind a 17-game skid in 1968. It's the fifth win in six games for the Celtics, who overwhelmed a team playing with only one of its regular starters in Victor Oladipo. He led Houston with 26 points on a night the Rockets made 16 of 50 3-pointers. “Early in the game we had good flow and pace... and then the second and third quarters that kind of stopped,"" coach Stephen Silas said. “So yeah, we’ve got to do better."" The Rockets, who haven’t won since Feb. 4, have lost seven straight home games for the first time since 2006. Boston was only up by four after one period, but pulled away by halftime. The Celtics had a 13-point lead early in the third quarter before using an 11-2 run, with nine points by Kemba Walker, to make it 79-57 with about 10 minutes left in the period. “The game rewards you if you approach it the right way, and he does that for us,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. A 12-3 spurt later in the third left the Celtics up 104-72 entering the fourth. Tatum stood out in that stretch, starting the run with a step-back shot before getting a steal and finishing on the other end with a nifty behind-the-back move. He wrapped up the scoring in that quarter with a 35-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer. “I didn’t think we were great early,” Stevens said. “They’re harder to play big, so we obviously went small the next 42 minutes.” Brown and Tatum didn't play after that and Boston Stevens cleared his bench with about nine minutes remaining and his team up 112-80.

"For the second straight night, Anthony Edwards bursts to the hoop and throws down a mean jam. (0:16) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Anthony Edwards scored a career-high 34 points and the short-handed Minnesota Timberwolves held on to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 114-112 on Sunday. Ricky Rubio added 15 points, including eight free throws in the final seconds. Karl-Anthony Towns had 13 points as Minnesota started with just 10 players after rookie Jaden McDaniels was added to the health and safety protocols before the game. The Timberwolves have won two of their past three games and are 2-6 under new coach Chris Finch. “No matter if I’m playing good or bad, if it’s time for a big-time shot, I always want the ball no matter what,” Edwards said of his fourth quarter. “That’s just who I am, but it just happened to be a good game. I was just telling them to give me the ball and get out of the way.” Damian Lillard scored 38 for Portland, which had won four of five and beat Minnesota 125-121 on Saturday. Gary Trent Jr. added 21 points for the Blazers, and Carmelo Anthony had 16 off the bench. Neither team could pull away for three quarters, with the largest lead being just six points for the squads playing without several key players and on the second game of a back-to-back. Portland was playing its 25th straight game without starters Jusuf Nurkic and C.J. McCollum. The Wolves still have second-leading scorer Malik Beasley on a suspension, D’Angelo Russell recovering from left knee surgery and two players in the health and safety protocols. “From an offensive standpoint, it was a struggle for a lot of the night and particularly the first quarter,” Portland coach Terry Stotts said. “I thought we did a good job trying to fight through some shooting struggles throughout the game. … I thought we gave a good effort in the fourth quarter to get back into it, but the hole was too deep.” Minnesota started to pull away early in the fourth and it wasn’t surprising to see Edwards in the middle of the action. The No. 1 overall draft pick left the game for several minutes after a mid-air collision with Blazers center Enes Kanter but later returned after being examined by the athletic trainer. He scored 13 of his points in the fourth and punctuated the performance with a flying dunk down the middle of the lane with 4:09 remaining to give the Wolves a 10-point advantage. “He’s fearless,” Finch said. “That’s what you want from all your great offensive players — fearless — and as he learns the NBA and learns his own game and tries to master those individual situations that he finds himself in, which he will over time. It’s fun to see him playing like that, for sure.” Portland used a 19-8 run late to close within two, but Rubio hit a pair of free throws after an offensive foul on him was changed to a defensive foul following a video review. “We didn’t lose our nerve,” Finch said. “We found a way to win. That’s important.” TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard hit six 3-pointers to move past J.R. Smith and J.J. Redick into 14th on the NBA’s career list. Lillard is 26 behind LeBron James for 13th. ... Nurkic has missed 26 games with a fractured right wrist. McCollum is out with a left midfoot fracture, but told The Athletic that he could see himself returning next week. ... Zach Collins (left ankle stress fracture) and Harry Giles III (left calf strain) also were out. Timberwolves: Edwards had a career-high six 3s, his 13th game with at least three in a game, marking the second-most such games as a rookie in team history. Stephon Marbury had 15 in 1997. ... Jarrett Culver missed his third straight game with a strained left big toe. McDaniels joined Jordan McLaughlin in the league’s health and safety protocols. … The 20 points by the Blazers marked a season low for a Wolves’ opponent in the first quarter. FREE THROWS GALORE Minnesota shot 39 free throws and hit 29 and held on by converting late. Portland was 17 of 21 from the line. “It was a lot of timely whistles,” Lillard said. “Calls got two different plays reversed down the stretch. It was a lot of factors down the stretch of this game. We just came up short.” PREDICTION TIME Edwards said he received a text from someone who believes the team — which has the league's worst record — is about to start a winning streak. “It's just crazy, but I feel like we can go on a large, tremendous winning streak,” Edwards said. “If we just stay locked in and engaged on everything that we're doing, we can go on a winning streak.”","401307383"
"Kyle Lowry receives his second technical foul and is ejected after throwing the ball across the court toward a referee. (0:58) CHICAGO -- — Rookie Patrick Williams had a career-best 23 points to lead the Chicago Bulls past the Toronto Raptors, 118-95 Sunday night. Zach LaVine scored 15 to help the Bulls end a two-game slide. Coby White had 13 points and Wendell Carter Jr. added 12 points and 11 rebounds after the two were removed from the starting five for the first time this season. Chicago maintained a double-digit lead for most of the second half and enjoyed a nice cushion after Denzel Valentine made three 3-pointers during a 9-0 run that pushed the lead to 96-78 with eight minutes left. Toronto, which had won 12 straight against Chicago, never got closer than 11 the rest of the night. Norman Powell scored 32 points as the depleted Raptors, down five regulars, lost their fifth straight. Kyle Lowry had 20 points and eight assists before being ejected in the final minutes after picking up his second technical foul for arguing with officials. Lowry said he didn’t think the pressure of fighting to stay in the playoff hunt — a new experience for the Raptors after several seasons of riding in the upper half of the Eastern Conference standings — or even his actions led to his ejection. “I really didn’t do anything,” he said. “Sometimes I guess egos get bigger. ... This is very unconventional but we’ve just got to find a way to get through it.” Chicago coach Billy Donovan hinted at lineup changes a day earlier and followed through Sunday as Thaddeus Young and Tomas Satoransky each made their first starts of the season, bumping White and Carter from the opening five. Each of the new starters finished with 10 points. Donovan, disappointed with his regular starters’ lapses after they returned from last weekend’s All-Star break, said the move was hardly meant to punish White and Carter — or set in stone. “I really appreciate Coby and Wendell making sacrifices for the team,” Donovan said. “It’s not like those guys are out of the rotation or not important pieces of the team. “It’s more about trying to get a consistent combination through 48 minutes.” Carter was a reserve most of last season and didn’t seem to take the lineup shift personally. “It was fun mixing the lineups,” he said. “It was really nothing new to me. I just knew I had to come in and be aggressive. ... (The change) had to be made and it is what it is. We weren’t clicking on all cylinders like we’re supposed to.” The Bulls took the lead for good late in the opening quarter and went on a 9-0 run near the end of the first half to take a 58-49 lead to the break. Carter, a starter in all 25 games he’d played this season, made his first four shots after entering the game late in the first. TIP-INS Raptors: Starters Fred VanVleet, Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby, and reserves Patrick McCaw and Malachi Flynn remained out to comply with the NBA’s COVID-19 protocol. Siakam has missed six straight games, one more than the remaining quartet. The team hopes to get some of the players back in time for the finale of the three-game road swing. … Lowry earned his first technical late in the third quarter for remarks from the bench. … Toronto fell to 1-7 this season in the second game of back-to-back outings. Bulls: Chicago had last beaten the Raptors on Feb. 14, 2017. … Fans still aren’t allowed to attend games at the United Center, but the neighborhood was buzzing an hour before Sunday’s tipoff.

"Zion Williamson scores 27 points on 13-of-16 shooting as the Pelicans rout the Clippers by 20 points. (1:14) NEW ORLEANS -- — Zion Williamson mixed full-speed, behind-the-back dribbles, pin-point bounce passes and even an alley-oop lob into his usual repertoire of forceful finishes at the rim. That left the Los Angeles Clippers scrambling defensively while the Pelicans piled up points in a second straight lopsided victory. Williamson scored 27 points to go with five assists, Brandon Ingram added 23 points and New Orleans routed the Clippers 135-115 on Sunday night. “We were on the attack,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “And then because we had made some shots, I think, Zion got room to go to the basket — and we know if he gets room to go to the basket, I mean, you're not going to stop it.” Williamson bullied the Clippers near the basket, exploding forcefully to the hoop on dribble drives or in transition for layups amidst crowds of hapless defenders, or for rim-rattling dunks. He also handled the ball adeptly, with threaded bounce passes to set up Josh Hart's 3 and Eric Bledsoe's cutting layup, and a lob on Jaxson Hayes' alley-oop dunk. “Whatever the team needs me to do, that's what I'm ready to do, whether it's score, play defense, facilitate,"" said Williamson, highlighting the point guard days of his youth. ""Coach has really put me in a position to facilitate the game and really open up the game for myself.” Ingram attacked Los Angles with slashing drives, pull-up jumpers and three 3-pointers, including one while being fouled for a 4-point play. Lonzo Ball hit five 3s and finished with 20 points for New Orleans, which shot an NBA season-high 65.4% (53 for 81). Hayes highlighted his season-high 17 points with a tomahawk dunk in which he virtually jumped over Clippers guard Reggie Jackson before slamming the ball down off Jackson's head. “I was just trying to get the ball in the basket,” said Hayes, who rated the dunk among his top three since high school. Hayes was assessed a technical foul for tapping his own head mockingly as he stood over Jackson after the play. “Obviously, I got a little hyped up,” Hayes said with a grin. The technical hardly mattered on a night when New Orleans outscored the Clippers 72-40 in the paint and led by as many as 33 points — two nights after beating Cleveland by 34. Kawhi Leonard scored 23 and Jackson 18 for the Clippers, who were without usual starting guard Patrick Beverley because of his recent right knee injury. Trailing 110-83 after three quarters, Clippers coach Tyronn Lue sent out a lineup of reserves to open the fourth period. “They were more physical than us. They were tougher than us, and we saw the results,"" Lue said. ""We’ve got to be more physical, have a defensive mindset to start every game. ... They got off to a very easy first quarter, and then it was just an easy game for them.” Leonard called the Clippers' recent erratic play “very concerning,"" adding, “If we want to have a chance of anything, you’ve got to be consistent.” Ball fueled the Pelicans offense in the first half, when he scored 14 points while assisting on four more baskets. His fourth 3 put New Orleans up 55-42. The Clippers cut it to 10, at 67-57, when Luke Kennard's right-wing 3 went down as the halftime horn sounded. TIP-INS Clippers: Paul George scored 15 points in 23 minutes. ... Kennard scored 15 and Amir Coffey 13. ... Jackson started for Beverley and played 24 minutes. ... Shot 15 of 43 from 3-point range. ... Reserves combined for 53 points. Pelicans: Have scored at least 66 points in the paint in two straight games. ... Hayes has made 24 of his past 27 shots and has set season highs in scoring in two straight games. ... Kira Lewis Jr. and Josh Hart each scored 13 points. ... New Orleans hit 12 of 26 3-point attempts. ... Combined for 38 assists as a team, two short of tying the franchise record. ... Won handily despite committing 19 turnovers. ... Reserves combined for 49 points. QUOTABLE While recalling Hayes' dunk on Jackson, Williamson said he thought the Clippers guard made a “perfect” defensive rotation to pick Hayes up cutting to the hoop. “That was good defense,” Williamson said, adding with a smile, “If it was me, I think I would have made a business decision and moved out of the way, to be honest.”","401307385"
"Marvin Bagley III is seen favoring his left hand after scoring for the Kings. He would leave with what would be revealed as a fracture. (0:35) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Gordon Hayward saw the athletic De'Aaron Fox closing in on him out of the corner of his eye while driving for a breakaway basket, and he knew he had only one option: dunk it. So Hayward leaped high and delivered a powerful two-handed dunk over Fox's outstretched arm, drawing a foul on a play that proved pivotal in the Charlotte Hornets' fourth straight win. “I can still jump from time to time,” the 30-year-old Hayward said with a smile. Terry Rozier scored 26 points, Hayward added 25 and the Hornets overcame a 15-point deficit in the second half to beat the Sacramento Kings 122-116 on Monday night after trailing almost the entire game. Fox led the Kings with 29 points, while Richaun Holmes had 17 points and 15 rebounds in a game in which Marvin Bagley III left early with a broken left hand. Hayward's momentum-turning play came with Charlotte trailing by one with 1:33 left. The 6-foot-7 Hayward knocked the ball away in the frontcourt, took a lookahead pass from Rozier and dunked over Fox, bringing the pandemic-restricted crowd of about 3,000 to its feet. He was fouled on the play and made the free throw to give Charlotte its first lead at 113-111. “When I got the kick-out I did see Fox and he’s just super athletic, so I thought he would try to challenge,” Hayward said. “In those situations, you definitely cannot try to lay it up. You have to go dunk it — and that’s what I did.” Said Hornets coach James Borrego of the team's biggest acquisition this offseason: “He makes winning plays.” He isn't the only one making winning plays for this surprising Hornets team, which moved into a tie for fifth place in the Eastern Conference with the Boston Celtics. After Hield quickly tied the game at the other end, Rozier, who has earned a reputation this season as being fearless, answered with a huge 3-pointer from the left wing to put the Hornets ahead for good with 54 seconds left, “Clutch. Ice in his veins, there’s no doubt about it,"" Hayward said Rozier. Down three, the Kings (15-24) fouled Bismack Biyombo — a 57.1% career free throw shooter — and he missed both shots. But the reserve center quickly redeemed himself at the other end of the court by blocking Fox on a drive to the basket with 34 seconds left. Rozier and Hayward, who were a combined 13 of 13 from the foul line, helped iced the game with each making a pair of free throws in the closing seconds helping the Hornets outscore the Kings 21-8 in the final 5 1/2 minutes. “I’m extremely proud of this group,"" Borrego said. “For some reason, we play our best basketball down the stretch and I guess, if there’s a time to pick your best basketball, it’s the last four or five minutes of the game. This group, they continue to fight.” TIP INS Kings: Shot 55.8% from the field and scored 68 points in the paint. ... Coach Luke Walton picked up a technical foul in the third quarter.

He will undergo further medical evaluation and an update regarding course of treatment will be provided in the coming days. “He’s put in so much hard work this year,"" Walton said. “I’ve said all year long, he’s continued to make really big strides and he was putting together a heck of a game tonight.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo lists all the food he plans on eating during the Bucks' day off. (0:42) WASHINGTON -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his third consecutive triple-double to lead the Milwaukee Bucks past the Washington Wizards 133-122 Monday night for their fourth consecutive victory. The Bucks pulled away late after letting a 26-point, third-quarter lead slip to five midway through the fourth. When the Wizards got within seven in the final minutes, Antetokounmpo scored the next four points to make it a double-digit game again. “I’m not Kobe,” Antetokounmpo said. ""I just try to be a basketball player. I don’t look at the clock and say, ‘Oh now we are up two or we’re down two, let me take over the game.’ No, I just make the right decision at the right moment. Sometimes it’s going to be score, sometimes it’s going to be pass.” Antetokounmpo  combined for 64 points, 26 rebounds and 21 assists in the two-game series at Washington that Milwaukee swept. The back-to-back NBA MVP also had 24 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the first triple-double of this run against the New York Knicks last week. “He’s been in a good place mentally,” coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""The way he’s playing and creating for others and creating for himself and getting to the free throw line, he’s in a good place. He’s playing great basketball. Antetokounmpo became the third player this season with a triple-double in three games in a row, joining Washington’s Russell Westbrook, who did it twice, and Miami’s Jimmy Butler. His seventh career 30-point triple-double passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most in team history, and he's the first Bucks player to have three triple-doubles in a row. “It’s not always about scoring,” Antetokounmpo said. “You can manipulate the game in different ways: passing, finding your teammates, putting them in the right spot.” The Bucks kept pace with Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia and are now two games back with Brooklyn in between. Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 37 points after sitting out Saturday to rest a sore left knee. Russell Westbrook had 23 points and a season-high 17 assists. “We were just taking some precautionary measures,” Beal said. “The knee feels a lot better, my whole body feels great. I felt refreshed and rejuvenated tonight.” Washington has lost four in a row, leading coach Scott Brooks to say: “It’s no fun losing. There’s no Cs or Bs like I used to always get. You either get an A or you get an F, and when you lose it’s an F.” ALMOST BLOWN LEAD Washington has had a penchant for coming back and coming up short this season. Budenholzer praised the Wizards for clawing back, even though the Bucks had plenty of unforced errors to pave the way to a tight game. “I felt like maybe we weren’t as focused as we needed to be at that point when we went up,” he said. “I thought we had some sloppy defensive possessions, some sloppy offensive possessions and then they took advantage of it."" DEEP BUCKS Every Milwaukee player who got on the court scored, and seven reached double figures. “Nobody settled just to get a shot up,” said Khris Middleton, who rebounded from a 1 for 5 start to score 23. “We realize we have many different matchups we can go to.” TIP-INS Bucks: Brook Lopez scored 22 points and had four blocks in another game against twin brother Robin. ... Axel Toupane was inactive the day after signing a two-way contract. Wizards: Davis Bertans (right calf tightness) and Neto (left rib contusion) were cleared to play about an hour before tipoff after being considered questionable.

"After the Knicks claw back to within three points, Julius Randle is called for a travel in the final seconds and the Nets hang on to win. (1:06) NEW YORK -- — It was clear from the noise in the seats, even with only about 1,600 fans in attendance. It was obvious from the emotion on the court, where Julius Randle had to be restrained by Knicks teammates after the buzzer following a call that went against him in the final seconds. New York's basketball rivalry was alive and heated Monday night. “I got a little taste of it tonight,” James Harden said. Kyrie Irving scored 34 points and Harden posted his 10th triple-double of the season, leading the Brooklyn Nets to a 117-112 victory over the Knicks. Harden finished with 21 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists in his first game against the Knicks since arriving in Brooklyn two months ago and turning the Nets into one of the NBA's best teams. Randle had 33 points, 12 rebounds and six assists, before a number of his teammates had to get off the bench to hold the All-Star forward back as he tried to get near the referees at midcourt. He wouldn't comment on his intentions, or the traveling call with the Knicks down three and 3.2 seconds remaining. “I was just frustrated,” Randle said. “Obviously we fought so hard to come back and try to win the game, so I was just frustrated and that was pretty much it.” The Nets agreed to the deal that brought Harden to Brooklyn on Jan. 13, playing short-handed that night at Madison Square Garden in a 116-109 victory over the Knicks. That made them just 7-6, but they are 20-7 since Harden’s arrival, including 19-4 when at least two of their three superstars play. The Knicks also have played well, with a .500 record and an energized fan base that made its presence felt among the small crowd allowed in Barclays Center. “These New York fans, especially the Knicks fans, you can hear them,” Harden said. “I don’t know how many fans we have in the building total, but you heard a lot of Knicks fans.” Jeff Green scored 20 points as the Nets won for the 13th time in 14 games, even with Kevin Durant sitting out the last 12 of them with a strained left hamstring. The Knicks cut an 18-point deficit to 115-112 after a dunk by Randle and then got the ball back when coach Tom Thibodeau successfully challenged a foul called on RJ Barrett with 7.7 seconds remaining. The Knicks won the ensuing jump ball and Randle tried to shoot a 3-pointer. Irving got his hand on the ball as Randle leaped and Randle dropped it after he landed and was called for traveling. Crew chief Scott Foster said Irving didn't dislodge the ball and Randle dropped it himself, making it a travel when he picked it up. He added that officials couldn't hear anything Randle said after the buzzer. Harden closed it out with two free throws. The Nets made 70% of their shots and led by five after one quarter, then opened the second with a 14-2 spurt to take a 49-32 lead. Barrett scored 23 points and rookie Immanuel Quickley had 21 in his first career start for the Knicks, who are in a tough stretch with Milwaukee, Brooklyn and Philadelphia, the top three teams in the Eastern Conference, in their first four games after the All-Star break. TIP-INS Knicks: Quickley started with the Knicks playing without point guards Elfrid Payton (strained right hamstring) and Derrick Rose (health and safety protocols). Also, Austin Rivers is away from the team for personal reasons. ... C Mitchell Robinson, recovering from surgery on a broken hand, did some shooting workouts before the game.

Brooklyn’s 62.5% shooting from the field was its highest in a first half this season. GETTING GRIFFIN READY The Nets continue to take it slowly with Blake Griffin, the six-time All-Star they signed during the All-Star break. Griffin hadn't played in his final weeks in Detroit so the Nets don't want to hurry him into the lineup before his body is ready, listing him out with left knee injury management. “He's healthy enough to play, we’re just trying to work on some of his physical deficiencies to help the knee and also ramp up his activity so he can have a safer return to play,” Nash said. “So, we just keep monitoring it, just keep building and we’ll have him back at some point here.” CENTURY CLUB The victory was the Nets' 100th against the Knicks. New York leads the series 101-100 with one meeting left this season.","401307388"
"Lonnie Walker IV wraps a sensational pass around Isaiah Stewart to Drew Eubanks for a jam. (0:20) DETROIT -- — Dejounte Murray had 19 points and 10 rebounds to lead a balanced attack as the San Antonio Spurs beat the Detroit Pistons 109-99 on Monday night. The Spurs had lost three of four, including a 35-point loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday. “I thought this was a nice bounce-back performance from our guys,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “We came out and did the things we needed to do.” Detroit's leading scorer, Jeremi Grant, left the game in the third quarter after falling hard on his hip while trying to drive between Drew Eubanks and Rudy Gay. “He's fine,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “He probably could have come back and played if we had needed him, but I saw it as a good chance to get more minutes for our young guys.” Jakob Poeltl had 14 points and 12 rebounds for San Antonio, which had six players in double figures. Rookie guard Devin Vassell finished with 13 points in 21 minutes in his third game back from COVID-19. “This has been a crazy rookie season, because we didn't have summer league and we aren't getting many practice days,” Vassell said. “Then I was out with COVID, so I'm just trying to talk to everyone I can every day and learn as we go. Tonight was a good night.” Josh Jackson had 15 points for the Pistons, who have lost four straight, while Grant scored 14. With Wayne Ellington (groin) sidelined, the Pistons shot 28% (7 of 25) from the 3-point line. “We need to hit more shots, but I don't think this loss came down to our offense,” Jackson said. ""We didn't play enough defense to win the game. The Spurs shot 69.6% in the second quarter to build a 60-50 lead, then pulled away by as many as 14 early in the third quarter. “You can't let a team come in and shoot 70% in the second quarter when we are trying to build our identity around defense,” Casey said. “You need a lot of mental toughness to beat the Spurs. You can't get one stop and decide you can relax. You have to keep playing all 48 minutes and we didn't do that.” Dejounte Murray finished off a 35-point quarter for the Spurs with a long 3-pointer at the buzzer, giving San Antonio a 95-75 lead. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio lost by 34 points (132-98) at Little Caesars Arena on their last visit — Dec. 1, 2020 — their worst margin of defeat against the Pistons. ... Poeltl's 12 rebounds matched a season-high. Pistons: Rodney McGruder started at guard, his first NBA start since playing 51:16 for the Los Angeles Clippers in a 107-103 overtime victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the regular-season finale on Aug. 14, 2020. McGruder played just 16 minutes in the postseason for the Clippers.","401307389"
"Paul George steps back and puts the cherry on top of the Clippers' win over the Mavericks. (0:22) DALLAS -- — Kawhi Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers answered a couple of low moments in their season — and kept rolling on the second night of back-to-backs. Leonard scored 22 points, Marcus Morris Sr. added 14 in a rare start and the Clippers beat the Dallas Mavericks 109-99 on Monday. The Clippers were playing Dallas for the first time since a 51-point blowout on their home court in December, and a night after a 20-point loss in New Orleans. The NBA's only remaining unbeaten team on the back end of consecutive games improved to 7-0 and tied Phoenix (7-1) for the most such victories. “Back-to-backs test your manhood, test who you are and test your character,” coach Tyronn Lue said. “I thought tonight we responded very well.” The second meeting — and first of two consecutive games in Dallas — since the Clippers beat the Mavericks in six games in a first-round series in the playoff bubble was a victory for LA's depth over the Mavericks' star power. The Clippers won for the second time in six games while Dallas lost for just the second time in its past seven. Luka Doncic posted his ninth triple-double for Dallas, finishing with 25 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds. Kristaps Porzingis scored 22 points. Paul George scored 15 as seven Clippers finished in double figures. Ivica Zubac had 15 points and 11 rebounds. Nicolas Batum, who sat while Morris made his third start of the season, had a couple of big 3-pointers and scored 14. Reggie Jackson and Patrick Patterson scored 12 apiece. The Clippers built leads early in both halves with better defense than they displayed a night earlier against the Pelicans, who shot the highest percentage in the NBA this season at 65.4%. The Mavericks erased a 14-point first-quarter deficit in the second quarter. But they trailed 55-50 at halftime after leading by a NBA-record 50 points (77-27) at the half in their 124-73 victory in LA in December. “We know how they felt after how we beat them at their place,” said Dallas guard Tim Hardaway, who scored 21 points. “You've got to give them credit. They came out aggressive. They put their foot down.” Dallas couldn't rally again after falling behind by 12 early in the fourth. The Mavericks trailed 103-99 with three minutes remaining but couldn't convert on two chances to get closer before Leonard got a three-point play off a putback. TIP-INS Clippers: C Serge Ibaka sat out with lower back tightness after playing 23 minutes against the Pelicans. It's just his second missed game of the season. ... G Patrick Beverely isn't on the three-game road trip because of right knee soreness. ... Morris, who missed the first eight games of the season, led all scorers with 12 in the first half, and Lue said he intended to keep 10th-year pro in the lineup. “We wanted to kick-start Marcus and get him going,” Lue said. Mavericks: C Dwight Powell didn't play because of an illness that coach Rick Carlisle said wasn't related to COVID-19. Powell was among the Dallas players to miss games in January because of health and safety protocols. ... Dallas tied a franchise low with five free-throw attempts (twice before, in 2008 and 1995). The Mavericks made four. It wasn't much of a difference in the game because LA had just 11 attempts, making nine. LEONARD'S BACK-TO-BACKS Leonard, who before this season hadn’t played on consecutive nights since near the end of the 2016-17 season, did it for the fourth time and played a season-high 40 minutes. He has played in six of the seven victories on the second nights of back-to-backs. “Physically I was tired, but mentally I wanted to win the game,” said Leonard, who had eight rebounds, seven assists and four steals while helping LA force seven turnovers by Doncic. “You're going to have these moments down the road where you feel like your juice is gone but you've just got to keep fighting.” NOT REVIEWABLE In the final seconds of the third quarter, Doncic pleaded with officials to give him a shot at a four-point play when the 3-pointer he threw up while he was fouled on purpose went in. Officials said there was no shot. After a discussion during a Dallas timeout, there was no challenge. The Mavericks had a throw-in, and Doncic hit two free throws after getting fouled again on a drive for an 85-78 deficit going to the fourth quarter. Carlisle said it was his mistake not knowing the ruling of no shooting foul wasn't reviewable.","401307390"
"Jamal Murray shows off his handles before flipping the ball to an open Michael Porter Jr. for the two-handed touch. (0:22) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic notched his 35th double-double with 32 points and 14 rebounds, leading the Denver Nuggets over the travel-weary Indiana Pacers 121-106 on Monday night. Michael Porter Jr. and Will Barton each scored 20 points for the Nuggets, who used a big fourth quarter to get the win. Malcom Brogdon led Indiana with 24 and Justin Holiday had 19. Domantas Sabonis finished a rebound shy of a triple-double with 10 points and 10 assists. The start of the game was moved back an hour because the Pacers were unable to fly from Phoenix into Denver until Monday afternoon. A snowstorm that officially dropped 27 inches at Denver International Airport closed the runways from late Sunday morning. Four runways were reopened mid-afternoon Monday. “I knew they got in late so I just wanted to put my foot on the gas early to figure out if they was or wasn’t (tired), but I knew I was going to figure it out,” said Barton, who scored the first eight points of the game for Denver. “I was going to try to put them on their heels. I was going to find out one way or another if they were tired."" Indiana rallied from 20 down in the first half to take a 79-74 lead midway through the third quarter. The Pacers led 91-87 after three, but the Nuggets opened the fourth with 14 straight points to take a 101-91 lead. “Our defense in the third quarter was a joke and if we had any chance of coming back and winning we had to play defense,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “That quarter they had 35 points and shot 61.9% from the field.” The Pacers didn’t score their first points until nearly five minutes into the fourth and were outscored 34-15. Caris LeVert didn’t want to blame the travel issues for the loss. “Going down 20 points to a good team is tough to overcome,” he said. “We’re competitors, we don’t want to make excuses. Stuff happens in life. For us to get to where we want to go, we can’t go down 20 points to a good team like that.” TIP-INS Pacers: G Jeremy Lamb missed his second straight game with a sore left knee. ... LeVert had 17 points in his second game back from having a cancerous mass removed from his kidney on Jan. 26. Nuggets: G Monte Morris was out of the lineup for the second straight game with a quad strain. G Gary Harris missed his 12th straight game with a left adductor strain, while R.J. Hampton continues to be out due to health and safety protocols. SNOW BUSINESS Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren drew on his experience in the D-League when dealing with the delayed travel. “There’s a few guys on our team that have gone through things like this before,” he said. “Fifteen years ago, when I was in the minor leagues, this stuff happened, a little bit, not a lot, but it happened. We did a lot of travel on the day of the game.” Indiana wasn’t the only one affected by the weather. Referees Bill Kennedy, Michael Smith and Jonathan Sterling, the officiating crew from Saturday night’s game in Denver, were stuck in town and worked Monday’s game. The Los Angeles Kings, who played the Colorado Avalanche on Sunday afternoon, had to stay overnight Sunday and the NHL postponed the Kings’ Monday night home game against St. Louis.","401307391"
"Devin Booker leads all scorers with 27 points as the Suns win 122-99 to hand the Grizzlies their third straight loss. (1:34) PHOENIX -- — Devin Booker scored 27 points, Chris Paul added 18 and the Phoenix Suns rolled to a 122-99 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night. The Suns have won six of their past seven games and bounced back emphatically from a 122-111 loss to Indiana on Saturday. They won the season series against the Grizzlies two games to one. Suns coach Monty Williams said he could sense a good game was coming. “You could tell there was a tense-ness about our meeting this morning,"" Williams explained. ""It’s what I love about the group. To take that energy and focus and hold a team like that to 99 points. They’re a top-10 defense and we hung up 122, which isn’t easy to do. The focus was there.” Booker shot 10 of 19 from the field and topped his season average of 25 points per game despite sitting out the fourth quarter. Deandre Ayton added 15 points, nine rebounds and three blocks, while Jae Crowder scored 14. Paul shot 9 of 11 from the field and had seven assists. The point guard has been known for his intensity but on this Phoenix team he fits right in with a roster that has many strong personalities, especially Booker and Crowder. Paul loves how upset the team gets after losses and then responds. “You show me someone fine with losing and I’ll show you a loser,"" Paul said. The game was tight for most of the first half but the Suns slowly pulled away in the third period. Crowder rattled home a 3-pointer with a few seconds left to give Phoenix a 96-77 advantage going into the fourth. Memphis could never close the gap and fell to 17-19 this season. Jonas Valanciunas led the Grizzlies with 24 points and 17 rebounds. Grayson Allen added 15 points off the bench, and Ja Morant also scored 15. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins thought Phoenix's second unit brought a lot of energy and gave the Suns a boost. The group finished with 41 points. “Our defense couldn’t catch up with them,"" Jenkins said. ""They were playing at a great pace, great speed.” The Grizzlies have lost three straight and four of five. The Suns scored 36 points in the second quarter to take a 60-52 halftime lead. Booker had 16 points before the break. Valanciunas led the Grizzlies with 13 points and 12 rebounds.

"An unmoving LeBron James catches Nico Mannion by surprise as Mannion runs right into him. (0:26) SAN FRANCISCO -- — LeBron James had a triple-double with 22 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, leading the injury-depleted Los Angeles Lakers past the Golden State Warriors 128-97 on Monday night. Montrezl Harrell backed up James' fourth triple-double of the season by scoring 27 points off the bench on 11-of-14 shooting as the Lakers clinched the season series with Golden State. Stephen Curry scored 27 points with four 3-pointers and became the Warriors' franchise assists leader a day after his 33rd birthday and in his 12th NBA season. “We've got to get sick of just getting blown out because that’s embarrassing,"" Curry said. ""We have to have some pride about how we’re playing. You can lose games, that’s going to happen. But not like that.” With a long list of injuries, the Lakers got another scare when Harrell briefly went down with 7:11 left in the first half. He took an elbow to the face from Warriors rookie center James Wiseman after his goaltend as he attempted to block a shot and had his elbows high. After a replay review to determine if it was “a hostile act,” Wiseman received a technical foul, not a flagrant. Harrell walked off the court on his own. Kyle Kuzma airballed the technical free throw — so, what happened? “San Francisco had a 3.5-magnitude earthquake and (stuff) started rumbling and I don’t know, I got scared,” he cracked. ""And it just went over to the far left.” Golden State had its home winning streak snapped at four — a day after the Warriors ended a season-worst four-game skid by beating the Jazz 131-119. But this was another tough beating at the hands of James and Co. after Golden State's 117-91 defeat in Los Angeles on Feb. 28. “They got 68 points in the paint. That’s unheard of,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. The Lakers had lost their previous two road games, both against Western Conference teams. “I don’t think we’ll find our true identity until playoffs,"" Kuzma said. CURRY'S MARK Curry's record-setting pass went to Kelly Oubre Jr. for a reverse layup one minute into the third. “It's special. It's kind of a longevity award,” Curry said. “But in terms of playing for the same franchise for 12 years and hopefully a lot longer, there's been some greats that have come through here for however long. Anytime you've done something or reached a level that is the top of the list for a franchise, it's pretty special. Wish it was under different circumstances obviously, with the game tonight.” Curry began the night with 4,854 assists, one behind franchise leader Guy Rodgers. They are the only two Warriors to reach 4,000 assists. “He can make passes with either hand and he gets blitzed so often that a lot of his passes come in traffic and under duress and he does an incredible job of getting the ball out of the traps and finding the right guys,” Kerr said before the game. “I think I said this the other day, but how many passes has he made over the years that have led to Draymond’s (Green) assists?” Curry hit a 3-pointer in his 100th straight game, the third such streak in NBA history and second for the two-time MVP after doing so in 157 straight games from 2014-16. Kyle Korver hit a 3 in 127 consecutive games from 2012-14 with Atlanta. COME BACK TO CHASE Might the Warriors have a home-court advantage before season's end? “We’re hopeful we’ll have fans in our building before the end of the season,"" Kerr said. ""Those talks are ongoing.” TIP-INS Lakers: Had a season-best 36 assists. “We want to be an extra-pass team,” coach Frank Vogel said. ... Los Angeles played without Marc Gasol, Kostas Antetokounmpo (health and safety protocols), Anthony Davis (strained right calf), Jared Dudley (torn MCL in right knee) and Alex Caruso, who Vogel said entered the concussion protocol and won't come back until Thursday at the earliest. Gasol is out as part of the league's COVID-19 health and safety protocols and won't be ready to return by Tuesday's game against the Timberwolves. ... LA is 9-3 on the road vs. the West. Warriors: Golden State hasn't beaten the Lakers at home since a 115-101 victory on Feb. 2, 2019 — so never at the second-year Chase Center. ... The Warriors wrapped up their eighth back-to-back this season and third of five playing consecutive days at home. ... The Warriors are 25-1 when Green has a triple-double as he did Sunday.","401307393"
"Rudy Gobert throws down a two-handed slam all over Daniel Theis in front of the Jazz bench. (0:20) BOSTON -- — The Jazz already have the best record in the NBA. If they execute down the stretch like they did against the Celtics, they might be even better by season's end. Donovan Mitchell had eight of his 21 points in the fourth quarter and Utah hit 19 3-pointers to beat Boston 117-109 on Tuesday night. Jordan Clarkson added 20 points off the bench. Mike Conley scored 17 points and Rudy Gobert finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds to help the Jazz sweep the season series between the teams. Coming off a mistake-filled loss at Golden State on Sunday to open their five-game road trip, Mitchell liked the focus his teammates responded with. ""I think the biggest thing is how we executed,” he said. “Tonight I think we did a good job of it. … getting the plays we wanted.” Boston led by as many as 11 in the first half before fading late. Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 29 points and Jaylen Brown added 28. But it wasn’t enough to overcome a hot-shooting night by Utah, which also got 45 points from its bench. At times this season Utah has had trouble both closing out games. Coach Quin Snyder said how they finished Tuesday is a positive step forward. ""It's important. I think our guys, in the second half we started defensive rebounding and got some things in transition and built a little bit of the lead,"" he said. Trailing 104-101, the Celtics had two chances to tie the game. The first was thwarted by an offensive foul on Robert Williams. Following a Utah foul on its next possession, Marcus Smart came up short on a 3-point attempt that was corralled by the Jazz. Mitchell then hit a 3 on Utah’s next trip to make it 107-101. Utah’s lead was 109-101 when Tatum was fouled by Gobert on a layup. But he failed to complete the three-point play and Boston was forced to foul. The Celtics played without big man Tristan Thompson after he was placed in the league’s health and safety protocols hours before the game. Semi Ojeleye made his seventh start of the season in his place but was quiet offensively. He failed to attempt field goal and finished with two rebounds and one assist. Boston was mostly able to neutralize Gobert in the first half, holding him to four points. But he found some openings in the final 24 minutes, including cutting to take a bounce pass from Clarkson and dunking over Daniel Theis as part of Utah’s initial fourth-quarter surge. Boston fell to 0-8 this season against the teams with the best five records in the NBA (Jazz 0-2; Suns 0-1; 76ers 0-2; Nets 0-2 and Lakers 0-1). “There’s a reason why the rest of us don’t have their record,” coach Brad Stevens said. “We don’t make people pay as much as they make everyone else pay.” TIP-INS Jazz: Hit 10 3-pointers in the first half. … Had eight turnovers in the first quarter, a season high for the opening period. … Udoka Azubuike was out for the 14th consecutive game with a right ankle sprain. Celtics: Tatum had a four-point play late in the third quarter to put the Celtics in front 76-75. Boston closed the period on an 11-2 run and took a 79-77 lead into the fourth. … Shot 60% (25 of 42) in the first half. … Romeo Langford remained in the health and safety protocols for the third consecutive game. HOOSIER FLATTERY Stevens acknowledged before the game that he’s heard about the groundswell of support he’s getting in his home state to be Indiana University’s next coach following Archie Miller’s firing. “That does mean a lot, I won’t act like that doesn’t,” Stevens said. “It’s flattering. But I also realize that I’m the coach of the Celtics. It’s been an amazing opportunity, an amazing challenge every day for the last eight years and I’m extremely grateful.”","401307394"
"Andre Iguodala throws a pass to Tyler Herro who streaks down the court to flush down a smooth dunk to cap the fast break for the Heat. (0:16) MIAMI -- — The Miami Heat got another win, and for a change it came relatively easily. Jimmy Butler had 28 points and 12 rebounds, Bam Adebayo returned from a knee issue and finished with 14 points, nine rebounds and six assists, and the Heat eased past the Cleveland Cavaliers 113-98 on Tuesday night. Kelly Olynyk scored 17 points, Tyler Herro had 15 and Duncan Robinson added 14 for Miami, which won for the 11th time in its last 12 games. But this win was unlike most others for the Heat this season, in that it was only the third in which Miami held a double-digit lead for the entire fourth quarter. “It was a little bit up and down, our game,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “There was some sloppiness to it, some miscues defensively. But overall, we made enough plays to come out with the win."" Collin Sexton scored 21 for Cleveland, which got 16 points and eight rebounds from JaVale McGee in 21 minutes on 8-for-10 shooting. It’s been an up-and-down, mostly down, time of late for the Cavaliers — who lost 10 consecutive games, then won four in a row, and have gone 0-4 since. “We need to continue to improve as a team, but the baseline is there,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “We are together. We are willing to compete. We take bumps and adversity together and we continue to fight.” Larry Nance Jr. scored 14, Darius Garland had 11 and Isaac Okoro added 10 for the Cavaliers, who were held below 100 points for the NBA-leading 17th time this season. The Cavs were just 10 for 35 from 3-point range, 2 for 18 in the first half. “You can play really good defense, you can find the extra man, you can do all the stuff you're supposed to do,"" Nance said. “If we're getting good looks and not making them, that's an issue in itself. We're generating solid looks. Just got to start knocking them down, really."" Adebayo hadn’t played since March 2, missing four games with left knee tendinitis. He was 6 for 14 from the field, and his three-point play off a pass from Butler with 1:54 left gave Miami a 108-93 lead — erasing any remaining doubt. Adebayo said he didn't feel limited in his return game. “It was good to be back,"" Adebayo said. “Watching your teammates win, I wanted to be part of that."" Kendrick Nunn added 10 for the Heat. Miami’s other wins where the lead was double digits for the entirety of the fourth quarter were Jan. 4 against Oklahoma City and Feb. 5 against Washington. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland called its first timeout 53 seconds into the game, trailing 5-0. The Cavs scored the next nine out of that break and briefly kept the lead, then trailed for the game’s final 39:56. ... The Cavaliers are 1-9 in their last 10 games against Miami. Heat: Avery Bradley (calf) is still out and missed his 19th consecutive game. ... Julia Dale, who dazzled crowds as a little girl when she was the good-luck charm anthem singer from Miami’s past playoff runs and now is a college student, returned for Tuesday’s anthem. LOVE OUT Cleveland forward Kevin Love, who played 10 minutes in New Orleans on Friday and left Sunday’s game at Atlanta after just 1:41, was sidelined again by right calf soreness. “Trying to stay positive with him,” Bickerstaff said. Love has appeared in only four games this season. HEAT TURNAROUND Miami started the season 11-17 and has gone 11-1 since, though Spoelstra insists the turnaround was happening before this 12-game stretch. “We saw the appropriate steps being made long before it started to change in the record,” Spoelstra said.","401307395"
"Dwight Howard denies Julius Randle at the rim -- and Randle lands on his backside. (0:36) PHILADELPHIA -- — Tobias Harris scored the baskets that let the Philadelphia 76ers beat the New York Knicks for the 14th straight time and yelled, “I'm an All-Star!” Fueled by a perceived snub, Harris has become a closer in the clutch and kept Philadelphia rolling without Joel Embiid. Harris scored 30 points, Seth Curry had 20 and the 76ers beat the Knicks 99-96 on Tuesday night for their sixth straight win. “That's for sure what I said,” Harris said. “I'm just reaffirming that to myself. I know the fans know that. I just try and find motivation in different areas and that's one of them.” The Sixers (28-12) maintained their grip atop the Eastern Conference standings, in large part because Harris got hot in the final minutes. He scored seven straight points, including the tying bucket from 3-feet out and a go-ahead layup that made it 96-92. He then yelled his All-Star proclamation loud enough for a sellout crowd of 3,071 fans to hear. Harris believed he should have joined teammates Ben Simmons and Embiid in Atlanta. “I’m sure it fuels him,"" 76ers coach Doc Rivers said. ""I think Tobias wants to win more, but I still think he thinks he should have been on the All-Star team. I agree with that. ” Simmons had 16 points and 13 rebounds and has never lost — 13-0 — against the Knicks. Julius Randle had 19 points and 16 rebounds for the Knicks, and RJ Barrett scored 17 points. The Sixers, again playing without injured All-Star Joel Embiid, had won all three games since the All-Star break by at least 22 points. The Knicks made them work for this one. The Sixers reserves rallied them in the fourth. Matisse Thybulle and Furkan Korkmaz buried consecutive 3s that brought the Sixers within four and they stayed on the court when Simmons and Harris checked back into the game. Dwight Howard kept it a four-point game on a clean block on Randle’s drive — no restraint needed — and Simmons scored consecutive baskets that made it 89-87. Curry gave the Sixers a 90-89 lead when he buried a 3 with 5:01 left. Randle had to be held back by Knicks teammates after the buzzer following a call that went against him in the final seconds of a loss a night earlier to Brooklyn. The All-Star forward was furious when he was whistled for a travel and the play was not reviewed. Randle’s first season in New York has otherwise been fantastic. The crowd was sprinkled with Knicks fans and there was a brief “MVP!” chant when he went to the free-throw line in the first half. The Sixers promptly turned up the artificial noise. Randle nearly had a triple-double through three quarters and helped the Knicks pick up their offense over the next two quarters. The Knicks led just 21-20 after a first quarter stuffed with missed shots in an ugly start to the game. “The 90s are excited about this game,” 76ers President Daryl Morey tweeted. The Knicks collapsed in the fourth and scored just 14 points on 5-of-19 shooting. “It shows us the work necessary to get over the hump,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. TIP-INS Knicks: G Derrick Rose remained out because of COVID protocols. “He’s feeling a lot better,” Thibodeau said. 76ers: Embiid turned 27. ... Rivers had Thibodeau on his staff in Boston when the Celtics won the 2008 NBA title. The two have remained close through the years. “He is one of those guys whose love is basketball. Early on, I tried to get him out of the office. And then I realized that would make him unhappy,” Rivers said. “So let I him be.” FAMILY AFFAIR Rivers should have been coaching against his son, but Austin remained away from the team. Rivers lost his spot in New York’s rotation earlier this season when the Knicks acquired Rose and has been officially ruled out because of “personal reasons.” Doc Rivers said he never talked about his son’s situation with Thibodeau. “I don’t call coaches and suggest who they should play. I just don’t,” Rivers said. “If it’s your son or not, I stay away from that.” Rivers also declined to comment on Austin’s personal and professional life. HE SAID IT Howard had 11 points and 12 rebounds off the bench for the Sixers.

(0:28) CHICAGO -- — Zach LaVine scored 40 points on 15-for-20 shooting, and the Chicago Bulls beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 123-102 on Tuesday night for their second straight win. LaVine led the way as Chicago shot 51% (48 for 94) from the field. The All-Star guard was 7 for 12 from 3-point range in 31 minutes of playing time. “He was unbelievably efficient on offense,"" coach Billy Donovan said. “He was spectacular.” LaVine's shots were dropping, one after another, especially when the Bulls needed a lift. “I've always been pretty efficient,” LaVine said. “I think I just got more consistent with shots and started to take some better ones. “Everything I shoot, I think I should make it.” Lauri Markkanen had 22 points for the Bulls, and Thaddeus Young added 17 points and nine rebounds. Tomas Satoransky finished with 13 points and seven assists. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 points for Oklahoma City, which had won three of four. Moses Brown had 20 points and 16 rebounds, and Kenrich Williams scored 14. “I think tonight we just couldn't find a way to compete the way we need to for 48 minutes,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. LaVine made his first five shots — including four 3-pointers — as Chicago raced to a 42-28 lead after one quarter. But the Thunder stormed back with a 15-0 run and took a 50-49 lead with 6:32 left in the half on Williams' 3-pointer from the corner. LaVine returned to the lineup and Chicago got back on track offensively, outscoring Oklahoma City 21-14 heading into the intermission. “I just want to come out and give us a good push,” LaVine said. “I wanted to help put the game away.” LaVine stayed hot early in the third quarter, sinking his first three shots on layups. Chicago outscored Oklahoma City 31-16 in the third to up its lead to 102-79. “(LaVine) requires a five-man defense and that showed us an area where we need to improve,” Daigneault said. ""A player like LaVine is going to burn you for every little mistake. “He burned us tonight and there's a lot we can learn from that.” KIDS COOLED OFF The game featured two of the youngest players in the NBA. Oklahoma City’s Aleksaj Pokusevski (19 years, 3 months) and Chicago’s Patrick Williams (19 years, 7 months) both started. Pokusevski and Williams both had 23 points in their previous game. But they struggled in this one. Pokusevski finished with four points on 2-for-9 shooting. Williams had just two points, going 1 for 9 from the floor. TIP-INS Thunder: Rookie Theo Maledon, also 19, returned after sitting out Sunday with a right ankle injury. Lu Dort (toe) and Al Horford (rest) were unavailable. Horford was rested for consecutive games for this first time this season. ... Brown and Ty Jerome were back in the starting lineup after making their first career NBA starts on Sunday against Memphis. ... Daigneault said the Thunder would take its time to “onboard” G/F Svi Mykhailiuk, who was acquired in a trade on Saturday. Bulls: Donovan said Garrett Temple (left ankle sprain) is out of his walking boot and making progress, but he had no timetable for the forward’s return. ... In their previous meeting with the Thunder this season, in Oklahoma City on Jan 15, the Bulls blew a 22-point lead and lost 127-125 in OT.","401307397"
"Kenyon Martin Jr. gets up high to throw down a lefty jam on John Collins. (0:26) HOUSTON -- — Danilo Gallinari scored 20 of his 29 points in the first half and the Atlanta Hawks beat Houston 119-107 on Tuesday night, dealing the Rockets a franchise record-tying 17th straight loss. Atlanta won its sixth straight, matching its longest since the first month of the 2016-17 season. Houston's losing skid ties the the franchise record by the San Diego Rockets in the team’s inaugural 1967-68 season. The Rockets haven’t won since Feb. 4. Atlanta led 73-58 at the half, but Houston won the third quarter 34-20 to pull within 93-92 entering the fourth. “Our defense in the fourth quarter really gave us the win,” Hawks coach Nate McMillan said. “Our guys, they stayed with it, didn’t get rattled and we kept our composure.” The Hawks were without starting and backup centers Clint Capela (heel) and Onyeka Okongwu (adductor). Without their main two big men, the Hawks started power forwards Gallinari and John Collins. “I thought both of those guys did a good job of taking advantage of the small-ball they were playing,” McMillan said. “We did a really good job of recognizing where the matchup was and taking advantage of it.” Gallinari hit 5 of 8 from 3-point range and has scored at least 20 points in four of his last five games after reaching that mark just twice in his first 23 games this season. “I’m just a lucky guy,” Gallinari said of his recent hot stretch. “I think we have a good rhythm and our chemistry is really getting going. We’re moving the ball and finding the right guy at the right time.” Collins scored 20 points, and Trae Young had 13 points and 14 assists. Five Hawks scored in double figures by halftime, and six scored at least 10 in the game. Victor Oladipo led Houston with 34 points, Jae’Sean Tate had 25, and Kevin Porter, Jr., scored 22. The Rockets were without a slew of players, including Christian Wood, John Wall, Eric Gordon, P.J. Tucker and Ben McLemore. Houston played with the league-minimum eight players, including two players on two-way contracts and one on a 10-day contract. “I thought we tried hard, and we fought, and we had eight guys and we kind of ran out of gas in the fourth quarter,” Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “It’s painful, regardless, but you look for small victories in this stretch when we are completely decimated.” TIP-INS Hawks: Capela, who was traded last February from Houston to Atlanta, received a highlight tribute video and was given an ovation by the Toyota Center crowd during a timeout in the first quarter. ... Without their big men, the Hawks were narrowly outrebounded 38-37. Rockets: Houston is hopeful Wood (ankle) can return Wednesday against the Warriors. The Rockets have gone 0-17 since his injury. Oladipo is unlikely to play, Silas said. The Rockets are also hoping for a Wednesday return for Danuel House Jr., (right knee contusion). Wall (left knee contusion) is hopeful for a Friday return. BACK TO .500 The win moves Atlanta to 20-20, back to a .500 record for the first time since Feb. 1. The team fired Lloyd Pierce on March 1 and named McMillan the interim. The Hawks are 6-0 under McMillan. “Of course, I’m looking at it, but we’re just taking this one game at a time and focusing on trying to get better every game,” McMillan said. “I haven’t talked with the guys a whole lot about our schedule, but this was a goal to try and get on a winning streak and put together a string of wins.” HE SAID IT “The fact that we’re in this awful stretch, and they’re not letting go of the rope, and they’re fighting their tails off and showing so much character. Everything I ask them to do, they try to do and that’s what a coach wants his group to do.” -- Rockets coach Stephen Silas WOMEN’S HISTORY NIGHT As part of Women’s History Night, the Rockets honored four-time WNBA champion and two-time WNBA League MVP Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, who played for the Houston Comets and is the current head women’s basketball coach at Texas Southern. “My journey with the Houston Comets was amazing, and I’ll never forget it,” Cooper said in a video.","401307398"
"Damian Lillard reflects on his journey to becoming a star in the NBA and how he still puts in just as much effort as when he was unknown. (1:53) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Damian Lillard has led some memorable comebacks and made some clutch game-winners, but to him, this win was noteworthy. Lillard had 50 points and 10 assists, and the Portland Trail Blazers came from behind to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 125-124 on Tuesday night. Lillard, who finished with six 3-pointers, made a pair of free throws with 1.2 seconds left for Portland, which rallied from a 17-point deficit with some six minutes remaining. He scored 20 of his points in the final quarter. “I think with how it happened and the position we were in down the stretch, this will be one I remember,” Lillard said. Brandon Ingram scored 30 points and Zion Williamson added 28 for the Pelicans. Lonzo Ball had 11 points and a season-high 17 assists. Nickeil Alexander-Walker had 20 points, including six 3-pointers, off the bench for New Orleans. His 3 midway through the final quarter stretched the Pelicans' lead to 112-96. But Gary Trent Jr.’s 3-pointer pulled the Blazers to within 117-113 with 3:30 left. Lillard added a 3 to make it a one-point game. Eric Bledsoe answered with a 3 for New Orleans, but Carmelo Anthony's jumper kept it close. Williamson's layup made it 122-118 with just over a minute to go. After Lillard and Williamson traded layups, Lillard was fouled and made both his shots. With 4.2 seconds left the Blazers got the ball with the Pelicans hanging on to a 124-123 lead. Bledsoe fouled Lillard, who made both his shots to put Portland up 125-124 with 1.2 seconds left. Williamson's turnaround hook at the other end at the buzzer missed the mark. “I got to my spot and drew a foul and that was game,"" Lillard said. The Pelicans were stunned. “I mean, we just didn’t play the way we played the whole game, like we were trying to run the clock out,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We talked about that before: We’ve got to get the ball down the floor and play the game. And we did not do it.” CJ McCollum, who was out with a fractured left foot, returned and finished with 10 points in 27 minutes for the Blazers. McCollum was averaging a career-best 26.7 points, as well as five assists, when he was injured during a game against the Atlanta Hawks on Jan. 16. McCollum started, but coach Terry Stotts said before the game that his minutes would be limited. The Blazers were still awaiting the return of Jusuf Nurkic, who fractured his wrist during a January game McCollum's first basket from the field was a first-quarter 3-pointer off a pass from Lillard. Lillard, who was ranked second in the league with an average of 29.9 points a game, got hit in the hand early in the game and was treated during a timeout, but he returned. New Orleans stretched the lead to as many as 16 points in the opening half before going into the break up 64-50. Williamson and Ingram combined for 30 of the Pelicans' first-half points. The Blazers closed to within 71-64 in the third quarter after Lillard's layup, but they couldn't get any closer until the final minutes. “He continues to do things that are remarkable,” Stotts said. “Fifty points and 10 assists, and game-winners, and all the things that he does. I’m never surprised, but I never take it for granted.” It was the second of three meetings between the teams. Portland won the first 126-124 in New Orleans on Feb. 4. TIP INS Pelicans: New Orleans won all four of the games against the Blazers last season. ... The Pelicans were coming off a 135-115 victory Sunday over the Los Angeles Clippers. ... It was Ball's second double-double this season. Trail Blazers: Portland was coming off a 114-112 loss at Minnesota on Sunday. ...

It was Lillard’s fifth game this season with 40 or more points, most in the NBA. ... Lillard was 18-for-18 from the line. SOOOOO CLOSE Ball hit Williamson with the long pass under the basket for the final shot of the game, and it looked as though the Pelicans might pull it off. “It was a great play. He’s a big wide receiver, he’s hard to get around,” Stotts said about Williamson. “But I think Lonzo made a hell of a pass.”","401307399"
"LeBron James connects with Kyle Kuzma on a full-court pass as Kuzma drains the easy layup. (0:19) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James had 25 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists in his 99th career triple-double, leading the Los Angeles Lakers to a 137-121 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night. Montrezl Harrell scored 25 points in another big game for the defending NBA champions, who picked up their third straight victory on the second night of a back-to-back set. James also recorded a triple-double Monday night at Golden State while Harrell scored 27 points. “He’s obviously the best reader of pick-and-roll action in the game, and Trez is a dynamic roller,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “Minnesota had a hard time figuring it out, and we have a mindset with our stuff that if a play works, we keep running it.” Dennis Schröder had 16 points and seven assists, while Kyle Kuzma and Talen Horton-Tucker scored 16 points apiece and excelled in the second half as the Lakers pulled away from NBA-worst Minnesota in the fourth quarter with 35 points on 14-for-23 shooting, particularly out of James' pick-and-rolls. The Lakers had 37 assists against Minnesota after racking up 36 at Golden State, giving them 35 or more assists in back-to-back games for the first time since 1996. “I'm just trying to dictate play, and whatever the defense gives us, just put the ball on target at the right times and make the right reads,” James said. “I was able to do that, especially in the fourth quarter.” The undersized Harrell had another strong game in the paint as the Lakers kept winning without starting big men Anthony Davis and Marc Gasol. Davis missed his 12th straight game with a right calf injury likely to sideline him until April. Karl-Anthony Towns and Anthony Edwards scored 29 points apiece for the Timberwolves, who had won two of their last three games for the first time since December. “When a young team like we are gets tired, bad habits kick in,” said Ricky Rubio, who scored 14 of his 19 points in the first half. “One of those is you settle for a jumper or a pull-up 3 instead of attacking to the rim. That’s why experience in this league is so important. With a veteran team like the Lakers, in the fourth quarter when the fatigue kicks in, they get even better. We’ve got to learn from that.” Minnesota made 52% of its shots against one of the NBA's best defensive teams, but allowed eight Lakers to score at least eight points apiece. “I thought we came out and started great, and then our shot selection got away from us,” Minnesota coach Chris Finch said. “We took a bunch of half-baked shots ... and that allowed them to come back to tighten the game up again.” TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jordan McLaughlin missed his fourth straight game under the NBA's health and safety protocols. ... Former Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell is expected to rejoin the team this week. He had arthroscopic knee surgery a month ago. Lakers: Gasol missed his fifth straight game under the NBA's health and safety protocols. He hasn't played since February. ... Alex Caruso missed his second straight game in the NBA's concussion protocol. He worked out on the court before the game. LEBRON MESSED AROUND Midway through the fourth quarter, James secured his fifth triple-double of the season — and his second straight after a 22-point, 11-assist, 10-rebound performance in San Francisco on Monday. “I honestly don’t think (James) has been playing that differently than what he was doing leading into the break,” Vogel said. “I just think our shooters have come alive. I think we hit a little bit of a wall coming into the break, and then our shooters got their legs under them a little bit, and in the last three games they’ve been hitting shots, so his assist totals are up.” Only four players in NBA history have recorded 100 triple-doubles, and they include Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd (107). Oscar Robertson holds the record with 181, but Russell Westbrook is up to 157. Lakers great Magic Johnson is third with 138.","401307400"
"Josh Jackson connects with Isaiah Stewart at the top of the arc as Stewart drains the unguarded 3-pointer. (0:20) DETROIT -- — Saddiq Bey had 28 points and 12 rebounds, and the Detroit Pistons overcame Norman Powell's 43 points to beat the Toronto Raptors 116-112 on Wednesday night, ending a four-game skid. Bey, who leads all rookies in 3-pointers with 85, was 6 of 10 from behind the arc for Detroit, which had lost 10 of 12. “That young man is already a solid pro and he's just getting started,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “He's as strong as an ox and you can see what he's doing with his jump shot. He's going to be a star in this league for a long time.” Bey has played 38 of Detroit's 40 games but isn't worried about hitting a rookie wall. “I love this schedule,” he said. “When you are in college, or even when you are playing an 82-game season, you have a lot of downtime between games. This year, we're basically playing every other day with a lot of back-to-backs. This is exactly what players want.” Delon Wright added 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, and Jerami Grant had 23 points. The Pistons outrebounded Toronto 54-30, including 13 offensive rebounds. “There was one stretch in the first half where we got four straight stops, but they beat us to every rebound and got another putback,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “At the end of that, you've worked hard, but you don't have any stops. You can't win when you are being outcompeted.” Powell went 14 of 18 from the floor, including 8 of 12 on 3-pointers, and Chris Boucher added 21 points on 10-of-16 shooting. However, Toronto's other three starters — Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and Kyle Lowry — missed 30 of their 37 field-goal attempts in a sixth straight loss. “It is frustrating, because we had a chance to win this game, but we couldn't make shots,” Nurse said. “Norman and Chris gave us a chance, but we couldn’t get there.” Siakam and VanVleet were both returning from absences related to COVID-19 protocols. “Obviously, I haven't been able to do much for the last couple weeks, but it was great being back out there,” said Siakam, who had 13 points on 3-of-11 shooting. “I'm tired, though, and I think I've lost some weight. Maybe it will make me faster.” Powell had 21 points in the first half, but the Pistons' 14-4 edge in second-chance points helped them take a 63-58 lead. Toronto went ahead with a 10-1 run to start the third quarter, aided by flagrant-1 fouls against Wright and Mason Plumlee. The Pistons, though, continued to dominate on the glass and took an 84-77 lead with 2:38 left in the quarter when Isaiah Stewart tipped in Detroit's third offensive rebound of the possession. Detroit led 88-81 at period's end and was up by double digits before a late Raptors run made it 105-102 with 2:27 to go. Josh Jackson hit a 3-pointer but fouled out on the next possession. Powell had a chance at a four-point play with 32 seconds left but missed the free throw to leave the score at 112-109. Grant added a jumper late. TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto hadn't lost six straight games since Dec. 3-12, 2012, Casey's second year coaching the Raptors. Pistons: Little Caesars Arena was allowed to sell 750 tickets for the game — the first time in 374 days the Pistons had played in front of home fans. GUNNING ALL NIGHT Powell became the second player this season to score 43 or more points without an assist.

"James Harden puts up 40 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds as he leads the Nets to a comeback victory against the Pacers. (2:16) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Brooklyn Nets coach Steve Nash insists he will never take for granted how James Harden can take control of a game. Harden did that with 40 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds for his 11th triple-double of the season, leading Brooklyn to a 124-115 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night. The All-Star guard often demanded double teams in the final quarter, yet still delivered with 14 points, six rebounds and four assists. The Nets outscored the Pacers 35-24 in the fourth. “It's a remarkable performance,” Nash said. ""He made some huge plays down the stretch. ... All the other guys played their part, but James was the main guy, as we've come to expect.” The Nets were without fellow All-Stars Kyrie Irving (groin) and Kevin Durant (hamstring) and newcomer Blake Griffin (knee). Harden was 13 of 27 from the field and 12 of 14 at the line. When he wasn't shooting, he set up open teammates driving to the basket, often for dunks and layups. “Harden was just doing his thing,” said the Pacers’ Domantas Sabonis. Harden hit a runner in the lane to tie it at 96 early in the fourth. That started a 13-4 run that included a Harden 3-pointer and another layup that pushed it to 109-100. “We just kept fighting and showed resilience,” Harden said. The performance was reminiscent of rallying from a 24-point deficit for a win at Phoenix without Irving and Durant. “I don't want to be down,” Harden said with a chuckle. “Obviously, we don't want to get used to having K.D. and Kyrie out of the lineup, but if we do, guys have got to be ready to step up.” Joe Harris added 19 points for the Nets, and Jeff Green and Tyler Johnson each had 15. Malcolm Brogdon led Indiana with 24 points, Sabonis had a triple-double with 18 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists. “All four games after the break in the fourth quarter, we've struggled,” Sabonis said. “I don't know. We're not getting stops when we need to.” Caris LeVert scored 19 points in his Pacers home debut since returning from kidney surgery three games ago. He was acquired in a deal that involved Harden going to the Nets. “I'm trying to get past the return part as much as possible,” LeVert said. “I wish we could have got the win.” The Pacers scored a season-high 40 points in the first quarter to take a 15-point lead. Harden held the Nets cut it to 61-58 at the half. He had 15 points and seven assists at the break. Harris hit a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the third quarter to get the Nets to 91-89. TIP-INS Nets: Have won 12 of 13 since Durant was sidelined. ... Harden needs one triple-double to tie Jason Kidd's single-season team record.

"After taking over the game late to help the Bucks top the 76ers, Giannis Antetokounmpo asks for a Philly cheesesteak during his postgame news conference. (0:36) PHILADELPHIA -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo came up big in overtime, and then took a seat — right on the court. Antetokounmpo scored 10 of his 32 points in the extra session to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 109-105 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night in a matchup of two of the Eastern Conference’s best teams. After being hounded by Philadelphia All-Star Ben Simmons for most of the game, Antetokounmpo found his offense late with Simmons in foul trouble. He scored 10 straight Bucks points, the last a 10-foot jumper in the lane that pushed Milwaukee’s lead to 105-98 with 1:11 left in overtime. He sat on the court near the 76ers bench after the bucket, drawing boos from the fans. “I haven’t seen that, that’s what I felt like I wanted to do at the time,” he said. “I was just trying to have fun and enjoy the moment.” The 76ers weren’t thrilled with the show of joy. “I wanted to go and Stone Cold Stunner him, but I already had one tech,” Philadelphia’s Dwight Howard said. “He had a hell of a game. I don’t want to talk trash or say anything negative, but we’ll see him again.” With P.J. Tucker reportedly headed to Milwaukee in a trade with Houston, Donte DiVincenzo scored 20 points and Jrue Holiday added 19 for the Bucks, who have won five in a row and 10 of 11. Milwaukee’s D.J. Augustin and D.J. Wilson, who according to ESPN will be traded to the Rockets, did not play. Torrey Craig, reportedly headed to Phoenix in a separate deal to clear salary space for Tucker, also sat out. Antetokounmpo finished with 15 rebounds and five assists, ending a streak of three straight triple-doubles. The two-time MVP had just four points and four shots, including a 3-point attempt that was woefully short, in the opening 24 minutes. “I wasn’t having fun,” he said. That changed in overtime. “I just tried to be aggressive,” he said. “There are going to be times when I have to be aggressive and go downhill and there are times when I have to find my teammates.” Tobias Harris scored 19 points and Danny Green added 18 for Philadelphia, which had its six-game winning streak snapped. Philadelphia All-Star Joel Embiid sat for the third straight game with a bruised left knee. Simmons had 13 points and 12 assists and hit a late 3-pointer. “They flipped the switch in the second half,” Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said. The Bucks (26-14) pulled within 1 1/2 games of the East-leading 76ers (28-13). SECOND-HALF SUCCESS Milwaukee rallied from a 19-point second-half deficit and went ahead 91-84 on Holiday’s corner 3 with 52.3 seconds left in regulation. The Bucks still led 93-90 on Khris Middleton’s layup with 3 seconds left. After a timeout, Furkan Korkmaz drained a corner 3 with 0.4 seconds remaining to send the game to overtime. FIRST-HALF FAILURE Milwaukee missed 16 of 17 3-point tries in the opening half and 33 of 45 shots overall, settling for a season-low 31 first-half points in addition to 13 turnovers. The Bucks’ previous low in a first half was 41 points. VETERAN HELP Tucker has averaged 7.2 points and 5.8 rebounds in an 11-year career for Houston, Toronto and Phoenix.

"Russell Westbrook twice tries to throw down statement dunks vs. the Kings, and twice he comes up empty-handed as his attempts go flying out of bounds. (0:40) WASHINGTON -- — De'Aaron Fox scored 28 points and hit a jumper over Bradley Beal with 0.7 seconds remaining to give the Sacramento Kings a 121-119 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes each added 18 points for Sacramento, which got its first win in the third of a six-game East Coast trip. The Kings have gone 4-4 since a nine-game slide that spanned most of February. “It was one of those moments where it could’ve gone either way,” said Kings coach Luke Walton, who started three players age 23 or younger, including the 23-year-old Fox. “That’s why I say, it’s so good for these guys to be in these type of games.” Russell Westbrook had 26 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists — his 12th triple-double of the season — for the Wizards, who have lost five straight since the All-Star break, the last four of those at home. Beal scored 29 points on 12-of-20 shooting, but but missed all five of his 3-point attempts as the Wizards shot a season-low 16% (4 of 25) from beyond the arc. Alex Len had 13 points and 12 rebounds for Washington. Both the Wizards and Kings entered Wednesday in 13th in their respective conferences, three places back of the last playoff berth. “I’ll say the same thing I said the first half of the year: Nobody’s going to feel sorry for us,” Beal said. The Kings led by nine points after the third quarter and maintained their advantage for most of the fourth before a personal 6-0 run by Westbrook. His driving layup tied the game at 119 with 22.6 seconds left. After a Sacramento timeout, Fox took the inbounds pass and ran down the clock before he dribbled left and sank a 19-foot jumper over Beal's outstretched arm. “First thought is always to get to the basket, and he tucked on that,” said Fox, who scored the Kings' last nine points. “You can’t get to the basket every time. So when I dribbled back, I was ready to shoot the ball.” Said Beal: “The only thing I probably could’ve done is maybe cut off his left hand, force him right. But he had it going the last 10 possessions.” Washington called timeout to try and set up a miracle winning shot with less than a second to play, but Westbrook threw away the inbounds. TIP-INS Kings: Walton said the team is “evaluating treatment plans” for Marvin Bagley III (hand fracture). Bagley was forced out of Monday's loss to Charlotte with the injury. ... Rookie Tyrese Haliburton scored 17 points starting in place of Bagley. ... Holmes fouled out with 1:40 left. ... C Hassan Whiteside (health and safety protocols) and F Robert Woodward II (hamstring strain) were active, although Woodward did not play. Wizards: Fell to 3-8 in the first of back-to-back games. ... G Raul Neto (bruised ribs) played after coach Scott Brooks said he would be a game-time decision. ... After making 15 consecutive starts, C Moritz Wagner has been active but unused in the last three games. IRON UNKIND While Westbrook was sensational late, he twice missed dunks off the back of the rim, the latter coming with 3:30 to play as Washington tried to close Sacramento's slim lead. FOX HUNTING Sacramento's improved play has coincided with more consistency from Fox. The third-year pro has at least 20 points in 10 straight games. “I'm just continuing to play, man. That's pretty much all it is,” he said.","401307404"

They read what the defense was doing and then they made the right plays.” Sexton scored 29 points, Garland added 25 and the two guards made big plays down the stretch as the Cavaliers ended a four-game losing streak with a 117-110 win Wednesday night over the Boston Celtics, who have fallen back to .500. “They made timely baskets,” Boston coach Brad Stevens said . “They made floaters. They made timely plays.” Sexton and Garland did it all, combining for 54 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. “That’s the improvement and growth we’re looking for,” said Cavs forward Larry Nance Jr., who added 18 points and 10 rebounds. The Cavs showed some glimpses of a promising future while also ending a nine-game losing streak to the Celtics, who wore their familiar green on St. Patrick's Day but had nothing to celebrate. Boston lost for the third time in four games, with the Celtics' lone win coming against the woeful Houston Rockets. Stevens detected some slumping shoulders amongst his players when shots didn't fall in the first half. It was not a good performance by a team with title aspirations and which had played Utah tough before losing at home on Tuesday night. “Sometimes, that's the way the game goes,” said Stevens, who wasn't displeased with his team's effort. Cleveland played with a lead all night, but the Cavs had to hold off a second-half rally by Boston led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Tatum scored 29 points and Brown 28 for the Celtics, whose only lead was at 2-0. With Cleveland clinging to a four-point lead, Garland hit a runner in the lane, and after a miss by Brown, Cavs rookie Isaac Okoro took a pass by Garland and threw down a vicious dunk and was fouled by Tatum. He completed the three-point play to make it 105-98. Sexton followed with his own three-point play a minute later to put the Cavs ahead by 12, and Cleveland, which lost at Miami on Tuesday, made its free throws in the final two minutes to get its first win since the All-Star break. Okoro had 15 points, including seven in the final quarter to help the Cavs hold on. Boston was just 10 of 38 on 3-pointers with Tatum and Brown going a combined 5 of 25. The Celtics were down two important pieces as guard Kemba Walker (knee injury management) and forward Tristan Thompson (health and safety protocols) both sat out. TAIT HONORED The Cavaliers paid tribute to longtime broadcaster Joe Tait, who died last week, by having a moment of silence before the game. Tait did radio play-by-play for the team from its inception in 1970 and for 39 seasons. After he retired in 2011, the Cavs hung a banner honoring “The voice of the Cavaliers” among their retired jerseys. TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens said center Robert Williams III will be re-examined on Thursday after hurting his knee going up for a lob. Stevens said there was an initial fear of a hyperextension, but Williams returned. ... This would have been Thompson's first game back in Cleveland since leaving as a free agent last year. A longtime fan favorite, Thompson spent nine seasons with the Cavs, who drafted him with the No. 4 overall pick in 2011. Cavaliers: F Kevin Love was out again. He missed his second game in a row since returning last week and feeling some discomfort in his second game back with a severe calf strain that has kept him more than two months. ... G Matthew Dellavedova is recovered from a concussion but has not yet been cleared to return following an appendectomy. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said the veteran will be back “sooner rather than later” but did not provide a timeline. ... The NBA moved Cleveland's April 9 game against Toronto to April 10.","401307405"
"Trailing by as many as 23, the Spurs go on a 17-0 run in the fourth quarter to fuel their comeback victory. (1:16) CHICAGO -- — Jakob Poeltl tied a career high with 20 points and set one with 16 rebounds, and the San Antonio Spurs used a huge fourth quarter to beat the Chicago Bulls 106-99 on Wednesday night. The Spurs trailed by 23 in the second quarter and were down 58-40 after their lowest-scoring first half of the season. But they dominated Chicago 39-19 in the fourth to come away with their second straight win after losing three of four. Derrick White scored 17 points — nine in the final quarter. Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson and Patty Mills each scored 14. Mills also had two steals, and the Spurs came out on top even though they made just 8 of 31 3-pointers. “We played two great defensive quarters in the second half, spurred on by Patty Mills' aggressiveness, and it just seemed to infect everybody else,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. “Offensively, we made a few shots, which we did not do in the first half. Jakob had a wonderful game.” Zach LaVine led Chicago with 29 points after scoring 40 the previous night in a win over Oklahoma City. Thaddeus Young, playing his 1,000th game, scored 16. And rookie Patrick Williams grabbed a personal-best 14 rebounds. “You're (ticked) off,” LaVine said. “I don't know how anybody else feels. I know how I feel. It's upsetting. You feel the momentum shift in the game, and sometimes, you can't do a lot about it. I think I've got to take better responsibility, myself, as a leader of the team to try to get guys together.” The Bulls led 80—67 through three quarters, only to have San Antonio open the fourth on a 12-0 run. Chicago responded with a 9-2 spurt. But the Spurs reeled off 17 in a row. Dejounte Murray gave them a 90-89 lead with a floater in transition and capped the run with a 15-footer to make it 98-89 with 2:44 remaining. One big difference for the Spurs in the second half was they went to a press. “It's not even about getting steals out of it,” Poeltl said. “It's more about getting us going on defense and maybe speeding them up, forcing them to take a bad shot or two. And I think that's really what got us going, got us to play more physical on defense. As a result of that, we got better rhythm shots on offense and they started falling.” FOUL PLAY The Bulls made 8 of 9 free throws. And LaVine — with three attempts — was the only starter to get to the line. “I guess San Antonio's the best defensive team in the NBA,” LaVine said. “I know that they don't foul a lot. I know I was going to the hole, and I drive aggressively. I know Thad drives aggressively. ... Obviously, San Antonio was pretty perfect tonight.” TIP-INS Spurs: The Spurs' previous low for points in the first half was 45, and they matched one by scoring 16 in the opening quarter. ... The Spurs hope to have F DeMar DeRozan (personal reasons) back when they visit Cleveland on Friday, though coach Gregg Popovich said it's “not in stone, yet.” DeRozan missed his fourth consecutive game, while F Keita Bates-Diop (strained right hamstring) sat out his second in a row. ... Murray had a suggestion for LaVine after the All-Star went off for 40 against Oklahoma City. He wrote “SIT OUT TOMORROW AND GET SOME REST!!!” in response to LaVine's Instagram post following the game. LaVine responded with laughing emojis. Bulls: The 16 points allowed in the first quarter matched a season low for Chicago. ... Coach Billy Donovan had plenty of praise for Young, a 14-year veteran. “Great guy. All the about team,” Donovan said. “Appreciate the investment he's made in a lot of the younger guys because that takes energy to do that. He's been really patient with those guys. I think think he's a great role model in a lot of ways.”","401307406"
"Stephen Curry appears to be in pain and is diagnosed with a tailbone contusion from landing awkwardly near the bench after missing an off-balance 3-pointer. (0:29) HOUSTON -- — Draymond Green had 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Golden State Warriors handed the Houston Rockets their franchise-record 18th straight loss, 108-94 on Wednesday night. “Draymond was having fun out there tonight,” coach Steve Kerr said. “He was on top of his game. I thought he controlled the whole game with his defense and his rebounding. He was really, in my book, the player of the game.” It was the third triple-double this season for Green and the 27th of his career. Reserve Jordan Poole scored 23 points and made a career-high six 3-pointers to help the Warriors bounce back from a blowout loss to the Lakers on Monday. Golden State breezed past the struggling Rockets to snap a season-high four-game road losing streak. “To lose a game like we lost the other day that was terrible,” Green said. “Just wanted to come out and get a good game, start this road trip off right.” Houston’s skid surpasses the 17 straight losses by the San Diego Rockets in 1968, when they went 15-67 in their first year as a franchise. It’s the first time the Rockets have lost nine consecutive home games since they dropped 11 straight in 1983. Golden State's Stephen Curry had 18 points and went 2 for 11 from 3-point range before sitting out the fourth quarter with a tailbone contusion. Kerr said Curry was sore and could miss Friday's game. Houston center Christian Wood returned after sitting out since Feb. 4 with a sprained right ankle. The Rockets had won seven of eight games before his injury. His first game out was when the skid started, and his return wasn’t nearly enough to get Houston back in the win column on a night when both John Wall and Victor Oladipo sat out. “He’s a difference-maker,” Houston coach Stephen Silas said of Wood. “He can score and rebound and block shots and really kind of changes who we are.” Despite the record skid, Silas saw positives on Wednesday night. “There’s definitely cause for some optimism around this team because once we get everybody back we’re going to be pretty good,” he said. Kevin Porter Jr. led the Rockets with 25 points and Wood finished with 21 points and nine rebounds. The Warriors led by four after the first quarter before outscoring Houston 37-17 in the second period to make it 68-44 at halftime. Poole led Golden State in the second, making 15 points and hitting 4 of 6 3-point attempts. “Jordan was great,” Kerr said. “He’s on a good run. I like his aggression. The thing that impresses me the most is how quick his decision-making has been.” The Rockets got no closer than 14 points in the second half. TIP-INS Warriors: Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 19 points and Andrew Wiggins had 17. Rockets: Danuel House had 11 points his return after missing five games with a bruised right knee. ... Wall missed his fifth game with a bruised left knee. ... Oladipo played Tuesday night but sat out Wednesday as maintenance in his recovery from a quadriceps injury. ... David Nwaba missed his second game with a sprained right wrist. WISEMAN AND PASCHALL OUT The Warriors announced after the game that James Wiseman and Eric Paschall missed the game because of coronavirus contact tracing and will be out for seven days under the league's health and safety protocols.","401307407"
"Ja Morant grabs the inbounds pass and flies down the court to give Memphis the lead with 1.2 seconds left vs. Miami. (0:36) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Ja Morant dribbled the length of the court for a tiebreaking layup with 1.2 seconds left and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Miami Heat 89-85 on Wednesday night to end a three-game skid. Memphis’ Kyle Anderson intercepted the inbound pass after Morant’s basket, was fouled and made two free throws to end Miami’s winning streak at five. The go-ahead bucket was similar to five days earlier when Morant’s closing drive against Denver was thwarted at the rim by center Nikola Jokic, leading to a Grizzlies loss. This time, the result was different. “Go get a bucket,” Morant said when asked about the play. “The same mindset I had against the Nuggets. … I was happy I was able to make the shot for us and hang on to the win.” “He's special,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""Him going in and scoring that bucket, going fullcourt with no timeouts left, speaks volumes to his ability and what he is able to do in clutch time.” Morant, Anderson and De’Anthony Melton each scored 13 points, and Melton also had 10 rebounds and six assists. Jimmy Butler was questionable to play after twisting his left ankle late in Tuesday’s win over Cleveland but led the Heat with 24 points on 10-of-20 shooting — among the few decent efforts in a poor-shooting game. Bam Adebayo scored 15 points and Duncan Robinson finished with 13. The Heat struggled to score through much of the night, playing their fifth game in seven days. “I am encouraged by our competitive spirit, playing a game in the mud,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Possession game, down the stretch, everything did matter.” Memphis was able to create some buffer late in the third quarter with 17 consecutive points and led 72-63 entering the fourth. Tyler Herro and Butler helped Miami tie it at 83 with 1:12 remaining. The score was tied again at 85 after a pair of free throws by Goran Dragic, setting the stage for Morant’s layup off an inbound pass. Morant got around Butler and got the shot off as Dragic came over to try and contest the attempt. “I’ve got to do my job,” said Butler, who guarded Morant from the inbound pass in the backcourt. “I’ll take that. That’s OK. I’ll be better the next time I’m in that situation, that position to get a stop. That’s what I’m here to do. I did not do that.” TIP-INS Heat: Wednesday marked Spoelstra’s 1,000th game as coach of the Heat. “I’m extremely humbled by that, and I’m really grateful for the people I work for,” said Spoelstra, only the third coach in NBA history to reach that milestone coaching one team in his career (Gregg Popovich, Spurs; Al Attles, Warriors). ... Barring a schedule change, this was Miami’s fifth and final one-game road trip of the season. … G/F Andre Iguodala (left hip soreness) and F Moe Harkless (illness) did not travel to Memphis for the game. ... Butler has 14 straight games with a steal. Grizzlies: Memphis began a stretch of four home games over the next six days. ... Jenkins tweaked his starting lineup, with Grayson Allen playing alongside Morant at guard, while rookie Desmond Bane moved back to the second unit. ... Dillon Brooks started his 181st game for Memphis, tying him with O.J. Mayo for 14th on the franchise list. ARIZA TRADE Miami made a trade with Oklahoma City on Wednesday, acquiring Trevor Ariza for Meyers Leonard and a 2027 second-round pick. Ariza has been working out privately in Miami. “I know he’s in great shape. His fitness level is extremely high. He’s been putting in a lot of work. You can’t fake that,” Spoelstra said, adding he doesn’t have a timetable on when Ariza would be ready to play.","401307408"
"Bol Bol drives in for a dunk to the delight of the Nuggets' bench.  On the other end, he swats away Jalen McDaniels' shot to give the ball back to Denver. (0:34) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic had 12 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for another triple-double, Michael Porter Jr. added 28 points and the Denver Nuggets pulled away in the second half to beat the Charlotte Hornets 129-104 on Wednesday night. Jokic has 10 triple-doubles this season and 51 overall. He also had his 228th double-double to move one past Dikembe Mutumbo for the franchise record. Jokic leads the NBA in double-doubles this season with 36 in 40 games. “Everybody knows Joker is going to do what he does every single night,” Porter said, referring to Jokic by his nickname. “He can do it all. If he wants to score 30 points, he can score 30 every single night. But he makes sure we get involved and we find our rhythm and that’s what great players do.” Will Barton scored 23 points to help the Nuggets win for the seventh time in eight games and snap Charlotte's four-game winning streak. Terry Rozier had 21 points to lead the Hornets. LaMelo Ball had 14 points. Up 57-45 at the half, the Nuggets took control with a dominant third quarter, outscoring the Hornets 38-22 to take a 95-67 lead into the final period. In the final 3 1/2 minutes of the third, as the Nuggets stretched their lead to 28 points, Jokic had passes to Jamal Murray that set up a 3-pointer, fed JaMychal Green for a dunk and PJ Dozier for a layup before going in for a dunk off a feed from Facundo Campazzo. Charlotte could not threaten the rest of the way as the Nuggets led by 34 points. They emptied their bench midway through the final quarter. “Denver’s a really good team,” Charlotte’s Gordon Hayward said. “They’re gearing up to try for a championship. They’ve been together for a while. So when you, as a team and collectively, don’t play your best they can embarrass you. And that’s certainly what happened tonight.” TIP-INS Hornets: Less than a month after going 3-3 on six-game trip, Charlotte began another extended stay on the road. Wednesday's visit to Denver was the first in a five-game road trip. Nuggets: G Gary Harris remains sidelined by a left abductor strain that has kept him out for most of the last five weeks. There is no timetable yet for his return. “I think for right now, and the foreseeable future, Gary is out and hopefully every day he is inching closer to getting back and being able to play,” coach Michael Malone said before the game.","401307409"
"Jeff Van Gundy is somehow able to keep his composure as his cat moves across the screen while he broadcasts the Clippers vs. Mavericks game from his home. (0:25) DALLAS -- — Luka Doncic thrilled the crowd early with a four-point play after getting fouled by Kawhi Leonard, then turned for a lengthy acknowledgement of those fans after one of several late buckets that helped keep Dallas comfortably in front. In a two-game set with the feel of a playoff series, the Mavericks got the split behind their young sensation. Doncic scored 42 points, and the Mavericks answered a loss against their first-round playoff opponent from last season, beating the Los Angeles Clippers 105-89 on Wednesday night. Josh Richardson scored 14 points and was a defensive spark as the Mavericks followed a 109-99 defeat two nights earlier and won the season series, 2-1. The other Dallas victory was by 51 points in LA three games into the season in December, about four months after the Clippers finished off the Mavs in six games in the NBA’s playoff bubble. “They’re a really good defensive team,” said Doncic, who was 16 of 28 from the field, including 6 of 11 from 3-point range. “It’s kind of tough, back-to-back games like the playoffs. That’s why we’ve got to be ready for the playoffs if we make it.” Paul George had 28 points for the Clippers, including a pair of 3-pointers in the final minute of the third quarter that cut a 12-point deficit in half going to the fourth. Doncic, who scored 22 points in the first half, took over in the fourth quarter, assisting on a 3 for Jalen Brunson’s first points of the game and hitting a fadeaway jumper and a 3 to get the lead back to 12 at 87-75. Leonard scored 20 points while Marcus Morris Sr. had 11 in his second consecutive start but was just 1 of 9 from 3-point range while the Clippers shot 28% (9 of 32) from long range. “For the most part I thought we did a good job defensively other than Luka torched us,” coach Tyronn Lue said. “I thought offensively we didn’t trust, we didn’t continue to share the basketball. We forced a lot of stuff all night.” Richardson, added in an offseason trade that cost the Mavericks their best 3-pointer shooter in Seth Curry as they tried to improve defensively, affected the game in just the way Dallas envisioned. The fiery guard had two steals on inbound plays after Dallas baskets in the first half, one of them after his own 3-pointer. Richardson, who finished with three steals, also blocked Reggie Jackson's dunk attempt in transition before halftime. “That set the tone for the game,” coach Rick Carlisle said of the early steals. “That's just a signal to everyone in the arena that we're here. He was here. And we weren't going anywhere. That's a big moment.” With George hounding him as the Clippers tried to rally in the fourth quarter, Doncic found Maxi Kleber for a 3, then connected with him in an alley-oop dunk on his ninth and final assist to get the lead to 15. Kleber scored 12 points. “He got comfortable and he made shots,” Leonard said of Doncic, who had six rebounds. “It's hard to turn off that water once a great player like that gets rolling.” Kristaps Porzingis, Doncic's European sidekick, had a quiet night on offense with 11 points but had 13 rebounds as Dallas won the battle of the boards after losing it two nights earlier. “I'm not surprised at all at how we came out and stayed with it,” Carlisle said. “These guys have been in the playoffs. They have a very good idea what these types of games are like. The burning question is always where do you take it from here.” TIP-INS Clippers: C Serge Ibaka missed his second consecutive game with lower back tightness. ... Leonard missed both free throws in the third quarter after Carlisle unsuccessfully challenged a foul call. Tim Hardaway Jr. thought he thwarted a dunk attempt by knocking the ball loose without fouling, but replay showed him grazing Leonard's right hand. Mavericks: Dorian Finney-Smith was out because of the birth of his son earlier in the day. ... F James Johnson was missed a third consecutive game and will be out for both upcoming games in Portland. Johnson has to pass a series of COVID-19 tests before he can rejoin the team after going to Wyoming to attend to personal business. ... Hardaway scored 15 points.","401307410"
"Bradley Beal pump-fakes the shot, gets his defender to bite and then shoots behind him. (0:26) WASHINGTON -- — Bradley Beal scored 43 points, Russell Westbrook had 35 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists in his 13th triple-double of the season and the Washington Wizards beat the Utah Jazz 131-122 on Thursday night. Washington broke a five-game losing streak overall and a nine-game skid against Utah. Donovan Mitchell equaled a season high with 42 points for the Jazz, who at 29-11 still have the NBA’s best record but have lost four of six in March. “We’re playing against the best team in basketball,” Washington coach Scott Brooks said. “Our antennas were up. We’ve got to do that every night.” Utah's Joe Ingles added a career-high 34 points, including eight 3-pointers. It was Beal’s fifth 40-point game of the season. Westbrook’s 15 rebounds equaled a season high. “We guarded for 48 minutes,” Beal said. “We just did a good job of making them uncomfortable. We executed on the offensive end. We made sure everyone was involved, but it was definitely the defense that won us the game.” Washington scored 13 straight to take a 23-12 lead with 5:02 to play in the first quarter. The Wizards increased their lead to 64-40 just before halftime, and the Jazz got no closer than 112-105 with 6:20 to play. “The urgency that we have on defense needs to improve,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. Washington had 24 points off 17 Jazz turnovers. “I think teams are just playing more physical,” Mitchell said. “I think they just wanted it more.” The Wizards lost a two-point game to Sacramento on Wednesday night. “They played a tough game last night, but you couldn’t tell by the way the played,” Mitchell said. TIP-INS Jazz: G Mike Conley was rested ahead of Friday’s game at Toronto. Snyder likes to rest Conley in back-to-backs, and said because the team played Tuesday, it would give him two days of rest before and after the game against the Raptors. Ingles started in his place. … C Rudy Gobert missed the first seven free throws he attempted and was assessed a technical foul in the fourth quarter. He had 13 rebounds. … Mitchell scored 20 points in the third quarter. Wizards: Their previous win against Utah came on Feb. 18, 2016. … Even though they’ve won just 15 games, have recorded a win against each of the top six teams in the Western Conference. … F Davis Bertans played just four minutes due to tightness in his right calf. … Westbrook grabbed his 5,000th defensive rebound. BIG NIGHT IN A LOSS Ingles’ eight 3-pointers tied a team record, but he wasn’t thrilled by that. “We need to play like we want to win a championship,” Ingles said. “I don’t know the exact reason, but we need to come out aggressive on both ends.” SHOOTING FOR 4? Brooks said the proliferation of 3-point shots doesn’t make him eager to see a shooter rewarded for even longer field goals. “They’re shooting deeper than ever,” Brooks said. “Back in time, if you’d taken one of those shots with any of my former coaches, it would have been an ugly timeout.”","401307411"

He hit a pair of free throws late in the second to give the Hawks their first 20-point lead. Thunder starters Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Al Horford were a combined 3 for 18 in the first half. Young did not play in the fourth quarter as McMillan went with Rajon Rondo to give the team’s leading scorer some extra rest.

"Up just one, Reggie Bullock comes up with a big steal on Evan Fournier and the Knicks survive 94-93. (0:32) NEW YORK -- — Julius Randle recorded his third triple-double of the season with 18 points, 17 assists and 10 rebounds to lead the New York Knicks to a 94-93 victory over the Orlando Magic on Thursday night. Evan Fournier scored 23 points but Reggie Bullock stole his pass on Orlando's final possession as the Magic dropped their ninth straight. “It was definitely important for us to close this one out,” Bullock said. New York had lost consecutive games to Brooklyn and Philadelphia, the top teams in the Eastern Conference, and four out of its last six overall. “I'm going to give credit to (Bullock) because he got a deflection but really it's just me being naive,” Fournier said. “I made a rookie mistake. ...Instead of reading the play, I starting the play (thinking) ahead and I was anticipating (the Knicks double-teaming on a pick-and-roll). I'm sorry. It's really my fault.” Randle has nine triple-doubles in his seven-year NBA career and became the first Knicks player with three or more in a season since Micheal Ray Richardson had seven in 1981-82. Alec Burks scored 21 points for the Knicks, who improved to 21-21. Bullock added 20. RJ Barrett chipped in with 17 and Frank Ntilikina finished with 13. “The win,” Ntilikina said, “was the most important thing.” Nikola Vucevic and Aaron Gordon each had 17 for Orlando. The Knicks were short-handed as point guards Elfrid Payton (strained right hamstring), Derrick Rose (health and safety protocols), Austin Rivers (personal reasons) and rookie Immanuel Quickley (sore left ankle) were unavailable. Which meant all of the ingredients were inside Madison Square Garden for a taut, back-and-forth game. New York had a 69-54 lead after Randle’s layup with 3:03 left in the third quarter, and appeared poised to put away the game. However, Orlando went on a 21-5 run spanning the remainder of third and the first 2:06 of the fourth to take a 75-74 lead on Fournier's 3. The Knicks regained the lead at 80-75 after Bullock and Burks made 3s on consecutive possessions. The advantage lasted a little more than a minute as the Magic used an 10-0 run to go up by five. But Randle and the Knicks defense would put an end to New York’s slide. The All-Star forward either assisted on or scored eight of New York’s nine points in the final 5:38. “It's just how the game was going,” Randle said when asked if he felt he needed to play a facilitating role. “I was going to find my teammates.” The Knicks held Orlando to 42.7% shooting from the field and 29.4% from 3. “We just couldn't make shots,” Vucevic said. “We struggled offensively.” TIP-INS: Magic: Coach Steve Clifford praised the way his players have managed what has been a trying campaign. “Our guys are handling this well,” Clifford said. “I think right now we’d be on track to have the most (player) games missed to injury (by) any team since 2004. ... We come into practice (Wednesday) and (Michael Carter-Williams) can’t practice and (Terrence Ross) limps off; you can see it on guys’ faces because we have taken way more than our share of bad luck over the last few months. But they’ve hung in there. The effort has been good.” Knicks: Coach Tom Thibodeau did not publicly lobby for any additions to a roster that has earned trust before next week's trade deadline. “This is the time of the year every team is talking to every team,” Thibodeau said. “If (management) feels can help our team, I’m sure they’ll take a hard look at it. I love the guys that we have, so that’s all I focus in on. Whoever’s here, that’s what we’re working with. And if something’s good for us and they make a move, that’s great, too.”","401307413"
"Anthony Edwards gets past all five Suns on his way to a one-handed slam. (0:21) PHOENIX -- — Rookie Anthony Edwards scored a career-high 42 points, Karl-Anthony Towns added 41 and the Minnesota Timberwolves suddenly look like a respectable NBA basketball team. The Timberwolves used the dominant Edwards-KAT combo and a fourth-quarter comeback to stun the Phoenix Suns 123-119 on Thursday night. They've won three of five games since the All-Star break. “Our future success starts now,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. The Timberwolves still have the worst record in the NBA at 10-31 but have played much better over the past couple weeks. Edwards and Towns carried Minnesota in this one, pouring in points from all over the floor. After the game, Edwards gave away his jersey to his “blood brother” who was at the game and gave his shoes to some other fans. The 19-year-old was grinning from ear to ear as he walked off the court. “We’re winning,"" he said. ""It’s always happy when we’re winning.” Edwards, who was the No. 1 overall pick out of Georgia last summer, made 15 of 31 shots. Towns was even more efficient, making 15 of 24 shots, including 5 of 7 3-pointers. Juancho Hernangomez dunked with 2.5 seconds left to seal it. It was just the second time in Minnesota's franchise history that two players scored 40 points in the same game. “Unbelievably special,"" Finch said. ""They played pretty efficient. KAT almost has a triple double. They were carrying us.” Jevon Carter hit a 3-pointer just before the third quarter buzzer to give the Suns a 91-83 lead. But the T'wolves kept the game tight, and Towns tied it at 107 after a 3-pointer with less than five minutes remaining. Towns also added 10 rebounds and eight assists. These were the kinds of performances the T'Wolves envisioned when they selected Edwards, who has a sweet jumper and elite athleticism that led to a few highlight-reel dunks on Thursday. The 6-foot-4 guard is averaging 30.6 points over his last five games. Devin Booker led the Suns with 35 points on 13-of-22 shooting. Phoenix lost for just the fifth time in its last 23 games. Chris Paul and Mikal Bridges both added 17 points. “Our game plan discipline wasn’t at a high level on defense and we were sloppy on offense,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “When a team comes into your home and scores 123 points and two guys go for 83 points, that is a lack of being ready.” The Suns got off to a slow start, but back-to-back 3s from Dario Saric and Booker tied it at 25 by the end of the first quarter. Phoenix pulled ahead 58-53 by halftime. Booker had 21 points before the break on 7-of-10 shooting from the field. Edwards had 22 points in the first half for the Timberwolves, including a pair of powerful dunks after slicing through the Suns' defense. “We didn’t come out the way we should have,” Bridges said. ""We played down to our opponent, looking at their record. They played harder than us. They have talented guys and we just didn’t come out and execute our game plan. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Edwards and Towns combined to score 41 of the team's 53 points in the first half. ... Hernangomez had 14 points off the bench, and Naz Reid added 10. Suns: F Cam Johnson missed his fifth straight game in the league's health and safety protocol. ... F Torrey Craig was acquired from the Bucks in a trade announced Wednesday. Craig wasn't available for Thursday's game. ... Booker was honored before the game for winning the NBA's Western Conference Player of the Month in February. ... Deandre Ayton fouled out with 1:10 left in the game. He had 14 points and seven rebounds.","401307414"
"Carmelo Anthony gets the ball and passes to Damian Lillard, who drives in for a late dunk in the Trail Blazers' win over the Pelicans. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Damian Lillard scored 36 points, 21 in the opening quarter alone, and the Portland Trail Blazers won the second of back-to-back games against the New Orleans Pelicans, 101-93 on Thursday night. Carmelo Anthony added 15 points for the Blazers, who also edged the Pelicans 125-124 on Tuesday night. Enes Kanter finished with 16 points and 13 rebounds. Zion Williamson had 26 points and 10 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season for New Orleans. The Pelicans' 93 points were the fewest by a Portland opponent this season. “I just think that we came out sharper defensively,” Lillard said. “We knew what we were capable of, and we put a solid defensive effort together and we were able to sustain it. We've had a couple opportunities to beat a team twice this season, and we haven't been able to do it. I think we all understood that and had that in mind, and we defended. Start to finish.” Anthony's 3-pointer gave the Blazers an 86-72 lead early in the fourth quarter for their biggest advantage of the game to that point. Lonzo Ball's floater pulled the Pelicans within 88-83 with 4:13 left. Robert Covington answered with a 3-pointer for the Blazers. Williamson's dunk with 1:20 to go narrowed it again in to 94-89 but the Pelicans couldn't catch up in the end. ""When you're struggling that much offensively, your defense has to be damn near perfect,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “And it wasn't. We couldn't get the ball in the basket at all tonight."" On Tuesday, Portland trailed New Orleans by 17 points midway through the fourth quarter, but made up the deficit and won it on Lillard's free throws with 1.2 seconds to go. Lillard finished with a season-high 50 points and 10 assists, and was 18 for 18 from the line. On Thursday he picked up where he left off, with 15 of the Blazers' first 20 points. He had five of his six 3-pointers in the opening quarter as Portland built a 31-23 lead. CJ McCollum, who returned Tuesday from a fractured left foot, had back-to-back 3-pointers to put Portland up 42-33. The Blazers led 57-48 at the half. Williamson's dunk got the Pelicans within 59-53 early in the third but Lillard's floater pushed Portland's lead to 75-62. Blazers coach Terry Stotts agreed with Lillard, calling it the team's “best defensive game of the year.” Portland has won six of its last eight games and completed a sweep of the three-game season series. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson averaged 32 points in the first two games against Portland. ... J.J. Reddick missed his sixth game with a sore heel. ... Brandon Ingram finished with 19 points, and Ball had 15. Trail Blazers: Lillard has more than 16,000 points, joining Kevin Durant and LeBron James as the only players with as many points in their first nine NBA seasons. ...

"Kendrick Perkins explains why he's convinced LeBron James' legacy has surpassed Michael Jordan's, on and off the court. (2:53) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James had 37 points, eight rebounds and six assists, and the Los Angeles Lakers moved back into second place in the Western Conference on Thursday night with their fourth straight victory, 116-105 over the Charlotte Hornets. Dennis Schröder had 22 points and seven assists as the defending NBA champions moved past Phoenix and pulled 1 1/2 games behind the league-leading Utah Jazz with their sixth win in eight games. “We haven't really talked about it,” James said of the conference race. “If it gets to a point where we can capture it, why not? But we haven't talked about seeding all year. We’ve gotten better since the break, but the most important things for our ballclub is playing championship basketball every night and being healthy.” Indeed, Los Angeles is unbeaten since the All-Star break despite playing without All-NBA big man Anthony Davis since Valentine’s Day. “It was definitely needed,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said of the All-Star break. “It was clear our guys sort of hit a wall after the short offseason. That stretch before the break, it was clear our guys were a little bit fatigued. I think Bron set a great tone for us, saying, ‘It’s go time,’ after the All-Star break, and guys have responded with some really good play.” LaMelo Ball had 26 points and seven assists in the dynamic rookie's Southern California homecoming with the Hornets, who have opened their five-game West Coast trip by losing back-to-back games for the first time since Feb. 5. “Definitely felt good playing out here,” Ball said while wearing a Dodgers cap in his postgame interview. “It felt good, but not too good because we didn’t get the win. ... The whole team knows we can compete. We all know what we can do. It’s just about putting it together and playing hard.” Although James didn't quite record his third consecutive triple-double — which would have been the 100th of his career — he commanded the floor throughout the night and eventually sealed the win on a driving layup with 15 seconds to play. James also enjoyed his first showdown with Ball, who spent time around the Lakers when his older brother, Lonzo, was on the team. “I think he’s damn good to be his age,"" James said. “His speed, his quickness, his ability to make shots at all facets in the paint, floaters, 3s, and he’s going to only get better. Every game is a learning experience for him. Him and Zo are two just very unique players in our league, and they showcase that every night.” TIP-INS Hornets: Starting big man Cody Zeller didn't play in the second half, but wasn't injured. ... Ball’s parents haven’t seen him play live during his impressive rookie season, and fans aren’t yet allowed inside Staples Center. Lakers: Marc Gasol missed his sixth straight game, but was cleared to end his quarantine. He still hasn't cleared all of the NBA's health and safety protocols to return to uniform. Gasol hasn't played since February. ... Davis missed his 13th straight game with a right calf injury. ... Alex Caruso scored five points in his return from the NBA's concussion protocol. BALL AND GOING HOME Ball was impressive in his first meeting with the team his famous family loved while he grew up in suburban Chino Hills. Ball won a state title as a freshman and verbally committed to UCLA as a teenager before his father, LaVar, put him on the international odyssey that ended with LaMelo becoming the third overall pick in last year’s draft. “I thought LaMelo was excited to play tonight,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “You could feel his excitement early. He wanted to prove he belonged in this league. I liked his fight and his competitive spirit, especially in the second half.”","401307416"
"Payton Pritchard steals the ball on one end of the court and gets it to Grant Williams who drains the 3-pointer. (0:16) BOSTON -- — Richaun Holmes had 25 points, 11 rebounds, three blocked shots and two steals, and the Sacramento Kings held on to beat Boston 107-96 on Friday night and earn their first season sweep of the Celtics since 2007. De’Aaron Fox scored 29 points and Buddy Hield had 22 for Sacramento, which has won consecutive games for the first time since Feb. 6-7. It was Holmes' fifth double-double in his last six games, and 15th of the season. “Tonight is just an example for people to see in a win what he’s been doing for us all season long,” said Kings forward Harrison Barnes, who had 15 points and 13 rebounds. “A lot of that is overshadowed by how we’ve been playing as a team. But he's been a defensive anchor for us all season."" Jaylen Brown had 19 points and 11 rebounds for Boston, which lost for the fourth time in five games to again fall below .500. The Kings outscored Boston 25-15 in the fourth quarter. “You have to be so engaged to win an NBA game. When you’re not, you don’t. We’re not,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “It's got to be 17 guys dying to play well together, and I think the fun follows that."" The Celtics eliminated a 15-point, first-half deficit and went ahead briefly in the fourth quarter. Sacramento led 97-93 with two minutes left when Holmes blocked Jayson Tatum driving to the basket and started the fast break that ended when Hield pulled up for a 3-pointer to make it a three-possession game. Holmes had another block, as well as a steal, on Boston's next possession before Fox's jumper made it 102-93. “I’ve been so impressed with Richaun since we got him,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “He fought and earned a starting spot and he’s never given it back. ... When our team’s having success, he’s usually a pretty big part of that."" The Kings led by as many as 10 in the first quarter and 15 in the second, and still held a 67-54 edge with eight minutes left in the third before Boston scored nine straight points. Payton Pritchard hit a 3-pointer to tie it 76-all with two minutes left in the quarter, and after Hield hit a 3, Pritchard made another to tie it again. Boston finally retook the lead in the fourth when Grant Williams hit a 3-pointer to make it 87-86 with 7:33 to play. After again leading 91-90 with 4 1/2 minutes left, Boston gave up 10 of the next 12 points, in cluding a banked 3-pointer by Holmes at the shot clock buzzer. Walton said Holmes' performance was “inspiring.” “It’s screening, running, blocking shots, occasional bank-shot 3s from the top of the key,” he said. “To see him get rewarded for that is a lot of fun for a coach.” TIP-INS Kings: The Kings won the previous matchup with Boston on Feb. 3 116-111. ... Forward Jabari Parker, who did not play, ran laps around the court after the game for about a half hour. Celtics: According to the Celtics broadcast, they entered the night with a 7-0 record in their traditional home white uniforms and 13-20 in their alternative combinations, including 5-7 in the green ones they wore Friday. ... Boston's 15 fourth-quarter points tied a season low for any Kings opponent. OPEN HOUSE There were about 50 Celtics staffers in the stands – the first time the team has played in front of any fans in Boston since March 8, 2020, before the pandemic shut down the NBA season. The state will allow large arenas and ballparks to admit 12% of capacity starting Monday, but Friday’s game was a test run. Instead of surrounding the court with some of the Celtics’ championship banners to provide a TV backdrop, they were returned to the rafters.

"Dejounte Murray drives and banks a difficult layup off the very top of the backboard and in to give the Spurs an 86-74 lead over the Cavaliers. (0:16) CLEVELAND -- — Keldon Johnson scored 23 points and grabbed a career-high 21 rebounds, and Dejounte Murray had 22 points as the San Antonio Spurs held on for a 116-110, wire-to-wire victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night. Johnson, a second-year pro, shot 9 of 19, was 5 of 7 from the foul line and had 11 offensive rebounds. Tim Duncan was the last Spurs player with a 20-point, 20-rebound game in 2013 and had their last 11-offensive board performance in 2010. “It’s definitely an honor to be in the company of one of the greats, but I have to keep going, keep pushing, can’t be satisfied,” said Johnson, who is listed at 6-foot-6. “You’ve just got to fight, man. You’ve got to want it every play, got to go get it. I just try to be myself — Keldon Johnson — out there.” Johnson’s previous NBA best was 14 rebounds against Dallas on Jan. 22 and he had 17 total boards in his last five games. The Kentucky product said the 21 rebounds were his most at any level of basketball. “Keldon was just a moose,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “He never stops. He’s got aggressiveness 100% of the time he’s on the court.” DeMar DeRozan had 20 points and seven assists in his return to the Spurs after missing four games for the funeral of his father Frank. San Antonio, which led by 22 in the third quarter, won its third straight to move a season-high six games over .500. Darius Garland had a career-high 29 points and eight assists for the Cavaliers, who have lost five of their last six. Collin Sexton also scored 29 points and Jarrett Allen had 15 points and 11 rebounds. Cleveland pulled within 114-110 on a 3-pointer by two-way player Brodric Thomas with 9 seconds left, but Murray made two free throws to lock up the victory. “We have to change our intensity and come out with more pressure early in games,” Garland said. Back-to-back 3-pointers by Patty Mills extended San Antonio’s advantage to 75-53 late in the third. DeRozan had eight points during the 21-11 spurt to open the second half. Johnson had 15 points and 11 rebounds in the first half, helping San Antonio take a 54-42 lead. Garland scored 16 points for the Cavaliers, who trailed by 15 in the second. “Credit to the Spurs and the way they played for 48 minutes,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “We got off to another slow start and we can’t have that.” TIME TO GRIEVE Popovich fully supported DeRozan spending the past week to grieve with his family following the death of his dad. Frank DeRozan passed away in Los Angeles on Feb. 19. “Circumstances are always different, but he did what was necessary for his family and I applaud him for that,” Popovich said. “Your family loves you. Basketball doesn’t.” White wasn’t surprised that DeRozan didn’t miss a beat in his return, saying, “He’s a hooper.

"Chuma Okeke throws a sweet dime over his head to Aaron Gordon, who goes up for a two-handed reverse dunk for the Magic on the break. (0:23) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — The Orlando Magic shook off a tough loss on the road by coming home with their best shooting performance of the season to end a nine-game losing streak. Aaron Gordon scored a season-best 38 points, Evan Fournier added 31 and the Magic held off a furious fourth-quarter rally to beat the Brooklyn Nets 121-113 on Friday night. The Magic lost 94-93 a night earlier to the Knicks in New York. With a chance to win in the closing seconds, Fournier botched a pick-and-roll and angrily ripped his jersey apart. On Friday, Fournier and the Magic did little wrong while shooting 51.2% and making a season-best 21 3-pointers. “It was great because we showed a lot of character after a very tough loss,” said Fournier, who shot 10 of 13 and was 6 of 8 on 3s. “We fought really hard against probably the best team in the East and got the ‘W.’” The Magic overcame Kyrie Irving’s season-best 43 points to stop Brooklyn’s winning streak at six games. The Nets also had their franchise-record, eight-game road winning halted. “This is what if feels like to lose,” said Irving, whose Nets lost for the first time since Feb. 27 and for just the second time in 16 games. “We don’t want too many more feelings like this, so learn from it and move forward.” Orlando led 103-84 at the end of the third quarter, but the Nets opened the fourth with a 16-1 run. However, Brooklyn would get no closer than 104-100 after Gordon and Fournier revived the Magic offense. Gordon tipped in an airball to gave Orlando a 114-105 lead and his 3-pointer seconds later sealed the victory. “We made a bunch of shots and as (Brooklyn assistant coach) Mike D’Antoni used to say, `When you have energy you shoot the ball better,’” said Steve Clifford, whose Magic won for the first time since Feb. 21. Two nights after rallying from 16 points down in a win in Indiana, the Nets were trying to pull off their second-largest comeback in a victory. However, the Nets couldn’t overcome an off night by superstar guard James Harden and some sluggish play outside of Irving’s 19 of 31 shooting. Irving scored at least 40 points for a third time this season, but he had just seven in the fourth. Harden snapped a streak of 14 straight games with at least 20 points when he finished with 19. He made only 4 of 16 shots and 2 of 9 3s. Gordon was 14 of 20 and 7 of 8 on 3s to easily surpass his previous season high of 24 points. Nikola Vucevic added 22 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists. “That was a great all-around game for our team and we showed what we can be offensively and defensively,” Gordon said. “It shows good resilience.” Up two at the half, the Magic extended their lead to 103-84 by making 14 of 21 shots and 6-of-9 3s in the third period. Gordon made all five of his third-quarter shots and had 33 points by the start of the fourth. TIP-INS Nets: Oddly, Brooklyn has been dominant in mid-week games (21-3), but it is just mediocre in games played on Friday, Saturday and Sunday (7-11). … Harden picked up three fouls in his first 11 minutes on the court. Magic: Terrence Ross, one of the NBA’s most potent scoring reserves, missed his fifth game because of a sore right knee. Orlando won for the first time when Ross doesn’t play. … Chasson Randle finished with 13 points and four 3s. GRIFFIN GETTING CLOSER While teammate Jeff Green implied that he could see Blake Griffin making his Nets’ debut in the coming days, coach Steve Nash wouldn’t commit to a timetable for the forward who signed with the franchise on March 8. Nash was highly complimentary of the work that Griffin has done to sharpen his game after being out of action since Feb. 12 when he was a member of the Detroit Pistons. “He looks good, he’s improving and he’s working hard off the floor, as well,” Nash said.","401307420"
"After Pascal Siakam's game-tying attempt rattles out, Raptors coach Nick Nurse throws his face mask toward the referees in frustration. (0:18) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Donovan Mitchell got to the foul line more than the Toronto Raptors did Friday night, and it was the difference for the Utah Jazz. Mitchell scored eight of his 31 points in the final minute and a half, going 4 for 5 the line as Utah held on for a 115-112 victory. “It's not so much getting there, it's finding ways to get there,” said Mitchell, who shot 15 for 16 in the game. The Raptors made 11 of 14 free throws. “For me, knowing how to get those fouls is what's important,” Mitchell said. “We got into the bonus fairly early so that made it easier. It just feels like it's part of my game, being aggressive. That's what's going to take this team to another level.” Pascal Siakam's 3-point shot at the final horn spun around and out for the Raptors, who have lost seven straight. Joe Ingles came off the bench with 19 points for Utah, which avoided losing on consecutive nights for the first time since Jan. 5-6. Rudy Gobert had 15 points and 16 rebounds. Siakam led Toronto with 27 points and nine assists. With the return of forward OG Anunoby from a six-game absence due to health and safety protocols, the Raptors played for the first time in months with their whole team. Anunoby finished with 15 points and five rebounds before fouling out with 5.7 seconds left. “It was the first game with everybody back, but we've got to get back to playing with each other again,” said Toronto guard Kyle Lowry. “We still gave up 36 points in the fourth quarter. That's just way too many points.” Ingles and Jordan Clarkson hit 3-pointers and Gobert converted a three-point play in a 12-0 run in the fourth quarter that lifted Utah to a 94-84 lead, the only double-digit lead of the game for either team. Norman Powell and Anunoby answered with 3-pointers and Toronto led 110-105 after a 3-pointer by Lowry with 1:36 left. TIP-INS Jazz: The Jazz had a 48-31 rebound advantage. ...

We’ve had a lot of issues all year,"" Nurse said.

"Dennis Smith Jr. dribbles toward the bucket and then lobs it up to Josh Jackson for a dunk. (0:18) HOUSTON -- — Frank Jackson had a season-high 23 points and the Detroit Pistons handed the Houston Rockets their franchise-record 19th straight loss, 113-100 on Friday night. Winless since Feb. 4, Houston struggled to find answers for Detroit’s ball movement and Jackson’s shooting. Jackson was 5 of 5 from 3-point range and 7 of 10 overall. “It’s been nice to get out on the court and get a rhythm,” said Jackson, who got his first start of the season Monday. “I’ve got some great teammates who are unselfish, and we move the ball really well. It was fun being out there.” Jerami Grant added 18 points, Josh Jackson had 15, and Isaiah Stewart 13. Detroit made 14 of 29 3s in winning consecutive games for the first time since mid-February. “It says a lot about our group of guys —- we’re workers and we’ve got a lot of really good, young talented men who can step in on any given night,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “There’s not a lot of difference in those games, but they’re all committed to improving every day.” The injury-plagued Rockets were playing just their fourth game of the season where Christian Wood, Victor Oladipo and John Wall were all available. Wall had 21 points and seven assists, Oladipo had 19 points, and Wood 18 points and 11 rebounds. Having Wall and Wood on the court at the same time gave Houston glimpses of what the duo could be capable of if they can both stay healthy. In the first half, Wall connected with Wood on several lobs and also made a smooth over-the-head pass behind himself in transition to Wood, who finished with a dunk. “That was very important,” Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “We’ve got to get some continuity amongst the group, we’ve got to get some chemistry, and it’s super important for all these guys to play and play minutes together.” Wood was facing his former team for the first time. Wood averaged 13.1 points and 6.3 rebounds in 62 games and 12 starts with Detroit last season before signing with Houston in the offseason. Wood nearly matched those averages in the first half on Friday night with 13 points and six rebounds at the break. GO D.J. Point guard D.J. Augustin and forward D.J. Wilson, acquired by Houston from Milwaukee in a trade involving P.J. Tucker, made their Rockets debuts. Augustin scored seven points in 20 minutes, while Wilson missed two shots in seven minutes. “It’s great to be here -- I’ve lived here for a long time and it feels like home,” Augustin said. “I was a little overwhelmed when I first heard the news because we just had a newborn two weeks ago, but when I heard it was Houston, all that went out the window, and I was very excited.” HE SAID IT “It was a battle of two new teams. My vision of growth was the fact that we carried over some of the fundamentals from shootaround to the game. That’s something we want to focus on for the rest of the season, focusing on utilizing every minute and continuing to grow.” — Pistons coach Dwane Casey TIP-INS Pistons: Dennis Smith Jr. returned from a three-game absence in the league’s COVID-19 health and safety protocols.

(0:18) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Andrew Wiggins scored a season-high 40 points, Jordan Poole added 25 while starting in place of injured Stephen Curry, and the short-handed Golden State Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 116-103 on Friday night in the first of back-to-back meetings between the teams. Damion Lee had 21 points, also a season best, as the Warriors won their third in the last four games despite missing several key players. Draymond Green was 0 for 6 from the field and scored only two points but grabbed 11 rebounds and handed out 13 assists. “It was fantastic, just the effort,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “Really understanding what it was going to take to win this game in terms of not turning the ball over, fighting on the glass. I think we established in the first half that we weren’t going to give them anything easy. “A lot of great individual performances, and a great team performance,” he added. Ja Morant and Grayson Allen had 14 points each to lead Memphis, and Brandon Clarke scored 13. Jonas Valanciunas added 10 points and 16 rebounds. “Golden State was way more competitive. Played harder than us,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. “They set the tone early in the game. We didn’t have the fight tonight; we’ve got to have it (Saturday).” The Warriors were without Curry, who bruised his tailbone in Wednesday’s victory over Houston. Meanwhile, rookie center James Wiseman and Eric Paschall both were unavailable under the NBA’s health and safety protocol. That was three of the team’s top five scorers on the sideline. But the Golden State guards filled the scoring void starting in the first half – Wiggins had 27 points and Poole added 17. That took the lead to as many as 21 before the Warriors held a 67-48 advantage at halftime. Wiggins knew he needed to step up to help the offense minus Curry, the Warriors' leading scorer. And if Wiggins’ offense wasn’t enough, he added a season-high four steals on the defensive end. Kerr called Wiggins' performance “amazing.” “Steph’s a big part of this team. He’s what makes this team go. With him being out, it was like everybody had to step up. I just tried to be aggressive from the start,” Wiggins said, adding: “I just tried to fill in as much as I could, do what I can to help the team go.” Memphis’ offense was lackluster through the first half, shooting 42% and committing 10 turnovers. That kept the Grizzlies’ fast-pace offense in low gear, managing only two fast-break points before halftime. They finished with 11 for the game. The ballhandling problems continued after the break, with Memphis committing seven more turnovers as Golden State maintained its 19-point advantage. Memphis never really threatened in the second half. “It’s nice to be able to turn around and flush it and play them the next night,” Allen said. “Get another chance to come out and play better.” TIP-INS Warriors: Poole entered averaging 19 points over the past five games, while shooting 54% overall and 46% from 3-point range. … On Feb. 10, 2017, against the Grizzlies, Green posted the only triple-double without reaching 10 points in NBA history. In that game, Green had four points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 steals. … Kerr said Wiseman and Paschall flew back to the Bay Area on Friday morning. Grizzlies: Valanciunas had his 25th double-double of the season. … Dillon Brooks was 2 for 10 from the field and is 7 for 30 in the last four games. … The back-to-back with Golden State is the second of an NBA-high 11 back-to-backs for the Grizzlies in the second half of the season. MORE ON CURRY Kerr said Curry was “still pretty sore. Frustrated. He wants to be going.” Kerr said Curry is day-to-day, but added he expects the star guard to be doubtful for Saturday’s game between the teams.","401307423"
"Jamal Murray scores seven points in overtime as the Nuggets pull away from the Bulls. (0:33) DENVER -- — Jamal Murray scored 34 points, including a tying 3-pointer in the final second of regulation and a crucial jumper in the final seconds of overtime, lifting the Denver Nuggets past the Chicago Bulls 131-127 on Friday night. Nikola Jokic had 34 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists in helping the Nuggets to their eighth win in nine games. Michael Porter Jr. added 19 points for the Nuggets, who extended their home winning streak against the Bulls to 13. Zach LaVine had 32 points to lead the Bulls. Otto Porter Jr. added 22 points. “That’s the most fun part of the game,” Murray said of delivering in the clutch. “When the adrenaline is rushing and everybody is running around, that’s when we’re at our best. And I’ve always been that way. I’ve always been that kind of closer. ""But it wasn’t just me. We kind of picked our spots. Still found Joker, still found Mike and we had some amazing defense.” Trailing by eight heading into the fourth quarter, the Nuggets fell behind 103-89 after Coby White hit a 3-pointer with 8:05 remaining. But Denver strung together an 8-0 run to narrow the deficit to 103-97. A dunk by Porter and 3 by Murray around a Chicago turnover put Denver up 108-107 with 2:41 left. Bulls coach Billy Donovan, who had seen his young team blow another fourth quarter lead in Wednesday’s loss to San Antonio, called a timeout and in an animated huddle urged his frustrated players to stay in the fight. “I was really, really upset in that timeout because I felt in that moment we were letting go of the rope,” Donovan said. “And that really bothered me. I thought when (Porter) came back in, he made a couple shots and we made a couple stops and we kind of got brought back to life, so to speak. But then we didn’t make enough plays down the stretch. We don’t have the margin of error to do that.” Chicago fought back to reclaim the lead, getting a 3-pointer by Porter and a basket by LaVine for a four-point edge with 1:14 to play. Chicago added another basket before Jokic hit a 3-pointer. After a steal by Facundo Campazzo off LaVine, Murray drove in for a layup to pull the Nuggets to within 114-113 with 18.3 seconds left. The Nuggets fouled LaVine, who made both free throws with 16 seconds left but Murray connected from the corner on a 3 with .04 seconds left in regulation, sending the game into overtime with the score tied at 116. With the Nuggets clinging to a 2-point lead, Murray connected on a jumper with 10.3 seconds left in the extra period to secure the win. The Bulls got off to a solid start and led 55-47 at the half. Chicago took an 89-81 lead into the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Bulls: G Garrett Temple remains sidelined by a sprained left ankle that he sustained a week ago against Miami, though he has been steadily increasing physical activity. “He’s been able to do different things on the court,” Donovan said. “He actually, today at shootaround, was doing some shooting, which was good to see. I think he’s definitely progressing.” Nuggets: The team’s backcourt remains depleted. Rookie G RJ Hampton has been out the last three weeks due to health and safety protocols. G Gary Harris remains sidelined by a left abductor strain, while G Monte Morris has missed time due to a quad injury.","401307424"
"Suns coach Monty Williams is ejected in the second quarter after having words with the ref for his frustration with the lack of foul calls. (0:32) PHOENIX -- — Chris Paul scored 20 points, Devin Booker added 16 and the Phoenix Suns bounced back from a loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves the night before by beating them 113-101 on Friday. Mikal Bridges scored 17 points and Langston Galloway added 14 off the bench for the Suns, who improved to 27-13 and have won 16 of their last 20 games. “Obviously, we wanted some type of revenge tonight,” Booker said. “We had a salty feeling in our mouths after the loss last night."" Karl-Anthony Towns led the Timberwolves with 24 points. Ricky Rubio had 21 points and 10 assists for Minnesota, which fell to 10-32. Minnesota stunned Phoenix on Thursday night with a 123-119 comeback win. Towns and rookie Anthony Edwards combined to score 83 points in that one, but the Suns were ready for them this time. “The NBA is played a little like a chess game,” Rubio said. “You make a move and then they make a counter move.” The Timberwolves looked as though they might pull off another upset for a while on Friday. In the midst of a 10-0 Minnesota run during the second quarter that gave the Timberwolves a 45-43 lead, Suns coach Monty Williams was ejected after receiving two quick technicals for arguing with the officials. Williams said he was upset when Booker got “smacked in the face” and Bridges got “drilled” going to the basket and there was no foul call on either play. “That is not a tactic I use but tonight was one of those nights I felt like I had to stand up for our guys,” Williams said. “I wasn’t trying to make a point or anything like that. I was a bit upset about that many no-calls.” The ejection seemed to ignite the Suns, who went on a 17-2 spurt that gave Phoenix a 60-47 advantage late in the first half. The Suns led 64-54 at the break. The Timberwolves rallied in the second half, scoring the first 15 points to push ahead 69-64 with 7:39 left in the third quarter. The Suns regained their composure and took an 83-78 lead into the fourth. Minnesota didn't get any closer after the Suns opened the fourth period with an 11-3 surge to put the game away. Bridges had five points in that spurt. “Chris was amazing and the bench came in and gave us a big boost in the third and the beginning of the fourth,” Williams said. Edwards had 11 points one night after scoring a career-high 42. The No. 1 overall draft pick finished 4 of 18 from the field and committed seven turnovers. “I’ve got to be more consistent with my mid-range shot, my 3-ball, because everyone knows I want to get to the rim,” Edwards said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Malik Beasley (NBA suspension), Jordan McLaughlin (health and safety protocols) and D’Angelo Russell (left knee surgery) did not play. ... Minnesota fell to 44-73 against the Suns. Suns: Williams was ejected for the first time in two seasons with the Suns. In fact, he was whistled for his first two technical fouls over the same span. ... F Cam Johnson missed his sixth straight game because of the league’s health and safety protocol.","401307425"
"CJ McCollum uses a step-back move to knock down a back-breaking 3-pointer as the Trail Blazers extend their lead to 118-112 late in the fourth quarter. (0:27) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — CJ McCollum scored 32 points, Damian Lillard had 31 and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Dallas Mavericks 125-119 on Friday night. The All-Stars for each team, Lillard and Luka Doncic (38 points, nine rebounds, eight assists) both had big nights. But Lillard had much more help from his co-star, as Kristaps Porzingis finished with just 11 points and didn’t make a field goal until the early third quarter. “That was my ninth time playing basketball since January 16th,” McCollum said after his best game since returning from a broken foot. “It’s hard to find a rhythm in a season like this. I was on a minutes restriction, I was rushing, I wasn’t playing with pace. I kind of settled in today. I got 23 shots up in 28 minutes.” The teams meet again Sunday, when Dallas will look for more from Porzingis, its second-leading scorer. “He got off to a slow start and we have just got to involve him a little bit more,” coach Rick Carlisle said. With 4:25 left in the second quarter, Porzingis was called for a technical foul after arguing a call with the officials. Seconds later, Doncic was also assessed a technical foul. Lillard made both technical free throws and the Blazers led 64-60 at halftime. “We made him have to work and have to make plays and I think that frustrated him,” Robert Covington said of Portland’s job against Porzingis. “He doesn’t like people to get up under him. For us, (Derrick Jones Jr.) and I did a great job of getting under him.” Portland coach Terry Stotts earned his 500th career victory. “After my first two years in Atlanta, I didn’t think I’d get to 100 wins,” Stotts said. Lillard collided with two Mavericks players with 2:37 left in the third quarter, staying on the ground and grabbing his left knee for a few minutes but staying in the game. The Mavericks led by as many as eight in the fourth quarter before Rodney Hood’s 3-pointer cut the Mavericks’ lead to 110-109 with 4:26 left. A dunk by Carmelo Anthony with 4:04 left wrestled the lead back for the Blazers. Lillard’s jumper with 3:23 remaining pushed Portland’s lead to 113-110 and he followed with a layup for a five-point lead. Doncic’s floater ended Portland’s 9-0 run to make it 115-112 with 2:36 left, but McCollum isolated against Porzingis to hit a 3-pointer to put Portland ahead 118-112 with 1:17 to play. TIP-INS Blazers: After back-to-back wins, including a 50-point game earlier this week, there’s growing buzz about Lillard as an MVP candidate. When the subject of comparing Lillard to past greats came up, Carlisle offered that Portland’s star is a first of his kind. “He’s a pioneer,” Carlisle said. “A lot of people will compare him to Steph Curry, I see him as being different. Lillard has really perfected the long 3-point shot off the dribble. It wasn’t that long ago where a pull up 3-point shot coming up the court was considered a cardinal sin in this league. He’s one of the guys who caused every team to work on this in skill development.” Mavericks: The Mavs were without a player who has been key for them over the past few weeks as Willie Cauley-Stein missed the game due to the league’s health and safety protocols. Carlisle told reporters that Cauley-Stein had a possible exposure to the coronavirus and is currently in quarantine for an “unspecified” period of time. Who are the free agents for the next two years? We have the lists. Center Andre Drummond is now a free agent and can sign with a contending team after reaching a buyout with the Cavaliers.","401307426"
"LeBron James appears to roll his ankle and initially tries to stay in the game, but eventually exits for the locker room. (1:02) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James left in the second quarter with a high right ankle sprain that the Lakers said will sideline him indefinitely, and Los Angeles went on to fall 99-94 to the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday. Two hours after the game, the Lakers announced that James is out indefinitely. The defending NBA champions already are without All-NBA big man Anthony Davis, who has missed 14 consecutive games with a right calf injury and likely won't play again until April. “Nothing angers and saddens me more than not being available to and for my teammates!” James tweeted later Saturday. “I’m hurt inside and out right now. The road back from recovery begins now. Back soon like I never left.” James was hurt when he rolled his ankle under Solomon Hill, who was called for a foul as he reached awkwardly for a steal. The 36-year-old superstar screamed and fell to the court clutching at his ankle, yet he got up and briefly stayed in the game. “I haven’t necessarily seen him scream and squall like that, probably ever, not even with that groin,” said Kyle Kuzma, who was with the Lakers when James missed 17 games with a groin injury two seasons ago. “It had to hurt a little bit, for sure.” After the injury, James hit a corner 3-pointer that extended his NBA-record streak of games with at least 10 points to 1,036, but he called a timeout and left the court shortly afterward. James knocked over a chair in frustration as he went to the locker room. “The mood of the team is we’re disappointed we lost, and we’ve got to come back and get one tomorrow,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I won’t disclose what LeBron was like (in the locker room). It’s in-house.” John Collins had 27 points and a season-high 16 rebounds, and Trae Young added 14 points and 11 assists for the Hawks. They opened an eight-game trip with their eighth straight victory under new coach Nate McMillan — but only after their defending champion opponents lost their 17-time All-Star to an injury that could shake the NBA’s balance of power if it turns out to be serious. With James out, the remaining Lakers rallied and actually took a one-point lead to halftime, but missed their first 11 shots of the second half. Danilo Gallinari scored 14 of his 18 points after halftime for the Hawks, who are on their longest winning streak since January 2015. “That was the first thing I told the guys: We can’t relax because LeBron is out of the game,"" McMillan said. “We have to keep up the pressure, and I thought our guys did that.” James’ absence left the Lakers without three starters in the second half, and the Hawks capitalized for their first road victory over Los Angeles since March 2016. Along with Davis, Marc Gasol missed his seventh straight game since February after sitting out under the NBA’s health and safety protocols. “It’s different without (James), without AD,” Gallinari said. “Of course they’re a different team. But at the same time, all of the players that stepped up are all NBA veterans with experience, guys that won championships. I would say it’s anyway a very good win.” Montrezl Harrell had 23 points and 11 rebounds, while Dennis Schröder had 16 points and seven assists against his former team for the Lakers, whose four-game winning streak ended amid much bigger concerns. Harrell suggested Hill's actions during James' injury were “not a basketball play,” and said the officials should have considered giving him more than a personal foul. TIP-INS Hawks: “It’s definitely a different type of game when Bron is out,” Young said. “Everything they do goes through him and AD.” ... Clint Capela had 16 rebounds. Lakers: Gasol has cleared the NBA's health and safety protocols, but coach Frank Vogel said the Spaniard wasn't ready to play because he hasn't practiced since February. RONDO RETURNS The Lakers played a tribute video to former guard Rajon Rondo, who had five assists in 14 minutes during his first trip to Staples Center since the Lakers’ championship run in the Florida bubble. Rondo, who already got his championship ring through the mail earlier this season, watched the video appreciatively. Rondo also stoked more nostalgia from Lakers fans when he got a technical foul in the third quarter for a weird bit of gamesmanship, inexplicably shoving the basketball into Schröder's face after a whistle. ""I love competitors who really try to compete against me on the court, but that’s not competing,"" Schröder said. ""I’m going to leave it at that.""","401307427"
"Matisse Thybulle comes from behind to block De'Aaron Fox and then makes a behind-the-back pass to keep the ball with the 76ers. (0:19) PHILADELPHIA -- — Tobias Harris knows the Philadelphia 76ers are an elite NBA team with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid in the lineup. Harris wanted to show they’re pretty good without the pair of All-Stars, as well. Harris scored 23 of his 29 points in the first half and fell just short of a triple-double to lead the short-handed 76ers over the Sacramento Kings 129-105 on Saturday night. “He really set the tone tonight with his attitude and then obviously his play,” Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said. “His total play was phenomenal.” The Eastern Conference-leading 76ers (29-13) played without starters Embiid, Simmons and Seth Curry. Harris said winning without their stars is a mentality. “Are we willing to fall into the distraction of, ‘Hey, we don’t have two of our top dogs?’ Or are we willing to embrace it?” Harris said. “I take that stuff personal when people believe we can’t win without those guys because I know how much talent we have as a group. And I know how well we play together as a team as a whole. We have a culture and a system here that works. When we trust it and do what is asked of us, we’re a hell of a team.” Shake Milton had 28 points and Danny Green scored 18 for Philadelphia. Harris added 11 rebounds and eight assists. In addition to regular starters Green and Harris, the Sixers went with Tony Bradley, Matisse Thybulle and Milton to open the game. “With all those guys out, what we did was execute well,” Rivers said. Philadelphia jumped out fast, using 16-of-26 shooting — including an impressive 6 for 8 from 3-point range — in the first quarter to take a 42-21 lead. Sacramento never got close after that. The offense kept coming for the Sixers in the second, and they were up 73-52 at halftime. Philadelphia took its biggest lead on Dwight Howard’s tip-in with 6.1 seconds left in the third period that made it 106-80. The 76ers finished shooting 56% (48 of 86) from the field, including 48% (11 of 23) from 3-point range. “It’s obviously good to play that type of basketball and get a victory,” Harris said. “Just a testament to guys making shots, us playing in a flow and getting into a rhythm.” Buddy Hield scored 25 points and De’Aaron Fox added 16 for Sacramento, which dropped to 2/3 on a six-game road trip that concludes Monday at Cleveland. The Kings (17-25) entered 2½ games behind Memphis for the No. 10 seed and a berth in the NBA’s Play-In Tournament. “Very disappointing game,” coach Luke Walton said. “We didn’t start with the appropriate energy that is required to compete.” Walton, however, wasn't going to spend too much time or energy overanalyzing the defeat. “I'll chalk this up to just not having it. For whatever reasons, we didn’t have it tonight,” he said. “We were not sharp. It’s not an excuse. But we’re going to move past this, get some rest tonight and be better in Cleveland.” MISSING PIECES Embiid has missed four straight games with a bruised left knee and is expected to be re-evaluated late this week. Simmons experienced knee soreness at the morning shootaround and was a surprise late scratch. Curry injured his left ankle in Wednesday’s 109-105 loss to Milwaukee. Curry isn’t expected to play in Sunday’s game at the Knicks, and Rivers wasn’t able to provide an update on Simmons' status after the game. GO GO GADGET Thybulle, a defensive stalwart, had a stellar recovery block with 40 seconds left in the first half. “He’s like Inspector Gadget with those long arms, and his recovery time is unbelievable,” Rivers said. “He keeps making plays like that every night, and it’s absolutely wonderful to watch.” TIP-INS Kings: Former 76ers C Richaun Holmes finished with 10 points and four rebounds. He had double-doubles in five of his previous six games and has 15 for the season. … Sacramento fell to 8-13 on the road. 76ers: Philadelphia improved to 19-4 at home. … Howard had 10 points and 13 rebounds while continuing to energize the home crowd.","401307428"
"Ja Morant drains a 3-point shot from the top of the arc for the Grizzlies. (0:21) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Jonas Valanciunas and Dillon Brooks scored 19 points each, Valanciunas added 15 rebounds and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Golden State Warriors 111-103 on Saturday night, splitting the two-game set between the teams. Brandon Clarke added 16 points, and Ja Morant had 14 points and eight assists, including six points in Memphis’ closing 10-3 run. Jordan Poole led the Warriors with 26 points, connecting on 10 of 21 shots. Andrew Wiggins, who had 40 in Golden State’s 116-103 victory Friday night, added with 20. “I think the basic learning opportunity is how you’ve got to handle your business,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said about winning the second night. “Coming out every single night and you have to do it together.” The Grizzlies talked about the importance of bouncing back after the Friday loss to the Warriors and making sure they were more focused for the second game of the series. Morant said he took a more vocal role as compared to Friday’s lackluster effort. “I apologized (to Jenkins) for not being a leader for (Friday) night’s game,” Morant said. “I told him I take full responsibility for that, and (Saturday), I picked up my talk. Playing hard, encouraging guys, just telling us to stay the course.” The Warriors, already short-handed without guard Stephen Curry and frontline players James Wiseman and Eric Pascall, were dealt another setback with the absence of Kevon Looney. Looney, who played well against Valanciunas on Friday, was the latest to fall under the league’s health and safety protocol. Looney’s absence left second-year 6-foot-10 forward Alen Smailagic to start and guard Valanciunas. While Smailagic, who was playing his third game this season, struggled with the Grizzlies center, collecting five fouls in 8 minutes on the court, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said the game got away in the first half. “I was disappointed we let them off the hook,"" Kerr said. “We had every opportunity in the second quarter to take control of that game. We just made too many mistakes.” The Warriors led 100-99 with 2:43 left on Poole’s 3-pointer, but Memphis answered with eight straight points, Morant scoring on an 8-footer to start the rally and connecting a couple of free throws to seal the win with 20.7 seconds remaining. Whether from stout defense or fatigue from the second night of the back-to-back, neither team shot well in the first half, both connecting on less than 38%. The Grizzlies added eight turnovers to their problems as the Warriors led 51-49 at the break. The shooting woes would continue for both teams throughout the game, Memphis shooting 39% for the night, while Golden State managed only 34%. TIP-INS Warriors: Smailagic scored his first points on a 3-pointer 19 seconds into the game. It was his only basket of the night. … Poole started his second game of the season in Curry’s spot. Grizzlies: Memphis had been held under 104 points in four of the previous five games. …F Justise Winslow, who returned from injury on Feb. 20, was available for the first time on the second game of a back-to-back. … F Kyle Anderson had a four-point play in the first quarter – the first of his NBA career. … Morant passed Shane Battier for 13th on franchise assists list. Battier had 717. … Tied a season high with 60 rebounds. A MISSED OPPORTUNITY With Looney out under the league health and safety protocol, the question became what can the Warriors do to address the situation. Kerr noted that Memphis is located just across the state line from Mississippi, where the state has opened vaccinations for anyone 16 and older. “Believe me, the thought of getting on a bus, taking our team 15 miles away from Memphis to get vaccinated crossed my mind,” he said. NO FIRM RETURN FOR CURRY Curry made the trip to Memphis, but was not active for either game. Coach Steve Kerr said because Curry has not done anything basketball-wise since the Wednesday night injury in Houston, the return includes everything from rest to game tolerance to strength and conditioning. “Our training staff is all over it,” Kerr said. “When he’s ready, he’ll be back.”","401307429"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo gets to the hoop for two to put the Bucks up 98-92 on the Spurs. (0:17) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 26 points and a season-high 15 assists, and the two-time league MVP received plenty of help as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the San Antonio Spurs 120-113 on Saturday night. The Bucks (27-14) won their season-best sixth straight game with seven players scoring in double figures. Khris Middleton scored 23 points and Jrue Holiday added 21. Antetokounmpo grabbed eight rebounds, barely missing a triple double. Lonnie Walker scored a career-high 31 points for the Spurs (22-17), and DeMar DeRozan added 22. Walker sank 13 of 21 shots, including 5 of 9 from 3-point range. The Spurs trailed 98-94 after a jumper by Walker following a San Antonio timeout. Middleton responded with a 3-pointer and Pat Connaughton scored a layup off an assist by Antetokounmpo, forcing a quick Spurs timeout. Two more 3-pointers by Middleton in the final 5 1/2 minutes helped the Bucks pull away, and Antetokounmpo added a powerful dunk and a 3-pointer. Donte DiVincenzo had 12 points and a team-high 13 rebounds for Milwaukee, which won for the 11th time in 12 games. Brook Lopez and Connaughton each had 11 points and former Spurs guard Bryn Forbes added 10. The Bucks rallied from a 14-point, first-half deficit and even used some zone defense to try to slow down the Spurs. “To start off the game, I thought they hit every floater, every mid-range shot that they took,” Middleton said. “After a while we started switching a little bit more, trying to be up a little more to take that shot away and also to take away the drive. “Giannis and Jrue did a great job of getting into the guards and making it tough on them.” The Spurs ended a five-game trip with a 3-2 record and coach Gregg Popovich was not discouraged by the loss. “This is the fifth game in seven nights,” Popovich said. “A couple of important guys didn’t play, but it doesn’t matter. They all come to compete. “We had 29 assists tonight against a hell of a team. We’re thrilled with the way we played. We just have to keep the consistency.” Holiday was fouled by Devin Vassell on a 3-point attempt with five-tenths of a second left in the third quarter, and Holiday made all three free throws to give the Bucks an 88-84 lead. Thee Bucks guard also sank a 3-pointer in the final second of the first half to extend Milwaukee’s lead to seven points at that time. “It was definitely a boost to be able to go into the end of the quarter on a good note and see the ball go in the basket,” Holiday said. “I think it was huge.” The Spurs’ strong start was keyed by DeRozan, who had eight points in the opening quarter as San Antonio took a 33-26 advantage. TIP-INS Spurs: Dejounte Murray and Patty Mills were held out of the lineup for rest as San Antonio played the second game of a back-to-back set and the finale of its road trip. “It takes its toll,” Popovich said. “We just decided with this increased density in the schedule since the all-star break that we needed to help them stay in good shape. And we’ve been in constant contact with the league; they’ve been great about understanding the situation.” … Popovich is one victory away from reaching 1,300 in his career. The only other NBA coaches to reach that level were Don Nelson (1,335) and Lenny Wilkens. (1,332). Bucks: P.J. Tucker made his Milwaukee debut after being acquired in a trade with Houston on Wednesday. The 35-year-old forward had not played since March 3 while waiting for the rebuilding Rockets to make a deal. “You can see the intensity,” Middleton said. “He’s going to be a great fit for us.” Tucker entered the game with 4:32 left in the first quarter and played 13 minutes. He had three rebounds and did not score. … Rodions Kurucs, also obtained in the Houston trade, was inactive (health and safety protocols).","401307430"

Miles Bridges scored a season-high 21 points and Gordon Hayward added 17 for the Hornets, who took their worst defeat of the season for the second time in three games. George scored 12 points while staking the Clippers to a 17-point lead in the first quarter. Los Angeles kept a healthy margin for the rest of the night, allowing Leonard to rest in the fourth quarter. “We’re a scary team when we play hard,” said Terance Mann, who scored a season-high 16 points in a reserve role. LaMelo Ball scored 13 points for Charlotte in the rookie sensation's second straight game in his native Los Angeles area. Ball played extensively in the second half despite clearly struggling with discomfort in his right wrist, which appeared to be injured in an early fall. Hornets coach James Borrego had no postgame update on Ball. “Give the Clippers a ton of credit,” Borrego said. “They’re a heck of a team. ... This season has been a grind. We’ve got a young group that’s played a lot of minutes, and they continue to show up every night, keep battling and keep playing.” The Hornets are winless on their five-game road trip after losing three straight for the first time since Jan. 22. Charlotte, which lost by 25 in Denver to start its trip, hasn't beaten the Clippers at Staples Center in 11 tries since February 2009. “It’s not been our finest basketball these last three games,” Hayward said. “We can be a lot better, that’s for sure. We’ve got to try to pick ourselves up here, stay together, stay positive. It’s a season of ups and downs, and we’ve been through it already, so there’s no reason to hang our heads. We’ve played three really good teams, and it doesn’t get any easier.” TIP-INS Hornets: Terry Rozier hit the 300th 3-pointer of his brief career in Charlotte, becoming the fastest player in Hornets history to reach the mark by doing it in just 102 games. He missed the final 15 minutes with a bruise on his left hip. ... Bridges was drafted by the Clippers in 2018 and quickly traded to Charlotte. ... P.J. Washington sprained his right ankle in the first half, but played extensively in the second half. Clippers: Patrick Beverley missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness, and Serge Ibaka sat out his third straight with lower back tightness. ... LA was perfect at the free throw line for the third time this season and the 26th time in franchise history. ... Luke Kennard, the Clippers' $64 million guard, didn't play until garbage time after sitting out the last two games. NIC'S REVENGE Nicolas Batum had 11 points and five rebounds off the bench for the Clippers in his first game against the Hornets since he was waived last November to make room for Hayward's arrival. The French big man spent five years in Charlotte, scoring a career-high 15.1 points per game in 2016-17. “He did a great job setting the tone early with his defense when he checked into the game,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “The guys were happy for him playing against his old team, and to get a win like that is pretty impressive.”","401307431"

"Lu Dort shows off his defensive prowess as he blocks the John Wall layup attempt to secure the win. (0:34) HOUSTON -- — Mired in a long losing streak, the Houston Rockets twice put the ball in John Wall's hands in the waning moments. No luck, once again. The Rockets lost their team-record 20th straight game, falling to the Oklahoma City Thunder 114-112 Sunday when Wall missed two shots in the final 10 seconds. “We have no choice but to pick up and try hard and learn and grow, and it starts with me,” Houston coach Stephen Silas said. The Rockets’ skid is tied for the ninth-worst in NBA history and the longest since Philadelphia’s record-setting 28-game losing streak across the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. Houston took a 110-109 lead with less than three minutes remaining. After the Rockets went ahead, Lu Dort blocked Wall’s layup from behind to protect a 113-112 edge. “That was a heck of a play, obviously, and a great second effort,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “He was out of the play a little bit and made a great comeback. I thought he was great, offensively, as well. I thought he really attacked.” Wall then missed a deep 3-pointer at the buzzer. “It worked out that way -- it was supposed to end up in a pick-and-roll,” Silas said. “It didn’t. This one hurts.” Dort scored 23 points and Isaiah Roby had 18 for the Thunder, who led by as many as 13 points. Svi Mykhailiuk and Justin Jackson each had 15 points off the bench. “I’ve been trying to work on making good decisions at the end of games, and I thought I did good in the end today,” Dort said. “We just had to step up and make some big plays at the end. We wanted to win, and that’s what we did.” Christian Wood had 27 points, eight rebounds and two blocks for Houston, Wall had 24 points and seven assists, and Victor Oladipo had 23 points. Oklahoma City led 31-22 at the end of a rough first quarter where the teams combined to make just 3 of 17 from 3-point range. They shot a sizzling 14 of 21 on 3s in the second quarter, however, and Oklahoma City led 66-62 at halftime. Wall, Wood and Oladipo combined for 40 first-half points. It was just the fifth time all season all three players have played in the same game. The Rockets hit a franchise-record 28 3s in a win against the Thunder on Feb. 1, just three days before their last win. On Sunday, the Rockets were just 14 of 38 on 3s. Oklahoma City outrebounded Houston 52-38, led by Moses Brown’s 14 boards. Brown added 13 points. Sunday’s game was originally supposed to be the season opener on Dec. 23, but it was postponed for COVID-19 protocols. HE SAID IT “That was a heroic play. It was so clutch. I told Lu after the game, ‘You’re a monster, Lu.’” -- Brown on Dort’s block TIP-INS Thunder: SG Shai Gilgeous-Alexander missed the game with right shoulder soreness. C Al Horford (rest), PF Darius Bazley (left shoulder contusion), PG George Hill (right thumb procedure) and SF Josh Hall (left knee soreness) were also unavailable. Rockets: PG D.J. Augustin was out with a stomach illness. . PG Kevin Porter Jr., who was originally ruled out with right quad soreness, was upgraded to be available shortly before tipoff. He had four points in 20 minutes off the bench. . PF D.J. Wilson -- acquired with Augustin in last week’s trade with Milwaukee involving P.J. Tucker -- had his first points as a Rocket, scoring eight in 10 minutes. FINAL POSSESSION With 4.9 seconds remaining, Houston inbounded the ball near their basket, with Jae’Sean Tate passing to Wall. Guarded by Dort, Wall took one dribble and attempted a deep 3-pointer from 29 feet that clanked wide left off of the side of the rim and backboard. Roby secured the rebound and the win for the Thunder. Wall was 1-for-7 from 3 in the game. BENCH SCORING Houston’s bench was outscored 39-12 in the game. In their previous loss to Detroit on Friday, Houston’s bench was outscored 40-20. Wilson led bench scoring for Houston with just 8 points. Wilson and Kevin Porter Jr. were the only reserves to score in the game.","401307433"
"Zion Williamson comes down the lane and finishes with a strong jam against the Nuggets. (0:17) DENVER -- — Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson each scored 30 points and the New Orleans Pelicans overcame another triple-double by Nikola Jokic to beat the Denver Nuggets 113-108 on Sunday. Nickeil Alexander-Walker added 20 points for the Pelicans, who won the finale of a road trip after dropping their first two games in Portland. “We executed and they missed some shots. Not a lot,” Williamson said. “We hit some free throws and we got stops when we needed to get them.” Jokic had 29 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for his 52nd career triple-double, including 11 this season. Jamal Murray added 23 points. Ingram said he and Williamson have been building a good rapport offensively. “We’re figuring out how to stretch the defense a little bit,"" Ingram said. ""Of course, when we go in, the defense is loading up, so I think today we actually got a chance to play a two-man game a little bit more and it worked out for us.” Trailing 83-80 going into the fourth quarter, the Nuggets put together a 9-0 run to move in front 95-92 on Jokic’s 3-pointer from the top of the key with 5:18 remaining. The game stayed tight in the closing minutes. Ingram completed two three-point plays around a jumper by Jokic to give the Pelicans a 107-104 lead with 57 seconds to play. Lane violations by Jokic and Murray allowed Ingram to complete his first three-point play after two misses from the line. Paul Millsap made one of two free throws for Denver, but Ingram sank two more free throws to build a four-point edge for the Pelicans with 29 seconds left. Jokic then missed a long jumper, snagged the rebound and got the ball to Murray, who also couldn’t connect. The Pelicans added four free throws down the stretch. Nuggets coach Michael Malone noted the disparity in free throws (30 for the Pelicans and 10 for the Nuggets, including none for Jokic) but declared emphatically it wasn’t the reason they lost. “We lost this game in the second quarter, (outscored) 36-21,” Malone said. “We lost this game because they flat-out kicked our (butt) on the glass (45-37). We knew going in they were the No. 1 offensive rebounding team in the league and if we weren’t going to be able to match that physicality it would make for a long night and that’s exactly what happened."" The Pelicans led 58-51 at halftime, closing the final 1:17 of the second quarter with six straight points, capped by Eric Bledsoe’s driving layup. TIP-INS Pelicans: G Lonzo Ball missed the game because of right hip flexor strain. G JJ Redick remains sidelined by a right heel injury that has kept him out for the past seven games. Nuggets: G Gary Harris (left abductor strain) and G Monte Morris (left quadriceps strain) remain sidelined. No timeline has been established yet for their return. … F Greg Whittington was inactive because of left knee soreness.","401307434"
"Jaylen Brown goes into his bag to create space from Nikola Vucevic before draining a shot from beyond the arc. (0:17) BOSTON -- — Jaylen Brown scored 34 points, including a career-high 10 3-pointers, and Jayson Tatum added 23 on Sunday to help the Boston Celtics beat the Orlando Magic 112-96 and snap a three-game losing streak. The Celtics made 23 3-pointers in the game, one short of the franchise record. Brown was 10 for 18 from the distance and one short of Marcus Smart's team record of 11 for one player. “I lost count at some point,” Brown said. “I wish somebody would have told me that. I would have fired up five, six more to make sure I beat Marcus.” Nikola Vucevic had 22 points and 13 rebounds for Orlando, which beat Brooklyn on Friday night to snap a nine-game losing streak. The Magic cut a 23-point, third-quarter deficit to 91-83 early in the fourth before Boston scored 12 of the next 16 points — including a pair of 3-pointers by Brown. “This team has been in a funk in some ways with that stuff, but that’s not who they are,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “We’ve seen what they do when their backs are against the wall. We know that they compete. There's never been a question of that.” The Magic led by as many as five points in the first quarter and held a 40-37 lead with seven minutes left in the second before Brown made a pair of 3-pointers to spark an 11-2 run. It was 50-46 Celtics in the final minute of the half before Tatum hit back-to-back 3s that gave Boston its first double-digit lead. Leading 56-49 early in the third, the Celtics scored 10 straight points to start a 19-5 run that made it a 21-point lead. Boston made 20 of its first 40 3-point attempts before missing five in a row. It shot 23 of 54 from 3-point range in all. “They shot the ball very, very well,"" Vucevic said. “But a lot of it was also because we didn’t make it hard enough.” TIP-INS Magic: Orlando scored only 17 points in the second quarter. ... James Ennis scored a season-high 18 points in 21 minutes off the bench in his first game in almost a month (strained left calf). ... The Magic shot 38.1% from the field. Celtics: Kemba Walker was tripped up and stayed on the floor for a bit, favoring his left knee, before heading to the bench. He checked back in later in the fourth. ... Smart, who had been on a minutes restriction since missing 18 games with a left calf strain, played 33 minutes for the second straight game. He had 11 points and eight assists. ... Tatum scored 19 in the first half, including 5 of 7 from 3-point range. STREAK SNAPPED The Celtics, who made it to the conference finals last year, had been among the top teams in the East early on. But they had lost four of their last five and have gone 12-17 since mid-January. “It takes teams time. Sometimes it comes quick. Sometimes it comes at different stages in the season, and some teams never get it,” Stevens said. “The goal is to find your best version. ... We have to do it with all five on every possession at both ends of the floor.” GETTING READY It was the Celtics’ last home game before the state opens large arenas to fans. In preparation for Thursday night’s Boston Bruins game, the TD Garden has added signage and other markers to guide fans in social distancing. Although there were no paid fans on Sunday, the public address announcer gave guidance on mask-wearing, exit procedure and staying in designated “neighborhoods.” The Celtics are next at home on March 29 to play the New Orleans Pelicans.","401307435"
"Kyrie Irving wraps a pass around a defender to Nicolas Claxton for an and-1 to extend the Nets' lead late. (0:23) NEW YORK -- — Another former All-Star made his debut in Brooklyn, where a pair of current All-Stars helped carry the Nets to another victory. Kyrie Irving scored 28 points and James Harden had 26 to lead the Nets to a 113-106 victory over the Washington Wizards on Sunday. Blake Griffin dunked for the first time since December 2019 in his Nets debut and Nicolas Claxton added 16 points, including two three-point plays down the stretch. Russell Westbrook had 29 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists for Washington. “We’re not allowed to take anyone lightly. We don’t have the luxury of that,” Harden said. “We have the mindset of one game at a time, one possession at a time, good things will happen for us.” After trailing by as many as 14 in the first half and 12 in the second, Washington pulled to 103-102 on Westbrook’s driving layup with 3 minutes remaining. But, Claxton produced two dunks while being fouled off feeds from Irving over the final stretch as Brooklyn never relinquished the lead. “It felt good when Kyrie passed me the ball. I guess I've got to get used to that. I’m used to him shooting,” Claxton said. “Finishing is easy. My name was called tonight and I was ready to go.” DeAndre Jordan scored 12 points and Joe Harris added 10 for the Nets, who have won 15 of their last 17 games. Rui Hachimura had 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards. Alex Len also had 20 points and Bradley Beal finished with 17. “We had a chance to win but they made big plays down the stretch,” Scott Brooks said. “That’s the way it goes.” Griffin played in his first game for the Nets since his buyout from the Pistons, checking in with 4:37 left in the first quarter. Brooklyn trailed by as many as 14 points in the opening quarter and was behind 30-25 after the first quarter. Harden opened the second quarter by scoring the first nine points and the Nets never trailed again. The Nets led 63-56 at halftime. The Wizards pulled within four on Len’s dunk with just over 8 minutes left in the third quarter, but a 9-1 run punctuated by Harden’s short jumper put the Nets up 82-70. Griffin scored his only points of the game on a driving dunk to open the final quarter as the Nets extended their advantage to 99-88. “I knew once it happened it was going to be a thing so I tried not to look down at the bench,” Griffin said. “But then I kind of peeked and saw everyone standing up, so it was hard not to smile in that situation. It felt good to just get that out of the way.” In 15 minutes, Griffin also added two rebounds and a block. “It was great to be back out there,” Griffin added. “I felt like it was a good start, but I’ve got some room to improve obviously.” TIP-INS: Wizards: Despite the loss, Washington took the season series 2-1, defeating the Nets 123-122 on Jan. 3 and 149-146 on Jan. 31. The Wizards also won last year’s series 2-1, the first time they have come out on top in consecutive seasons since 2015-16 and 2016-17. Nets: Since losing to Detroit on Feb. 9, the Nets have the best record in the NBA (15-2). … Griffin had not played since Feb. 12, when he totaled 12 points, four rebounds and six assists in his final game with the Pistons in a 108-102 loss at Boston. LAST MEN STANDING Harris is the only member of the Nets to have played in each of the team’s 43 games this season. He has also started the most (39). Robin Lopez, who scored 10 points, is the only Washington player to see action in each of his team’s 41 games, only nine as a starter. STARTING OVER A total of 16 Wizards have started at least one game this season. Cassius Winston and Troy Brown Jr. were the only active players on Sunday’s roster who have not started a game for the team. The Nets have used 14 different starters this season, with no combination starting more than four consecutive games together. Brooklyn has used a league-high 21 starting lineups.","401307436"
"Collin Sexton scores six of his 36 points on these two 3-pointers as the Cavaliers beat the Raptors 116-105. (0:31) CLEVELAND -- — Collin Sexton scored 23 of his 36 points in the second half, Jarrett Allen had 17 points and 15 rebounds and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat Toronto 116-105 on Sunday night, handing the Raptors their eighth straight loss. Dean Wade scored 16 points and Darius Garland had 15 points and six assists for Cleveland, which had dropped five of its previous six. Sexton’s 3-pointer gave the Cavaliers their largest lead at 97-75 early in the fourth. As time expired in the first half, Sexton and Toronto’s Norman Powell were involved in a dust-up and received technical fouls. The third-year pro said it placed a chip on his shoulder for the rest of the game. “They were jawing at me earlier, so I said some stuff back to them because I don’t back down,” Sexton said. “Coach (J.B. Bickerstaff) said you woke them up, now what are you going to do? “We knew they were going to be physical and punk us a little bit, so we just had to be ready to shoot and don’t pass up anything good.” Fred VanVleet had 23 points and seven assists for Toronto, while Kyle Lowry and Powell each scored 18 points. The Raptors have lost eight in a row for the first time since Jan. 10-22, 2012 and are a season-worst eight games below .500. VanVleet nailed a 3-pointer with 54 seconds left to pull Toronto within 110-105, but Larry Nance Jr. answered with a dunk and Wade and Sexton made two free throws apiece to complete the win. Toronto has fallen to 11th in the Eastern Conference, one spot out of the play-in tournament, and faces a decision on impending free agent Lowry before the NBA trade deadline Thursday. “I know that’s my (35th) birthday, so whatever else is happening on that day, I’m not worried about it,” Lowry said. “We’re trying to get everybody back together and into the groove and on the same page, so it’s tough. We just need that one win to get going.” The Cavaliers scored the first 12 points in the third, capped by Sexton’s 3-pointer to seize control 71-57. They finished 17 of 33 beyond the arc and dominated the rebounding battle 54-37, allowing them to overcome 27 turnovers that cost them 26 points. Sexton shot 13 of 24 and tied his career best with six 3-pointers, raising his scoring average to 24.2. Cleveland has moved within three games of a play-in spot, but may deal disgruntled center Andre Drummond before the deadline. “I know Sexton is hard to play off the dribble, but you’ve got to come out to him,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “Yeah, he may be 5 feet behind the line, but he made those shots.” Cleveland carried a 59-57 lead into the break as Sexton scored 13 points and Wade had 11. There were 10 lead changes and seven ties in the first half, but none after intermission. “You saw a different fire in Collin’s eyes after what happened at the end of the first half,” Allen said, laughing. “He wanted to go after Norman Powell. He wanted to go after all those guys.” TIP-INS Raptors: VanVleet has made at least one 3-pointer in a franchise-record 69 consecutive games. … F Chris Boucher is the only Toronto player to appear in all 42 contests. … The Raptors play 14 of their next 20 at their temporary home of Tampa. “This season has been about as hard as it could have been, to be honest,” Nurse said. “But I believe these things even out, so things should be looking awesome soon.” Cavaliers: C JaVale McGee (illness) returned after missing one game. … G Matthew Dellavedova (appendectomy) has participated in back-to-back practices, but was inactive. He suffered a concussion in December and has yet to make his season debut. … G Quinn Cook is expected to sign a second 10-day contract. … F Kevin Love (right calf soreness) and F Taurean Prince (left shoulder sprain) remain out. SAFETY FIRST Nurse was fined $50,000 for throwing his facemask behind the scorer’s table Thursday after Toronto’s 115-112 loss to Utah in Tampa, Florida. He expressed regret, explaining that he was struggling to communicate. “Coaching is difficult to do while wearing a mask, but I’ve got to do a better job,” Nurse said. “That’s on me to adjust to it. I just hope the money goes to a good cause.”","401307437"
"Daniel Gafford cuts to the hoop and gets up high to flush a big one-handed jam. (0:21) DETROIT -- — Laurie Markkanen had 16 points and eight rebounds and the Chicago Bulls used a strong defensive performance for a 100-86 win over the Detroit Pistons on Sunday night. Zach LaVine scored 18 points for the Bulls, who had lost two straight. “These guys are always working to get better,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “We've had some tough losses lately — the kind of losses that can linger — and I've been around teams where that's been a problem. This group is good at avoiding that.” Daniel Galford added eight points and 11 rebounds for Chicago. Detroit shot 16% (4 for 25) from 3-point range. “I'm grateful for every chance I get,” said Gafford, who entered the game after Wendell Carter, Jr. was poked in the eye. “I was in the starting lineup and I took it for granted. I thought I could just keep doing it, and now I've learned I have to keep earning it.” Jerami Grant scored 26 points for the Pistons, who had won two straight. Rookie Saddiq Bey, who averaged 24.0 points in Detroit's wins over the Toronto Raptors and Houston Rockets. didn't score until hitting a meaningless 3-pointer at the buzzer. “I thought Saddiq had some good looks, but there are nights you need to see a shot go in to give you that kick start,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “In the last couple games, we did a great job of kicking the ball out to the perimeter and we hit everything we took. Tonight, we weren't as good as getting it out and nothing was going in.” The Bulls trailed for most of the first half, but used a late run to take a 46-45 lead. Chicago shot 60% on 3-pointers while holding the Pistons to 20%. Chicago expanded the lead to 11 points in the first five minutes of the third quarter and continued to shut down Detroit's outside shooting. The Pistons went 1 for 8 in the quarter, falling to 16.7% for the game. “I think the difference in the game was the stretch going into the half and the third quarter,” Casey said. “I thought we got a little of a glazed look in our eyes at the end of the half, and then we didn't respond when we got back out there.” The Bulls led 75-65 going into the fourth quarter and expanded their lead to 19 points on Denzel Valentine's 3-pointer with 6:51 to play. That kept Donovan from pushing his starters too hard on the front end of a back-to-back. “I was very happy with what we got from the bench guys tonight,” Donovan said. “They got us back into the game in the second quarter. so I went back to them in the third quarter and they played just as well.” TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago has won six straight games against the Pistons, including a 4-0 season sweep in 2019-20. The streak has let the Bulls move into a 135-133 lead in the all-time series, which peaked 30 years ago with Michael Jordan's teams against the Bad Boys. Pistons: Grant, who had a career-high 43 in Chicago in a 105-102 loss on Feb. 17, scored 14 points in the first quarter on Sunday, and finished with 26. QUICK START Before the game, Donovan told forward Patrick Williams to watch for a chance to pick off Mason Plumlee's pass on the opening tip. Williams did just that, stealing the ball and scoring on a dunk at the seven-second mark. Williams finished with 10 points and seven rebounds. “He jumped the tip, just like we had discussed, and I think that really got him going,” Donovan said. “We did some different things with him offensively and he had a nice game.”","401307438"
"Julius Randle is called for a foul that sends Tobias Harris to the free throw line. After Harris puts the 76ers ahead, Randle misses on the Knicks' final possession to seal a win for Philadelphia. (1:47) NEW YORK -- — Tobias Harris made two free throws with 5.3 seconds left in overtime and the Philadelphia 76ers ran their winning streak against the New York Knicks to 15 games with a 101-100 victory Sunday night. Philadelphia improved to 30-13 with its eighth win in its last 10 games. “A win is a win. We'll take it,” Harris said. “I was like, ‘We got to put this one (away),’” Harris said. “‘Put this one down and get the win.’” Julius Randle scored 24 points but his last shot rimmed out just before the buzzer as New York dropped to 21-22. “Everyone wants to win,” RJ Barrett said. “Everyone wants to win so when you lose a game, especially like this, a game that we had, a game we should have won, (it’s tough).” The final meeting of the three-game season series and second in five days between the Atlantic Division rivals was a defensive struggle the whole way. Danny Green hit a couple 3-pointers to give Philadelphia a 96-93 lead in overtime, but Alec Burks and Barrett had baskets before Reggie Bullock’s 3 as the shot clock expired gave the Knicks a 100-96 lead. Harris made a 3 and Randle was called for his fourth foul as Harris attempted to grab Shake Milton’s misfire. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau appeared to be trying to challenge the call, but there was no review and Harris made both free throws to put Philadelphia up one. Crew chief Courtney Kirkland said Thibodeau did not signal his request for a challenge quickly enough after calling a timeout. “After all the fouling and everything that was going on, for (the referees) to call that and decide the game is ... ridiculous,” Randle said. “They have to do a better job. It’s too many games like this.” Green connected on a floater in the lane to push the advantage to 88-85 late in regulation. On the ensuing possession, Randle missed a layup and Harris grabbed the rebound. But he missed both free throws and Dwight Howard could not corral the loose ball, giving the Knicks one last chance. “The first two free throws I got in the fourth quarter I really couldn't feel my hand going to the line and shooting them because of the foul,"" Harris said. “And I missed two in a row so that was a tough one.” The Knicks took advantage as Randle knocked down a right corner 3 with Harris draped all over him to tie the game at 88. After a timeout, Randle stole Ben Simmons' pass and raced up court, but his 3-pointer missed badly. TIP-INS: 76ers: Philadelphia entered the game with the best record in the Eastern Conference and the second-best record in the NBA, so coach Doc Rivers does not think there is much the front office can do to improve the 76ers before Thursday's trade deadline. In fact, Rivers believes the best move the Sixers could make is getting star center Joel Embiid back from a bone bruise in his left knee, suffered in a 127-100 win over the Washington Wizards on March 12. “If we make a move, great. If we don’t, we love our team,” Rivers said before the game. “There’s no move we can make more important than getting Joel back out there.” Knicks: The short-handed Knicks received help in the returns of Immanuel Quickley and center Mitchell Robinson, both of whom played against Philadelphia. Robinson had missed 15 games with a broken hand and Quickley sat out New York’s 94-93 win over Orlando Thursday night with a sore left ankle. The Knicks did not have starting point guard Elfrid Payton, who missed his fifth straight game with a strained right hamstring, and reserve guards Austin Rivers (personal) and Derrick Rose (health and safety protocols). Thibodeau said Robinson, normally New York’s starting center, would “probably come off the bench initially and then we’ll see where that goes. Eventually he’ll be back starting.”","401307439"
"Chris Paul earns the 10,000th assist of his NBA career on a lob pass to DeAndre Ayton for a slam. (0:32) PHOENIX -- — The LeBron-less Los Angeles Lakers are off to a predictably slow start. Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton both had 26 points, Chris Paul had a triple-double with 11 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds and the Phoenix Suns beat the Lakers 111-94 on Sunday night. Los Angeles played without 17-time All-Star LeBron James for just the second time this season and fell to 0-2 in his absence. James suffered a high ankle sprain in a 99-94 loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday and is expected to miss significant time. Even after the loss, Lakers coach Frank Vogel was optimistic after his team's performance. Los Angeles is also playing without All-Star forward Anthony Davis, who has missed a big chunk of the season with a right calf strain. ""I think our guys really fought tonight,” Vogel said. “We didn’t shoot the ball that well, but I thought we competed at a very high level. It is going to take a little time as we adjust, figure out where the shots are coming from and what our new identity is going to look like.” Los Angeles struggled on offense without James, shooting 41% from the field. Montrezl Harrell led the Lakers with 23 points off the bench on 10-of-13 shooting. Dennis Schroder added 22 points. “Second- and fourth-quarter defense — holding them to 18 points in each. That won us the game,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. Phoenix entered the fourth quarter with an 88-76 advantage. The Lakers pulled within 96-89 with 6:33 left after Schroder made a free throw following a technical foul on Paul, but the Suns responded with the next seven points and pulled away for their 17th win in 21 games. “We stayed the course,” Paul said. “That’s a talented team over there.” The Suns pushed out to a 59-44 lead by halftime. Booker had 14 points before the break, while Ayton had 12. The Lakers shot just 37% from the field in the first half. PAUL GETS TO 10,000 Paul became the sixth player in NBA history with 10,000 assists when he threw an alley-oop pass to Deandre Ayton for a dunk in the third quarter. “It’s a blessing, first and foremost, just to play this long,” Paul said. ""That’s something I don’t take for granted. There’s a lot of guys I came in with who are coaching and can’t play. The only players in league history with more assists are John Stockton, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Mark Jackson and Magic Johnson. With about 30 games left this season, it's possible Paul could pass Nash, Jackson and Johnson for third on the career list. “I’m just grateful to be around Chris and enjoy moments like this,” Williams said, who praised Paul's hard work throughout his career. “You don’t get 10,000 assists just by showing up.” LEBRON'S ABSENCE Lakers coach Frank Vogel said he wasn't sure how much time James will miss with his ankle injury, but made it clear that a quick return was unlikely. “We’re prepared for him to be without us basically indefinitely,” Vogel said during pregame Sunday. Vogel said the Lakers would obviously miss having having the four-time Most Valuable Player on the floor, but the team's offense would have the same “general structure and framework."" The coach also hoped that the time off the court would allow James a mental break as well as a physical one. The Lakers won the NBA championship last season in a COVID-19 delayed season that ended on Oct. 11. That gave James and the rest of L.A.'s players less than two months to recover before training camp for the current season. James was at Sunday's game with a boot on his injured ankle. FACES IN THE CROWD Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce watched Sunday's game from a suite. TIP-INS Lakers: Without James, Los Angeles went with a starting lineup of Wesley Matthews, Kyle Kuzma, Markieff Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Schroder. Suns: F Cam Johnson was available for the first time since missing six straight games in the league's healthy and safety protocol. He made his first shot — a 3-pointer from the corner — after checking in late in the first quarter. He finished with eight points in 15 minutes.","401307440"
"Luka Doncic drains eight 3-pointers before missing on his ninth attempt, tying his career high for for 3s in a game. (1:34) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Luka Doncic scored 37 points in three quarters, leading the Dallas Mavericks to a 132-92 rout of the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday night. Doncic made his first eight 3-point shots and finished with 8-for-9 shooting from long distance. Overall, he shot 13 of 19 from the field and added seven rebounds and four assists. Josh Richardson scored 21 points, DorianFinney-Smith added 13 and Kristaps Porzingis 12 for the Mavericks. “We shifted our concentration onto our defensive game plan, our offensive gameplay and unconditionally helping each other out there and turning the attention away from the officials,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. “This is part of the growth process for a young team. Some things that this team simply has to go through. This was a source of growth tonight and we just want to keep working to improve every single day. “ Damian Lillard led Portland with 19 points, and Gary Trent Jr. added 16. CJ McCollum finished with 13. “Anytime me, CJ (McCollum) and (Carmelo Anthony) go 0 for 16 from 3, we’re not going to have much of a chance,” Lillard said. Dallas’ Boban Marjanovic, who sat our Friday’s game, took advantage of his opportunity to make an impact. After Portland had a 13-5 advantage on the offensive glass on Friday, Marjanovic’s presence helped tipped the scales in favor of the Mavericks in just five minutes of action. Marjanovic finished with two points and two rebounds but helped prevent Portland center Enes Kanter from dominating the boards. Dallas outrebounded the Blazers 52-33 overall. The Mavericks made 19 3-pointers. Portland was unable to keep pace as the Trail Blzers shot 20% from the 3-point arc and made only nine shots from long distance. A Doncic 3-pointer gave the Mavericks a 76-54 lead, forcing a Blazers timeout with 8:47 left in the third quarter. Dallas started the third quarter on a 19-0 run. A three-point play by McCollum stopped Portland’s third quarter drought, which lasted 5:37. “I don’t know how I characterize that,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “It was not our night in the 3rd quarter. 19-0 speaks for itself.” The Mavericks led 103-69 at the end of the third quarter. The Blazers took Lillard out of the game after the third quarter. Dallas led by as many as 45 at one point. TIP-INS Blazers: The Blazers had won three straight games coming into Sunday. But their defense, which ranks 29th in the league, is still a concern. According to Stotts, the Blazers have had one complete defensive performance in the last three wins. “You look at our last three games, we played an outstanding six minutes of defense against New Orleans. The next game against New Orleans we played four complete quarters. Dallas is a tough team to guard with Luka and the way they space the floor. But in the fourth quarter, it was a solid effort.” Mavericks: One of the factors in a tough night for Kristaps Porzingis in Friday’s game were two early offensive fouls. Porzingis was called for fouls while attempting jump shots, with his elbows catching Blazers players in the face. The Mavericks are trying to help coach him out of it, but they can only do so much. “He can swing them higher and miss the guy’s face is one correction that can be made,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. “What he’s doing is he’s stepping off to create space. It’s unlucky. It happened twice the way it did and I think he made both shots. It’s an adjustment that needs to be made. It’s a unique play. You don’t see many other 7-3 guys making a footwork play like that with that kind of skill. We will do our best to make sure it doesn’t happen again, but you can never say anything definitely for sure.”","401307441"
"De'Aaron Fox works his way through Quinn Cook and finishes with a bucket and a foul. (0:16) CLEVELAND -- — De’Aaron Fox scored 30 points, Tyrese Haliburton had a career-high 28 and the Sacramento Kings completed their longest road trip of the season with a 119-105 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. Buddy Hield added 19 points and Richaun Holmes had 17 points and 16 rebounds for the Kings, who went 3-3 on their 10-day trip. Harrison Barnes made a late run at a triple-double with nine points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. “That will make the flight back a little bit easier for the guys and for the coaching staff,” Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. “We knew we had a great opportunity tonight, so I’m pleased with the road trip, for sure.” JaVale McGee paced the Cavaliers with 18 points and nine rebounds, while Collin Sexton had 15 points and seven assists. Cleveland, playing its third home game in four days, trailed for the final 25 minutes and has lost six of eight. “Understandably, some nights you just don’t have it,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “The guys kept trying, but we were just hunting as a group and couldn’t put it together consistently.” The Kings seized control with a 23-9 run to open the third quarter, fueled by 11 points from Fox, to push their lead to 86-68. Haliburton followed with 14 points in the fourth when Sacramento went up by 19. Haliburton, the No. 12 pick, is averaging 15.0 points and 4.0 assists since moving into the starting lineup four games ago. He shot 11 of 15, including 4 of 5 on 3-pointers, and made both free throws in 36 minutes. “It felt nice to see the ball go in the hoop and that gave me confidence,” Haliburton said. “When the shots aren’t falling, I get really hard on myself, but I’ve got to learn to control what I can control. That’s how hard I play and the attitude I have.” Fox and Haliburton each had 14 points in the first half as the Kings held a 63-59 advantage. There were 15 lead changes and 10 ties with the clubs combining to make 51 of 97 shots. “De’Aaron has gotten a lot stronger and I think you see that in his game, and Tyrese was great,” Walton said. “There were stretches when De’Aaron took over and stretches where he did. It’s exciting to watch them grow together.” The Cavaliers may have a different look when they return to Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse on April 1. Center Andre Drummond and backup McGee could be dealt before the NBA trade deadline Thursday. “I thought JaVale gave us a nice lift off the bench with the group he was out there with,” Bickerstaff said. The Kings made their first trip to Cleveland since Dec. 7, 2018, and played the Cavaliers for the first time since April 4, 2019. TIP-INS Kings: F Marvin Bagley III (left hand fracture) missed his fourth straight game and will be sidelined until at least mid-April. “We need to keep the mentality of getting to the rim,” Walton said. “Losing Marvin and his skill-set definitely hurts that.” … C Chimezie Metu (right wrist fracture) and rookie G Jahmi’us Ramsey (right hamstring strain) were inactive. … Both Sacramento games against Cleveland in 2019-20 were canceled. Cavaliers: G Matthew Dellavedova (appendectomy) was downgraded from questionable to out after taking part in back-to-back practices, further delaying his season debut. … F Kevin Love (right calf soreness) and F Taurean Prince (left shoulder sprain) remain unavailable. … G Quinn Cook signed a second 10-day contract before the game. … Two-way G Brodric Thomas finished third in the G League Rookie of the Year voting. MEMORY LANE Walton wrapped up his playing career with the Cavaliers, appearing in 71 games from 2011-13. He also became engaged to his now-wife Bre during his stay. “I had a great time in Cleveland,” Walton said. “The city is great. The fans are great. And I got the chance to play with a young Kyrie (Irving) and a young Tristan (Thompson). We didn’t win a ton, but we had a good time.”","401307442"
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander muscles into the paint for a layup, then he drains a step-back 3-pointer. (0:22) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder relied on strong 3-point shooting Monday night to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-103. The Thunder set a season high with 21 3-pointers in just 37 attempts (56.8%). Eight of the nine players who entered the game for the Thunder hit at least one 3-pointer. Only center Moses Brown didn’t convert from beyond the arc, but he contributed 17 rebounds. Reserve guard Ty Jerome led the way by hitting all five of his 3-point attempts. Gilgeous-Alexander was 4 for 6 from deep, while Aleksej Pokuševski and Théo Maledon each hit three 3s. “Shooting can be a little bit volatile,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. ""Some nights you generate great looks and the shots don’t fall, and sometimes they do. But I think tonight, some of it was the result of really great ball movement. “It was just high, high-level team basketball that we displayed tonight, and the 3s were a byproduct of that.” Karl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 33 points and 10 rebounds. Anthony Edwards scored 16 points and Ricky Rubio added 11 points and 11 assists for the Wolves, who lost their second straight. “We were looking, but we couldn't find a spark,” said Edwards, who was held in check for the second straight game after scoring 42 points in a win at Phoenix on Thursday. The Thunder entered the game averaging 12.8 3-pointers a game, putting them in the middle of the pack among NBA teams. Their 34.6 shooting percentage on 3s, however, was worse than all but four teams. “Some nights the shots don’t fall and some nights they do, but we’re going to bring the energy and competitiveness every night,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said after the Thunder won their second road game in as many nights. Leading by seven points at the break, the Thunder staved off two big Timberwolves runs in the third quarter to maintain their cushion. First, Jake Layman scored on a reverse layup to cap a 10-0 run that gave Minnesota a 60-59 lead early in the period. The Thunder responded with a barrage of 3-pointers, one each from Pokuševski and Isaiah Roby and two from Gilgeous-Alexander that put them back on top 73-62. Timberwolves coach Chris Finch called a timeout to stem the tide, and Towns responded by converting a three-point play. That keyed a 12-2 spurt that pulled Minnesota back to within a point. But Pokuševski drained another 3 and Gilgeous-Alexander converted a driving layup and another 3-pointer of his own to keep Oklahoma City on top 83-76 after three. GET MOVING Many of the Thunder's 3-pointers were uncontested, a product of efficient and effective ball movement. Svi Mykhailiuk, playing in his third game with the Thunder after being acquired in a trade with Detroit, hit 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions in the fourth. The next time down the court, his teammates worked the ball back to Mykhailiuk for another open look. Instead, he made an extra pass to Kenrich Williams in the corner. Williams promptly drained a 3-pointer, the team's third in less than a minute, stretching their lead to 15 points. “I think that play really is a prime example of how we want to play,” Jerome said. “(Mykhailiuk had) just hit two, he’s hot, we made two passes to get it to him, but he turned down a good shot for a great shot.” TIP-INS Thunder: The team record for 3-pointers in a game came on April 10, 2019, when Oklahoma City converted 23 of 54 3s in a game at Milwaukee. … Jerome came off the bench to hit four 3-pointers in the second quarter. He was recalled from the G League Oklahoma City Blue on Feb. 25. In 11 games since his recall, the second-year guard from Virginia has made 21 3-pointers while averaging 27 minutes a game. Timberwolves: The team announced on Monday that a limited number of fans will be allowed in attendance at their final 12 home games of the season. Tickets will go on sale to the public on March 31, with an April 5 game against Sacramento marking the first time fans will be allowed at Target Center in more than a year. … Edwards, the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, has had an uneven rookie season. The last week has been a good illustration of his peaks and valleys. He dropped 42 points on the Suns on Thursday, but in two games since, he’s totaled just 27 points on 10-for-34 shooting.","401307443"
"Patty Mills has a chance to send the game to overtime, but he misses the 3-pointer and Terry Rozier lobs one to Miles Bridges for the alley-oop after the buzzer. (0:32) SAN ANTONIO -- — Charlotte won without the free-wheeling and fast-paced offense the Hornets enjoyed with LaMelo Ball, though they would rather have their rookie point guard back. Gordon Hayward scored 27 points, Terry Rozier added 24 and Charlotte held on to beat the San Antonio Spurs 100-97 on Monday night in its first game since losing Ball to a wrist injury. “We are definitely going to miss him,” said Rozier, who refers to Ball as his “little brother.” “But we’ve just to got to adjust. This is what we’ve got. He’s a special player, a great player, but this is part of the NBA. Not move on, but we’ve just got to make it happen.” Ball suffered a fractured right wrist Saturday after a hard fall against the Los Angeles Clippers. Regarded as the leading candidate for Rookie of the Year honors, Ball is expected to miss the remainder of the season. “I think we all feel for Melo,” Hayward said. “It was nice for us to be able to a get a win like that in our first game without him. A lot of people stepped up. We all wish him a speedy recovery. He is truly important to this team.” The Spurs had won four of five but struggled to contain the Hornets’ frontcourt. Bismack Biyombo and Malik Monk added 11 points apiece and P.J. Washington added 10 points and 13 rebounds as Charlotte snapped a three-game skid. DeMar DeRozan had 28 points and Derrick White added 21 for the Spurs to open a nine-game homestand. The Spurs tied the game at 93 with 1:45 remaining following a 3-pointer by White and a three-point play by DeRozan. Rozier hit a step-back 27-footer to give the Hornets a lead they would not relinquish again. “They really challenged our mental toughness and physical toughness,” Charlotte coach James Borrego said. “I think this team really grew tonight. We withstood that. This was not a finesse win. This was not a transition, knocking down 3, type of win for us. We had to gut this one out with physicality and toughness. You really need that along the way.” The Hornets are 16-0 when leading after three quarters. “It’s really impressive for such a young team to find ways to win like that,” Hayward said. “I think we’re fighters. It’s nice to have people that hit clutch shots.” San Antonio held Charlotte to 19 points in the third quarter and the defensive push continued into the fourth when White’s jumper put the Spurs up 76-74 for their first lead since White’s game-opening 3-pointer. “We played a very good second half, but we didn’t play a good first half,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “We looked like a team that just got back off the road. And sometimes that’s the formula in the NBA. That first game coming back is a tough one. I was hoping we were over that, but the first half was a killer.” The defensive effort was needed after Charlotte used a balanced attack to offset Ball’s loss in building a 12-point lead. Ball’s absence was evident early as Charlotte was held to two fast-break points in the first quarter. The Hornets were fifth in the league in fast-break points at 15.1 per game but were held to five against the Spurs. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte held San Antonio to 45 points in the first half after allowing 47 points in the second quarter of a 122-114 home loss to the Spurs on Feb. 14. … Cody Zeller missed his second straight game with left shoulder bursitis. Borrego is hopeful Zeller will be available Wednesday at Houston. Spurs: San Antonio point guard Dejounte Murray arrived wearing Becky Hammon’s Colorado State jersey complete with her surname and No. 25. The Spurs assistant coach starred at Colorado State before playing 16 years in the WNBA equally between the New York Liberty and San Antonio Stars. Rudy Gay paid tribute to Rebecca Lobo by wearing the Connecticut All-American’s No. 50 jersey and DeRozan wore Hall of Famer Cheryl Miller’s No. 31 jersey from Southern California. … The nine-game homestand is the longest in franchise history, surpassing the seven straight home games the Spurs had in 2012.","401307444"
"Rudy Gobert shows off some moves as he powers his way to the rim to finish with a dunk. (0:16) CHICAGO -- — Donovan Mitchell scored 30 points, Rudy Gobert added 21 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high nine blocks, and the Utah Jazz pounded the Chicago Bulls 120-95 on Monday night. The Western Conference leaders took control in the first half and rolled to their second straight win after losing five of eight. Mitchell made five 3-pointers, one shy of his season high. The two-time All-Star also had six rebounds and six assists. Gobert just missed the first triple-double by a Jazz player since Feb. 13, 2008, when Carlos Boozer had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists at Seattle. He also surpassed his previous high of eight blocks. “He's playing the right way,” coach Quin Snyder said. “When he does the things that, really, only he can do as far as running and being willing to come over and get off his man's body and contest shots, he's gonna block shots.” Gobert picked up his ninth block with 8:18 remaining in the game when he rejected a driving Coby White. He got subbed out about a minute later. Gobert checked back in with 5:37 left and exited for good with 1:38 remaining. “When I subbed out with about seven minutes left, Derrick (Favors) was coming in and told me that I had nine blocks,” Gobert said. “He was very happy to tell me that. That's just the way we are as a team. Everyone is happy for one another. Everyone is lifting each other up. It's just fun to be part of a group that cares for one another.” Joe Ingles made 5 of 6 3s and finished with 17 points. Jordan Clarkson scored 16, and Mike Conley added 15 points. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 27 points, though he made just 10 of 25 shots. Thaddeus Young added 14 points and nine rebounds. But Lauri Markkanen scored just eight points in 19 minutes as the Bulls lost for the third time in four games. The 7-footer sat for about a 13-minute stretch between the third and fourth quarters but insisted he doesn't need an explanation from coach Billy Donovan. “I trust Billy 100 percent,” Markkanen said. “He doesn't need to explain anything to me. If it comes up, obviously, we can talk about it. He was trying to find a new lineup that would work. I'm not questioning him at all.” TIP-INS Jazz: Gobert was questionable because of a bruised left hip. ... Ingles is 105 for 210 on 3-pointers this season. ... Snyder praised assistant Alex Jensen, saying “he will be successful as a head coach sometime here in the future."" Jensen is in his eighth season with the Jazz. He starred from 1994 to 2000 at Utah, which is looking for a coach after firing Larry Krystkowiak last week.

"Danuel House Jr. heaves a shot from beyond half court and makes it before the halftime buzzer sounds. (0:26) HOUSTON -- — Stephen Silas walked off the court at halftime believing he'd seen a sign. Danuel House Jr. swished a 51-footer at the buzzer, sending the Rockets to the locker room on a high after 20 straight games of nothing but lows. “I was like, ‘Whoa, maybe this is the night,’” the Rockets coach said. “It felt like something special had happened. For us, something special happening is a win after so many losses in a row.” The Rockets went on to snap their 20-game losing streak Monday night, as John Wall had his first triple-double in five years in a 117-99 victory over the Toronto Raptors. Houston’s skid was tied for the ninth-worst in NBA history and the longest since Philadelphia’s record-setting, 28-game losing streak across the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. But Wall had 19 points, 10 assists and 11 rebounds, his first triple-double since March 17, 2016. That helped the Rockets got their first win since Feb. 4. “It’s like indescribable for a win in March of this crazy season, but I’m just so proud of the guys,” Silas said. “When you’re going through it and fighting so hard and seeing the disappointment in the players’ faces after loss after loss after loss, and to go into the locker room after today’s game and everybody is so happy and joyous is just super cool and great.” Wall found Silas after the game and gave him a big hug. “I just told him, ‘We finally got one,’” Wall said. “I told him I’m riding with him no matter what, and he said the same thing to me. No coach wants to deal with all this adversity he’s had to deal with in their first year. I’m happy for him.” Houston also handed the Raptors their ninth straight loss, which now represents the NBA’s longest active losing streak. All five Houston starters scored in double figures by midway through the third quarter. Jae’Sean Tate had 22 points, Sterling Brown added 20, Christian Wood scored 19 and House added 12. Houston led 65-60 at halftime after House's heave from well behind the halfcourt line near the Raptors bench on the sideline. The Rockets closed out the third quarter with an 88-86 lead and opened the fourth quarter on a 9-1 run to pull away. Houston overcame a rough first half where Wall received a technical foul for a third straight game, arguing with an official five minutes into the first quarter. Wood picked up his third personal foul less than three minutes into the second quarter and was limited to just eight scoreless first-half minutes. Fred VanVleet led Toronto with 27 points and was frustrated after the loss. “If you’re not going to play defense, you better score more than 99 points,” VanVleet said. Pascal Siakam scored 21 points, Normal Powell had 19 and Kyle Lowry added 17. Brown made his first five shots, including three 3s, for 13 first-quarter points. He finished 7 of 10 and 4 of 7 from 3. The Raptors led 28-27 at the end of the first quarter. In their losing streak, Houston led after the first quarter only three times, including on Feb. 26 when they led the Raptors 31-30. TIP-INS Raptors: DeAndre’ Bembry was ejected from the game after receiving two back-to-back technical fouls in the fourth quarter. ... Toronto has lost seven straight on the road. ...

"Dillon Brooks' basket in overtime keeps the Grizzlies in the lead for good as they beat the Celtics in Memphis. (0:19) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Ja Morant had 29 points and nine assists, and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Boston Celtics 132-126 in overtime on Monday night. Dillon Brooks added 24 points, seven rebounds and seven assists as the Grizzlies won for the third time in four games. Jonas Valanciunas had 16 points and 19 rebounds. Jaylen Brown led Boston with 27 points, and Jeff Teague finished with a season-high 26 points. Robert Williams III had 17, and Marcus Smart scored 16. “We had this one,” Brown said, later adding: “It’s definitely one we want back. We played hard to get back into the game. There’s still a lot of stuff we’ve got the clean up.” Morant scored the last three points of the game from the free-throw line. Brooks had five points early in the extra period. “Credit our guys,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “Big stops and big rebounds down the stretch to close out a big win.” Morant added: “Us continuing to fight and be able to lock in late in the game, won us this game.” The Celtics already were without starting guard Kemba Walker when Jayson Tatum was a late scratch with an illness. That meant two of Boston’s top three scorers were missing. “When you are missing guys like Jayson and Kemba, you have to win with a better defense,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “I think that’s what we’ve been able to do in the past.” But this time, they were not able to overcome Memphis, which played well in the extra period. While Morant and Brooks led the offensive attack, Stevens pointed to Valanciunas as a major factor. He said the Grizzlies center “just destroyed us.” “Even though he ended with 16 points, it felt like a lot bigger than that,” Stevens said. “It felt like he was getting what he wanted off the glass.” Boston trailed by nine midway through the fourth quarter. But Smart found Daniel Theis for a tying alley-oop dunk with 7.3 seconds left in regulation, sending it to overtime. Brown, who connected on 10 of 18 from 3-point range en route to 34 points in a win over Orlando on Sunday, struggled through much of three quarters, starting 3 of 11 from the field. He finished 11 of 24. “We played together. We were connected out there,” Brooks said. “We had minor slippage, but we found a way to overpass it and make the right plays to win the game.” TIP-INS Celtics: Brown has reached double figures in each of his 40 games this season. He has scored at least 20 in 30 of those games. ... Defeated the Grizzlies 126-107 on Dec. 30 when Brown had a career-high 42 points. ... Walker sat out his 17th game to deal with left knee injury management. Teague started in his spot. Fourth-year F Semi Ojeleye started for Tatum. ... Teague was 5 for 5 in the first half, including a pair of 3-pointers. His previous season high was 19 against Milwaukee on Dec. 23. Grizzlies: Had not defeated Celtics in last 10 meetings. Their last home win over Boston was Jan. 10, 2016. SECOND NIGHT PROBLEMS The Celtics have lost six straight on the second night of back-to-backs, many of those without Walker. “We started the year off great on the second night of back-to-backs, and have not been good the past month,” Stevens said, later adding: “The formula doesn’t change just because you played yesterday. You have to have the ability for guys that are fresh to impact the game.""","401307447"

Milwaukee played without Antetokoumpo due to a sprained left knee,  but the Bucks still shot 61.5% (24 of 39) from 3-point range and 56.4% overall. “When somebody like our best player is not playing that night, we kind of lock in,” Holiday said. “Everybody has to do a little bit more. It's a testament to the team we have.” Coach Mike Budenholzer was unsure about Antetokounmpo's status for Wednesday's game against Boston. Budenholzer said he thinks the reigning two-time NBA MVP got hurt during a 120-113 victory  over the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday. “We’re hoping it’s shorter rather than longer, but we’ll see how these first 48 to 72 hours go and we’ll know more then,” Budenholzer said before Monday’s game. With Antetokounmpo out of the lineup, Pat Connaughton made his first start of the season and collected 20 points and nine rebounds while shooting 6 of 7 from 3-point range. Khris Middleton had 25 points, eight rebounds and six assists. The Bucks also played without reserve forward P.J. Tucker because of a sprained left ankle. Tucker played 12 minutes and was scoreless Monday in his second game since he was acquired in a trade with Houston last week. “We’ll see how he does overnight and what he feels like and looks like tomorrow,” Budenholzer said. Indiana wasn’t close to full strength, either. The Pacers were missing Malcolm Brogdon (sore lower back) and Myles Turner (sprained left ankle) and remained without T.J. Warren, who hasn’t played since Dec. 29 due to a stress fracture in his left foot. “I don't think it's serious,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said of the Brogdon and Turner injuries. “I would expect them back very soon.” Even without Antetokounmpo, the Bucks made short work of the Pacers. Holiday recorded season highs in both points and assists. Indiana’s Doug McDermott opened the game with a 3-pointer, but the Bucks scored the next 19 points and stayed in command the rest of the way. “I just thought our overall readiness and our aggressiveness to start the game was not there tonight, for a number of different reasons,” Bjorkgren said. The Bucks went 9 of 10 from 3-point range in the first 9½ minutes and led 48-26 by the end of the first quarter. That 48-point outburst represented the fifth-highest point total the Bucks have ever recorded in a single quarter. “It's contagious,” Holiday said. “The ball has energy. Pushing the pace and seeing the ball go through the hoop, the hoop just grows and gets bigger. From there, I feel like the pressure kind of falls off your shoulders, the weight kind of falls and you just let it go and let it shoot.” Indiana got 22 points from Domantas Sabonis, 21 from Jeremy Lamb, 20 from McDermott and 19 from Caris LeVert. TIP-INS Pacers: While Jrue Holiday had arguably his best game of the season, his brothers on Indiana's roster struggled. Justin Holiday hit consecutive 3-pointers in overtime in a 109-106 victory at Miami  on Sunday, but he scored just three points and shot 1 of 10 (all 3-point attempts) on Monday. Aaron Holiday was scoreless in 17 minutes and shot 0 for 7. Bucks: Connaughton made his 13th start in 322 career regular-season games. … The Bucks led 83-60 and matched their highest first-half point total of the season. ... The Bucks are 9-0 against Central Division foes.","401307448"
"Kawhi Leonard is fired up after draining a 3-pointer to put the Hawks away at Staples Center. (0:22) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 25 points, Terance Mann added a season-high 21 and the Los Angeles Clippers rallied from a 22-point deficit in the second half to snap the Atlanta Hawks' eight-game winning streak with a 119-110 victory Monday night. Luke Kennard made all eight of his shots and scored all of his season high-tying 20 points in the second half for the Clippers, who fell behind 88-66 in the third quarter shortly after a frustrated coach Ty Lue put in a small lineup of five reserves. “With the team that we have, we know that we’re capable of making some comebacks,” Kennard said. With Mann and Kennard spurring the comeback, Los Angeles ended the game on a dominant 53-22 run. “I think we realized over the past few games that energy is one of the things that works for us,” said Mann, who scored 11 points in the fourth quarter. “When we’re hustling, rebounding the ball and showing personality, it’s made us open up our eyes.” Trae Young had 28 points and eight assists, and John Collins scored 23 points in the Hawks' first loss of March, and their first under new coach Nate McMillan. Atlanta's winning streak was its longest since January 2015. “I thought we just started celebrating,” McMillan said. “They made some adjustments, they went small, and we just lost our focus and didn’t finish this game. ... We lost our composure.” After Lue emptied his bench because he said he was “looking for life,” a lineup without All-Stars Leonard and Paul George shockingly trimmed the deficit to single digits. George finished with a season-low eight points, but the Clippers didn't need him. “I think it’s definitely one of the most fun games I’ve been a part of in my basketball career,” Kennard said. “That’s top two, if not at the top. The group that was in, and then just hearing the guys on the sidelines, the way they were cheering us on as we made that run, that’s what it’s all about.” After Mann hit the tying layup with 4:25 to play, he drilled a 3-pointer with 2:42 left to give Los Angeles its first lead of the second half. Leonard's decisive 3-pointer with 1:23 left capped a 50-20 surge by the Clippers, and the superstar added another on the next possession for a flourish on the stunned Hawks. “We’ve gone through this before,” Young said. “We’ve done a great job recently of closing out games. You’re not going to be perfect all season, but it felt like we had a real good chance of closing this one out."" TIP-INS Hawks: Danilo Gallinari was whistled for a flagrant foul on Mann in the third quarter. Gallinari then missed the fourth quarter with a left knee bruise, McMillan said. ... Young hit five of their 12 3-pointers and had four of their seven turnovers. Clippers: They traded Mfiondu Kabengele to Sacramento during the game. Mann's collegiate teammate at Florida State appeared in 35 games over two seasons with LA. ... LA again played without two regular starters. Patrick Beverley has missed five straight games with right knee soreness, and Serge Ibaka has missed the last four due to lower back tightness. NIGHT OF THE HUNTER De’Andre Hunter scored eight points in 21 minutes for Atlanta in his first game since Jan. 29. He missed 23 games while recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery. “He went out there and played good,” Young said. “I know he was trying to get into a rhythm. He got a couple of shots to go down, and it was good to see.” Hunter averaged 17.2 points and 5.4 rebounds in his first 18 games. McMillan said Hunter is on a minutes restriction for now. LUUUUKE Kennard got a $64 million extension in the offseason, but had played only 64 minutes in the last 10 games. He shook off any rust with a dazzling effort against the Hawks, hitting four 3-pointers while adding seven rebounds and four assists without a miss. “Luke is a bucket,” Mann said. “He can get to it, and it was great to see.” Kennard even banked in a 3-pointer from halfcourt at the third-quarter buzzer to cap his 13-point quarter. “When that deep shot went in from halfcourt, I said, ‘Shoot, you know what? Let’s just keep this momentum going,’” Kennard said. “A 20-point (deficit) seems like a lot, but we just chipped away.”","401307449"
"After Mike Malone sends thoughts and prayers to those involved in the Boulder, Colorado, shooting, he gets emotional as he reads the list of names of the 10 people who died. (1:12) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Nikola Jokic had 28 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his 12th triple-double of the season, and the Denver Nuggets built a big lead before holding off the Orlando Magic 110-99 on Tuesday night. Denver had a 24-point advantage early in the second half that was trimmed to five. But the Nuggets won their sixth consecutive road game to tie a franchise record set twice previously, most recently in 2018. The Nuggets also won their ninth straight against the Magic and for the 16th time in 18 meetings dating to the 2003-04 season. Denver coach Michael Malone was tearful and openly emotional before the game while talking about the 10 people killed in a grocery story by a gunman Monday in Boulder, Colorado. Malone named each of the 10 victims of a massacre that took place approximately 28 miles from downtown Denver. He dedicated the game to the families dealing with the aftermath. “Hopefully the players understand the tragedy that happened and what it means for us because we represent Denver, and Boulder is right there with us,” Malone said. “We’re still thinking of everybody and hope that Boulder stays strong.” Orlando got within 92-86 with six minutes to play, but missed its next three shots and faded down the stretch. The slumping Magic lost for the 11th time in 12 games and dropped to 9-14 at home. Jokic got his 10th assist with slightly more than four minutes remaining to move into second place in the NBA with 12 triple-doubles, trailing only Russell Westbrook (14). Jokic, who has a franchise-best 53 triple-doubles in his career, began the day tied with James Harden at 11. Jamal Murray scored 21 points for Denver. Michael Porter Jr. had 18 points and seven rebounds. Murray said his thoughts were with the families back in Colorado dealing with another tragedy. “It’s stupid for that to happen and that’s 10 lives gone like that in a snap of the fingers,’’ Murray said. ”Just going to shop, get food, eggs, milk, and it’s crazy it can happen that easy. It’s crazy to think that you can walk in a store and your life could be over.” Evan Fournier scored 31 points for the Magic — his second 30-point game of the season. Nikola Vucevic added 18 but was badly outplayed by Jokic, a fellow All-Star center. Down as many as 24 after allowing the first basket of the second half, Orlando made it a game in the third quarter. The Magic used a 20-4 run to get within eight and had a 30-19 advantage in the period. They eventually got as close as five two different times in the fourth. “You always have to understand why you win and lose,” Malone said of Denver’s second-half turnover woes. “More importantly, you never want to accept in victory what you wouldn’t accept in defeat.” TRADE TALK After the game, Magic forward Aaron Gordon acknowledged he recently requested a trade from management prior to Thursday’s deadline. Gordon had 13 points and six assists in the loss. He seemed aware that Wednesday’s game against Phoenix could be the last of his seven-season stint with the Magic. “The losses have accumulated over the years and it’s just my frustration boiling over,” Gordon said. “I think a lot of people share that sense of frustration with me.” After this season, Gordon will have one more year remaining on his contract. The injury-ravaged Magic sit well outside the Eastern Conference playoff race. TIP-INS Nuggets: Scored 28 of their first 38 points in the paint and had 42 paint points by halftime — six fewer than their per-game average. The Nuggets finished with 60 points in the paint. … Denver had a 19-0 advantage in fast-break points over the first 24 minutes. Magic: Orlando extended its streak of games with at least one 3-pointer to 1,100. That streak, which ranks fifth in the NBA, dates back to March 17, 2007. … Coach Steve Clifford said guard Terrence Ross (sore right knee) could return Wednesday. … Former Magic forward Hedo Turkoglu, who helped the franchise reach the 2009 NBA Finals, sat courtside.","401307450"
"Julius Randle has the hot hand for the Knicks, going 7-of-10 from beyond the arc in a 37-point performance. (0:56) NEW YORK -- — Julius Randle scored 37 points to spark the New York Knicks to a 131-113 rout of the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. The All-Star was one of six players to finish in double figures for New York, which evened its record at 22-22. RJ Barrett scored 21, Alec Burks added 20 and Mitchell Robinson had 16 points and 11 rebounds. “Winning is fun,” Barrett said. With its 22nd victory, New York has won one more game in 2020-21 than it did all of last season. Even so, the Knicks are not yet planning any parades just yet. “It's tough to play 48 minutes,” Barrett said. “We have to figure out a way to try and do that ... get as close to that.” Bradley Beal scored 22 points for the Wizards, who lost for the ninth time in 11 games. “I don't think we even arrived to the arena, honestly,” Beal said. “We didn't bring any focus, any energy, and we damn sure didn't play defense. So that's why we lost.” Before the game, Washington coach Scott Brooks spoke passionately about the importance of his team stringing wins to make a push for the franchise’s first playoff berth since the 2017-18 season. Instead, it was the Knicks who played with purpose and led by 20 at halftime following Robinson’s two-handed dunk off Barrett's missed free throw. That ended a first half in which Randle scored 21 points and Barrett had 10 points, five assists, and grabbed four rebounds. New York did not let up in the second half, extending its lead to as much as 31. In one 52-second stretch in the third quarter, Randle drilled three 3-pointers on back-to-back-to-back possessions. “I was just confident,” Randle said. “I put the work in. I know how hard I worked this summer on trying to improve as a shooter. So honestly I'm not really surprised. ... I had it rolling.” Along with the win, the Knicks also received some reinforcements as Elfrid Payton returned to New York’s lineup. The point guard had missed five games in a row with a strained right hamstring. The Knicks did not have Austin Rivers (personal) and Derrick Rose, who missed his ninth straight game as the veteran guard is “working his way through protocol,” Tom Thibodeau said during his pregame availability. TIP-INS: Wizards: Washington is among the NBA’s most intriguing teams on the eve of the trade deadline. The Wizards are 13th in the East, but have the league’s leading scorer in Beal, who will be an unrestricted free agent this summer. Brooks is focused on the immediate. “Part of being in the NBA this time of the year, you (have) to be able to focus on the game and focus on what you do,” Brooks said. “If you’re worried about (trade rumors) ... you’re going to have to learn how to deal with it. It’s just part of being a player in this league.” Knicks: Before the game, the NBA announced Randle had been fined $15,000 “for directing inappropriate language toward a game official and public criticism of the officiating,” for his outburst following New York’s 101-100 overtime loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday. Randle had been called for a loose ball foul on Tobias Harris with 5.3 seconds left in overtime and the Knicks leading by a point. Harris made both free throws, and Randle missed a last-second shot which would have won the game. During his Zoom availability after the loss, Randle said the call was, “...ridiculous,” and added the on-court officiating “have to do a better job.”","401307451"
"The Lakers continue to struggle with LeBron James and Anthony Davis sidelined due to injuries as the lose to the Pelicans 128-111. (1:18) NEW ORLEANS -- — Brandon Ingram looked invigorated by the sight of some old teammates on the Lakers' bench, while Zion Williamson resembled the reliable 20-point machine he's become in his second pro season. That spelled trouble for a Los Angles squad that has been struggling without injured stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Ingram scored a season-high 36 points, Williamson had 27 points and nine rebounds, and the New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Lakers 128-111 on Tuesday night. The 20-year-old Williamson became the first NBA player younger than 21 to score at least 20 points in 21 straight games, and he did so with his usual crowd-pleasing array of alley-oop dunks and quick, powerful drives to the hoop. “We see it every night. You almost just get used to it,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""I didn’t even think tonight was like one of his better nights. ... He’s so good now, the standard’s so high on the offensive end of the floor that you start to take it for granted.” Ingram helped keep the Pelicans comfortably in front with 17 points in the third quarter, showcasing his mid-range repertoire of pull-ups, fades and turnaround jumpers — often against former Lakers teammate Kyle Kuzma. “Going against those guys again is always fun because we kind of got drafted around the same time and we were all coming up trying to battle against each other, just trying to be better than each other,” said Ingram, who has scored 30 points 10 times this season, including in his past two games. “Of course, I'm a competitor. So, I wanted to go back to some of those old days of just us going at it in practice,” Ingram continued. “I just tried to get the best of him.” Pelicans guard Josh Hart — like Ingram an ex-Laker who was part of the trade that sent Davis to Los Angeles — grabbed 15 rebounds to go with five steals. Second-year guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker scored 18 and rookie guard Kira Lewis Jr. set a new high with 16 points in a reserve role. New Orleans center Jaxson Hayes scored 15 points in 19 minutes, hitting four times inside and making all seven of his free throws. The Lakers, lost their third straight — all without Davis and the past two without James, who sprained his ankle early in a loss to Atlanta on Saturday that started the current skid. “We had a stretch in the second quarter where we hit a big drop, which really hurt us in this game,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “We didn’t play well enough defensively, particularly in that third quarter. We are going to miss guys like LeBron and Anthony on both sides of the ball, so getting us organized offensively is probably my top priority right now.” Montrezl Harrell had 18 points for the Lakers, while Kuzma and Markieff Morris each scored 16. Kuzma also grabbed 10 rebounds and had seven assists. New Orleans opened its first double-digit lead in the second quarter and went up by 17 on Ingram's 27-foot 3-pointer, one of four he hit from deep. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope's 3 trimmed the Pelicans' lead to 59-46 at halftime. The Lakers never got within single digits in the second half and trailed by as many as 30. TIP-INS Lakers: Have lost four of their past five on the road. ... Dennis Schroder scored 15 points and Wesley Matthews had 14. ... The Lakers went 18 of 37 from 3-point range (48.6%). Pelicans: Starting point guard Lonzo Ball missed his second straight game with a strained right hip flexor. Alexander-Walker started in his place. ... Steven Adams had 12 points and seven rebounds. ... Australian rookie Will Magnay saw his first NBA action in the final three minutes. He attempted one shot from 3-point range and missed. ... New Orleans missed 19 of 29 from 3-point territory. ... Outrebounded the Lakers 53-34 and outscored them 62-32 in the paint. POINT PRODUCTION Williamson said he's not sure how long he can sustain his 20-point streak because he's trying not to be selfish with the ball on the offensive end. “Since I have the ball in my hands a lot and my coach and teammates trust me, I could just shoot a lot and get 20 points, but my teammates and coaches know that’s not the game I want to play,"" Williamson said. ""I want to get everybody involved and hunt for the best shot. So getting those 20 points, some nights it is going to be tougher. But nights like tonight, when there’s a lot of ball movement and B.I.’s doing his thing, that really opens up the game for me.”","401307452"
"Devin Booker drives down the lane and makes a floater through contact vs. Miami. (0:22) MIAMI -- — The last time the Phoenix Suns won seven consecutive road games, Chris Paul had yet to become an NBA All-Star, Devin Booker and Mikal Bridges were 10, and Deandre Ayton had not even started playing basketball. That was then. The Suns are rolling now, and the Miami Heat just keep on sputtering as the trade deadline looms. Booker scored 23 points, Ayton finished with 17 points and 16 rebounds and the Suns added to Miami’s miserable stretch with a 110-100 win over the reigning Eastern Conference champions on Tuesday night. It was Phoenix’s seventh straight win on the road, the first time the Suns have had such a streak since January 2007. “I don’t want to make declarations about us,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “I just like winning games and winning with our defense against a really good team — a team with a championship pedigree and a team that’s been where we want to go.” Former Heat forward Jae Crowder scored 13 points, Bridges added 12 and Paul had nine assists for the Suns (29-13), who moved within two games of idle Utah for the top spot in the Western Conference. “I felt like we were all engaged mentally with the game plan and it translated out on the court,"" Crowder said. “We had control of the game the whole way through."" Kendrick Nunn scored 25 points for Miami, which has dropped four in a row and continued struggling from the field. The Heat have shot 41% from the field and 28% from 3-point range during this slide, which came immediately after a stretch where Miami won 11 out of 12 games. “We’ll keep plugging away until we find the right solutions,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “We’re certainly better than what we’ve shown over the last four games on the offensive end.” Bam Adebayo scored 15 points and Jimmy Butler had a 14-point, 11-rebound night for Miami. The Heat could be active before Thursday’s 3 p.m. trade deadline, with it looking like they need some sort of spark to get back on track. The Heat are one of five teams — Atlanta, Charlotte, New York and Chicago are the others — all clustered within one game of each other between fourth and eighth place in the East. Miami was within 42-39 midway through the second quarter, before the Suns went on a 16-4 run and went into the break up 58-43. The Heat used an 11-0 run to cut a 22-point deficit in half late in the third quarter, but never was closer than 10 in the second half. Crowder, Booker, Paul and Butler all sat out the fourth quarter. For the Suns, it was a little rest. For Butler, it was probably more frustration than anything else. “We know we’re not playing to our capability,” Nunn said. “But we’ll get things together.” TIP-INS Suns: Crowder — a big part of Miami’s run to the NBA Finals last season — was introduced last and got a warm reception, which he acknowledged with a wave. ... The game started a stretch where Phoenix is scheduled to play 18 of its final 31 games on the road. ... This is Phoenix’s best 42-game start since the 2007-08 Suns began 30-12. Heat: Miami added KZ Okpala (health and safety protocols) to its injury list, along with Avery Bradley (calf), Goran Dragic (back) and Udonis Haslem (protocols). ... Kelly Olynyk played the first nine minutes of the game and sat the rest of the half, then played the first six minutes of the third quarter and didn’t return. He was 0 for 6. RECORD WATCH Phoenix is now two wins from matching the franchise record for consecutive road victories. The Suns have won nine consecutive road games in the same season three times; it also happened in a stretch from March 1998 through February 1999, obviously spanning two seasons. STREAKING The Heat have had winning streaks of six, five and four games this season — and losing streaks of five, four, three and three games. Somehow, it all adds up to a 22-22 record with 28 games left.","401307453"
"Tobias Harris' 25 points help the 76ers stop the Warriors' 24-point comeback, and Philadelphia comes away with a 108-98 win. (1:59) SAN FRANCISCO -- — The way his Philadelphia 76ers are winning, coach Doc Rivers sees no reason to discuss the trade deadline. Tobias Harris hit a go-ahead jumper with 3:44 to play, scored another basket on the next possession and finished with 25 points and 13 rebounds to help the Sixers hold off the Golden State Warriors 108-98 on Tuesday night. “My attitude is not to get the highlights, get the praise, it’s to get the win,” Harris said. Harris also converted a free throw on Draymond Green's technical foul with 2:47 remaining. Rivers likes how Harris has improved from game to game. “What I liked about his game tonight, he didn't force it, he kind of just let the game come to him,” Rivers said. “And he made plays, not just with his shot but with the pass. Played phenomenal defense.” Ben Simmons added 22 points and eight rebounds for the Sixers, who pulled off their second consecutive road win after a 101-100 victory at New York on Sunday. The Eastern Conference leaders improved to 31-13 with their ninth victory in 10 games. “As a group, we've won nine out of 10 games, the guys are playing good basketball — no need to talk about it,” Rivers said about Thursday's deadline. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 24 points and 10 rebounds to carry the load for the Warriors, with his name popular in trade conversations. “He’s coveted,” coach Steve Kerr said. Jordan Poole added 19 points for the short-handed Warriors, who roared back with a big third quarter after trailing by 24. “This was a tough loss. We fought till the end,” Andrew Wiggins said. “Nice comeback and all but we didn’t close at the end.” Stephen Curry missed his third straight game with a bruised tailbone since falling hard on his backside at Houston last Wednesday and won't play for at least a week, Kerr said before the game. Younger brother Seth Curry of the Sixers also sat out after spraining his left ankle last Wednesday in an overtime loss to the Bucks. He missed his third straight game. One member of the family delivered with a big night: Their brother-in-law, Damion Lee, scored 16 points for Golden State in 24 minutes off the bench. Rookie center James Wiseman returned from the NBA's health and safety protocol after missing three games and will stay in the starting lineup indefinitely, Kerr said. Philadelphia hit 12 of its initial 22 shots to build a 27-9 lead and was up 35-17 after one quarter. A moment of silence was held before tipoff for Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor, who died Monday at age 86. STEPH'S STATUS Stephen Curry had an MRI and the test revealed inflammation in the tailbone. He will miss at least the next two games for Golden State before being re-evaluated in a week. Poole started in Curry’s place again. STRONG MESSAGE Kerr sat sternly in front of a black background featuring 18 names — representing each of the people killed in mass shootings over the past week in Atlanta and Boulder, Colorado. Before Kerr began to talk basketball, he delivered yet another message about gun violence that hits so close. “If we don’t humanize it just continues to be a statistic and it makes it much easier for the idiots out there to say, ‘this is the price of freedom’, in terms of owning guns. ‘This is the price of freedom,’ that’s possibly the dumbest expression I’ve ever heard in my life,"" said Kerr, speaking sternly on what he calls “weapons of war.” Kerr's father, Malcolm, was murdered in Beirut while president of American University of Beirut when Kerr was 18 and a college freshman at Arizona. TIP-INS 76ers: Philadelphia earned its first win on Golden State's second-year home court in Chase Center, having last won on the Warriors' floor with a 113-104 victory on Jan. 31, 2019.

"James Harden carefully dribbles through the lane and finds Nicolas Claxton for the slam. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — James Harden had 25 points and 17 assists to lead the Brooklyn Nets to a 116-112 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday night. Jeff Green finished with 20 points, 15 in the first half and a pair of free throws to close it out with 4.8 seconds left. Nicolas Claxton had 16 points and nine rebounds off the bench for Brooklyn, which played without Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. The Nets also were nearly without Harden, who said he was close to sitting out with a sore neck. But Harden, who has played more games than anyone in the NBA since entering the league in 2009 with 871, takes great pride in being available for his team. “That’s just who I am, that’s just how I’m built,” Harden said. “If this thing was done tomorrow, I know I gave everything I had. I know I didn’t shortcut at any point. It will be over one day but me in the back of my mind knowing, I have peace knowing I did that. I can live with that.” Enes Kanter had 19 points, 19 rebounds and six assists, while Damian Lillard had 22 points and nine assists for the Trail Blazers. Lillard and has backcourt partner McCollum had a tough night against the Nets, going to a combined 10 for 35 (28%) from the field. “I think both teams played real good basketball, both teams competed throughout the beginning of the game, throughout the whole fourth quarter. They just made some extra couple of shots end of the quarter,” Kanter said. The Nets held the Blazers to just 21 points in the fourth quarter and held Lillard scoreless in the final period. “Our sense of urgency and intensity on the defensive end has to be there, no question,” Harden said. “I’m proud of the guys in the fourth quarter, because that’s what won us the game. We have to have the intensity to be as great as we can be.” Kanter nearly had a double-double in the first quarter, with 13 points and eight rebounds to help Portland take a 41-37. Portland led 66-65 at halftime. Harden's pass to Claxton gave the Nets a 92-91 lead after three quarters. A layup by Blake Griffin, on Harden’s 13th assist, gave the Nets a 105-97 lead, forcing another Blazers timeout with 8:08 remaining. Back-to-back 3-pointers by Robert Covington cut the Brooklyn lead to 105-103. With the Nets leading 114-111, the Blazers successfully challenged a call to set up a jump ball at the center circle. Derrick Jones Jr. won the tip for Portland, which led to a Brooklyn foul against Covington with 7.8 seconds remaining. Covington missed the first but made the second, making it 114-112, before Green made his finishing free throws. TIP-INS Blazers: After suffering the worst home loss in franchise history on Sunday, the Blazers believe it was the product of a rare poor shooting night. “We’ve been a good shooting team all year. I think that was a little bit of an anomaly of Dame and CJ and (Carmelo Anthony) not making a 3. I think the offense will be better and that will help our defense.” ... The Blazers had two players removed from the lineup just before tip-off, with Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little both entering the league’s health and safety protocols. Nets: Durant, who has been out since Feb. 15 and has missed 18 games since Feb. 6, is closer to a return. Nets coach Steve Nash says that Durant is working out on the floor, but that he is in a “crucial” part of his rehabilitation that would not be improved by flying across the country. “He has to close that critical last stage of his rehab. He is on the court every day and looks great. But he’s making sure that strength is there. We need to make sure he’s coming back to play safely. If this was the playoffs, there’s a chance he would be back very soon. But there’s no point in taking a big risk at this point in the season.“ ... Harden was a game-time decision with a sore neck. “I would play Jesus tonight if I could,” Nash said before the game. BRINGING GRIFFIN ALONG Griffin played in his second game with the Nets. He remains on a minutes restriction, with Nash saying any increase in Griffin’s workload will be “very, very gradual.” “I definitely don’t want to get excited,” Nash said. “We have to remember he’s played one game in basically a month. He could play more minutes but I don’t want to jeopardize his long term health.” Griffin finished with eight points and five rebounds in 19 minutes.","401307455"
"Caris LeVert's step-back move results in a 3-pointer that gives the Pacers aa 114-109 lead over the Pistons with four seconds left in regulation. (0:22) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Caris LeVert's transition to fitting in with the Indiana Pacers was delayed two months by kidney surgery to remove a cancerous mass. Acquired in a three-team trade on Jan. 16 that involved All-Stars James Harden and Victor Oladipo, LeVert didn't play again until just recently. His seventh Pacers start was his best yet with 28 points in a 116-111 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. “I felt like I've tried to be aggressive from day one,” LeVert said, “but it takes time.” LeVert's fourth 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds remaining enabled the Pacers to snap a six-game home losing streak. “Very big shot,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. “His legs are getting under him more and more each day.” It's the first time LeVert has surpassed 20 points with his new team. “I love fourth quarters. I love big moments,” he said. “Every win is important for us right now as we try to make the playoffs.” The Pacers (20-23) ended their worst winless stretch at home since losing six in a row in 1985. The Pistons (12-31) have the Eastern Conference's worst record. Edmond Sumner scored 18 points off the bench and Malcolm Brogden scored 16 for the Pacers. Jerami Grant led the Pistons with 29 points. Saddiq Bey and Wayne Ellington each scored 16. Levert accounted for the Pacers' last eight points of the first half for a 57-51 lead. The guard scored 15 of 17 first-half points in the second quarter. The Pistons committed nine of their 15 turnovers in the second quarter to continue a seasonal trend of erratic ballhandling. That meant playing catch-up in the second half. “This is about execution and making the easy pass,” Bey said. The Pistons rallied to cut the deficit to 78-76 with 2:15 remaining in the third, but the Pacers bench responded as reserves George Bitadze and Jeremy Lamb sank 3-pointers. The Pacers finished the quarter with an 86-79 lead. The Pistons tied the game at 92 on an Ellington jumper with 8:23 remaining. Detroit had a chance to tie or go ahead in the final minute, but Delon Wright committed a turnover. “At the end of the game, again, we had an untimely turnover,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. TIP-INS Pistons: After making a season-low 4 of 25 3-pointers in Sunday's home loss to Chicago, Detroit had four 3-pointers by the early minutes of the second quarter and were 6 of 15 from beyond the arc in the first half. Pacers: Have had a winning record at home for 31 consecutive seasons, but must finish 11-5 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse to extend that streak.","401307456"
"With one second left in the game, Marcus Smart inbounds to a wide-open Daniel Theis, who puts up a potential game-winning 3-pointer but can't knock it down. (0:40) MILWAUKEE -- — Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo feared the worst when he saw Boston's Daniel Theis all alone with the game on the line. Antetokounmpo could breathe a sigh of relief a moment later when Theis' 3-pointer bounced off the rim. Milwaukee blew most of a 25-point lead before holding on for a 121-119 victory over the Celtics on Wednesday night. Theis’ last-second miss finished the Bucks' eighth straight victory. “Thank God he didn't make it and we were able to get the win,"" Antetokounmpo said. Khris Middleton had 27 points and 13 rebounds for the Bucks, who have won 13 of 14 overall. Bobby Portis had 21 points on 7-for-10 shooting. Boston lost for the fifth time in six games. Jaylen Brown had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Kemba Walker scored 23. After trailing 90-65 midway through the third quarter, the Celtics cut the margin to two on Brown’s 3-pointer with 1:32 left. Theis then drew an offensive foul on Antetokounmpo, and the Celtics had multiple opportunities to tie the game or go in front the rest of the way. That's when the Bucks' defense stiffened. Marcus Smart missed a 3-pointer with 1:06 remaining. Donte DiVincenzo blocked a layup attempt from Walker with about 35 seconds remaining. Brook Lopez blocked a Smart layup attempt with 2 seconds left. “I think honestly, it may not seem it, but I think we did a great job of not tensing up,” DiVincenzo said. “I think we just made a few mistakes down the stretch, but I think it's good for us to learn how to get better off of a win.” After the Lopez block, Middleton knocked Smart’s ensuing inbounds pass out of bounds, giving the Celtics one last opportunity. Smart found Theis all alone in front of the Celtics’ bench, but the shot bounced off the rim as the buzzer sounded. “Lopez is playing off Theis and just protecting any cut to the rim, so Theis was the best option there,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""He got a great look. He stepped in and shot it with authority, back-rimmed it, looked good.” Antetokounmpo and Boston’s Jayson Tatum returned after the All-Stars missed games on Monday. Antetokounmpo rested during the Bucks’ 140-113 victory over Indiana because of a sprained left knee. An illness kept Tatum from playing in a 132-126 overtime loss at Memphis. Antetokounmpo scored 13 points – his second-lowest total of the season – but also had eight rebounds and seven assists. Lopez and DiVincenzo each had 17 points. Tatum scored 18 points in the first meeting between the teams since the season opener. Jeff Teague added 15. That first Celtics-Bucks matchup also was a thriller. The Celtics won 122-121 in Boston when Tatum banked in a 3-pointer in the final second and Antetokounmpo missed a potential tying free throw. This time, a last-second shot from the Celtics didn't fall. “We were a little bit fortunate,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “Theis got clean for a free look. We were fortunate he didn't make it.” TIP-INS Celtics: Reserve forward Semi Ojeleye bruised his left hip early in the second quarter. He was helped to the locker room. … The Celtics have lost five of their last six games. Bucks: Reserve guard Bryn Forbes was held out with a toe injury. Forbes’ absence resulted in an opportunity for Sam Merrill, who typically isn’t part of the rotation but entered Wednesday’s game late in the first quarter. ... P.J. Tucker, who sprained his left ankle in the Pacers game, played Wednesday and had three points and three rebounds in 19 minutes.","401307457"
"Evan Fournier dribbles inside and finishes a tough bucket off the glass as the Magic edge out the Suns 112-111. (0:19) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — If Orlando's victory Wednesday night turns out to be Evan Fournier’s last game for the Magic with the NBA’s trade deadline approaching, the guard will depart with yet another memorable moment. Fournier scored the last of his 21 points on a difficult driving layup over Phoenix center Deandre Ayton with 6.4 seconds left and the Magic beat the Suns 112-111. Fournier, an unrestricted free agent at season’s end who has been the subject of recent trade talks, admitted he would be heartbroken if he’s dealt away from the franchise he has spent the past seven seasons playing for. “I left my home (in France) where I lived with my parents when I was 13 and since then I never stayed in one place for more than two years, so the fact that I’ve been here for seven years says a lot,” said Fournier, who hit four 3-pointers and scored at least 20 points for the 12th time this season. “I had a son here, I got married and it means more than a lot. … If it’s the end, it’s the end, but I obviously love the franchise.” Suns star Devin Booker made two free throws with 19.4 seconds left to give Phoenix a one-point lead, but he failed to answer Fournier's winner when he missed a reverse layup attempt just before the final horn. The loss ended Phoenix’s road winning streak at seven, its longest since 2006-07. Phoenix is 14-6 on the road, tied for the second-most road victories in the NBA. “We started off the right way, but we never got over that hump,” said Booker, whose Suns lost on the road for the first time since Feb. 3. “We pushed the lead to 10 to 12 a couple of times and messed around with the game. They stuck around and finished it the right way.” Nikola Vucevic had 27 points and 14 rebounds for Orlando, and rookie Chuma Okeke made all six of his shots — four from 3-point range — en route to a career-best 17 points. “It lets me know that I’m capable of doing these things, capable of hitting these shots and making these plays,” Okeke said. Orlando trailed by 13 in the early going and by five in the fourth period before rallying behind Vucevic’s 32nd 20-point performance. Vucevic’s fadeaway jumper put Orlando up 107-102 with 2:58 to play and his free throw with 27.4 seconds remaining broke a tie at 109. Booker finished with 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, and Chris Paul scored eight of his 23 points in the fourth quarter. Jae Crowder had 17 points and four 3-pointers — the final one tying the game at 109 with 38.1 seconds to play. Ayton had 21 points and nine rebounds for Phoenix, who fell to 22-6 when leading after three periods. “Everybody is upset because we lost and that’s a good thing,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. There were five lead changes and five ties in the fourth period alone. The Magic ultimately won for a second time in the past 13 when Fournier rubbed off a Vucevic pick and finished over Ayton as the guard fell to the floor. “Over the years we’ve played a ton of two-man game, so we have a great understanding of each other’s game,” Vucevic said about the action that led up to Fournier’s winner. “Tonight, they switched (defensively), he went at Ayton and made a tough shot. It was a big-time shot.” TIP INS Suns: Wednesday was the four-year anniversary of Booker’s franchise-record 70-point game against Boston in 2017 and the 31-year anniversary of Tom Chambers scoring 60 points for the Suns in 1990. … Phoenix’s bench was outscored 37-20. Magic: Coach Steve Clifford thought Terrence Ross (sore right knee) might return, but he was out again. Orlando is 2-7 without Ross this season. … Cole Anthony, who has been out since Feb. 11 with a rib fracture, has resumed on-court basketball drills, but he has yet to be cleared for contact. … Orlando is 5-25 when trailing after three periods.","401307458"
"During Kyle Lowry's postgame news conference, he gets called via FaceTime by Drake, who says he's Lowry's translator. (0:16) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Pascal Siakam scored 27 points and the Toronto Raptors broke a nine-game losing streak Wednesday night with a 135-111 rout of the Denver Nuggets. Toronto built a 24-point lead in the first half and shot 50% (24 of 48) on 3-pointers overall to win for the first time since Feb. 26. OG Anunoby scored 18 of his 23 points before halftime for the Raptors, and Norman Powell added 22. Kyle Lowry, playing perhaps his final game for Toronto on the eve of the NBA trade deadline, finished with eight points, nine assists and five rebounds. “A lot of people are wondering what's going to happen. There are a lot of rumors out there,” Siakam said. “When you're losing, that makes it even worse. My focus was on trying to win a game and I was trying to block everything else away.” As for the prospect of breaking up the core of a team that won a championship two years ago, Siakam said: “That's the NBA. There's a lot of doubt going on, but there's not much you can do. It's kind of out of your control.” Lowry had a plus/minus of plus-42, second-best in franchise history. “He plays harder than anybody I’ve ever seen, and I can’t give him a higher compliment than that,” coach Nick Nurse said. ""He’ll go down as maybe the greatest Raptor ever to date.” Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray scored 20 points apiece for Denver, which lost for only the third time in 12 games. Michael Porter Jr. added 19 points and eight rebounds. The Nuggets had won six straight road games, equaling a franchise record. The Raptors were desperate for a win, having dropped 2 1/2 games outside the Eastern Conference playoff picture with 29 to play. “The only thing that's frustrating is if we can't play our way back into it at the end,” Nurse said. “We're not a million miles away from getting into postseason play and that's what we've got to make a run at.” The Raptors made their first five 3s, two during an early 8-0 run that put them ahead for good. Denver went scoreless for more than three minutes of the second quarter as Paul Watson Jr. and Anunoby hit 3-pointers in a 12-0 run. Toronto led 67-43 when Siakam drove for a layup with 2:34 left in the first half. The Nuggets never got the margin under 15 in the second half. A trio of 3s by Watson in the fourth quarter helped the Raptors stretch their lead to 35. TIP-INS Nuggets: Were coming off a win Tuesday night in Orlando. ... G Monte Morris missed his seventh game with a quadriceps injury. Raptors: Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment used the first all-female broadcast crew in NBA history, with The Sports Network's Kate Beirness and Amy Audibert serving as studio hosts. Meghan McPeak did the play-by-play, Kia Nurse was the analyst and Kayla Gray gave the sideline reports. ... Nurse downplayed reports of a shouting match with Siakam after Sunday night's loss at Cleveland, and said reports of a $50,000 fine were inaccurate. “We're all focused on winning, and I think that's all that matters,” Siakam said. ...

"Patrick Williams gets the ball and finishes with a one-handed dunk. (0:17) CHICAGO -- — Darius Garland had 22 points and nine assists, Jarrett Allen added 19 points and nine rebounds, and the Cleveland Cavaliers used a balanced attack to defeat the Chicago Bulls 103-94 on Wednesday night without leading scorer Collin Sexton. Larry Nance, Jr. had 14 points and pulled down 14 rebounds as Cleveland limited Chicago’s top scorers Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen in the second half. Isaac Okoro finished with 12 points for Cleveland, which won for just the fourth time in its last 10. “We had contributions from everyone,"" Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “I thought we did a great job of moving and sharing the ball tonight.” Garland, a 21-year-old second-year pro, quarterbacked Cleveland's attack and strong second half. The point guard had 14 points in the half to help Cleveland nudge ahead to a six-point lead after three quarters before the Cavs put it away in the fourth. “Darius is a good player and he's growing into a leadership role,” Bickerstaff said. “He usually has what it takes when the ball is in his hands."" Garland found himself in Nance's playful grip during a postgame Zoom interview. Moments after Garland started answering a reporter's question and said, “I was just trying to be aggressive like I always do,” the 6-foot-7 Nance pulled the 6-foot-1 Garland away from the camera. After kidding around, both players sat down and concluded the session. “(Darius) is great on that point guard job and he did it to perfection tonight,” Nance said. “He got his team across the finish line. He did an awesome job of directing us.” LaVine led Chicago with 22 points, getting 18 by the half on 6-for-8 shooting, including four 3-pointers. But the All-Star didn’t connect again until late and was held to two baskets on 12 shots in the second half. Markkanen had 13 points in the first half before cooling off and finishing with 17. “I don't think it was good game for anybody offensively,"" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “We didn't have any flow. We didn't play with any pace.” Coby White and Tomas Satoransky each had 11 points for Chicago, which has lost four of five. Sexton sat out after he experienced right hamstring soreness in the morning shootaround. Bickerstaff said the injury to the guard averaging 24 points wasn’t serious. The Bulls led 55-53 after a tight first half, during which each team hit 22 shots from the floor. But Chicago was more efficient, shooting at 53.7% opposed to Cleveland’s 43.1%. Both teams hit cold shooting stretches early and the Bulls committed six turnovers in the first quarter. That helped Cleveland open an eight-point lead with 4:32 left in the quarter, the biggest for either team in the half. The Bulls pulled into a 25-all tie at the end of the quarter as LaVine lofted in a 3 as time ran out. The Cavaliers opened a 78-72 lead after three quarters as the Bulls cooled off, shooting just 6 for 20 from the floor. LaVine went 0 for 5. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Bickerstaff hinted Sexton’s injury could be day-to-day. “It’s no major concern of anything lingering at this point. We’ll continued to monitor,” he said. ... With Sexton out, F Cedi Osman made his 16th start this season in a tweaked lineup. “Everybody has to chip in and do a little more,” Bickerstaff said. ... Kevin Love (right calf strain), Matthew Dellavedova (concussion, appendectomy) and Taurean Prince (left shoulder sprain) remained out. Bulls: Donovan said G/F Garrett Temple (sprained left ankle) was healthy enough to play, but he didn’t enter the rotation Wednesday. Temple had missed six games entering Wednesday and Donovan was concerned about his lack of playing time. LIMPING IN LaVine appeared to be limping late in the game, but Donovan didn't have a medical report. “There was no question he was limping. I got him off the floor immediately,"" Donovan said. “He said he wanted to play and I left him in there."" ROAD TRIPPING The Cavaliers started a four-game trip Wednesday, the first of seven of eight games on the road. The Bulls play nine of their next 10 games away from United Center, all during a 17-day span in the pandemic-condensed schedule. “When you look at a schedule like that, you can get overwhelmed,” said Donovan, who noted the lack of time to practice. “These players have never been through this before.”","401307460"
"With LaMelo Ball out indefinitely, the Hornets take down the Rockets 122-97 with the help of Terry Rozier's 25 points. (1:34) HOUSTON -- — Terry Rozier scored 25 points, Devonte’ Graham added 21 and the Charlotte Hornets beat the Houston Rockets 122-97 on Wednesday night. The Rockets quickly returned to the loss column after snapping a 20-game losing streak Monday night. It was the NBA’s longest skid since Philadelphia’s record-setting 28-game rut across the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. Charlotte won in Houston for the first time since Dec. 22, 2004, snapping a 15-game losing streak. The Hornets were still adjusting their rotation in the second game without LaMelo Ball after the rookie suffered a fractured wrist that is expected to sideline him for the rest of the season. Graham started at point guard, hitting 6 of 9 from 3-point range. “This is the Devonte’ we know,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “We all know it’s in there. This is the guy we know, believe in and trust. We all believe in him, and tonight, he proved why he’s on this roster and why he’s such a big part of our group. He was fantastic.” Malik Monk added 19 points off the bench for Charlotte. “If things aren’t going right with the second unit, it’s all on me,” Monk said. “With LaMelo hurt, I take great pride in bringing a lot of energy off the bench.” The Rockets were without Victor Oladipo, who missed the game for personal reasons. Oladipo has been heavily mentioned in trade rumors this week, leading up to Thursday afternoon’s deadline. For Houston, John Wall had 20 points and seven assists, and Christian Wood added 11 points and 10 rebounds. “We just have to play basketball and look at the film,” Wall said. “We have to play hard for 48 minutes to try to give ourselves a chance to win the game.” Following a 26-26 tie at the end of the first quarter, Charlotte took a 58-55 lead into halftime, thanks in large part to 9-for-19 shooting from 3. The Hornets finished 18 of 38 from 3 in the game, good for 47.4%, just under their season-high 51.2%. Charlotte opened the third quarter on a 10-2 run and entered the fourth with a 93-70 lead after outscoring the Rockets 35-15 in the third. “We just knew we had to tighten up our defense,” Borrego said. “We talked a lot about our defensive effort, and the guys responded. The starters were fantastic. They came out with urgency and were making shots, but it started on the defensive end. They set the tone, and we rode that wave for the rest of the half.” The Rockets closed out a seven-game homestand going 1-6 and will play four of their next five games on the road where they have lost nine straight. “Right at the beginning of the third quarter, (the deficit) went from 3 to 10 right away,” Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “It went downhill from there.” In their previous meeting in Charlotte’s 119-94 win on Feb. 8, the Rockets scored just seven points in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Hornets: C Cody Zeller, who missed the last two games with left shoulder bursitis, entered the game listed as probable and played 16 minutes off the bench, scoring eight points and grabbing seven rebounds. . Charlotte outrebounded Houston 50-39. Rockets: PG Kevin Porter Jr. was sidelined with right quad soreness. He participated in pre-game shooting drills before the team’s warmups and could be ready to return when the team travels to Minnesota this weekend. WALL’S EARLY SECOND-HALF EXIT After Charlotte’s hot start to the second half, Wall left the game relatively abruptly, a little more than four minutes into the third quarter. He spent much of the third quarter on a stationary bike, distant from the team’s bench. Wall declined to comment after the game. Silas was asked about his exit. “NBA stuff, frustration,” Silas said. “I’ll just leave it at that.” BORREGO NOT FOCUSED ON TRADE DEADLINE Hornets coach James Borrego said he hasn’t spent too much time over the past few days thinking about the looming trade deadline on Thursday afternoon. He said he talks with general manager Mitch Kupchak every day and that, “If he has something, he’ll bring it to me.” DARLING’S FIRST POINTS Rookie SG Nate Darling scored his first-ever points in the NBA, hitting a 26-foot 3-pointer with 1:58 remaining in the game. “I was excited for Nate,” Borrego said. “To score in an NBA game for the first time, that’s special. And I loved the bench’s reaction. That’s a special thing, and I’m very happy for him.”","401307461"
"Jalen Brunson drives into the lane, fakes the pass and heads to the basket uncontested for an easy layup. (0:18) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Kristaps Porzingis had 29 points and seven Dallas players scored in double digits as the Mavericks ran away with a 128-108 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 21 points off the bench for Dallas, and Luka Doncic finished with 15. Rookie guard Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 29 points, including 18 in the fourth quarter. Karl-Anthony Towns had 22. Dallas has won two games in a row, while Minnesota dropped its third straight. “If we want to be the best team that we think in our mind that we can be, then these games are must-wins,” Porzingis said. “These are the types of games that we cannot let slip.” The Mavericks are 14-5 in their last 19 games. With Doncic quiet in the first half, Porzingis carried the scoring for Dallas. He had 17 points on 6-of-13 shooting as the Mavericks took a 56-55 lead into halftime. Doncic, who averaged 39 points in his previous three games, was held to five in the first half on 2-of-9 shooting. His second basket came with 8.2 seconds left in the half, giving the Mavs a one-point lead. Dallas struggled from the floor in the first half, connecting on just 37.5% of its shots (18 of 48). But the Mavericks’ offense clicked in the third quarter and they shot 52% from the field to push the lead to double figures. “The start to the game was rough, but we hung in,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “We had a rough start to the second half and then got our bearings, got our footing."" A three-point play by Jalen Brunson in the final minute of the third put the Mavericks up 85-73, their biggest lead to that point. Porzingis followed with a 3-pointer, his third of the night. Minnesota led by 13 in the first quarter, fueled by big outputs from Towns and Edwards. But that lead slipped away and Dallas tied it at 33 early in the second. “Defense was great in the first half. It was great in the beginning. Then it just kind of fell apart on us,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. Porzingis didn't play in the fourth quarter. He came within one point and one rebound of his 10th career 30-point, 10-rebound game. Dallas grabbed 14 offensive boards and outrebounded Minnesota by a 52-37 margin. “It's disappointing,” Towns said. “They got a lot of offensive rebounds, and it hurt us.” After his 11-point first quarter, Edwards didn’t score again until a pair of free throws early in the fourth. TIP-INS Mavericks: James Johnson rejoined the team after missing five games for personal reasons. He was available off the bench but did not play. … Doncic and Hardaway both picked up technical fouls. Timberwolves: G Josh Okogie was originally scheduled to start but was placed on the health and safety protocol list shortly before tip-off. … In the first quarter, Towns extended his franchise record of consecutive games with a 3-pointer to 59.","401307462"
"Ja Morant steals the pass and goes in for thunderous jam. (0:17) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Dillon Brooks matched a season high with 25 points, and the Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 116-107 on Wednesday night in the opening game of a four-game trip. Grayson Allen scored 20 points and Jonas Valanciunas added 16 points and 15 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who have won four of five to move one game above .500 for the season. The Grizzlies trailed by 12 in the third quarter, but they closed out the quarter on a 33-12 run to take control for good. “I hit them really hard at halftime about our undisciplined-ness, our inability to keep the Thunder in front of us -- something that we talked about before the game multiple times,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""We had a lack of competitiveness on the ball, we were turning the ball over, missing some shots, not getting set defensively.” Memphis guard Ja Morant said the Grizzlies listened to their coach, and got to work. “I just feel like we picked up our defensive effort,” he said. “We were able to get stops and play in transition, which we like to do -- get out and run. And it opened up a lot for us on the offensive end, got our offense going.” Moses Brown had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and Al Horford added 13 points, eight rebounds and six assists for the Thunder. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who leads Oklahoma City with 23.7 points per game, was out with plantar fasciitis in his right foot. Coach Mark Daigneault said before the game that there is no set timetable for his return. “I don’t want to use long term because it’s vague, but it’s not day-to-day,"" Daigneault said. ""It’s going to be a more significant amount of time than day-to-day. This one is now an injury that we need to take a look at.” The Thunder led 53-49 at halftime behind the play of centers Horford and Brown. Horford had 11 points, six rebounds and six assists at halftime, while Brown had 10 points and 10 rebounds in just 14 minutes. The Thunder went on a 6-0 run in the first 54 seconds of the third quarter that included a layup and a dunk by Aleksej Pokusevski. Oklahoma City pushed its lead to 12 before the Grizzlies responded with a flurry. A dunk by Brooks put the Grizzlies ahead, and he followed with a 3-pointer that gave Memphis a 67-63 lead and caused the Thunder to call a timeout. Memphis expanded its lead to 82-73 at the end of the third quarter and remained in control the rest of the way. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Morant scored two points on 1-for-7 shooting in the first half. He made 4 of 7 shots in the second half to finish with 11 points, seven assists and five rebounds. He averages just over 19 points for the season. ... It was Morant's 100th NBA game. ...

Made 10 of 35 3-pointers. ... Had seven players score in double figures. MORE BOARDS Valanciunas increased his streak of consecutive games with at least 10 rebounds to 11. It is the longest active streak in the league. MOSES BROWN Brown grabbed at least 12 rebounds for the fourth time in his last five games. The second-year player who has spent time in the G-League this season earned praise from Horford. NOT PERFECT Thunder guard Ty Jerome made all five of his 3-pointers Monday at Minnesota.

"Kawhi Leonard gets downhill and hammers a dunk vs. the Spurs. (0:21) SAN ANTONIO -- — Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard gave Spurs fans little to boo about in his return to San Antonio. Leonard had 25 points and the Los Angeles Clippers never trailed in beating the San Antonio Spurs 134-101 on Wednesday night. Leonard was booed during pregame introductions and subsequently each time he touched the ball. The jeers were not as loud as his three previous visits to the AT&amp;T Center and waned as the game progressed as the Spurs gave their fans little to root for and Leonard’s near-perfect outing gave them little to jeer about. Not that it mattered to the ever-stoic Leonard. “I doubt it,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “I think every game is the same to him.” And it was. The Clippers won their third straight and 11th by 20 points or more this season, but Leonard only saw room for improvement. “We’re not there yet,” Leonard said. “Not there yet. That’s what’s on my mind.” Marcus Morris added 20 points, Paul George had 17 points, and Lou Williams 16. “You have to have that respect level for every player that steps on to the floor,” Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray said. “We were more focused on the obvious two, Kawhi and Paul George. We have to know who’s who on the floor and what they are capable of.” DeMar DeRozan led San Antonio with 19 points, and Patty Mills added 16. The teams meet again Thursday night in the finale of the two-game set in San Antonio. Los Angeles remained third in the West and San Antonio dropped to eighth. After winning four of five, the Spurs have lost the first two of a nine-game homestand. Spurs fans still have not forgotten or forgiven Leonard for his trade demand and subsequent departure to Toronto following his injury-riddled 2018 season. Fans quickly got to see what made Leonard so special during his time in San Antonio. Leonard stole the ball on the Spurs’ opening possession, stepping into the passing lane to pick off a pass from Murray and quickly dribbling upcourt to make a contested layup against two defenders. “He’s smart,” George said about Leonard’s defense. “He knows how to position himself. He’s longer than you think. He knows how to get in the right spots.” Leonard finished 9-for-12 shooting, making both of his 3-point attempts and all five of his free throws. He also had seven rebounds, five steals and three assists in 32 minutes. The Clippers made their first five 3-point attempts in building a 19-7 lead, including three from Morris. Los Angeles would extend that lead to 18 points in the first quarter. “Just active,” Lue said. “Disruptive. I thought we brought physicality to the game. Just getting into their bodies and being active.” Los Angeles shot 62% on 3s in the first half and 56% from the field. San Antonio was 7 for 22 on 3-pointers and committed 16 turnovers. TIP-INS Clippers: Lou Williams was 6 for 12 from the field to eclipse 15,000 career points. “Great milestone,” Lue said. “Especially someone who has come off the bench for most of his career.” … Since suffering a 105-89 loss in Dallas on March 17, Los Angeles has averaged 126 points in its three victories with an average winning margin of 23 points. … G Patrick Beverley missed his sixth straight game with a sore right knee. … C Serge Ibaka missed his fifth straight game with tightness in his lower back. Spurs: San Antonio has trailed by at least 10 points in 61% of its games this season and is now 9-16 when facing that deficit. … Popovich does not expect the Spurs to make any trades despite widespread speculation the team will deal one or more of its veterans. If they cannot trade LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio will make him an unrestricted free agent by buying out his remaining contract. … F Rudy Gay missed the game with a sore left foot and G Lonnie Walker IV sat out with a sore right wrist. Popovich said both the injuries are minor and expects both to return soon. Who are the free agents for the next two years? We have the lists. Center Andre Drummond is now a free agent and can sign with a contending team after reaching a buyout with the Cavaliers.","401307464"
"Donovan Mitchell's deep 3-pointer increases the Jazz's lead over the Nets. (0:17) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Donovan Mitchell showed no mercy against a Brooklyn Nets team missing most of its starting lineup. “The biggest thing was trying to be aggressive, get downhill, make plays, get on the rim and finish,” Mitchell said. “That was just my mindset from the jump.” Mitchell scored 27 points and the Utah Jazz routed the short-handed Nets 118-88 on Wednesday night. The Jazz jumped to a 21-point lead in the first quarter against the depleted Nets, who never really threatened to make it a competitive game. “Tonight, we really showed the mental fortitude throughout the entire game to continue keep our foot on the pedal,” Mitchell said. Bojan Bogdanovic, who was mired in a 3-for-25 shooting slump from 3-point range, made 4 of 6 3-point attempts and scored 18 for the Jazz, who have won four of five. “It felt great to see shots go in,” Bogdanovic said. This matchup between Eastern and Western Conference contenders lost some luster when the Nets James Harden was scratched due to a sore neck. He joined teammates Kevin Durant (left hamstring strain) and Kyrie Irving (personal reasons) on the injured list. “We want to play against guys like KD, Kyrie, James Harden — that’s what competitiveness is … but we’re not gonna change how we play or our mindset because those guys aren’t in the game,” Mitchell said. Alize Johnson, who was signed to a 10-day contract on Monday, had a career-high 23 points and 15 rebounds. Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot added 14 for Brooklyn. “That’s a great team. That’s the team with the best record in the league. We went out there severely undermanned. Most importantly, (our players) stuck together and played hard,” Brooklyn coach Steve Nash said. Mitchell made five 3-pointers in three quarters of action. He has increased his efficiency of late, averaging 32.5 points over his last four games. The Jazz played at home for the first time this month. They had slipped from the hottest team in the NBA to one struggling to score and defend. “We had a really tough schedule on the road for the 21 out of 27 days … so we are trying to find a rhythm and play that Jazz basketball that everybody loves,” Bogdanovic said. Utah, which has the best record in the NBA at 32-11, remained stingy on defense while firing 3-pointers from every angle. The Jazz made 23 of 55 from beyond the arc against Brooklyn’s slow defensive rotations. The Nets had won 16 of 18 games despite missing one primary player or another most nights. The latest example was Harden’s 25 points and a career-high 17 assists to power Brooklyn past Portland 116-112 on Tuesday night. But Harden wasn’t on the court against the Jazz and the Nets sorely missed his scoring and playmaking skills Brooklyn shot 35% and had only 19 assists as a team. Harden was engaged in the game, coaching his teammates and even directing a few words toward the officials. Mike Conley scored 10 of his 18 points in the first 4:22 of the game to stake the Jazz to a 16-4 lead. By the end of the quarter, Utah led 38-17. That was a role reversal from Utah’s worst showing of the season on Jan. 5 in Brooklyn, when the Nets led 35-14 on their way to a 130-96 win. Meanwhile, Joe Harris, the lone regular starter for the Nets, played five scoreless minutes and sat for the rest of the game. At halftime, the Jazz led 63-38 – the lowest scoring first half of the season for Brooklyn. Mitchell made a driving layup and 3-pointer to put the Jazz up 78-40 in the third quarter, which was their largest margin over an opponent all season. Even with all their stars, the Nets have struggled defensively this season and relied on their supercharged offense to get their wins. But without their sharpshooters, the Nets’ league-leading .587 effective shooting percentage seemed a distant memory. The Nets have dropped five straight in Utah and their last road victory over the Jazz was 98-96 in 2016. FROM THE PLANE TO THE COURT Johnson joined the Nets in Salt Lake City on Wednesday morning and only had time to go over a few plays and concepts. No one expected the career highlight double-double he posted. “He was great. Stuffed the stat sheet. Played good defense. Had tons of energy. I don’t think he’s really played since the G League bubble. Heck of an effort from him,” Nash said. Johnson wanted to make the most of his opportunity. “(I wanted to) just prove to everybody that I belong here in the NBA. I’ve put in a lot of hard work,” said Johnson, who didn’t have a single play run for him. TIP-INS Nets: Spencer Dinwiddie (partially torn ACL, right knee), Blake Griffin (left knee injury management) and Landry Shamet (right ankle sprain) also sat out. … The loss snapped the Nets’ franchise-record road win streak against Western Conference opponents at nine game (dating to Jan. 29 at Oklahoma City). …. Chris Chiozza, who was inactive for seven straight games, had 10 points and season-high nine assists. Jazz: Joe Ingles was 18 of 22 from 3-point range over the three previous games, which marked the best three-game stretch from outside the arc in NBA history, but Ingles went 1 for 6 from 3-point range Wednesday. … Jazz now have five wire-to-wire wins this season. … After missing his first five 3-pointers, Jordan Clarkson made one in the third quarter to run his streak to 69 games with at least one 3.","401307465"
"With the shot clock running out, De'Aaron Fox knocks down a smooth fadeaway jumper as the buzzer sounds. (0:17) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — De’Aaron Fox scored 37 points, Tyrese Haliburton made a pair of free throws with 36.6 seconds remaining and the Sacramento Kings beat the Atlanta Hawks 110-108 on Wednesday night. Haliburton finished with 17 points and seven assists, Buddy Hield scored 14 and Richaun Holmes had 16 points and eight rebounds. Clint Capella had 25 points and 17 rebounds for the Hawks, who have lost back-to-back games after winning their first eight under interim coach Nate McMillan. Fox shot 13 of 20 and rattled Atlanta’s defense all night. He had 15 points in the first quarter, scored against a trio of Atlanta defenders inside the key with an up-and-under move in the third, then later added a turnaround 19-footer as the shot clock expired. “I was just playing, seeing how they were guarding pick and rolls, how soft they were guarding the ball,” Fox said. “For me, it’s just continuing to try to grow as a player and become more efficient in what I do … and help my team win.” It’s the 10th 30-point game for Fox this season. “It feels like the game is really slowing down for him, which is similar to that pre-injury run we were on with him,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “We’re clearly a better team when he’s playing like that. He’s really finding that comfort level out there and getting to his spots at his pace. ""It’s the shot that he wants to take and that’s what you love to see out of your offensive guys.” McMillan blamed Atlanta’s inconsistent offense and lack of defense. “I thought we really settled on the perimeter, and in that second half we didn’t continue to keep the pressure on their defense,” McMillan said. “Defensively, we never really established our defense where we were getting stops. Fox had his way pretty much most of the night.” As good as Fox was, Haliburton made the difference down the stretch. The 12th overall pick in the draft, Haliburton had a four-point play with 4:58 remaining, then added a 10-foot turnaround jumper. After Young’s 3-pointer tied the score at 108, Haliburton was fouled driving toward the basket and made both free throws. “Tyrese, all season long, he’s got that clutch gene,” Walton said. “You get in those final couple minutes of a game and if he gets a shot you feel pretty comfortable he’s going to make it. He did it again tonight.” Young and Hield exchanged misses before Danilo Gallinari’s shot at the buzzer hit the side of the rim. Before Gallinari’s miss, Fox ran up behind Young and poked the ball out of bounds. “We know what we can do offensively, but for us we know we have to finish games,” Fox said. “Defensively, there’s times when we’re getting nine or 10 stops in a row. For us, it’s just continuing to build on that. You try to sustain that and make that your consistent play.” Fox made eight of his first 11 shots to keep Sacramento in front for most of the first half before Atlanta closed the second quarter on a 10-3 run. John Collins’ alley-oop dunk on a pass from Young capped the run and tied it at 57. TIP-INS Hawks: Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 20 points in his first game back at Golden 1 Center. Bogdanovic spent his first three seasons in Sacramento before signing with the Hawks in the offseason. ... Rajon Rondo was held out because of right adductor soreness.

"Adrian Wojnarowski details what the Heat's approach was in acquiring Victor Oladipo at the trade deadline, while Tim Legler wonders how he will fit into the roster. (1:51) MIAMI -- — CJ McCollum got Portland started, and Damian Lillard provided the finish. Lillard made three free throws with one second remaining for the final margin, and the Trail Blazers survived a wild ending to beat the short-handed Miami Heat 125-122 on Thursday night. Lillard was fouled by Miami’s Trevor Ariza on a 3-point attempt, which the Heat argued to no avail. He coolly sank all three foul shots, and the Blazers snapped a two-game slide. “Sometimes I might have it going, but he's the closer,"" McCollum said of Lillard. Miami didn’t have a time-out remaining to advance the ball and couldn’t get a desperation attempt to tie the game off before time expired. McCollum had 21 of his game-high 35 points in the first quarter for Portland, which got 22 points from Lillard, 20 points from Carmelo Anthony and 18 points to go along with 16 rebounds from Enes Kanter. Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro each had 29 points for Miami, which dropped its fifth straight and fell to 22-23. Kendrick Nunn scored 22 for the Heat. “I was happy with the way we fought out there,"" Herro said. “That was a great game, down to the end and they came down with a couple more free throws."" A combination of trades, illness, injury and virus-related issues left the Heat with nine players for the game. Victor Oladipo and Nemanja Bjelica have yet to join the club after being acquired earlier Thursday in moves that sent Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley to Houston, plus Chris Silva and Moe Harkless to Sacramento. The other Heat absences: Jimmy Butler was sick, Goran Dragic has a back issue and Udonis Haslem and KZ Okpala remain in the league’s health and safety protocols. Portland took a 100-99 lead with 7:57 left on a 3-pointer by Anthony. To that point, neither team had been up by more than eight all night. Miami then went on an 11-0 run to take a 110-100 lead, with Gabe Vincent, Andre Iguodala and Herro all making 3-pointers on consecutive possessions and Herro adding a pair of free throws to cap the spurt. Portland answered with an 11-0 run of its own, taking the lead back on a layup by Lillard with 3:48 left. Back and forth they went the rest of the way, with some team either taking the lead or pulling into a tie eight times in the final 1:44. Lillard got the call from referee Brian Forte at the end, and Portland got the win. “Brian saw it one way, we see it another way,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I think it was a great game and a buzzkill way to end it. I think everybody wanted to see overtime, but Lillard's also a great player. He puts a lot of pressure on you."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: McCollum now has five quarters with at least 21 points in his career, including a 28-point first quarter against Chicago in 2018.

"RJ Barrett flies to the bucket and drops in a tough layup while drawing a foul. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — Alec Burks scored 15 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter and the New York Knicks beat the Washington Wizards 106-102 on Thursday night to sweep the two-game set. RJ Barrett added 24 points, 10 rebounds and five assists for the Knicks. Immanuel Quickley had 16 points. Two days after being in control throughout in a 131-113 victory, the Knicks trailed by 17 midway through the third quarter and never led until the fourth. “The defense was much better in the second half and then the fourth quarter I thought we were making the right plays,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “We had a good rhythm. A lot of guys stepped up.” They won by outscoring the Wizards 39-24 in the final period, with Barrett making a 3-pointer and then a tying three-point play with 4:45 to play. Quickley followed with a 3-pointer and Julius Randle capped an 11-0 run that put New York ahead 96-91 with 2:54 remaining. “Even though Thibs is always yelling the whole time, when you really talk to him he always just talks about staying poised, understanding how long the game is,” Knicks center Taj Gibson said. “Even on tough nights, just work the game.” Bradley Beal had 26 points and nine assists for the Wizards, but shot just 8 for 23. Russell Westbrook missed all eight shots in the second half and ended a dismal 3 for 15, and the poor shooting of their starting guards helped the Knicks surge ahead. “I thought we were having a real physical mindset and in that fourth quarter we kind of let up and made some critical mistakes,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. “And when you do that, they make 3s.” Westbrook finished with 13 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists, but had eight turnovers. Rui Hachimura had 21 points and nine rebounds as the Wizards lost for the eighth time in nine games. The Wizards led by five after one, then scored the first 10 of the second to open a 35-20 lead on Raul Neto’s steal and layup. Washington pushed the lead to 17 later in the period and took a 60-45 advantage to the break. The Knicks missed their first eight 3-pointers before Quickley made one midway through the second quarter. But New York turned it around after halftime, cutting it to 11 after three. “I think we played hard this game but we just have to be smarter,” Hachimura said. Randle, who got treatment on his leg during the game, finished with 13 points on 5-for-16 shooting. TIP-INS Wizards: The Wizards landed Chandler Hutchison and Daniel Gafford from Chicago in a three-way deal that included Boston. General manager Tommy Sheppard said both players were expected to be in for physicals Friday and hopefully be in uniform for Washington on Saturday. Hutchinson hasn't played since Feb. 5 after missing 10 games for coronavirus protocol reasons earlier in the season, but Sheppard said the swingman was expecting to suit up for the Bulls in their game Saturday against San Antonio had he still been there. Knicks: The Knicks won the season series over the Wizards for the first time since the 2013-14 season. ... New York was without starting swingman Reggie Bullock because of a sprained right ankle. Derrick Rose remained out as he recovers from the coronavirus. WISHFUL WIZARDS The Wizards were hit hard by coronavirus absences and stoppages early in the season and entered play 13th in the Eastern Conference. But that was only 3 1/2 games out of a spot in the play-in and Sheppard said they still have high expectations. “You couldn't foresee what happened to this team,” Sheppard said. “Certainly I’m not making any excuses. That’s something we had to experience, go through and deal with, and it’s something that certainly hurt us in the win column. But we move forward.”","401307468"
"Reggie Jackson buries a corner triple over Jakob Poeltl to put the finishing touches on the Clippers' win over the Spurs. (0:17) SAN ANTONIO -- — The Los Angeles Clippers overcame a tough loss off the court with their fourth straight victory despite missing a big part of their bench. Reggie Jackson scored 28 points, Paul George had 24 points and 13 rebounds and the short-handed Clippers rallied in the second half to beat the San Antonio Spurs 98-85 on Thursday night. The victory came hours after the Clippers traded Lou Williams to the Atlanta Hawks for Rajon Rondo just hours before tipoff. “It’s a tough loss, it hurts,” George said. “You hate to see these things happen. We’re going to miss Lou. The best way we can do this, to send him off well, is to go out and try to win it (all).” They started that campaign by handing San Antonio its fourth straight loss, including the first three of a nine-game homestand. DeMar DeRozan had 23 points, and Dejounte Murray added 18 for the Spurs. San Antonio was attempting to rebound from a 134-101 loss to Los Angeles on Wednesday night, but could not do so even with the Clippers missing five key players. Los Angeles also was without Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka and Patrick Beverley due to injury. Leonard and Morris were ruled out less than two hours prior to tipoff. Terence Mann, who started in place of Leonard, had 10 points and 12 rebounds in 32 minutes. Despite those absences, the Clippers led for much of the first half and recaptured the lead in the final minutes of the third quarter. Los Angeles coach Tyronn Lue said he looked down at his bench during a sluggish start and told his assistants this is when he would want Williams. “He’s going to be missed for everything he brought and not just basketball,” Lue said. “I just think he was a great person. That’s what I love the most. We all knew he was a great basketball player, but just him as a human being and what he stood for and how he always boosted the morale of the team with everyone around him. That’s what we are going to miss the most.” Los Angeles held San Antonio to 30 points in the second half. “We are not shooting well, obviously, and we started to turn it over a little bit, which kind of exacerbates the situation,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “But we are not getting 3s. In this league, you got to get ’em. And, overall, too many mental errors here and there.” RONDO’S ROLE Lue said he is unsure if Rondo will join the starting unit or come off the bench once he joins the Clippers. “We’ve got to get everybody together, get everyone healthy,” Lue said. “Just trying to see what works. It’s going to take some time. Just not sure right now.” While Mann is sad to lose Williams, he said he is excited to play alongside Rondo. Mann carries Rondo’s rookie card in his wallet at all times. Mann was given the card the same day he was named to the A team on his travel team, so he considers Rondo’s rookie card a good-luck charm. SAYING FAREWELL The Spurs held a moment of silence for former coach Stan Albeck. He died Thursday at the age of 89. “Coach Albeck wasn’t just important to the Spurs, he was what I call a lifer,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “People like myself don’t come close to loving the game the way he did.” Albeck coached San Antonio from 1980 to 1983. He also had head coaching stops with Chicago, Cleveland, New Jersey and the ABA’s Denver Rockets. TIP-INS Clippers: Leonard and Morris were not listed on the team’s injury report prior to the game. Leonard sat out with a sore right foot and Morris had a bruised right calf. … Using an eight-man rotation, Los Angeles got 19 points from reserves Nicolas Batum, Luke Kennard and Amir Coffey. … Clippers are 8-0 in the second game of a back-to-back this season.

Aldridge appeared in 376 games for the Spurs, averaging 19.5 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.25 blocks. … San Antonio acquired Marquese Chriss and cash from Golden State for the rights to Cady Lalanne.

"Dwight Howard gets ejected after an altercation with Montrezl Harrell. Then, prior to the second quarter, Doc Rivers reacts to the ejection and isn't a fan of what happened. (0:40) LOS ANGELES -- — Danny Green hit eight 3-pointers and scored 28 points against his former team, and the Philadelphia 76ers weathered Los Angeles' late rally for their fourth straight victory, 109-101 over the slumping Lakers on Thursday night. Seth Curry scored 19 points and Tobias Harris added 17 for the Eastern Conference-leading Sixers, who have won 10 of 11 overall and seven of eight without injured All-Star Joel Embiid. Green hit six 3-pointers in the first 2 1/2 quarters and added a game-clincher with 30.4 seconds to play in the type of superb shooting performance he rarely achieved during his sole season with the Lakers, where he averaged 8.0 points over 89 starts. “Got a chance to see some of my brothers, compete against them, and there’s nothing better to come out with a win,” Green said. Green received his championship ring from the Lakers before the game along with Dwight Howard, who then got ejected after the first quarter. Green won back-to-back titles with Toronto and Los Angeles, but he still hasn't collected his 2019 ring from the Raptors because of the pandemic. When asked why he played so well against the team that traded him, Green replied: “Coincidence? Possibly. Probably.” The Lakers traded Green in the offseason to acquire Dennis Schröder, who had 20 points and a season-high 11 assists in Los Angeles' fourth consecutive loss. Playing without superstars LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Lakers are on their second four-game skid since mid-February. Kyle Kuzma scored 25 points and Montrezl Harrell added 20, but the defending NBA champions remained winless since James sprained his ankle last Sunday. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 19 points. “We’re not trying to just hold on,” Harrell said. “We’re trying to compete, play the right way and win some basketball games. We’re in a tough patch right now. We’ve lost a couple of games, but we’re not going to stop, and we’re going to fight.” Philadelphia led by 18 points in the second half after dominating the third quarter, but the Lakers made a late 18-6 run to trim the margin to 102-98 with 2:20 to play. Los Angeles got within three points in the final minute before Green beat the shot clock with a sideline 3-pointer to ice it. “Each of the last three or four games, we’ve had one really bad quarter,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “We need to prevent that and play a 48-minute night. We’re just having a stretch where we make some poor decisions and miss some assignments on the defensive end.” TIP-INS 76ers: They acquired George Hill from Oklahoma City and Ignas Brazdeikis from New York in a three-team trade, parting with Tony Bradley, Terrance Ferguson, Vincent Poirier, the rights to Emir Preldžic and a slew of draft picks. Hill is averaging 11.8 points per game for the Thunder with 38.6% 3-point shooting. “I think he's going to be great for us,” said Green, Hill's former teammate in San Antonio. ... Curry returned from a three-game absence with an ankle injury. Lakers: They failed to block a shot for the first time since Feb. 10, 2018, ending a streak of 224 straight games. ... The team played a tribute video and held a pregame moment of silence for Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor, who died Monday. ... Marc Gasol had five points in his first game for the Lakers since February following a nine-game absence under the NBA’s health and safety protocols. DWIGHT TOSSED Howard’s ejection prematurely ended his first game after collecting his ring. The journeyman center scored six points in the first quarter but was called for two separate technical fouls related to his lively battle in the paint with Harrell. “It was a very selfish play,” Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers sid. “You’ve got one tech. You can’t get another one. We just have to have better discipline. I get it. There’s a lot of emotion, but we had one center on our team, and he got thrown out. I know there’s emotion, but he’s a veteran. Got to have better discipline.” FANS IN STANDS The Lakers had a few dozen fans in the Staples Center stands for the first time this season after getting permission from the Los Angeles County Health Department to welcome no more than 50 people. The fans mostly watched quietly.","401307470"
"Kelly Oubre Jr. says he can't predict his future with the Warriors beyond this season. (1:27) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — A few moments before coming out of Sacramento's blowout win over the Golden State Warriors, point guard De’Aaron Fox kept hearing his teammates urge him to continue shooting. “They were like, ‘Go get 50,'"" Fox said. “I’m like, ‘Let’s just get this game over with. There’s other opportunities for this to happen.’ That’s what I said. I wasn’t looking for a career high but if the shots were there, take them.” Fox had a career-best 44 points as the Kings romped to a 141-119 victory against a short-handed Warriors team Thursday night. The mercurial Fox shot 16 of 22 and added seven assists, continuing his two-week scoring surge. He's topped 40 points twice this season and poured in 30 or more in six of his last 10 games. He is averaging 30.7 points during that span. “It’s fun to watch, it really is,” Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. “To see him continue to figure things out, to see him continue to grow as a leader both vocally and leading by example with his play, is a lot of fun. He’s in a good place right now. When De’Aaron is playing like this, we’re a pretty good team.” Tyrese Haliburton added 21 points with a career-high six 3-pointers, and Richaun Holmes had 25 points and 11 rebounds for the Kings. Buddy Hield scored 16. Sacramento has won five of six. Andrew Wiggins had 26 points for the Warriors. Kelly Oubre Jr. and Nico Mannion scored 19 apiece. Golden State beat Sacramento by 31 points in January. This time, the Warriors were missing two of their stars. Stephen Curry sat out his fourth straight game with a bruised tailbone. Draymond Green also was held out after waking up feeling ill. “Draymond did not come to shootaround and is not feeling well at all right now,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said before the game. Haliburton put the Kings up by 22 late in the third quarter with a double step-back move that left Damion Lee flailing before the Sacramento rookie sank a 3-pointer and was fouled. Haliburton also made a four-point play a night earlier against Atlanta. Oubre’s 3-pointer cut the gap to 111-100, but the Warriors couldn’t get any closer. Fox made consecutive 3s, then added a pair of free throws to extend the margin to 18. “It’s just continuing to stay in attack mode early and often,” Fox said. “Not try to force anything but attack the basket, look for open guys, try to score on all three levels. I feel like no matter who it is I can pretty much get to the basket. Once you see the ball go through the basket a couple times, it definitely helps to shoot jumpers after that.” Oubre felt the Warriors struggled after falling behind. “Fox is obviously on a tear right now,” said Oubre, who played AAU ball with Fox while both were growing up in Houston. “He’s the fastest point guard in the league. It’s hard to stop that when we’re on our heels the whole game.” KINGS MOVES Sacramento made a flurry of moves just ahead of the NBA trade deadline, acquiring Delon Wright from the Detroit Pistons and forwards Moe Harkless and Chris Silva from the Miami Heat. Additionally, the Kings obtained guard Terence Davis from the Toronto Raptors for a 2021 second-round draft pick. The Kings sent Cory Joseph and a pair of second-round picks to the Pistons, while Nemanja Bjelica was dealt to the Heat. WARRIORS MOVES Golden State traded center Marquese Chriss and cash to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for the draft rights to center Cady Lalanne. The Warriors also sent guard Brad Wanamaker, a 2022 second-round pick and cash to Charlotte for the Hornets’ second-round pick in 2025. DUBS VACCINATED Kerr said about 12 players and coaches, including Green, received the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday at Kaiser Permanente near Chase Center in San Francisco. “So I was very happy to receive mine,” Kerr said. “Just the one shot, which is great.” Kerr is encouraged by this “important” step in the process of returning to somewhat normal living as soon as possible. “It’s important for us. We’ve been really hit hard just by COVID protocols obviously as a team, so it’ll be nice to get as many guys as possible vaccinated and hopefully not have any more issues in terms of missing games, but more importantly is just the general health and welfare of not only our guys but everybody. The more people who can get vaccinated out there the better so we can build herd immunity and move past everything as a society.” TIP-INS Warriors: Mychal Mulder was held out because of illness. Kings: Fox’s previous career high was 43 points against New Orleans on Jan. 17. … Kyle Guy scored a career-best 17 points.","401307471"
"Kyle Lowry tries to score a layup just before halftime, but Isaiah Stewart shuts the shot attempt down as he gets a block against the backboard. (0:18) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Wayne Ellington scored 25 points and the Detroit Pistons beat the virus-depleted Toronto Raptors 129-105 on Wednesday night to snap a three-game losing streak. Ellington was 8 of 11 from 3-point range and the Pistons were 20 for 41 overall from long range. Detroit’s backups had 56 points, with Rodney McGruder and Saben Lee each finishing with 20. Starting guard Dennis Smith Jr. put up 10 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists. Norman Powell had 36 points for Toronto, and Kyle Lowry added 21 points. The Raptors played without Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby, three of their top four scorers, and reserves Malachi Flynn and Patrick McCaw because of the NBA's health and safety protocols. Coach Nick Nurse and most of his staff also were held out. The biggest voids were on defense and rebounding. “We had a practice yesterday to try to regroup a little bit and it was really a pretty good practice,"" said Sergio Scariolo, who directed the Raptors for the second time in Nurse's absence. “But no excuses. We had enough players and coaches to have played a better game than this one.” The Pistons shot 53% and had a 49-34 rebound advantage. “We should have had more patience and selected better shots,” Scariolo said, “but you have to give credit to the Pistons. They played good defense and they moved the ball really well.” Smith felt best about the rebound element of his triple double. “My thing as of late has been trying to get to the ball and making a play to help us win,” he said. “We were making shots tonight and we kept the energy in the game from start to finish. I think that was the main thing.” Lee and fellow rookie Isaiah Stewart had two field goals each on a 15-0 run that lifted the Pistons to a 14-point lead early in the second quarter. Lee added six more points on a 15-5 spurt to put Detroit up 101-80 with 11:54 left. The game was originally scheduled for Tuesday night, but postponed because of the Raptors’ COVID outbreak.
