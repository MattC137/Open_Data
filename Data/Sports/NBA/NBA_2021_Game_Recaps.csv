"Jae'Sean Tate drives towards the basket, goes behind the back and slams home the impressive dunk. (0:21) James Harden was back in a Houston uniform. It’s still unclear how many more times that’ll happen. The three-time defending NBA scoring champion made his preseason debut with the Rockets on Tuesday night, after starting to practice with his team just one day earlier following a late arrival to training camp amid incessant trade speculation. Harden scored 12 points in 21 minutes and the Rockets beat the San Antonio Spurs 112-98. Harden also had four assists, three rebounds and two steals. He checked out for the final time with 5:02 left in the third quarter, having missed his final four shots. John Wall and Ben McLemore each had 15 points for the Rockets, who got 11 points apiece from Eric Gordon and Jae’Sean Tate and 11 rebounds from DeMarcus Cousins. As expected, Wall and Harden were the starters in the Houston backcourt. “It can be really good,"" first-year Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. “To have two dynamic ballhandlers on the floor who can do a bunch of different things, play off each other, create for each other, it can be really, really good."" Harden was not planning to address reporters after the game. “Just happy to see him back out there on the floor,"" McLemore said. Lonnie Walker IV scored 17 for the Spurs, who got 13 points, seven assists and five rebounds from Dejounte Murray. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 12, while Rudy Gay and Devin Vassell each added 11 for San Antonio. Harden seemed anything but disinterested to start his first live game action of the season. He stood immediately to the right of Silas in the pregame huddle, his eyes staring intently at whatever the coach was sketching on a dry-erase clipboard before taking the floor. Harden's first shot was a made straightaway 3-pointer and his second attempt led to him getting fouled from beyond the arc and making three free throws. So, his shooting touch was there, at least at the outset — as was his touch on passes. He connected with Danuel House on a three-quarter-court chest pass to set up a dunk late in the opening quarter, timing clearly not much of an issue after a couple months off. Harden went 3 for 10 from the field, including 2 for 6 from 3-point range. He also went 4 for 5 at the free-throw line. “I thought our young guys played him pretty wisely,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “I think we fouled him one time on a 3-point shot, but that's going to happen with him. He's pretty clever. We were better on him than we were John Wall. I thought John Wall got by us much too often."" Wall said he isn't recruiting Harden to stay in Houston, focusing instead on how they can work best together as teammates now. “He's going to do what's best for him. ... I don't try to ask him about that because that's his personal business,"" Wall said. The Rockets lost guard Chris Clemons with 9:58 left, after he was taken off the court in a wheelchair. Clemons made a 3-pointer for an 87-74 Houston lead, and after retreating to the defensive end for the ensuing possession, appeared to take a bad step and immediately began reaching for his right Achilles area. There was no immediate diagnosis of Clemons’ injury, but given his reaction when it happened and as he was being wheeled off the floor it was reasonable to think that the Rockets were bracing for bad news. “Right when it happened, I knew exactly what it was,"" said Wall, who has dealt with Achilles surgery himself. There are four games Wednesday, followed by seven on Thursday, eight on Friday and then three in the preseason finales Saturday. The regular season begins on Dec. 22. Tuesday’s games: 76ERS 108, CELTICS 99 At Philadelphia, Shake Milton scored 19 points, Joel Embiid added 18 and Tobias Harris finished with 16 points and a game-high nine rebounds for the 76ers in the preseason opener for both clubs. Ben Simmons had 10 points and six assists for Philadelphia. Jeff Teague scored 18 for Boston. He shot 7 for 9 on a night where some Celtics struggled mightily from the field; Jaylen Brown made his first shot and went 0 for 10 the rest of the way, and Jayson Tatum finished just 4 for 13. Payton Pritchard had 12 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter for Boston. Tatum finished with 10 points.","401265849"

"Duncan Robinson knocks down a Christmas Day record-tying seven 3-pointers to help the Heat beat the Pelicans. (1:10) MIAMI -- — Erik Spoelstra remained perfect on Christmas, and a record-tying show from Duncan Robinson helped him stay that way. Robinson made seven 3-pointers — tying the Christmas single-game mark — and scored 23 points, helping the Heat beat the New Orleans Pelicans 111-98 to start the NBA’s holiday quintupleheader Friday. “It's super special to play in Christmas,"" Robinson said. “I certainly don't take it for granted."" Goran Dragic scored 18 points, Bam Adebayo had 17 and Avery Bradley finished with 12 for Miami, and Spoelstra improved his Christmas record as Heat coach to 8-0. “I wasn't even aware of that,"" Spoelstra said. “Just shows you that we've had some really good teams here and teams that have had the opportunity to play on Christmas."" Precious Achiuwa and Tyler Herro each scored 11 for Miami, which lost Jimmy Butler at halftime with right ankle stiffness. Zion Williamson had 32 points and 14 rebounds in 38 minutes for New Orleans — the rebounds and minutes both being career highs. Brandon Ingram finished with 28 points. But the Pelicans shot 40% to Miami’s 51%. “We made some defensive mistakes that we shouldn't have,"" said Josh Hart, who scored 12 for New Orleans. “Lack of communication. We've got to communicate better on the defensive end."" Robinson’s seven 3s tied the Christmas mark Ingram set last year. “The guy is a great, great shooter. He's going to have nights like that,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “But at least three of them were ones where we could have done a better job."" JJ Redick’s 3-pointer with 7:43 left cut Miami’s lead to 91-85 and came during a stretch when the Heat went five minutes without a field goal. But the Pelicans got no closer. The Heat restored order by scoring 11 of the game’s next 13 points, and when Achiuwa — the rookie who had strong defensive minutes — forced Williamson into a turnover with 3:55 left, the entire Miami bench rose in celebration. “We knew they would make a run, but we stayed composed,"" Dragic said. New Orleans led 17-9 midway through the opening quarter — and got outscored 52-21 by Miami over the next 13½ minutes, with the Heat hitting nine of their 13 first-half 3s in that span on the way to a 23-point lead. The Pelicans chipped away, getting within 66-53 at the half and 88-79 after three. But New Orleans shot only 30% in the final quarter and Ingram went scoreless in those 12 minutes after playing the entire third period. Van Gundy lamented playing Ingram so much in the third. “Probably not optimal play-calling on my part, either,"" Van Gundy said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson's previous career high was 34 minutes. ... Redick fouled out for the second time in 898 career regular-season games, and missed six of his seven shots. ... The Pelicans are now 1/3 on Christmas. Heat: Andre Iguodala started the second half for Butler. ... Miami improved to 11-2 on Christmas. It hadn’t played on the holiday since beating New Orleans in 2015, and hasn’t lost on Dec. 25 since 2007. SEASON’S GREETINGS Heat forward Moe Harkless this week helped pay rent for about 50 New York families in dire economic circumstances this holiday season, plus covered lost wages and other essential expenses. “Means the world to me,” Harkless said. COMING HOME Veteran ref John Goble was crew chief and got to be home for Christmas; he’s a Miami native. Marc Davis (lives in Chicago, crew chief Friday in Milwaukee) and John Goble (lives in Connecticut, crew chief Friday in Boston) also got to work near home for Christmas.","401266794"
"Kawhi Leonard goes for 23 points and Paul George adds 21 in the Clippers' 121-108 win vs. the Nuggets. (2:21) DENVER -- — Kawhi Leonard was hurt and the Denver Nuggets were mounting a rally like they did three months ago. This time, the Los Angeles Clippers didn’t allow Denver to complete the comeback. Leonard had 21 points before taking an elbow to the face in the fourth quarter, Paul George scored 23 points and had nine assists, and Los Angeles beat the Nuggets 121-108 on Friday night. It was the second straight big win for LA, which beat the Lakers on Tuesday night. “We’re a different team than last year,” George said. The Clippers led by 11 with 6:11 left Friday night when Serge Ibaka went up for a rebound and caught the side of his teammate’s face with his right elbow. Leonard lay bleeding on the court before walking to the locker room. “He got up and walked off the floor, so he’s going to be good,” LA coach Tyronn Lue said. Leonard was ruled out shortly thereafter and was being evaluated postgame, but it did put a scare into George. “Really worried. I was thinking the worst,” George said. “I didn’t know if he was concussed or what actually happened, I just saw him laying on the ground. That was first and foremost, making sure he was OK.” The Clippers didn’t need Leonard to close out a Nuggets team that upset them in the second round of the Western Conference semifinals last season. Nikola Jokic finished with 24 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds for Denver, which has dropped its first two games of the season. Jamal Murray added 23 points, 13 coming in the fourth. The Nuggets rallied from double-digit second-half deficits in Games 5, 6 and 7 of the second-round series in September, winning all three and wiping out LA’s 3-1 lead to advance to the Western Conference finals. It was a surprising end for a team many thought could beat the Lakers and advance to the NBA Finals. George said he has put that disappointment in the past. “I buried last year, left last year in the bubble,” he said. “This is a new season, new team, new goals, new everything. I was ready and poised and confident coming into this year, and I was prepared coming into this season.” Denver wasn’t able to do it again but made a run after trailing by 24 late in the third quarter. The Nuggets used an 11-0 run into early in the fourth, and two 3-pointers by Murray sliced a 98-74 deficit to 106-95 with 7:35 left. “When you’re down 25, it’s about pride and about effort,” Murray said. “We wanted to play hard and let the lead take care of itself. We saw the lead chip away like we did in the playoffs, we just couldn’t get over the hump.” Leonard went out soon after but Denver never got the deficit under 10. “They made a run, we lost Kawhi so we could have lost our composure, lost our game, but we took a good timeout,” Nicolas Batum said. “We kept moving the ball and made big shots.” TIP-INS Clippers: F Marcus Morris (sore right knee) missed his second straight game, but coach Lue said he is day-to-day. “He’s been doing his own rehab with the sports science team and he’s progressing,” Lue said. Nuggets: F JaMychal Green sat out with a left calf strain. Green, who played for the Clippers last season, has yet to play in the regular season after signing with Denver in the short offseason. SCROOGED AGAIN Denver was playing on Christmas night for the second straight season, with both ending in double-digit losses. Last year the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Nuggets 112-100 in Denver, stopping a seven-game winning streak. “Two years in a row we weren’t ready to play on Christmas night,” coach Michael Malone said. “Bah humbug.”","401266795"

"Steph Curry drains a 3-pointer in the second quarter to pass Rick Barry for second on Golden State's all-time scoring list. (0:23) MILWAUKEE -- — Khris Middleton scored 31 points and the Milwaukee Bucks routed the Golden State Warriors 138-99 on Friday to win their first Christmas Day home game in over half a century. Middleton went 10 of 15 overall and 6 for 8 from 3-point range, leading a strong performance from deep for his team. He totaled 58 points in his first two games of the season. “The weeks before the season, I just tried to put in good work, work on my game,” Middleton said. “So far, it's been working for me.” Milwaukee was 20 of 37 on 3-point attempts, while Golden State was 10 of 45. The Warriors were outscored by 65 points in their first two games, the second-highest total in NBA history through two games to 71 points for the 1987-88 Clippers. Golden State lost 125-99 at Brooklyn in its season opener. This was the second-most lopsided score of any Christmas Day game in NBA history. The Syracuse Nationals beat the New York Knicks 162-100 on Dec. 25, 1960. “The thing I was most disappointed in is we just had two good days of practice with our execution working on getting in our offense and making hard cuts and reads, and we did not execute much of anything,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “It was kind of scattered and disorganized. I'm disappointed in that. I've got to take the blame for that. I'm the head coach.” Milwaukee's only other Christmas home game came during the franchise’s inaugural season in 1968. The Bucks were on the road for Christmas the last two seasons, losing at Philadelphia in 2019 and winning at New York in 2018. Bucks players got a Christmas surprise before the game when they received videotaped messages from their families in a move orchestrated by team officials. “It was definitely the best gift that I got today,” Bucks guard Jrue Holiday said. Then they went out and delivered a dominant performance to bounce back from a season-opening  122-121 loss at Boston  in which Celtics star Jayson Tatum banked in a go-ahead 3-pointer and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo missed a potential tying free throw in the final second. Antetkounmpo had 15 points and 13 rebounds against Golden State, but the two-time reigning NBA MVP shot 4 of 15 from the floor and 7 of 15 from the foul line. Stephen Curry scored 19 points for Golden State, and rookie James Wiseman had 18. Andrew Wiggins had 12. Jordan Poole and Brad Wanamaker added 11 each. Donte DiVincenzo and D.J. Augustin each scored 13 for Milwaukee. Holiday had 12 and Bobby Portis added 10. TIP-INS Warriors: F Draymond Green sat out for the second straight game because of a sore right foot. … This marked the 12th time Kerr was part of a Christmas Day game. He has played in five and coached in seven. … The Warriors dropped to 13-17 in Christmas Day games. This was their eighth straight Christmas Day appearance. Bucks: Augustin made his Bucks debut after sitting out the Celtics game due to a strained left calf. The 33-year-old Augustin signed with the Bucks last month after spending the last four seasons with Orlando. CURRY MILESTONE WATCH Curry increased his career points total to 16,458, overtaking Rick Barry (16,447) to move into second place on the Warriors' list. Wilt Chamberlain holds the franchise record after scoring 17,783 points for the Warriors. Curry was 2 of 10 from 3-point range to give him 2,499 career 3-pointers. The two-time MVP is looking to join Ray Allen (2,973) and Reggie Miller (2,560) as the only NBA players to make at least 2,500 3-pointers. Curry went 5 of 5 from the line to extend his streak of consecutive successful free-throw attempts to 55. He is chasing Barry's franchise record of 60 straight from 1976-77.","401266797"
"Jayson Tatum hits the tough fade away 3-pointer with Kyrie Irving right on him as the shot clock expires. (0:29) BOSTON -- — Kyrie Irving scored 37 points with eight assists in his return to Boston and Kevin Durant added 29 for Brooklyn on Friday to lead the Nets to a 123-95 victory over the Celtics. Jarrett Allen added 11 rebounds for the Nets, who remained perfect so far this season and sent Boston to its first loss. Irving was 7 of 10 from 3-point range in his first regular-season game at TD Garden since he opted out of his Celtics contract in 2019. “We’re going to continue to see them. We’re in the same division,” Irving said, adding that there was “nothing added” to his motivation in playing his former team. Jaylen Brown scored 27 with eight rebounds for the Celtics and Jayson Tatum had 20 points and eight boards. The Celtics beat Milwaukee in their opener on Wednesday on Tatum's last-second shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo, but they couldn't do it again in their second straight matchup against a team expected to contend in the Eastern Conference this season. “The benefit of playing these two games against two other great teams is that it forces you to be better,"" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. ""It tests you to see where you’re at, it sets the bar, and now you know what you have to strive for.” The game began after a moment of silence for former Celtics player and coach K.C. Jones, who died earlier Friday. Durant scored 16 points in the third quarter, when the Nets outscored Boston 35-23 to turn a three-point deficit into an 86-77 lead. He scored nine straight Brooklyn points at the beginning of the third when the Nets took the lead for good. ""It’s still impressive to watch after all these years,"" Nets coach Steve Nash said. “For him to have little runs like that is nothing in his mind. For mere mortals in the NBA, it’s impossible to think of.” Boston led by three at the half before being outscored 35-23 in the third quarter, including a 9-0 run that turned a three-point edge into a 82-70 lead. It was 86-79 early in the fourth when the Nets, even with Irving and Durant on the bench, again scored nine in a row to open a 16-point lead. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn has beaten the Warriors with Klay Thompson and Draymond Green sitting out and the Celtics with Kemba Walker injured. “We just need to stay hungry. This means nothing,” Nash said. ... It was Durant’s 10th visit to the TD Garden in 14 seasons -- his fewest in any NBA city. Celtics: Jeff Teague was perfect from 3-point range in the exhibition season and 4 for 4 in the regular season opener before missing his first in the third quarter on Friday. ... Tatum scored zero points in the first quarter and 12 in the second. ... Tatum’s passed Walter McCarty and moved into eighth place on the Celtics’ all-time 3-pointer list, with (418). Isaiah Thomas is seventh with 460 and Paul Pierce is first with 1,823. ... Celtics coach Brad Stevens was called for a technical foul arguing about a foul call against Daniel Theis in the second quarter.","401266798"
"LeBron James jokes about how he has to drink wine to alter his free throw shooting, especially after an air ball at the line tonight. (0:44) LOS ANGELES -- — When LeBron James checked the stat sheet as he left the Staples Center court after his latest high-scoring Christmas victory, he realized the Lakers had scored 138 points with a mere 22 from him. The NBA champions already look like they could be even better this year. In their second game of the new season, even Luka Doncic didn't stand a chance of keeping up. Anthony Davis scored 28 points and James became the second-leading Christmas scorer in NBA history during the Los Angeles Lakers' 138-115 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. Montrezl Harrell scored 17 of his 22 points in the second half, and Dennis Schröder had 18 points and six assists in a second strong game for both new additions to the champs. Los Angeles outrebounded Dallas 53-27 and closed out its first win of the season with a dominant fourth quarter. “We have the ability to where we can have four, maybe even five guys that can score in the 20s any given night,” James said. “As long as we defend and we’re efficient, it’s a beautiful thing to see.” Doncic had 27 points and seven assists in his first starring role in the NBA’s showcase Christmas evening game for Dallas. Josh Richardson and Trey Burke had 17 points apiece as the Mavs started 0-2 with a late fade. Dallas' three offensive rebounds were fewer than Harrell, who had five. “You can’t win a game where the second-chance points are 35-0,” Doncic said. “It’s as simple as that. We box out, we win the game."" The Lakers were aggressive and accurate from the opening tip, taking a 69-57 halftime lead while hitting 61.4% of their shots. Doncic went 3 for 10 in the first half but combined with Burke for 22 points in the third quarter to keep it close. “The more we play with each other, the more we’re going to figure things out,” Davis said. “We prided ourselves on not losing two in a row last year, so we wanted to come out and make sure we do that.” HOLIDAY CHEERS James moved into second place behind Kobe Bryant for the most points scored on Christmas, passing Oscar Robertson in the third quarter. James has 383 points in 15 games on Christmas, while Bryant had 395 in 16 holiday appearances. TIP-INS Mavericks: Kristaps Porzingis is on the Mavericks’ trip while recovering from knee surgery in October. Coach Rick Carlisle said the Latvian big man is “making progress all the time. I’m confident in saying it’s weeks, not months (before his return, but that’s all I’m going to tell you. He has a ways to go.” ... This was Dallas' only scheduled meeting with the Lakers this season. Lakers: Davis was accidentally elbowed in the face by Burke in the first quarter. He had a split lip, but stayed in. ... ESPN reported Schröder has already opened contract extension talks with LA, and the German guard confirmed he would “love to” sign a long-term deal: “It's just got to be fair on both sides.” ... Wesley Matthews, Marc Gasol and Alfonzo McKinnie all scored their first points for the Lakers after going scoreless in the opener. ... They wore powder-blue warmups over their silver-on-white Christmas uniforms with blue accents.","401266799"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo says he's upset he missed the tying free throw but hopes to learn from it moving forward. (1:29) BOSTON -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn't stop Jayson Tatum from knocking down a “tough, tough, tough” shot. Then the reigning MVP and defensive player of the year missed one of the easiest. Tatum banked in a fallaway, go-ahead 3-pointer in the final second, and Antetokounmpo missed a potential tying free throw with 0.4 seconds left, allowing the Boston Celtics to escape with a 122-121 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night in the teams' season opener. “Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be in that position,” said Tatum, who scored 30 points. “If it goes down or not, that’s what I work so hard for. You just want to be in that moment.” Jaylen Brown scored 33 points for Boston, which entered the fourth quarter leading by 17 points. The Celtics trailed 120-119 when Tatum dribbled the clock down from 8.9 seconds before lofting a high-arcing 3 over Antetokounmpo  that kissed the glass on its way down. “I think aside from the ball going in the basket, I’m not sure we could have defended Tatum much better than we did,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I thought Giannis did a great job individually, great contest. Credit to Tatum, he banked in a 3 at the end of the clock.” Antetokounmpo called it a “tough, tough, tough 3.” Tatum said the glass wasn't really part of the plan. “Once I let it go I knew it was going to hit the backboard,” he said. “But I didn’t necessarily try.” The ensuing inbounds pass was thrown at the rim and Antetokounmpo tried to tip it in, but he was fouled. He made the first foul shot, but bounced the second off the front of the rim. “Obviously, there’s a bit of a weight on your shoulder because you know if you miss, that’s it for your team,"" said Antetokounmpo, who scored 18 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter. “I’m a winner. I want to do whatever it takes for my team to win. But you learn from every situation that basketball puts you in.” Khris Middleton had 27 points and 14 rebounds and big offseason acquisition Jrue Holiday scored 25 points for Milwaukee. The Bucks had the best record in the NBA in each of the past two seasons but didn’t make it out of the Eastern Conference finals. Milwaukee led by nine points, 48-39, midway through the second quarter before Boston rolled off 10 straight points and 19 of the next 23. Boston led 101-84 after three, but Antetokounmpo outscored the Celtics 10-2 over a two-minute span midway through the fourth to cut a 10-point Celtics lead to 109-107. “We took a good hit and kept ticking,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. TOMMY POINT The Celtics observed a moment of silence for Tommy Heinsohn before the game and played a tribute video at the first break for the player, coach and broadcaster who was with the team for more than 60 years and all 17 of its NBA titles. Heinsohn, who died last month at the age of 86, won eight championships in nine years as a Celtics player from 1956-65. He won three more titles as a coach and was the fourth person inducted in the basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. The Celtics lowered eight of their championship banners courtside, picking the ones they deemed to have special meaning to Heinsohn. TIP-INS Bucks: During the game, the Bucks exercised their fourth-year team option on guard Donte DiVincenzo for the 2021-22 season. DiVincenzo had 15 points and five assists. Celtics: Newcomers Jeff Teague scored 19 points in 25 minutes, and Tristan Thompson had 12 points and eight rebounds.","401266804"
"Steph Curry goes for 20 points and 10 assists in his first regular-season game since March as Golden State falls to Brooklyn on opening night. (1:41) NEW YORK -- — Kevin Durant shook off 18 months of rust in a matter of minutes. Durant looked good as new against his old team, Kyrie Irving was even better and the Brooklyn Nets emphatically kicked off the Steve Nash era with a 125-99 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night in the NBA's season opener. Durant finished with 22 points in 25 minutes of his first official game since rupturing his Achilles tendon while playing for Golden State in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals. It's a new start for Durant, but he did the same things he's been doing for years. “I tried not to make too big a deal out of this whole thing and realize I’ve been playing this game since I was 8 years old, so just got to revert back to what I know,” Durant said. Irving led Brooklyn with 26 points and Caris LeVert scored 20 as the Nets led by as many as 38, pouring on the points the way the Phoenix Suns did when Nash was their point guard, or more recently Golden State did when Durant was their All-Star forward. The Nets made the playoffs last season but now are expected to contend for the Eastern Conference title after finally getting Durant and Irving on the court together. They used the first game of the shortened, 72-game season to prove they might be worth the hype. “I think our goals are a lot higher this year and we just want to be able to come in and dominate and do that consistently,” Irving said. Stephen Curry had 20 points and 10 assists for the Warriors, a depleted team that looks nothing like the powerhouse that won two titles in Durant's three seasons there. Durant left shortly after having surgery following his injury and was expected to sit out the entire 2019-20 season even before it was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Teammates who have worked out with him said the four-time scoring champion was back in top form and Durant quickly backed up their boasts in a mostly empty Barclays Center. He made his first three shots, one a 3-pointer and another while being fouled, and was in double figures in fewer than five minutes. He did everything but keep up with Irving, who made three 3-pointers and had 17 points in 9 1/2 minutes of the opening quarter, when the Nets led by as many as 21. Irving, himself coming back from injury after playing just 20 games last season because of shoulder problems, had Brooklyn’s last two baskets of the first half, including a deep 3-pointer with 4.1 seconds left that made it 63-45. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he was happy for Durant but upset with what he saw from his team, trying to bounce back after winning a league-low 15 games last season. “Both Kevin and Kyrie just kind of had their way in the first half,"" he said. ""So the lack of physicality and competition were the most disappointing things.” Durant then scored 10 more in Brooklyn's 36-point third quarter, ending his night for good late in the period. No. 2 pick James Wiseman started at center despite his limited preparation and had 19 points and six rebounds. But the Warriors, playing without Draymond Green because of a sore right foot, need to find more shooting around Curry with Klay Thompson set to miss a second straight season. Andrew Wiggins was 4 for 16 for his 13 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. was 3 for 14. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said Green planned an individual workout Tuesday and would hopefully do some group work Wednesday when they remained in New York to practice. ... Wiseman, at 19 years, 266 days, became the third-youngest Golden State player to start a game behind Andris Biedrins (18, 352) and Anthony Randolph (19, 179). ...

They are 1-0 for the first time since Nov. 3, 2012, their first game at Barclays Center after moving from New Jersey. ... Brooklyn re-signed G Chris Chiozza to a two-way contract Tuesday. He played in 18 games for the Nets last season. ... The Nets honored the essential workers who have helped New York fight the coronavirus, raising a banner on one end of Barclays Center.

"The Clippers are fueled by Paul George scoring 33 points on 13-of-18 shooting from the field as they go on to defeat the Lakers on opening night 116-109. (2:15) LOS ANGELES -- - After the Los Angeles Lakers got their championship rings, the Los Angeles Clippers gave a performance that showed this retooled team is determined to contend for its own jewelry several months from now. Paul George scored 26 of his 33 points in the second half, Kawhi Leonard added 26 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rallied past the Los Angeles Lakers on the NBA champions' ring ceremony night for a 116-109 victory Tuesday. George went 13 of 18 with five 3-pointers in an outstanding first game since agreeing to add four years and $190 million to his contract with the Clippers, who never trailed in the latest meeting of Southern California's two NBA powerhouses. The Clippers beat the Lakers in the season opener for the second straight year while winning coach Tyronn Lue's debut. The Clippers stayed in their locker room while the Lakers received their rings, but they emerged with purpose and determined play - from their two superstars in particular. ""Our focus was on us,"" Lue said. ""The Lakers, they deserved that ring. They had a great year, and you can't take nothing away from them. Our focus wasn't really on the Lakers. They were the best team last year, so congratulations to them again, but now we're moving on."" LeBron James scored 22 points and Anthony Davis had 18 for the Lakers just 72 days after they finished off the Miami Heat in the NBA bubble. James said he turned his ankle ""pretty good"" in the second half, leading him to play just 28 minutes. ""I'm happy today is over with and we can focus on the season, but it's just a lot to process,"" James said. ""It felt weird having a basketball game today."" The Lakers returned from the shortest offseason in league history and celebrated  the franchise's 17th title, but they couldn't keep up with George and Leonard down the stretch. Lakers coach Frank Vogel also limited James' playing time and kept Davis to 31 minutes, anticipating the long grind ahead on his veterans after a 10-week offseason. ""It's not ideal, but I do feel it's necessary to manage those guys' minutes the right way,"" Vogel said. ""Getting through this stretch healthy is a priority, and evaluating how our new guys fit is a priority when we haven't had a normal amount of time to do that. The five guys on the floor have got to be better than they were tonight."" Serge Ibaka scored 15 points in his debut for the Clippers, who hadn't played since blowing a 3-1 playoff series lead to Denver and ruining a much-anticipated conference final showdown with the waiting Lakers in the bubble. The collapse led to coach Doc Rivers' departure, and Lue moved down the bench to take over a star-studded team with several new additions. The Lakers fell behind by 22 points under the ring hangover in the first quarter, but they erased all but two points of the deficit in the second. The Clippers pulled away late in the third with George scorching a series of one-on-one defenders. He scored 11 more points in the fourth to seal it. ""We're not thinking about last year,"" Leonard said. ""It's a different team. I'm just happy that we kept playing basketball the right way. Even if we lost the lead, we turned around and kept playing our basketball. We ran our offense, and that's what we take pride in tonight. Everybody had each other's back and was staying positive."" TIP-INS Clippers: Nicolas Batum and Ibaka started for their new club. ... Former Lakers Lou Williams and Ivica Zubac scored 11 points apiece. Lakers: James believes he will be fine to play on Christmas, saying he'll get extensive treatment. He also joked about another solution: ""I'll drink some wine that will flow right to the ankle."" ... Dennis Schröder and fellow newcomer Marc Gasol were in Vogel's starting lineup. Gasol had no points and five fouls in 12 minutes. ... Wesley Matthews also went scoreless in his Lakers debut. DEBUTS Batum had three points and six assists in 28 minutes in his Clippers debut, while new $64 million swingman Luke Kennard had four points in 21 minutes off the bench. Montrezl Harrell had 17 points and 10 rebounds in a strong debut after moving down the hallway from the Clippers to the Lakers last month. Schröder also was impressive in his Lakers debut, with 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. ""Those guys are going to be big-time players for us,"" Vogel said.","401266806"

"Damantas Sabonis goes for 32 points as the Pacers win their season opener vs. the Knicks 121-107. (2:18) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Victor Oladipo took matters into his own hands after a sluggish first half Wednesday night. He drove to the basket, made shots and wound up scoring 16 of his 22 points in the final 24 minutes to lead the Indiana Pacers past the New York Knicks 121-107 on opening night. “He wanted to be assertive in that second half,"" new coach Nate Bjorkgren said after collecting his first career win. “I thought he was very aggressive, attacking the basket more, looking to shoot it more. I liked his aggressive mentality on both ends of the floor."" Domantas Sabonis finished with a career-high 32 points, along with 13 rebounds and five assists to help Indiana win its fourth opener in five years. RJ Barrett finished with 26 points and Alec Burks had 22 for New York, which lost on opening night for the fourth time in five years and the first time in coach Tom Thibodeau's tenure. And after a strong start, Thibodeau certainly expected a stronger finishing punch from his team. “The way we played in the first half is the way we need to continue to play,"" he said. “We probably played 24 minutes of good basketball and to win on the road, you have to do more than that."" It wasn't pretty and with only a few dozen people in the Bankers Life Fieldhouse stands, the energy was lacking, too. But Oladipo's opening outburst in the second half changed everything. The two-time All-Star scored the Pacers' first 11 points in the third quarter then found T.J. Warren for a breakaway layup to give the Pacers a 78-77 lead with 5:50 left in the quarter. Indiana never trailed again. The Pacers extended the margin to 83-77 after three, made it a double-digit game early in the fourth and pulled away midway through the fourth. “I’m just going to go out there and be assertive, be aggressive,"" Oladipo said. “Everything else will take care of itself."" TIP-INS Knicks: Barrett played a nearly perfect first half, going 8 of 8 from the field, 3 of 3 on 3s and 1 of 2 at the free throw line. He finished 11 of 15 from the field. ... No. 8 pick Obi Toppin had nine points on 3-of-12 shooting in his NBA debut. ... Mitchell Robinson, who broke the league's single-season field goal percentage record last season, struggled with fouls all night and was 1 of 2 from the field with three points. ... Julius Randle had 17 points and nine rebounds. ... The Knicks had 16 turnovers. Pacers: T.J. Warren, who was so impressive in the bubble, wasn't himself after returning from a foot injury.

Malcolm Brogdon had 21 points, seven rebounds and eight assists. ... Indiana had a 49-40 rebounding advantage. HURTING Knicks rookie Immanuel Quickley's debut didn't last long. The 25th overall pick in last month's draft played just 12 minutes and took only three shots before leaving with a hip pointer. He finished with five points, one rebound, one assist and one steal — and his status for Game 2 is unclear, too. “He’ll be examined (Wednesday and Thursday),"" Thibodeau said. “He had a great impact when he went into the game in the first half.

"Nikola Vucevic sends a beautiful assist to Evan Fournier who cuts backdoor to the hoop for an and-1 in the final minute of action. (0:20) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — For a third time in the past four years, the Orlando Magic opened their season on their home court with a stirring victory beat the rival Miami Heat. Clearly, though, it will take more than just a victory over the defending Eastern Conference champion Heat for the Magic to back up forward Aaron Gordon’s bold talk of the team being ""overlooked.’’ Evan Fournier hit a go-ahead 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter, converted a three-point play off another driving layup in the final minute and scored 25 points in the Magic’s 113-107 victory over Miami on Wednesday. ""It was a good win and you always want to win the first game, especially when it’s at home,’’ said Fournier, who scored nine points in the final period for Orlando. ""It’s definitely rewarding to win against a team like Miami because it’s always tough to play against them.’’ The Sunshine State rivals opened the regular season against one another for the sixth time. Oddly, the two rivals have started their seasons in Orlando four times in the past five years. The Magic are 5-1 in their six openers against their rivals from South Florida. Bam Adebayo led Miami with 25 points and 11 rebounds, Goran Dragic added 20 points, and Jimmy Butler had 19 points and seven assists. The Heat turned the ball over 22 times, leading to 24 Magic points. ""One, empty possessions. Two, we didn’t get the necessary ball movement … and thirdly, (the Magic) are a good defensive team,’’ said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra’s, whose team was playing for the first time since losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals in October. Miami led 83-79 after three periods and it was up 93-91 with 4:29 to play following Adebayo's dunk. However, Fournier soon after swung the momentum to the Magic’s side with his strong finish. Fournier, who is looking to bounce back this season after struggling in last season’s playoffs, made all three of his shots in the fourth quarter. Gordon had 20 points and seven rebounds, Terrence Ross chipped in 19 and Nikola Vucevic added 15 points and 11 rebounds. Point guard Markelle Fultz added 15 points and made two clutch free throws with 1:11 to play. Gordon is confident that the Magic can open some eyes with their play this season. ""I don’t think, outside of Orlando, people have a lot of belief in us,’’ said the forward, who made 8 of 11 shots. ""I don’t think they think that we’re going to become potential contenders or even have a playoff slot and I don’t think that’s true. I feel like we’re really ready to make that next leap.’’ TIP-INS Heat: Dragic, who played well despite struggling with a foot injury much of training camp, was upset with his team’s hustle. ""We talked and thought we did not play hard enough,’’ Dragic said. ""This is what we need to correct.’’ Magic: The Magic held a moment of silence prior to tipoff to honor franchise co-founder Jimmy Hewitt. He died last month at the age of 79. Hewitt, along with Pat Williams, helped bring the NBA in the 1989-90 season.","401267152"
"Russell Westbrook scores 21 points, while dishing 15 assists and bringing in 11 rebounds vs. the 76ers. (1:29) PHILADELPHIA -- — The 76ers have gone more than a year without losing in Philadelphia, a stretch that included a coaching change, a roster revamp, and a pandemic hiatus. The constant? Joel Embiid simply dominant down the stretch. Embiid scored 15 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 113-107 win over Washington on Wednesday night and spoil Russell Westbrook’s triple-double Wizards’ debut. The Sixers haven’t lost at home since Dec. 20, 2019. Westbrook and Bradley Beal were fantastic in spurts in the opening-night backcourt pairing that nearly handed 76ers coach Doc Rivers a loss in his Philadelphia debut. Westbrook had 21 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds to wow the Wizards after being acquired in the big deal that sent former cornerstone John Wall to the Houston Rockets. Beal, a two-time All-Star who was second in the league in scoring last season, had 31 points. “Not good enough. I’m kind of disappointed in myself,” Westbrook said. “There were plays where I could have had a better game.” Embiid, sensational in the fourth, and Shake Milton, who scored 19 points off the bench, were the go-to scorers late, and Ben Simmons sealed the win with a monster dunk in the waning moments. Simmons had 16 points — one less than Embiid scored in the fourth. “He’s the focal point. The ball is going to Embiid on every single play,” Beal said. “He’s a hassle down there.” Embiid was nearly unstoppable in the post in the fourth, getting the ball on five straight possessions at one point and turning them into buckets that wiped out a 10-point deficit. His driving layup with 1:09 left put the Sixers up 105-103, and he finished 10 of 17 from the floor. “I don’t think anybody can stop me, especially with the mentality I have this year,” Embiid said. The Sixers made their major change on the bench, hiring Rivers to replace Brett Brown and wake up a team that was swept out of the first round of the playoffs last year. Rivers has to find a way to make the Embiid-Simmons pairing work — two All-Stars who have yet to get the most of their prodigious talents and have frustrated fans with their flaws. Simmons showed an early willingness to try and fix his — making shots from beyond 15 feet. Simmons was encouraged by new teammate Dwight Howard, who won a ring last season with the Lakers, to stick around postgame and work on his shooting. Both players stayed on the court and Howard waved toward the stands — mostly security guards and team employees — to get louder during a shooting drill. Simmons was the subject of trade rumors, though new head decision maker Daryl Morey said the guard was not on the trading block. “Dwight’s been pushing me to get better. He wants me to be great,” Simmons said. “I really appreciate that. It makes you want to work.” TIP-INS Wizards: Israeli teen Deni Avdija scored seven points in his NBA debut for the Wizards. The 19-year-old was the ninth overall pick in the draft and had played for the Tel Aviv Maccabi club in Israel’s Premier League. “I know he’s only 19 years old but he plays with a passion, plays with a determination that I like,” coach Scott Brooks said. ... Beal and Westbrook each had six turnovers and Washington had 20 overall. 76ers: The 76ers bench largely outplayed the starters. Howard had 10 rebounds, Furkan Korkmaz scored 11 points and first-round pick Tyrese Maxey was a burst of energy early and had six points. SIR CHARLES PREDICTS TNT analyst Charles Barkley played with Brooks and roomed with him, too, when they played for the 76ers. Barkley put some pressure on his old teammate when he predicted the Wizards would make the playoffs. “I’ll tell you what, he’s guaranteed a lot and very rarely it comes through,” Brooks said. “My job is to take care of my former roommate and pay him back. ... Hopefully, we can have a good year and make the playoffs. I like our chances.” Brooks is entering the final season of his five-year, $35 million contract. THAT’S ENTERTAINMENT The 76ers had drummers, the cheer team held signs that read “Make Some Noise,” a DJ blasted music and the mascot Franklin roasted the Wizards with humorous signs to liven up an empty Wells Fargo Center.","401267173"
"Zion Williamson climbs the ladder and gets a big block on OG Anunoby. (0:23) TAMPA, Fla. -- — The Toronto Raptors had their home floor shipped 1,300 miles when they relocated to Tampa for at least the start of the NBA season. Yet it was the New Orleans Pelicans who looked at home at Amalie Arena in the season opener for both teams. JJ Redick converted a four-point play with just over a minute remaining and finished with 23 points, and Brandon Ingram led all scorers with 24 points as the Pelicans rallied from an 11-point deficit and beat the Raptors 113-99 on Wednesday night. Zion Williamson had a big second half for the Pelicans and finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams scored 18 and 16 points, respectively, in their first games with the Pelicans, who delivered new coach Stan Van Gundy a victory in his New Orleans debut. “I’d say that we fought very hard in a game that was very, very frustrating,” Van Gundy said. “We were turning the ball over, we were in foul trouble, not a lot was going right for us. We hung in there and kept fighting and then made enough plays and enough shots to pull away.” Pascal Siakam led the Raptors with 20 points. Kyle Lowry finished with 18 points and 10 assists. Because of the current Canadian restrictions on cross-border travel due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Raptors are scheduled to play their first 17 “home” games at Tampa’s Amalie Arena. The second half of the NBA’s schedule will be released later. Lowry hit four 3-pointers in the second quarter, and when Siakam made consecutive 3-pointers, the Raptors opened their largest lead of the game at 11 points. Redick hit a couple 3s late in the second period, but the Pelicans went into the break trailing 57-50. Ingram spoke on the importance of Redick to the Pelicans. “He’s good to have around from a professionalism standpoint, so we like to have him around,” Ingram said. “We love that he can shoot the basketball and when he’s open he needs the basketball.” Early in the second half, Lonzo Ball and Bledsoe hit 3-pointers in a 9-0 run. Then, Ball and Ingram did all the scoring for the Pelicans on a 10-2 run that finished the third quarter and gave the Pelicans an 88-79 lead. They scored 38 points in the period. <U+2033>(The third quarter) ... zapped our energy pretty big time,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “We did seem to lose a little energy and maybe ran out of a little gas, too.” About 3,800 people attended the game, and Siakam said fans in the stands makes a difference. “I don’t know if it’s all Raptors fans or what the case might be, but I thought it was cool, just having people around it,” Siakam said. “Obviously we’re blessed that we have some people, some type of energy in the crowd to make the atmosphere a little better.” TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson, who averaged only 27.8 minutes over 24 games in an injury-filled rookie season, went to the bench with three fouls with 8:10 left in the first half. He did play 30 minutes. ... New Orleans shot 52.5% in the game and hada 45-35 rebound advantage. Raptors: The loss ended Toronto’s seven-game win streak in season openers. ... It was Lowry’s ninth straight opening-day start for the Raptors. ... The Raptors have seven undrafted players on their season-opening roster.","401267174"
"Trae Young throws an alley-oop from half court to John Collins who goes up to throw down a one-handed dunk to cap the fast break for the Hawks. (0:19) CHICAGO -- — Trae Young was tough to stop in his first two NBA seasons. Surrounded by more talent than ever before, he could become a nightmare for the league in his third year. Young scored 37 points and the revamped Atlanta Hawks pounded Chicago 124-104 on Wednesday night, spoiling Billy Donovan's debut as Bulls coach. “Just being able to go out there and put on a show in the first game was really good,” Young said. “Not every night obviously is going to be like this, but it's really good to have an opening game like this.” Atlanta shot 54% (43 for 80) from the field and had seven players score in double figures. Cam Reddish had 15 points and John Collins finished with 14. “All of our guys played well. All of our guys played together,” coach Lloyd Pierce said. Looking for their first playoff berth since 2017, the Hawks signed Bogdan Bogdanovic, Danilo Gallinari, Rajon Rondo and Kris Dunn during free agency. Rondo and Dunn were held out on opening night, but Bogdanovic had 15 points and seven rebounds, and Gallinari scored 13. While the newcomers could give Atlanta a big lift, the dynamic Young remains the engine that drives the Hawks. He seemingly scored at will against the Bulls, going 10 for 12 from the field, 5 for 6 from 3-point range and 12 for 14 at the line. He also had seven assists and six rebounds in just 26 minutes. “The way we spaced, it opened up a lot of driving lanes and gaps to the rim for either shots at the rim or if they helped, we had shooters open,” Young said. Chicago cleaned out its front office and fired coach Jim Boylen after it went 22-43 last year during its third consecutive losing season. Donovan was hired in September, and it looks as if he has quite the job ahead of him. Zach LaVine scored 22 points and Lauri Markkanen had 21 points and seven rebounds in a solid start to an important season for the 23-year-old forward. But the Bulls struggled defensively and were careless with the ball at times, finishing with 17 turnovers. “We did not help each other well enough defensively,” Donovan said. Patrick Williams, the No. 4 overall pick in this year's draft, had 16 points for Chicago in his NBA debut. The 19-year-old Williams became the youngest player in Bulls history to start their first game of the season. Young led the way as Atlanta grabbed control in the first half. He found Collins for an alley-oop jam that made it 66-46 with 4:49 left. He had 27 points on 7-for-9 shooting at the break, helping the Hawks to an 83-59 halftime lead. “We just didn't come to play as a team,” Bulls center Wendell Carter Jr. said. TIP-INS Hawks: Dunn (right knee) missed the game against his former team. Dunn played for the Bulls for the past three seasons before signing a $10 million, two-year contract with the Hawks in free agency. “He's just at a point where he's trying to get right,” Pierce said. “He's been doing some non-contact activity.” ... C Clint Capela (left Achilles soreness) and Rondo (health and safety protocols) also were held out. Asked if it could be a lingering issue with Capela, Pierce said: “No, I just thought he was sore.” Bulls: F Thaddeus Young missed the opener because of an infection in his lower left leg. ... Donovan didn't reveal his starters until right before his first game. He went with Williams, Markkanen, LaVine, Carter, and Coby White, but he said staying flexible is important this year because of COVID-19 protocols. “I think we've got to do a good job, players and coaches, of making sure we're all staying ready,"" he said. ROOKIES While Williams started in his NBA debut, Atlanta rookie Onyeka Okongwu was sidelined by a foot injury. Okongwu, a 6-foot-9 center from Southern California who was selected by the Hawks with the No. 6 pick in the draft, will be re-evaluated on Monday, the day of Atlanta’s home opener against Detroit.","401267175"
"Ja Morant stuns the Spurs with an impressive dunk after throwing the ball off the glass to himself for a two-handed slam. (0:29) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — DeMar DeRozan had 28 points and nine assists, Dejounte Murray added 21 points as the San Antonio Spurs used a balanced attack to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies 131-119 on Wednesday night, overcoming a huge game by Ja Morant. Morant -- the reigning rookie of the year -- had 34 of his career-high 44 points in the second half. While that helped carry the Grizzlies offensively, it wasn’t enough to put a deep dent in San Antonio’s double-digit lead through much of the second half. “I’m not happy at all,” Morant said when asked about the career-high, adding: “We came up short. So, learning from this game and prepare for the next.” While the game tipped off the Grizzlies 20th season in Memphis, things were toned down from the normal baptism of a new campaign. FedExForum was void of any fans, leaving any crowd noise to recorded reactions. “I thought our guys, our young guys competed hard, really showed themselves well for the first game we played together,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. He later added that Murray’s defense “did a good job making Morant work.” “At the end, I think we were probably a little bit tired. But Morant just took it in his own hands and decided to attack the rim. I don’t think we got back really well the last six, seven minutes of the game. But, fortunately, we were able to continue scoring.” LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points for San Antonio, while Lonnie Walker IV and Keldon Johnson had 16 each, part of seven Spurs finishing in double figures. “I think we got a little sloppy toward the end,” Murray said. “But like I said, we fought, we played together, and we made it happen and we came out with a win.” Dillon Brooks scored 16 for the Grizzlies, while Jonas Valanciunas added 15 points and 13 rebounds. The Spurs, who fell behind early as Memphis was connecting on 3-pointers, clamped down on defense in the second quarter. The stingy defense and much better shooting by the Spurs helped San Antonio to a 66-53 lead at the break. “They really picked up their pressure in the second quarter, which I think really think impacted both sides of the ball,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. TIP-INS Spurs: Fourth-year G Derrick White was out recovering from left toe surgery. …Wore their City Edition jerseys with the fiesta colors – teal, pink and orange – across the chest and down the side of the shorts. … G Patty Mills connected on a 3-pointer in the second quarter, moving him ahead of Allen Iverson for 99th on the all-time made 3-pointer list with 1,060. Grizzlies: Are 9-17 in home openers, and had won six of their last eight entering the game. …Memphis remained without F Jaren Jackson Jr. (left knee meniscus surgery) and swingman Justise Winslow (left hip displacement). … Valanciunas reached 1,000 career rebounds in the third quarter. DANCIN’ POP: Spurs swingman Lonnie Walker IV apparently is trying to help coach Gregg Popovich into music, teaching the San Antonio coach about some of the better rap artist. “The only ones that I listen to are the ones you can dance to,” Popovich said. “If you can’t dance to it, then it’s not good.”","401267177"
"Karl-Anthony Towns describes the struggle he has been going through as he recovers emotionally from the death of his mother due to COVID-19. (1:32) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Minnesota's season-opening victory over Detroit was winding down, and Karl-Anthony Towns was urged by teammate D'Angelo Russell to grab the game ball as a keepsake. For mom, in memory. Towns had 22 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, leading the Timberwolves past the Pistons 111-101 on Wednesday night after a pregame moment of silence and moving tribute video for the All-Star center's mother. Jacqueline Cruz-Towns died of complications from COVID-19 in April. “When you go through what I’ve been through, you just find a different source of strength. I don’t know how to explain it. I made a promise to these guys to be here for them,” Towns said. Malik Beasley scored 23 points, Russell pitched in 18 points, and Anthony Edwards — the first overall draft pick last month — added 15 points in his debut as the Timberwolves overcame a deficit that often reached double digits and was still 12 points midway through the third quarter. In a promising sign for this long-languishing franchise, they leaned on their defense to come back. “We grew up, man,” Towns said. Towns had to do a lot of that off the court this spring and summer, while the NBA paused for the pandemic. “You may see me smiling and stuff, but that Karl died on April 13th,"" Towns said. ""He’s never coming back. I don’t remember that man. I don’t know that man. You’re talking to the physical me, but my soul has been killed off a long time ago,” Towns said. Towns, who made Minnesota’s first basket after an 0-for-7 start by the team, gave the Timberwolves their first lead of the game at 98-97 on a 3-pointer with 3:38 remaining. Russell hit one with 2:05 left for a 103-101 edge, Towns rebounded a missed deep shot on the other end by Derrick Rose, and Beasley buried one with 1:28 to go to send the Wolves on their way. Josh Jackson (19 points) and Rose (15 points) provided plenty of production off the bench, but the Pistons sputtered down the stretch and were outscored 31-16 in the fourth quarter. Rookie Killian Hayes, one of the team's three first-round draft picks, had three turnovers in the fourth quarter. “That’s what this is for, for him to learn from and get better in those situations,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Blake Griffin, the six-time All-Star, had 15 points and seven rebounds after his 2019-20 season was limited to 18 games by another left knee injury. The first overall pick in the 2009 draft, one of the few prominent players left after the overhaul commissioned by new general manager Troy Weaver, took only one shot in the fourth quarter. Jackson was the standout of a disappointing night. The rest of the Pistons shot 5 for 28 from 3-point range. “That’s part of my role on this team, to come out and spread the floor,” Jackson said. TIP-INS Pistons: Mason Plumlee pitched in 14 points, eight rebounds and six assists. He went 7 for 8 from the floor. Timberwolves: Towns and Jarrett Culver (10 points, 10 rebounds) became the first Minnesota pair to record point-rebound double-doubles in a season opener since Kevin Garnett and Rasho Nesterovic in 2002.","401267178"

Harrison Barnes stole the ball from Jokic with 2.6 seconds left and Buddy Hield tipped in his miss at the buzzer, sending the Sacramento Kings storming off the court with a stunning 124-122 win over the Denver Nuggets in overtime Wednesday night. Jokic recorded a triple-double with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists, but he had a crucial offensive foul with 2.6 seconds left in regulation that denied Denver a chance to win it in regulation and he watched helplessly as Barnes stole the ball in the chaotic closing moments of overtime. Hield led Sacramento with 22 points and Barnes and De’Aaron Fox each added 21 for the Kings, who snapped a six-game skid in Denver, where they had last won on Jan. 3, 2017. Fox also had a key block of Will Barton’s layup with 10.6 seconds remaining in overtime and Barnes grabbed the long rebound and raced downcourt to for a layup that tied it at 122 with 6.5 seconds left. Denver called timeout, but Barnes punched the ball away from Jokic, then raced for a 4-foot dunk that Barton blocked. Hield tipped it in just before the buzzer, then raced off the court and through the tunnel at the newly renamed Ball Arena. Michael Porter Jr. scored 24 points for Denver despite early foul trouble, but playoff star Jamal Murray was held to five points and was 1-for-9 shooting before fouling out late in regulation. “I’d be lying if I told you our defense had a lot to do with that,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “When you’re as good as Jamal Murray and you have a shooting night like that, that’s more him having an off-night. Now, I give our guys credit for competing and making it hard for him. But he sees that every night. “I actually feel bad for whoever has to guard him next time out. I’m assuming he’ll probably have a pretty good game. But our guys did a heck of a job competing.” Before the game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone was asked if Murray could match his playoff prowess in the new season, and he used the opportunity to talk about how the team’s first trip to the Western Conference Finals in a decade last summer was already old news. “As great as last season was -- I’m going to keep saying this -- that season is over,” Malone said. “That was a different team. Yes, we have our core back, but we have seven new players. As great as it was to win our division, to get to the Western Conference Finals, to comeback from two 3-1 deficits; starting tonight, who cares? That’s over.” Murray emerged as a bona fide star in the bubbled playoffs in Florida, but Malone said Murray, Jokic and everyone else has to forget about that run now. “We can’t rely on that,” Malone said. “That is ancient history in my eyes. Now, Jamal has a challenge of being that player for 72 games. He did it at a high level for 19 games in the playoffs. Now, this is the beginning of the 2020-2021 season, can Jamal Murray bring it every night and help this team reach even greater heights? “Our goal has still been, we haven’t obtained our goal yet, and that is to win a championship. Jamal is going to be a big part of that.” After the game, Malone pointed to the Kings' 36-24 third quarter as the key to Denver's disappointment, and Jokic concurred, saying, “We relaxed. We played a really good first half. They came out of (halftime) really aggressive with a lot of energy and picked up the tempo of the game. We didn’t match it.” TIP-INS Kings: Corey Joseph had 12 points in 12 minutes off the bench in the first half. ... Sacramento didn't lead at all in the first half, and there was only one tie before halftime, at 7-7. Nuggets: Murray missed all five of his 3-pointers but made all seven of his free throws. ... The Nuggets were outrebounded 53-45 although no Kings reached double digits off the glass (four Sacramento players had nine boards).","401267179"
"Donovan Mitchell feeds it inside to Rudy Gobert and he throws down a dunk on Jusuf Nurkic. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Rudy Gobert had 20 points and 17 rebounds in a dominant season-opening performance, leading the Utah Jazz to a 120-100 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. Gobert controlled the inside and got plenty of support from the outside as Utah shot 19 of 50 from the 3-point line. “It’s fun when we play the way we played tonight,” Gobert said. Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell and Bojan Bogdanovic all made four 3-pointers and Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson knocked down three apiece. Mitchell also scored 20 points. Damian Lillard was scoreless in the first half and finished with only nine points and seven assists for Portland. “They came out from the jump and they were blitzing and trapping. I wasn’t really expecting that,” Lillard said. “But I just didn’t play a good offensive game.” Utah started quickly from outside and pushed its lead to 52-33 with 6:29 left in the first half. The Jazz led by as much as 23 before taking a 64-44 lead at halftime. Lillard was held scoreless in a half for the first time in six seasons. Lillard broke the drought with a layup early in the third quarter. Perhaps no play summed up the night for Portland better than a 3-on-1 break that left Lillard wide open with 31 seconds left, before Lillard took a hesitation dribble and missed the 3-pointer with nobody around him. The frustration extended to his backcourt mate CJ McCollum, who picked up a late technical foul arguing a call in the fourth quarter. McCollum led the Blazers with 23 points. “I don’t think it was for a lack of effort. I think we played hard, we just didn’t play well on both sides of the ball,” McCollum said. Utah’s held the Blazers to barely 40% shooting and had a 59-40 rebounding advantage. It wasn’t just Gobert, but the Jazz had four other players who grabbed at least six rebounds, including Clarkson with seven boards off the bench. TIP-INS Jazz: Bogdanovic played for the first time since March 9. He elected to have wrist surgery in May during the NBA’s hiatus and did not join the team in the NBA bubble. Bogdanovic, who averaged 20 points last season, finished with 15. Blazers: Wednesday was the first game for Portland newcomers Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. Both players are starters for the Blazers. Jones Jr. had a good night shooting the ball, hitting 3 of 5 3-pointers. Covington was 0 for 3 from the field and scoring only one point.","401267180"
"Late in the fourth quarter, Grayson Allen and Trae Young's feet get tangled up causing Young to stumble on the play. (0:25) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Trae Young scored eight straight points down the stretch and finished with 36 points as the Atlanta Hawks beat the Memphis Grizzlies 122-112 Saturday night. Kevin Huerter added 21 points for the Hawks, who won their second straight. De’Andre Hunter finished with 15 points and rookie Nathan Knight added 14 points, going 4 of 5 from the field and 2-for-3 shooting from 3-point range. Ja Morant led Memphis with 28 points and seven assists, and Kyle Anderson finished with 20 points and 14 rebounds. Dillon Brooks added 19 points before fouling out in the closing seconds. Huerter said the goal was to stop the Grizzlies’ transition game and keep them out of the paint, where they are one of the best teams in the league. “For the most part, I think we did a pretty good job at that. We tried to turn a lot of them into shooters,” Huerter said, later adding: “Trying to keep them out of the paint, and we did our thing offensively.” The game was a showdown between two of the league’s top young point guards in Young and Morant, both of whom had big season-openers. Young had 37 points in the Hawks’ 124-104 win at Chicago, while Morant scored a career-high 44 in a home loss to San Antonio. Young, who was limited to 12 points in the first half, scored 10 points in the final 2:40 against the Grizzlies, starting with the eight straight to keep Memphis from overtaking Atlanta. “I think shots just went down,” Young said of the second half. “I was getting some really good looks in that first half. Shots just weren’t going in. For all of us. … I think we got the rust off (in the first half) and played really well as far as scoring throughout the rest of the game.” The young guards carried their teams through the first half, with the Hawks also getting an early burst from Huerter, who had 13 points at the break, hitting all five of his shots. The Hawks held a 58-56 lead at the half. “We’re both young talents trying to be the face of the league,” Morant said. “We’ve played against each other many times. ... The sky’s the limit for (Young).” TIP-INS Hawks: Split a pair of preseason games against the Grizzlies in Memphis. …Starting frontline player Danilo Gallinari did not play due to a left foot contusion. … Knight, who signed a two-way contract with the Hawks after a four-year career at William &amp; Mary, scored his first NBA points in the first quarter. Grizzlies: Reserve G De’Anthony Melton was a late scratch Saturday morning due to health and safety protocols. “In terms of a return date, I’m new to this process,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said, adding: “We don’t have a firm timeline yet. It’s to be determined.” ... Kyle Anderson reached 2,000 career points in the first quarter. … Morant reached 500 assists in the second quarter. INJURY KNOWLEDGE: When asked about the availability of certain Hawks injured players, coach Lloyd Pierce candidly said he can only coach the ones available. And that’s how he approaches it. “I never pretend to know about injuries,” the Hawks coach said. “I’ve never sustained an injury in my life, so I don’t pretend to know what an ACL or and MCL or anything else or foot or ankle. I don’t know anything about it, so I don’t try to pretend to know.”","401267181"
"LaMelo Ball makes two 3-pointers in the first quarter of the Hornets' game vs. the Thunder, the first of his career. (0:26) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — After watching his team surrender a 13-point lead in the final two minutes, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said he needed to clear his head. He did, and then he went to work. Gilgeous-Alexander knocked down a tiebreaking jumper with 1.4 seconds left and finished with 24 points, helping the Oklahoma City Thunder hold off a furious rally by the Charlotte Hornets to win their season opener 109-107 Saturday night. Taking the last shot is a role the third-year player said he's become comfortable with. “The greats do it,” he said. “It’s a role I'm blessed to have. But I work extremely hard and I want to take full advantage of it.” The Thunder led 102-89 with 1:50 to go, but Miles Bridges spurred Charlotte with 11 of his 14 points in the final 1:06 — including a trio of 3s in the last 25 seconds. His final 3 tied it at 107 with 10.3 seconds left. Gilgeous-Alexander then took the inbound pass, brought the ball up the floor and pulled up from 23 feet to drain a contested jumper over Caleb Martin from the top of the key. “He understood how much time he had and got to his spot,"" said Mark Daigneault, who won in his debut as Oklahoma City's coach. George Hill was 8 of 9 from the field and finished with 21 points, and Darius Bazley and Luguentz Dort each had 15 points for the Thunder after their first scheduled game against the Rockets was postponed earlier in the week. “When coach drew it up, he told Shai to go at six, I was like, he’s hitting the shot,” Bazley said. Hill said he liked what he saw from the new-look Thunder. “This season is a going to have a lot of ups and downs, some wins and losses, but the more we can stay together and be resilient, we will be fine,"" Hill said. Terry Rozier, who had 42 points on 10 3-pointers in Charlotte’s loss to the Cavaliers to open the season, had 19 points to lead the Hornets, but his desperation heave at the buzzer fell short. P.J. Washington added 18 points and rookie LaMelo Ball scored 13 points off the bench. Ball was held scoreless in the NBA regular season debut against the Cavaliers but scored nine in the first quarter Saturday, including two 3s. He later got a floater to fall from 13 feet and added a dunk off a steal, finishing the first half 5 of 6 from the floor for 13 points to give the Hornets a 59-57 lead at the break. However, he did not score in the second half, missing all four shots from the field. “I thought LaMelo played extremely well tonight,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “There may be more minutes for him. Tonight was a good step for him.” TIP-INS Thunder: Outrebound the Hornets 54-47 behind 13 boards from Al Horford. Hornets: Charlotte shot 6 of 31 from the field in the third quarter after shooting 50% in the first half. ... Bismack Biyombo started at center for Cody Zeller, who is out at least four weeks after breaking a bone in his left hand in the team's season-opening loss at Cleveland. CLOSING THE DEAL The Thunder struggled with putting the game away in the final 2 minutes, missing free throws and turning the ball over. Daigneault said that will be an area the team must improve upon. “We could have handled it better,” Daigneault said. “Hopefully we learn from it and handle it better next time.” As for his own performance in his coaching debut, Daigneault said he gave himself a “C-plus.""","401267182"
"Andre Drummond blocks the floater then corrals the ball for an outlet pass to Collin Sexton in transition who drills a 3-pointer on the other end. (0:22) DETROIT -- — The Cleveland Cavaliers took full advantage of Detroit's inability to close out games. Collin Sexton scored 32 points and three of his teammates had at least 21 points, helping Cleveland  beat Detroit  128-119 in two overtimes Saturday night. “Multiple opportunities where we could’ve given in, multiple opportunities that we could've lost the fight,"" Pacers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Every player, to a man, decided that was not going to happen. We will not quit and that’s a testament to those guys and building our identity."" While the Cavs improved to 2-0, the rebuilding Pistons dropped to 0-2 after also struggling down the stretch in their season-opening loss at Minnesota. “The positive is we put ourselves in a position to win two straight games,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. Cleveland center Andre Drummond had 23 points, 16 rebounds, five assists, four steals and three blocks against his former team. “A lot of memories just rushed into my head,"" said Drummond, who was drafted No. 9 overall by Detroit in 2012 and traded to the Cavs last season. Darius Garland added 21 points and a career-high 12 assists, setting the tone for a young backcourt with Sexton that combined to score 49 points in the season-opening win over Charlotte. “Our two young guards carried us and put us in a position to win,"" Bickerstaff said. Cleveland reserve Cedi Osman had 22 points, Kevin Love scored 15 points after missing the opener with a calf injury and JaVale McGee had 11 points off the bench. Jerami Grant had 14 of his 28 points in the third quarter, when the Pistons took control before blowing it, and Blake Griffin finished with 26 points. Detroit's Derrick Rose had 13 points, missing 11 of 15 shots, and had some costly turnovers. Cleveland led 59-53 at halftime with three scorers — Sexton, Osman and Garland — already in double figures. Griffin had 18 points at halftime, scoring all his points on 3-pointers with just two misses beyond the arc. Detroit closed the third with a 14-0 run, capped by Grant’s 3-pointer from the team’s logo at midcourt, after the Cavs led by 11 earlier in the quarter. The Pistons were ahead 101-93 with three-plus minutes left in regulation and allowed the Cavs to score the final eight points — five on Drummond's free throws — in the quarter to extend the game. Rose helped the Pistons take a nine-point lead in overtime. He later lost opportunities to seal the victory with an unforced turnover while being guarded by Drummond with 13 seconds left and by losing the ball by dribbling it off Drummond's foot to give it back to the Cavs with 1.2 seconds left. “I’ll take Derrick Rose going to the basket,"" Casey insisted.

"Russell Westbrook goes full throttle towards the basket and finishes layup in the lane. (0:16) WASHINGTON -- — The Orlando Magic beat Washington 130-120 on Saturday night, overcoming another triple-double by Russell Westbrook in his home debut for the Wizards. Westbrook had 15 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists to become the fourth player in NBA history to record a triple-double in his team’s first two games. Magic Johnson (twice), Jerry Lucas, and Oscar Robertson previously accomplished the feat. Westbrook is the first player to do it with a new team after being acquired from Houston in the off-season for John Wall. “This one is on me,” Westbrook said after the Wizards dropped to 0-2. “For us we didn’t put ourselves in position to win the game, especially myself. Missing easy shots — it wasn't nothing that they did.” Terrence Ross scored 25 points to lead Orlando. Nikola Vucevic had 22 points and 17 rebounds, and Markelle Fultz added 21 points to help the Magic win its second straight to start the season. “I think it was a team effort,” Fultz said about trying to contain Westbrook. “He’s a great player. He gets to the rim. He creates for others. He’s on the glass.” Bradley Beal had 39 points for the Wizards, while Thomas Bryant had 19. Westbrook, who averaged a triple-double three straight seasons from 2016-17 to 2018-19 with Oklahoma City, had just two points at the half and finished shooting 6 for 19 from the field. “I feel fine,” Westbrook said when asked how he felt physically. “I just hate losing.” Despite the triple-double from Westbrook and big night from Beal – who had 11 points in the fourth – the Magic were in control for most of the game. Washington’s final lead came at 101-100 on a dunk by Robin Lopez with 8:46 left. Orlando then used a 13-2 run in which five different players scored to go up 113-103 and seal the game. “I think they’re a bear to guard,” Clifford said about the new look Wizards. “They play at a pace that makes it difficult to stay in touch with them.” Washington has dropped five straight to Orlando. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando’s reserves outscored their Wizards counterparts 53-32. ... Clifford said pregame that James Ennis (hamstring strain) remained in Orlando to continue his rehab schedule. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks said pregame that he wasn’t sure if Westbrook would play in the second half of back-to-backs but is hopeful Davis Bertans play between 18 to 20 minutes. Bertans had nine points in 20 minutes. ... HONORING WES Washington honored late Hall of Famer Wes Unseld before the game with a moment of silence and video tribute from Beal. The Wizards will wear the number 41 on their jerseys this season. Unseld died on June 20 at the age of 74.

"Ben Simmons cleans up on the offensive board with a putback dunk vs. the Knicks. (0:17) NEW YORK -- — The Philadelphia 76ers moved the ball around so well Ben Simmons felt like they were the Harlem Globetrotters. He and Embiid keep turning the New York Knicks into their Washington Generals. Embiid had 27 points and 10 rebounds while remaining unbeaten against the Knicks, leading the 76ers to a 109-89 victory Saturday night. Simmons had 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists while also leading the defensive effort that forced New York's RJ Barrett into a miserable shooting performance. The Sixers beat the Knicks for the 13th straight time since early in the 2017-18 season, the first with Embiid and Simmons playing together. They did it by breaking open a close game in the third quarter, when they had seven assists on their 11 baskets. “Team basketball wins games and championships,” Simmons said. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry each scored 17 points as Philadelphia improved to 2-0 and got off to a good start in turning around its road woes after finishing with a 12-26 road record last season. Having Curry and Danny Green aboard should help with their ability to hit from deep. “If you want to double, I dare you because we’re going to knock down those shots,” Embiid said. New coach Doc Rivers earned his 945th victory, moving ahead of Bill Fitch into sole possession of 10th place on the career list. “It’s a great feeling,” said Rivers, in his 22nd season. “I don’t count and it’s not why I coach but it’s an honor.” Julius Randle scored 25 points and Alec Burks added 22 for the Knicks, who fell to 0-2 under Tom Thibodeau. Barrett, after a 26-point season opener, shot 2 for 15 and had 10 points. “Our responsibility is to improve each and every day. Come in, put everything you have into it,” Thibodeau said. “The games reveal exactly where we are and obviously it’s showing us that we have a lot of work to do.” The Knicks were without both their first-round rookies. Obi Toppin is sidelined by a strained right calf and Immanuel Quickley was still sore after sustaining a hip pointer in their season opener. The Sixers' lead was just three a minute and a half into the third quarter before six straight points made it 68-59 on Curry's 3-pointer. Randle made a free throw, but two baskets by Embiid and 3-pointers by Curry and Green made it a 16-3 run and extended the lead to 78-62 midway through the period. The Knicks cut it to nine midway through the fourth, but Embiid nailed a 3-pointer before a nice flurry by Simmons pushed it to 104-85 TIP-INS 76ers: With Philadelphia completing its first back-to-back of the season Sunday at Cleveland, Rivers wouldn't say if Embiid would be rested. ... Philadelphia's last loss to New York was April 12, 2017, long after Embiid's rookie season had ended early because of injury. Knicks: Toppin, the No. 8 pick and last season's college player of the year, had an MRI on Saturday. The Knicks said he will be re-evaluated in a week to 10 days. ... New York also remained without G Austin Rivers (groin), leaving him unable to play against his father's team. WARDROBE MALFUNCTION The Knicks debuted their City Edition jerseys and one needed a quick alteration. Reggie Bullock's jersey had his No. 25 on the front but No. 23 on the back. Mitchell Robinson is No. 23, so Bullock had to change his jersey to the correct one after it was noticed.","401267185"
"Victor Oladipo gets bumped as he's shooting a 3-pointer and still buries it. (0:18) CHICAGO -- — Domantas Sobonis had 22 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, and the Indiana Pacers used big scoring runs in the second and third quarters to cruise to a 125-106 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night. T.J. Warren scored 23 points and Victor Oladipo added 22 as Indiana beat its Central Division rivals for a 10th straight time, including five straight at the United Center. Sabonis, who had a career-high 32 points in the season-opening win against New York, finished 8 for 11 from the field before fouling out with just over five minutes remaining. “My teammates really helped me,” Sabonis said. “All game long they were reminding me where to be and helping me keep my energy up. In these games, with no fans out there, that's really important.” Zach LaVine scored 17 points and Lauri Markkanen had 16 points and nine rebounds for Chicago, which dropped its second straight to start the season. After getting off to a horrid start in the season-opening loss to Atlanta, the Bulls started fairly well on Saturday, building a 40-34 advantage early in the second quarter. But the game quickly turned as Indiana ran off 21 straight points to grab a 55-40 lead. Chicago went scoreless for five minutes and fell apart at both ends. The Bulls went 0-for-8 from the field with six turnovers during the drought — with three of the turnovers coming in the backcourt against Indiana's full-court trap. Defensively, they broke down repeatedly and allowed easy baskets. “Whatever the run was in the second quarter, we have to be able to stop it sooner than that,” Chicago coach Billy Donovan said. “They don't handle it — they don't handle it at all. They internalize it and try to do it themselves. They have to do it together. “The bottom line is this is pro basketball and you have to be able to handle it.” LaVine agreed with his coach's assessment. “We have to fight,"" he said. ""We can't let those lapses go that long.” The Pacers had a 66-56 halftime lead and started the third quarter with 18 straight points for an 84-56 edge to essentially put the game away. Chicago missed its first seven shots of the quarter and didn't score until a Markkanen layup with 7:12 left. “In the third quarter, we knew we had to come out and change things,” Sabonis said. The Bulls rallied, trimming the deficit to 114-103 with just under four minutes to play, but Warren converted a layup and Oladipo added a 3-pointer to build the lead up to 119-103. TIP-INS Pacers: C Goga Bitadze (right ankle sprain), F Brian Bowen II (right groin) and G Jeremy Lamb (left knee) each missed a second straight game.

"DeMar DeRozan gets the steal off the inbounds and throws it up to Keldon Johnson who hammers it home with two hands. (0:18) SAN ANTONIO -- — San Antonio is emphasizing a youth movement this season. The team's veterans are still capable of pulling out a victory. DeMar DeRozan had 27 points and the Spurs rallied in the final minute to beat the Toronto Raptors 119-114 on Saturday night. San Antonio’s Dejounte Murray added 11 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his first career triple-double. Murray became just the 14th player in franchise history to accomplish the feat. DeRozan’s 3-pointer with a minute remaining pulled the Spurs within 114-113. The 12-year veteran was 3 for 4 on 3-pointers as he joined the list of top 100 scorers in league history. “DeMar, that’s part of his game this season, to shoot more 3s,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “He’s more confident with it and it shows.” The Spurs took a 115-114 lead on LaMarcus Aldridge’s fadeaway put-back with 29.9 seconds remaining. In his 15th season, Aldridge outfought a host of Raptors and even Murray for the rebound after San Antonio missed two previous shots. “It was impressive,” Murray said of Aldridge’s effort. Toronto’s Kyle Lowry missed a pull-up 19-footer with 22.3 seconds left, and 34-year-old Rudy Gay made two free throws at the other end. Fred VanVleet had 27 points and Chris Boucher added 22 points for the Raptors in their first road game. Toronto had six players score in double figures, including all five starters. Patty Mills added 21 points, Lonnie Walker IV had 14 and Aldridge and Keldon Johnson each had 12 for San Antonio. The Spurs had 36 assists to achieve a balanced scoring. “It was all over the place,” DeRozan said of the team’s pace. “That’s how we need to play. When we move the ball the way we did tonight, you’re going to have more outcomes like tonight.” San Antonio was playing its first home game since March 10 prior to the league imposing a four-month layoff due to the pandemic. The Spurs played a standard message outlining league rules for fans in attendance even as the AT&amp;T Center was essentially empty. There were a few family members scattered in the lower bowl, but their support was drowned out by recorded cheers. Popovich expects more 3-point shooting this season, and the Spurs responded by going 14 for 34 after attempting 25 in their season opener against the Memphis Grizzlies. The Spurs had four 3-pointers in the second quarter to match their output in the opening period, but quickening their pace enabled them to add three dunks in the second. TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry had 16 points and 10 rebounds for his second double-double in two games. He is averaging 17 points and 10 assists for Toronto. ... Aron Baynes made his San Antonio debut as a member of the Raptors. In his ninth season, Baynes spent his first three seasons in the NBA with the Spurs before moving on to Detroit, Boston, Phoenix and Toronto. Spurs: Popovich said Derrick White is progressing and “should return soon” after not playing in the preseason and missing the team’s opener following left toe surgery. The team’s starting point guard was running, cutting and shooting 3-pointers prior to the game with no visible signs of discomfort. ... The last two Spurs triple-doubles both came at home against the Raptors. Prior to Murray’s triple-double on Saturday, DeRozan had the team’s previous on Jan. 3, 2019.","401267187"
"Timberwolves rookie Anthony Edwards takes coast-to-coast straight at Rudy Gobert for a turn away jumper. (0:27) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Tough defense is becoming a crucial part of Minnesota’s basketball identity. That was evidenced by what the Timberwolves did in the closing seconds of their 116-111 victory over Utah on Saturday night. The Jazz had a chance to set up a tying 3-pointer and force overtime with 4.2 seconds left. Minnesota did not even let it get to that point. The Timberwolves forced Bojan Bogdanovic to commit a five-second violation on an inbounds pass. Utah got the turnover and Minnesota got the win. “We played a tough game today,” center Karl-Anthony Towns said. “We gutted this one out. Played great defense all around.” D’Angelo Russell had 25 points and six assists to lead the Timberwolves. Towns added 16 points and 12 rebounds. Minnesota had five players score in double figures. Jordan Clarkson scored 23 points and Donovan Mitchell added 21 to lead the Jazz. Mike Conley added 20 points and Rudy Gobert chipped in 18 points and 17 rebounds. Utah trailed over the final three quarters. The Jazz rallied from a double-digit deficit and closed within 107-103 with 2:27 left on back-to-back 3-pointers from Mitchell. Russell hit a jumper and Josh Okogie cut to the basket for a dunk on Minnesota’s next two possessions to keep Utah from erasing the Timberwolves’ lead. Utah made it a one-possession game on Gobert’s putback dunk with 5.9 seconds left. Russell made only 1 of 2 free throws, giving the Jazz a chance to set up a tying 3-pointer that never materialized. “They were the more aggressive team, and they took us out of our actions,” Mitchell said. “We couldn’t use their aggression against them.” Anthony Edwards tallied nine of his 18 points in the first quarter. “He’s going to continue take steps because he has a growth mindset,” Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. “I thought he made plays within the offense too. You don’t see that a lot from a teenager.” The Jazz cut the deficit to a single possession near the midway point of the second quarter, pulling within 44-41 on a floater from Clarkson. Minnesota stamped out the rally with a 10-2 run, punctuated by a banked floater from Beasley, and extended its lead to 54-43. Utah struggled with defending the perimeter and could not adapt enough on offense to handle consistent pressure from the Timberwolves. Minnesota shot 55% from 3-point range in the first half. The Timberwolves made 11 3-pointers before halftime. On the other end, they forced 12 Jazz turnovers and turned those into 17 points. “Minnesota was the more aggressive team in the first half,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “They ran, they defended, and we didn’t do either of those things.” Not much changed for either team in the third quarter. Minnesota led by as many as 17 points in the quarter, going up 86-69 on a Naz Reid 3-pointer. TIP INS Timberwolves: Towns blocked four shots, his highest number of blocks in a game since the 2018-19 season. … Jarrett Culver went 3 of 3 from 3-point range and finished with 14 points. … Minnesota scored 26 points off 18 Utah turnovers. Jazz: Conley scored Utah’s first nine points of the third quarter. … Mitchell and Bogdanovic were a combined 9-of-39 shooting from the field. … Royce O’Neale finished with 13 rebounds. … The Jazz had a moment of silence before tipoff for Utah running back Ty Jordan, who died from an accidental gunshot wound on Friday night. BRINGING BACK THE FANS 1,500 fans piled into Vivint Smart Home Arena to watch the Jazz play their home opener. Utah is one of the few NBA teams to play games in front of fans this season. Fans were limited to seats in the lower bowl and none sat courtside near either team. The Jazz enjoyed playing before actual fans again. “It was a breath of fresh air for all of us,” Conley said. “It sounded like a lot more people than were there. Loved having the fans and our families there."" The Timberwolves also embraced seeing socially distanced faces in the crowd. “It was a dope experience,” Edwards said. GUTTING IT OUT Towns left late in the fourth quarter after falling on his left wrist. He returned to action for the final 57.7 seconds. The wrist was sore after the fall, but the Minnesota center decided to finish things out and play through the pain down the stretch. “I didn’t just want to quit the game and go get X-rays,” Towns said. “I wanted to be there in case my team needed me.” Towns fractured the same wrist in February before the NBA All-Star break.","401267188"
"James Harden sinks a filthy step-back 3-pointer to put the Rockets up 126-125, but he is outdone by CJ McCollum, who drops a game-winning 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds remaining in overtime. (1:34) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — CJ McCollum scored 44 points, including a 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds left that gave the Portland Trail Blazers a 128-126 win over the Houston Rockets on Saturday night. Damian Lillard had 32 points and nine assists to help Portland get its first win. McCollum also had eight assists. McCollum finished 17 for 30 from the field, including 9 for 16 on 3s. Lillard was 5 for 13 from beyond the arc. “I think besides Steph (Curry) and Klay Thompson, we’re the only backcourt in the league that empowers the other,” McCollum said of his partnership with Lillard. “I don’t try to take over the game from him. We work together.” James Harden finished with 44 points and 17 assists for Houston, and Christian Wood added 31 points and 13 rebounds. Harden also had a game-ending turnover on the final possession of overtime. Lillard’s layup pushed the Blazers ahead 125-123 with 30 seconds left in overtime, but Harden made a 3 to push the Rockets ahead with 15.3 seconds left. Then with 6.3 seconds left, the ball found McCollum again and the Blazers’ guard hit another long range shot putting Portland ahead 128-126. “We tried to do everything that it takes as a team to stop whoever has the hot hand,” Harden said of the Blazers'guards. “They both started off slow and then the rest of the game the caught fire.” McCollum’s jumper with 2:03 left in overtime pushed Portland’s lead to 123-118, forcing a Rockets timeout. After Wood cut the Blazers lead to 123-120 with a layup, Harden tied the game again at 123 with 38.6 seconds left. A layup by Wood with less than a minute left in regulation tied the score at 111. Then Lillard put the Blazers ahead at 113-111 with 52 seconds left. Harden responded with a basket of his own to tie it again at 113 with 38.9 seconds left. After a missed 3-pointer by Lillard, Houston’s PJ Tucker was called for a loose ball foul on the rebound with 32 seconds left. Houston’s challenge of the call was unsuccessful, but they were rewarded after Jusuf Nurkic missed both free-throws. Both teams exchanged empty possessions and the game went into overtime. After Portland jumped out to an early lead, Harden’s impact on the game was much more noticeable. Harden had eight assists, to go along with six points, in the first quarter alone. “I feel like my conditioning could be better obviously,” Harden said. “But I think we let it get away from us. I didn’t surprise myself at all. I know what I’m capable of.” For Portland, Lillard made good on his promise to be more aggressive after scoring only nine points in the opener, getting 21 in the first half. But despite the better start and a more aggressive Lillard, things once again went sideways for the Blazers in the second quarter. The Rockets pushed their lead to 40-30 with 8:16 left, all with Harden watching from the bench, forcing a Blazers timeout. Houston pushed its lead to 16 in the first half. Harden, who had a double-double of 17 points and 10 assists by halftime, also looked like he already had great chemistry with free agent acquisition Wood, who had 15 points in the first half, as Houston led 68-58 at the break. Houston’s grip on the game loosened in the third quarter as Portland’s defense started to string some stops together and McCollum got hot. McCollum had four 3s in the third, with three coming in a span of less than 90 seconds on his way to 14 points in the quarter. With the improved defense and McCollum’s play, the Rockets’ lead was cut to 85-84. Houston scored only 17 points in the third quarter. “We were more aggressive, we rotated a lot better,” McCollum said of Portland’s improved defense. “We’re learning, we’re learning on the fly. We have to adjust on the fly and take advantage of our time. Hopefully we will have more quarters like the third quarter tonight.” Houston has 16 players on its roster and entered Saturday with nine eligible, one more than the league minimum. The Rockets’ scheduled opener Wednesday was postponed because nine players were unavailable, including Harden after he was found to have violated league health and safety protocols. His four-day quarantine ended Friday. “It’s been difficult,’ first-year coach Stephen Silas said.” We didn’t have a shoot around on the gameday on Wednesday. “Then we didn’t play, then we didn’t have a practice that day and then we had a shootaround today. My preparation as far as film study has been fine but getting us on the same page has been a bit of a challenge.” The Rockets were still without John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Gordon and Mason Jones on Saturday, all listed as out by the Rockets with “health and safety protocols” as the reason. Those four players, if they return negative tests, will see seven-day quarantines end Wednesday and could play as early as Houston’s home game Thursday against Sacramento. Ben McLemore and Kenyon Martin Jr. are away from the team and self-isolating, the Rockets said, and Chris Clemons is lost for the season with an Achilles injury. “We have a chance,” Harden said of the Rockets, with the hope they will have a more complete unit next week. “We just have to get things clicking faster than later. We all know the West is a very strong conference, there’s no nights off. We have to be prepared each and every game.” TIP INS Blazers: Rodney Hood scored his first points since returning from a torn Achilles he suffered over a year ago. Hood was scoreless in his first game back on Thursday, but got going with a 3-pointer in the first quarter. Hood averaged 11 points per game and shot 49% from the 3-point line in 21 games with Portland last season. Hood was also a key member of the Blazers team that went to the Western Conference Finals in 2019. Hood Rockets: With only nine active players and Harden being a late arrival to training camp, Silas was asked about what kind of workload the former MVP would have. “James will play in the 30s for sure,” Silas anticipated. “I’ll be talking to him constantly through the game. We have to look at this long-term we can’t forsake the future and having him go out play 41, 42, 43 minutes but we are going to try and win the game.” As for the four players currently in quarantine, Silas said he expects to have them back for the team’s practice scheduled for Wednesday.","401267189"
"Chris Paul nails a 3-pointer before the halftime buzzer sounds for the Suns vs. the Kings. (0:23) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — De’Aaron Fox had 24 points and seven assists, Richaun Holmes and Buddy Hield combined for five free throws in the final two minutes and the Sacramento Kings held off the Phoenix Suns 106-103 on Saturday night. Marvin Bagley III added 13 points and 11 rebounds, Harrison Barnes had 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Hield finished with 14 points for Sacramento. Devin Booker scored 26 points for Phoenix. Chris Paul had 22 points and 12 assists. “We found a way to grind out a win,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “There’s lots of games throughout an NBA season that are going to require that type of mentality. Give our guys a lot of credit for the effort they played with.” Three nights after beating Denver on a last-second tip-in by Hield in overtime, the Kings had to sweat out another close one. Sacramento led 99-97 before Holmes scored on a three-point play with 1:43 remaining. Paul responded with a short jumper and free throw before Holmes made a pair from the stripe. After Booker missed a jumper with 4.7 seconds left, Hield made two free throws. Paul then made a 3-pointer at the buzzer. “I don’t know if relieved is the right word.” Barnes said. “We were just trying to maintain the edge that we had in that second half of that Denver game that really allowed us to kind of get over the hump and get that win. We were going to try to bring that into this game.” The loss ended the Suns’ nine-game winning streak dating to last season when Phoenix won its final eight games in the NBA bubble. Suns coach Monty Williams was troubled by his team’s perimeter shooting and noted that Phoenix has to regroup quickly with another game in Sacramento on Sunday. “It’s going to be a matter of will,” Williams said. “Both of us know each other. We have the fresh memory of tonight’s game. Coming out tomorrow, it’s going to be which team imposes its will on the other. We have to rise to the challenge.” The Kings got off to an 11-0 start and led most of the first half. Barnes sparked the fast start with a low bucket, a steal and a dunk. The Suns closed within 58-54 at halftime after Paul’s 3-pointer at the buzzer was waved off. The play was reviewed and overturned. TWO DOWN, 70 TO GO Sacramento is off to a 2-0 start for the first time since beating Cleveland and Philadelphia to open the 2003-04 season under then-coach Rick Adelman. The Kings last made the playoffs in 2005-06, the longest active drought in the NBA. “It’s nice but it’s mainly nice because it continues to support the journey we’re on and support the work that’s being put in by our players,” Walton said. “We’ll take it.’’ MISFIRING SUNS Phoenix shot 41.8% from the floor and was especially cold beyond the arc, going 11 of 44 on 3-pointers. Sacramento wasn’t much better at 5 for 23. “We have enough shooters to really knock those in at a higher clip,” said Jae Crowder, who had three 3s. “Looking at (the Kings) they made five 3s and beat us pretty good.” TIP-INS Suns: Booker had 11 points in the third quarter … Phoenix missed 16 of its first 3-point attempts. ... Phoenix last won 10 straight in 2010. Kings: Bagley has had a double-double in each of Sacramento’s first two games this season. The second overall pick in 2018, Bagley had only three during an injury-plagued season a year ago.","401267190"
"Luka Doncic drives down the lane and puts up the tough layup that hits the top of the backboard and falls in. (0:18) LOS ANGELES -- — Luka Doncic scored 24 points and the Dallas Mavericks led by a NBA-record 50 points at halftime in a 124-73 rout of the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday to earn their first win of the season. Josh Richardson added 21 points and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 18 points for the Mavs, who kept up their dominance in the second half, too. “There’s no huge secret,” Richardson said. “We just got up and played well. We played with a sense of urgency.” The Clippers trailed 77-27 at halftime, with their 50-point deficit being the largest at the break in the shot-clock era, which began in 1954-55. Paul George led the Kawhi Leonard-less Clippers with 15 points before sitting out the second half. Serge Ibaka added 13 points and nine rebounds over three quarters of the team's first loss. The Clippers began with victories over the defending NBA champion Lakers and Denver. “It's not that big of a deal,” George said. “Yes, we got our butts kicked today, but it's one game.” Los Angeles got outrebounded 32-16, had just three assists, and missed 18 of 19 3-pointers in the first half. George was the only Clipper in double figures with 13 after missing all six of his 3-point attempts. “It was a tough game, coming from Christmas. I enjoyed my Christmas Day yesterday, today just popped up on me a little too fast,” George said. “I take full responsibility. It'll be a different situation next game. We will be ready.” Doncic had 18 points, seven rebounds and four assists in the first half. He scored as many points (13) as the Clippers in the first quarter. The Mavs scored nearly every time down the court while forcing the Clippers into 9 of 37 field-goal shooting. “Everything was clicking on all cylinders,” said Hardaway Jr., adding that the team didn't realize how big the lead was until they were in the locker room at halftime. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle emphasized staying consistent in the second half. “The challenge is to maintain that level of competitiveness,” he said. “Our guys established a standard for collective toughness and will that we need to find a way to maintain.” The Clippers opened the third quarter on a 10-0 run — their biggest spurt of the game — to get within 40 points. The Mavs got right back to putting the hammer down. They connected on four consecutive 3-pointers — three by Hardaway Jr. — to restore their lead to 50. They were ahead 104-57 going into the fourth. Doncic just missed a triple-double, finishing with nine rebounds and eight assists. He has scored 83 points in his first three games of the season, the first two of which were losses. “We showed who we are. People judge us like first two games of season, it’s a long season,” Doncic said. “We got to keep going like that. We got to play defense.” The fourth quarter belonged to the teams' reserves, although the Clippers kept Luke Kennard, who started in place of Leonard, in the rotation for a bit. The Mavs' bench was on its feet and whipping towels in the air to celebrate Josh Green's one-handed fastbreak dunk that extended their lead to 53 points. Former Clipper Boban Marjanovic polished off a 12-0 run with a jumper that pushed the Mavs' lead to 120-63, their largest of the game. “We weren’t letting each other look up at the score,"" Mavs forward James Johnson said. The Mavs shot 49% from the field, made 14 3-pointers and outrebounded the Clippers 54-36 in the game. Los Angeles had 13 assists after notching 32 against Denver on Christmas. The Clippers shot 26 of 76 from the floor and made just 4 of 33 3-pointers. “You throw it away,” first-year Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “Our guys didn’t have a lot of pop on either end of the floor.” Leonard sat out after needing eight stitches in his mouth after accidentally getting elbowed by the 7-foot Ibaka going for a rebound in Friday’s win at Denver. He watched the debacle from the bench. TIP-INS Mavericks: They won for the first time in three road games to start the season. Eleven of their first 16 games are being played away from home. ...

"Kyrie Irving evades the defense to score a bucket with his left hand. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Gordon Hayward gave Hornets fans a little taste of why owner Michael Jordan felt strongly about luring him to Charlotte with a four-year, $120 million contract last month. Hayward, acquired in a sign-and-trade with Boston, had 28 points, seven assists and six rebounds, and Charlotte handed the Brooklyn Nets their first loss of the season, 106-104 on Sunday night. Hayward did a little bit of everything, making 12 of 20 shots while setting up his team with good scoring opportunities and helping the Hornets out of some potentially bad possessions with solid plays before the shot clock expired. “He brings us calm and poise out there,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. “He settles us when we need a good possession, an efficient possession. He is able to create that.” The 6-foot-7 small forward said he's just starting to get comfortable with his new teammates after a limited training camp and missing two preseason games with a broken finger. “We are constantly building that chemistry,” Hayward said. “We didn’t have as much time as we wanted to get to know each other. We are starting to figure each other out. When I do, that will ultimately help me be a better playmaker.” Terry Rozier added 19 points, including two clutch free throws, and P.J. Washington finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Hornets, who limited the Nets to 42.7% shooting from the floor. Kevin Durant led the Nets with 29 points, and Kyrie Irving chipped in with 25 points. After winning their first two games by 26 and 28 points, Brooklyn as finally in a close game in the fourth quarter, which Durant said he enjoyed. He also said the Nets need to learn they'll get everyone’s best game every night because they're considered a favorite in the East. “It’s good to have that target on your backs — and it will bring out the best in all of us,” Durant said. They certainly got Charlotte’s best game. “We have to treat every team like its Brooklyn,” Hayward said. “We had this sense of urgency.” The Hornets appeared to break open the game early in the fourth quarter behind seven quick points from Hayward. But the 16-point lead nearly evaporated as Durant and Irving began to play with a sense of urgency and helped cut the lead to 101-99 with less than two minutes to play. But with a chance to tie or take the lead, Irving's driving layup was blocked and Devonte Graham knocked down a corner 3 at the other end to give Charlotte a cushion. A short while later Durant missed an open pull-up jumper with 7.4 seconds left with the Nets trailing by two. Rozier made two free throws to make it a two-possession game and seal the win. “It looked good when it was leaving my hands,"" Durant said. ""Maybe I could have shot the 3 (instead). I’m sure we will get that shot later in the season and hopefully I can capitalize.” TIP INS Nets: Spencer Dinwiddle left the game in the third quarter with a right knee strain and did not return. It's unclear if he will play Monday night. ... Brooklyn was outrebounded 54-46. Hornets: Washington appeared to roll his ankle with 5.3 seconds remaining and left the game. Borrego said the power forward sprained his ankle, but isn't sure the extent of the injury.

"Robin Lopez saves a pass from going out of bounds and throws up a wild hook shot that miraculously goes in. (0:24) WASHINGTON -- — Timing can be everything and right now the Orlando Magic have been the better team in the all important fourth quarter to start the season. Markelle Fultz and Terrence Ross each scored 26 points as the Orlando Magic mounted a big fourth quarter comeback and beat the Washington Wizards 120-113 on Sunday night to start a season 3-0 for the first time since 2009-10. Nikola Vucevic scored in the post to give Orlando the lead for good at 114-113 with 25.1 seconds left as the Magic scored the final 10 points of the game in defeating the Wizards for the sixth straight time. “We’ve played three good fourth quarters,” said Magic coach Steve Clifford. “We could easily be 0-3 right now. All three games that we’ve played, the deciding quarter’s been the fourth quarter. How you win can build confidence….I think it’s good to win this way.” Vucevic finished with 15 points and eight rebounds while Evan Fournier added 19 as the Magic outscored the Wizards 43-19 in the fourth quarter making it the third largest fourth quarter comeback in team history. Bradley Beal had 29 points and seven assists but was just 10 for 29 from the field while Russell Westbrook was held out for rest as Washington dropped to 0-3 for the first time since 2016-17. “It’s not where we wanted to be but it’s where we are,” said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. “We’ve got to get the first win first before we get anything else.” While it will become more commonplace throughout this unique season, Washington and Orlando became the first teams to play a back-to-back in the same venue since Jan. 24-25, 1988 when Washington hosted Philadelphia. “Any time you can get a win on the road, it’s big,” said Fultz, who played his high school basketball in the DC area. “To be able to go 2-0 here is a huge. I think it’s a big confidence booster for us to show us what we can do. I still think we’ve got to start out a little better.” Brooks rested Westbrook in the second game of a back-to-back.

Beal, who had averaged 35.5 points per game in the previous four meetings with Orlando, missed two shots in the final 19 seconds… NO OFF DAYS While technically out on rest, Westbrook was not taking it easy at all. The two-time scoring champ and nine-time all-star stood for most of the game while shouting encouragement to his new teammates and letting the referees know he was still in the building. Westbrook often greeted the players with high-fives and chest bumps during time-outs. FOOTBALL SUNDAY Vucevic was called for two fouls in the first quarter, both while guarding Bradley Beal. After the second foul, Vucevic appeared frustrated and mimicked a punting motion while holding the ball. Orlando was issued a delay of game warning.","401267193"

(0:20) NEW ORLEANS -- — Brandon Ingram had 28 points and 11 rebounds and the New Orleans Pelicans held on for a 98-95 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday night. The Spurs had a chance to tie after Steven Adams, whose put-back dunk had given New Orleans a 97-91 lead with two minutes left, missed a pair of free throws with 11 seconds remaining. But Eric Bledsoe blocked DeMar DeRozan's 3-point attempt from behind in the final seconds to preserve a victory that New Orleans first-year coach Stan Van Gundy found gratifying on a night when his team overcame relatively poor shooting. “As a coach, these are my favorite kinds of wins,” Van Gundy said. ""Not that I want to shoot like that every night, but to shoot 38% — and 20% from 3 — and be able to get a win against a good team, to me, is a great way to win. “The first step is we got to get to where we don’t beat ourselves, and I'm talking specifically about turnovers and fouls,"" Van Gundy added. The Pelicans had just eight turnovers to the Spurs' 15, outscored San Antonio 21-8 at the foul line and had 12 offensive rebounds to the Spurs' four. Zion Williamson had 18 points — highlighted by five dunks — to go with 11 rebounds and five steals for the Pelicans. Lonzo Ball had 16 points and five steals, and Josh Hart had 12 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Williamson missed 15 of 22 shots but still managed his third double-double in three games — and a career-high in steals. “That’s a big part of building a wining culture,"" Williamson said. ""When one thing isn’t working for you, don’t let it affect the other parts of your game, like defense and rebounding.” Rudy Gay scored 22 points and Lonnie Walker IV had 16 for the Spurs, who lost for the first time after winning their first two regular season games. “I wish I could have knocked down a couple open 3s and kind of helped us a little bit more,” Gay said. “But the last play, obviously, they sniffed it out. We couldn’t get what we wanted out of it.” Keldon Johnson had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Dejounte Murray had 13 points, but also turned the ball over six times. New Orleans led by 15 in the third quarter when JJ Redick hit a pull-up jumper while being fouled by Gay and completed the 3-point play to make it 79-64. The Spurs then suddenly seized momentum with a 21-3 run that put them back in front, 85-82, early in the fourth quarter.

Osman scored 14 points off the bench and Larry Nance Jr. had 13 points and five assists. “I still don’t think we’ve put our best four quarters together yet, but that’s our goal,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Playing agenda-less basketball, that’s what the guys have bought into.” Drummond, who has three double-doubles, netted 15 points and 10 rebounds in the first half as Cleveland carried a 64-50 advantage into the break. The Cavaliers forced 22 turnovers, six by Simmons, and turned them into 35 points. “I thought our spacing was bad,” Rivers said. “I want Ben to attack the basket, but I also want him to make plays and have a good balance. We won two games, but we just didn’t play well tonight.” Both teams completed their first back-to-back set of the season. Cleveland beat Detroit 128-119 in double overtime Saturday, while Philadelphia won 109-89 in New York. “It was a good back-to-back win because I am exhausted,” Drummond said, laughing. WAITING GAME Cavaliers G Kevin Porter Jr. (personal reasons) has yet to dress for a game as the front office mulls whether to discipline him for an offseason arrest. The second-year pro was expected to serve as Cleveland’s sixth man. “We’re still having those conversations, still working through the plan, organizationally,” Bickerstaff said.

"Giannis Antetokounmpo tips away the pass and runs the floor for the huge one-handed dunk. (0:18) NEW YORK -- — Tom Thibodeau's first victory as Knicks coach came surprisingly easy against a top opponent, as New York routed the Milwaukee Bucks 130-110 on Sunday night. Julius Randle had 29 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists, Elfrid Payton scored 27 points in his best game as a Knick, and New York led by as much as 28 against the team that had the best record in the NBA the previous two seasons. The Knicks were among the NBA's worst during that time but are hoping for a turnaround under Thibodeau, the former Coach of the Year who engineered comebacks in Chicago and Minnesota. “As long as we’re putting the work into it, we’ll get better,” Thibodeau said. The Knicks opened his tenure by hanging with Indiana and Philadelphia for a half before those teams pulled away in the final two quarters. This time, they used a 16-2 run late in the first half to open a 61-43 lead, then got 12 points apiece from Randle and Payton in the third to make it a 21-point lead heading to the fourth. The Knicks opened the final period with seven straight points for a 103-75 bulge. “We put good halves together against Indiana and last night,” Randle said. “We've just got to put the second half, full game together and that’s what we did tonight.” Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 13 rebounds for the Bucks, who were coming off a 39-point trouncing of Golden State on Christmas and looking to build momentum before playing two straight games in Miami against the team that eliminated them in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Teams are sometimes being scheduled for consecutive road games in one city this season as a way to reduce traveling during the coronavirus pandemic. But after going 20 for 37 on 3-pointers Friday, the Bucks were 7 for 38 (18%) behind the arc against the Knicks. They also allowed the Knicks to shoot 54% from the field and 59% from 3-point range. “They had a great night shooting and we've probably got be a lot better defensively,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Alec Burks scored 18 points and RJ Barrett bounced back from a poor performance against Philadelphia with 17 as the Knicks had plenty of offense even without injured rookies Obi Toppin (calf) and Immanuel Quickley (hip) for the second straight game. Frank Ntilikina had 12 points on 4-for-4 shooting from 3-point range, making New York's point guards 7 for 7 behind the arc. Payton made all three of his attempts as part of a 12-for-16 night overall. “I think we all know we have to be better,” Bucks reserve Bobby Portis said. TIP-INS Bucks: Khris Middleton scored 22 points. ... Jrue Holiday, who had 64% of his shots in his first two games with the Bucks, shot 4 for 10 for eight points. ... Portis, who played for the Knicks last season, had 17 points. Knicks: Thibodeau said G Austin Rivers, who hasn't played this season because of a sore right groin, has made progress and would go through the contact portion of practice for the first time on Monday. ... Thibodeau said he expected Quickley to be able to jump right back in when he was cleared, but thought Toppin would need more time because of the nature of his injury prevents him from doing much while he's out. PAYTON'S POINTS Payton's best game last season, his first in New York, was 20 points. He opened 2020-21 by going 3 for 13 in two games.","401267196"
"Malcolm Brogdon pokes the ball away from Marcus Smart and takes it the other way for an easy slam dunk. (0:21) INDIANAPOLIS -- — With Indiana down one in the final seconds Sunday, coach Nate Bjorkgren asked Domantis Sabontis to bail out the Pacers. The All-Star forward delivered. He put the ball on the floor, drove hard toward the basket, muscled in the go-ahead layup and drew a foul with 8.4 seconds to play. Sure he missed the free throw, but Indiana’s defense forced an errant 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left and held on for a 108-107 victory over Boston. “Coach is a genius. He has a different play for everything,” Sabonis said. “He trusts every single one of us and that makes it easier for the players. We all trust him and just try to execute as best we can.” So far, Sabonis has thrived in Bjorkgren's new system. He followed Saturday's triple-double, with 19 points, 10 rebounds and five assists — his third double-double in three games and No. 100 in his career. And Sabonis had plenty of help, too. Malcolm Brogdon scored a season-high 25 points and T.J. Warren added 17 as the Pacers improved to 3-0 for the first time since 2013-14, sweeping their first back-to-back of the season — barely. “Yes, it was designed that way,” Bjorkgren said after drawing up the play for Sabonis during Indiana's final timeout. “But I thought the other four guys really moved and shifted the defense, too, and that helped open it up for Domas.” The Celtics spent most of the second half playing catch up before finally taking a 107-106 lead when Robert Williams III stole an inbound pass and found Marcus Smart for a breakaway layup with 11.8 seconds to go. After a missed free throw Sabonis, Boston called timeout to set up a play and Jayson Tatum's long 3 was off the mark. Tatum finished with 25 points and Jaylen Brown had 18 as the Celtics lost their second straight. “We definitely beat ourselves tonight and there was still an opportunity to win the game,"" Brown said. “We gave it up at the end. We’ve got to come back and be better, be more physical and more solid on defense.” TIP-INS Celtics: Tatum also had 11 rebounds and five assists. ... Payton Pritchard added 13 points off the bench. ... Smart finished with 11 points and six assists. .... Robert Williams III had 12 points. ... Boston had 18 turnovers and got outrebounded 37-34. Pacers: Brogdon had five rebounds and five assists. ... T.J. Warren had 17 points and Doug McDermott added 16 off the bench. ... McDermott has had three straight double-figure games and went 3 of 7 on 3s. ... Myles Turner had 10 points, seven rebounds and five blocks and now has 17 blocks in three games. ... Indiana had 23 assists on 45 baskets. ... It's only the seventh time in the Pacers NBA history they've started 3-0. OLADIPO OUT The Pacers deactivated two-time All-Star guard Victor Oladipo on the second game of a back-to-back. Officially, the reason given was injury management — a reference to the ruptured quad tendon in his right knee, an injury he suffered in January 2019. Unofficially, this was something Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Prtichard wanted when he was searching for a new coach this fall. Coach Nate Bjorkgren responded by mixing and matching his rotations. HE SAID IT “I think that final play was tough,"" Brown said. “It was not all of his (Williams') fault. When Sabonis gets going with his left hand, he’s tough. He got one tonight on us.""","401267197"
"Stephen Curry dishes to James Wiseman for a powerful slam. (0:18) CHICAGO -- — Although Stephen Curry is one of the best finishers in NBA history, he was more of a decoy late on Sunday night. Damion Lee hit a 3-pointer with 1.7 seconds remaining and Curry scored 36 points, sending Golden State to a 129-128 victory over the Chicago Bulls for the Warriors' first win of the season. With the Chicago defense focused on the sharp-shooting Curry, Lee inbounded the ball to Kevon Looney with 5 seconds left and then ran over to receive a handoff with Curry drawing a crowd on the left wing. Lee fired from a few feet beyond the top of the 3-point arc for the game-winner. Lee was the third option on the play behind Curry and Andrew Wiggins. “It just shows how much the coaching staff and my teammates believe in me,” Lee said. “I'm going to enjoy it. The main thing is we got the win.” Lee finished with 12 points on 4-for-5 shooting on 3s. Curry was 11 for 25 from the field, including 5 of 15 on 3-pointers — a day after making 105 straight 3s to finish practice at the Bulls’ facility. “(Lee) handled it great,” Curry said of the final play. “Him and Loon had a great connection. He was ready to shot. He made a lot of big shots tonight and that was the biggest one to keep us from an 0-3 hole.” Zach LaVine had 33 points and appeared to hit the game-winner for winless Chicago with a 10-foot pullup with 5 seconds to play. LaVine, though, thought he left too much time on the clock. “I think I shot it a little too early,” he said. “I wish I had shot the ball with two or three seconds on the clock. Even if I miss, we still have overtime.” Wendell Carter Jr. had 22 points and 13 rebounds, and Lauri Markkanen added 22 for the Bulls (0-3). Chicago committed 24 turnovers. Markkanen sat out the final few minutes with a calf contusion. With his first 3 late in the first quarter, Curry became the third NBA player to amass 2,500 career made 3-pointers. Ray Allen (2,973) and Reggie Miller (2,560) are the others. Sunday's game was Curry's 702nd in the NBA. Allen played in 1,300 games and Miller 1,389. Late in the third quarter, Curry set a Warriors record for most consecutive made free throws with his 61st dating to last season. He finished 9 for 9 for the game to run his streak to 64. Rick Barry, who shot underhand from the line, held the previous record with 60 straight in 1976. Golden State led 60-56 at halftime, but Chicago started quickly in the third and grabbed an 83-73 advantage with 4 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. The Bulls led 97-93 entering the fourth. With the score tied at 100, the Bulls went on a 10-2 spurt for a 110-102 lead with under eight minutes to play. LaVine scored the final seven points, capping the run with a dunk. The Bulls maintained the multi-possession margin until Curry hit a 3 with 2:02 left to pull Golden State to 123-121. Otto Porter Jr. then made a 3 for the Bulls with 54 seconds to go, but Curry answered with a three-point play. After a miss by LaVine, Looney tied it on a putback with 16.9 seconds remaining, setting the stage for the dramatic finish. TIP-INS Warriors: F Draymond Green (right foot) missed his third straight game, but scrimmaged on Saturday and is close to returning. “Draymond got through the scrimmage really well,” coach Steve Kerr said. “We felt from a conditioning standpoint, it made sense to give him the next two games off and give him another four, five days of conditioning.” Bulls: F Thaddeus Young (lower left leg infection) missed his third consecutive game. CHRISS INJURED Golden State C Marquese Chriss suffered a fibular fracture and ankle injury to his right leg during a scrimmage at practice on Saturday. He is out indefinitely and will undergo surgery later this week. The 23-year-old averaged 6.5 points and 6.5 rebounds in the Warriors' first two games. “He went up for a lob and landed awkwardly,” Kerr said. “We don’t know how long he’ll be out. We’ll know more after surgery.”","401267198"
"Buddy Hield drives to the basket and pulls up for a fadeaway bucket. (0:16) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Mikal Bridges scored 22 points, Cameron Johnson had 21 in 21 minutes and the Phoenix Suns pulled away with two big second-half runs to beat the Sacramento Kings 116-100 on Sunday night. Devin Booker added 20 points, five rebounds and five assists, and Deandre Ayton had 11 points and 15 rebounds for the Suns, a night after a 106-103 loss in the opener of the two-game set in Sacramento. That loss snapped the Suns’ winning streak at nine. Booker talked about the importance of Phoenix getting back on track. “We talked about trusting the system. We have a lot of new players out there trying to figure each other out but always with the right intention,” said Booker, a first-time All-Star a year ago. “We’re getting better. Tonight was a step forward in that on both ends. We just have to continue to grow.” Buddy Hield scored 17 points for Sacramento. First-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton added 15 points and six assists. Tied at 73 with 4:45 left in the third quarter, the Suns closed the period with a 17-5 run. Phoenix extended its lead to 107-88 on Booker’s fast-break layup during an 18-5 run in the fourth. Bridges was 9 of 15 from the field, going 4 of 8 from long range. Johnson was 7 of 9, hitting 3 of 4 3-pointers. He made all four of his free throws “When teams throw junk defenses at me and they’re blitzing a lot, we have guys that can make them pay,” Booker said. “That’s why we have the team that we do. Not surprising to me. We knew from the night before that we had a lot of open looks that we didn’t make and me myself needed to take care of the ball better. We’ll figure it out.” Kings coach Luke Walton said his team made too many mistakes. “It’s a good learning experience,” Walton said. “They’ve got guys over there, Chris Paul leading the group and an All-Star in Booker, they’ve got pride. They lost the first night, we knew it was going to be even tougher tonight. We just had some real mental breakdowns and when we did they were ready to pounce on it.” Paul had eight points and 12 assists. The Phoenix newcomer spent much of the fourth quarter cheering on his teammates while casually perched on a barrier between the bench and the court. Ayton helped the Suns to a 44-39 edge in rebounds. TIP-INS Suns: The last time Phoenix played the same team in the same city on consecutive days during the regular season was Nov. 2-3, 1990, when it opened the season with two games against the Utah Jazz in the Tokyo Dome. Kings: The Kings were attempting to go 3-0 for the first time since 2002-03. … Owner Vivek Ranadive sat near midcourt, socially distanced from five others in the organization who also watched from courtside.","401267199"
"Kyle Kuzma drives baseline and makes a fancy pass to Montrezl Harrell for an easy two-handed flush in the lane. (0:15) LOS ANGELES -- — Kyle Kuzma scored 20 points in the first half while starting in Anthony Davis' place, and LeBron James added 18 points in the Los Angeles Lakers' 127-91 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night. Star big men Davis and Karl-Anthony Towns sat out. Davis has a bruised calf that isn't expected to be a long-term problem, while Minnesota's Towns has a more serious dislocated left wrist. Kuzma had a phenomenal opening half in his first start since agreeing to a three-year, $40 million contract extension with the NBA champions. He hit three consecutive 3-pointers to open the scoring in a wire-to-wire win for Los Angeles, which led by 20 in the first quarter and 36 in the third. Lakers coach Frank Vogel believes Kuzma's overall game evolved last season when he moved into a supporting role with Davis' arrival. “It’s not really about scoring,” Kuzma said. “I just try to impact the game and take shots when I have them, and that’s made me a better player. ... I just try to seize the moment. In a season like this, playing back-to-backs, the coach and the organization being conservative with LeBron and AD allows me to have those nights when I can show what I work on every day.” Marc Gasol had 12 points, eight assists and seven rebounds in just 21 minutes for the Lakers, who spaced the floor and moved the ball superbly with 32 assists. “Marc sees the game very similar to how I see it,” James said. “We’ve got guys that can make the right play, make the right pass. You saw some unbelievable passes tonight from Kuz, from (Alex Caruso). The list goes on and on. Nobody should ever feel pressured to take a bad shot because we can always move the ball.” No. 1 pick Anthony Edwards had 15 points on 6-of-21 shooting in the Timberwolves' first loss of the season. Minnesota missed its first 12 3-point attempts while falling behind by 23 early in the second quarter. “I thought we didn't play our brand of basketball at all,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “There were a lot of things I didn’t like tonight, so we’ll dive into the film. We’ve got a good locker room there. We’ve got guys who want to do the right thing. They feel the same way, I’m sure.” TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jaden McDaniels scored his first NBA points on a pair of 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. ... Josh Okogie went to the locker room in the second quarter. The team said it was cramping. ... Towns was examined Sunday in Los Angeles. He won't require surgery, but will be evaluated weekly. Lakers: James rolled his left ankle in the first half for the second time in a week, but stayed in the game. He is questionable for Monday. ... Caruso strained a hand muscle.

"Trae Young lobs the ball to Clint Capela, who finishes the alley-oop with authority. (0:18) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 29 points, Bogdan Bogdanovic added 17 and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Detroit Pistons 128-120 in their home opener Monday night. John Collins finished with 15 points for the Hawks, who are 3-0 for the first time since 2016-17 and hit 20 3-pointers while shooting 47.6% beyond the arc. Young’s 3 from the right wing put Atlanta up 122-112 with 1:47 remaining before Jerami Grant’s 3 trimmed the lead to five with 1:05 left. Collins hit two free throws and Young sealed it with four free throws in the final minute. “Being 3-0 is great for us and for me it’s all about taking it one game at a time,"" Young said. “We're going up to Brooklyn to play a really good team and we need to bring the same energy and effort. I’m super excited about this team. Just need to get everyone healthy and it’ll be fun."" The Pistons dropped to 0-3. They were without star forward Blake Griffin and reserve guard Derrick Rose, who were given the night off to rest. Coach Dwane Casey started Josh Jackson, who scored 27 points in Griffin’s spot. Grant had 27 points, and Delon Wright chipped in 18 off the bench. “He’s shooting the ball well,"" Casey said of Jackson. “The ball seems to find him in certain situations. I love the way he's been a bright surprise for us. He’s that diamond in the rough you have to find everyone once and a while."" Wright made two free throws to pull the Pistons within five at the 3:15 mark of the third, but the Hawks went on a 29-16 run that culminated with Cam Reddish’s alley-oop dunk, Bogdanovic’s runner and Rajon Rondo’s jumper, making it 115-91 with 7:43 remaining. Detroit made another move, pulling within 115-106 on two free throws by Grant at the 4:16 mark, but Collins answered with an alley-oop dunk and Young hit two foul shots to put Atlanta up 119-108 with 2:43 to go. The Hawks made 16 of their first 25 shots before the Pistons went on a 13-2 run to pull within two in the second quarter, but Atlanta got hot again. Young scored on an acrobatic runner off the glass and converted the three-point play to make it 46-41 at the 7:04 mark of the second. Bogdanovic followed with a 3 from the right wing, De’Andre Hunter hit a 3 from the left wing, Young knocked down three free throws and Bruno Fernando hit a putback to make it 62-49. The Hawks took their first double-digit lead on Solomon Hill’s 3 at the 3:29 mark of the first. “We definitely can score,"" Hill said. “I think our offensive efficiency needs to be cleaned up.

"The Grizzlies' Ja Morant lands on a Nets player's foot after trying to block a shot and leaves the game in a wheelchair. (0:31) NEW YORK -- — Ja Morant could barely stand, needing a wheelchair to take him from the court area after spraining his left ankle. Having already lost their first two games, now the Memphis Grizzlies had lost the NBA Rookie of the Year and their best player. “A moment like that can really test you, but our guys just kept on fighting,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins. And Morant was there to watch them. The Grizzlies earned their first victory of the season, outlasting the short-handed Brooklyn Nets 116-111 in overtime Monday night. Morant was hurt late in the first half when he leaped to block a shot by Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and landed on the Nets forward's foot. Morant immediately hopped off the floor, then laid on the floor in pain before being wheeled to the back of the arena. He rejoined his teammates on the bench in the second half with his foot in a walking boot, offering energy and support to carry them through a tense finish. “He's a team player. He loves his squad,” teammate Dillon Brooks said. Morant watched Brandon Clarke score the go-ahead basket on a follow shot with 41 seconds left in overtime before the Grizzlies put it away with free throws. Morant averaged 36 points in the two losses, scoring a career-high 44 in the season opener, but the Grizzlies found enough offense without him Monday. “Unbelievable display of resiliency by our group,” Jenkins said. Kyle Anderson scored a career-high 28 points and Brooks added 24 for the Grizzlies. Clarke had 16 points and Jonas Valanciunas finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds. “We kind of knew that this was a game that we had to win no matter what,” Clarke said. Caris LeVert had 28 points and 11 assists for the Nets, who rested Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving while losing for the second straight night. Brooklyn is also without Spencer Dinwiddie, who will have surgery to repair a partially torn right ACL sustained Sunday. With both stars returning this season from injury, the Nets decided Sunday night they would rest Durant after he played a season-high 36 minutes in a loss to Charlotte. They listed him on the injury report Monday morning. Irving was added a few hours later. The players forced to take on bigger roles perhaps ran out of gas in overtime, when the Nets managed five points from LeVert but nothing more, shooting 2 for 10. “Early in the season I think guys are still acclimating to back-to-backs, let alone an overtime back-to-back,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. Neither team was ahead by more than seven in the second half, when there were 16 lead changes, so it wasn’t a surprise when they needed five more minutes after LeVert missed a 3-pointer on the last possession of regulation. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis started a three-game road trip. ... Anderson's previous career high came in the last game, when he had 20 points against Atlanta. Nets: Luwawu-Cabarrot scored 21 points, but only two after halftime. ... The Nets opened a six-game homestand, their longest since playing six straight games at Barclays Center during the 2015-16 season. SPENCER'S SURGERY The Nets said Dinwiddie would have surgery scheduled for next week and further updates would be provided afterward. In an Instagram post, Dinwiddie recalled returning from a more severe knee injury in college seven months later. “Next question: Will I miss the road to a (at)brooklynnets 2021 championship? My response: As we’ve seen before. Crazier things have happened,” he wrote. BACK IN BROOKLYN The Grizzlies were the last visiting team to win in Brooklyn — nine months ago. They crushed the Nets 118-79 on March 4, a week before the season was suspended because of the coronavirus.","401267202"
"Donovan Mitchell attacks the basket and banks in a tough shot as the Jazz hang on to defeat the Thunder 110-109. (0:33) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Donovan Mitchell hit a go-ahead layup with 7 seconds left and finished with 20 points, lifting the Utah Jazz over the Oklahoma City Thunder 110-109 on Monday night. Bogan Bogdanovich scored 23 points and Mike Conley added 20 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for the Jazz, who ended a 17-game losing streak in regular season road games against the Thunder, including games in the NBA's Orlando bubble last season. Utah’s last win in Oklahoma City came on Oct. 31, 2010. “We tightened it up down the stretch,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “You have to get stops to win. They played hard. I don’t feel like we played our best, but that’s the challenge, to figure out how to win when you don’t have your best game. We hope we can take this and build on it and keep getting better.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who hit a game-winning shot in the Thunder’s season-opening win in Charlotte, missed a driving layup in heavy traffic at the buzzer. He had 23 points and seven assists, while Luguentz Dort led the Thunder with a career-high 26 points. “We had a shot there at the end, which is all you can ask for,” said the Thunder’s Al Horford, who scored 11 points. “There was a lot of positive. It was just too bad we couldn’t finish the game.” An 8-0 run by Oklahoma City to start the fourth quarter put the Thunder up 95-86, and they led 100-93 after a drive by Darius Bazley with 7:32 left. Utah answered with 11 straight points — the final six by Mitchell — to go ahead 102-100 with 5:10 left. Dort’s 3-pointer with 1:05 left gave Oklahoma City a 109-108 lead. Both teams traded empty possessions before Mitchell’s game-winning basket. Mitchell scored the Jazz’s final 12 points. As the game progressed, “I thought Donovan did a better of job of trying to set up and get help, using screens and pick and roll and kind of take what they give you,” Snyder said. “That’s the idea, to get better as the game goes on.” The Thunder hit their first five shots — including four 3-pointers — to go ahead 17-5 and held that lead for most of the first half, taking a 52-49 advantage into halftime. Mitchell and Bogdanovic were a combined 4 of 19 from the field in the half. After eight lead changes in the third quarter, Oklahoma City led 87-84. Utah was Oklahoma City’s scheduled opponent on March 11, when the Jazz’s Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. The game was postponed moments before tipoff and the NBA season was temporarily shut down.

""This is a growing, learning experience for all of us and we have to get better, on the defensive end especially,"" Rockets coach Stephen Silas said. ""When you have nine guys, and you are kind of doing things on the fly because you don’t have practice time, it can get ugly against a good team and that’s what happened tonight.” Harden put on a show in the second quarter, scoring 21 points and connecting on three 3-pointers, but the Rockets still trailed 70-60 at halftime. Jokic and Murray combined for 36 points in the first half to help spark the Nuggets’ offense, which had struggled during an 0-2 start. Houston pulled to 87-79 on a dunk by Jae’Sean Tate with 5:33 left in the third but the Nuggets closed the period with a 19-4 run and maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the way. Paul Millsap touched off the flurry with a 3-pointer off a feed from Jokic, whose 18 assists represented a career best. “He’s a great player, a great talent,” said Millsap, who finished with 19 points. “You always know when you’re open, he’s going to hit you.” Jokic said he learned to read the floor for passing lanes early on. “I just play like that, trying to find the open guy,” he explained. “My coaches gave me the freedom to do that.” TIP-INS Rockets: On a pregame Zoom call, Silas said he was hopeful most if not all the players either quarantining or self-isolating would be able to emerge from the health protocols and rejoin the team by mid-week. “Wednesday’s practice is an important practice, getting these guys back in and getting the group on the same page,” Silas said. Nuggets: F JaMychal Green, who left the Los Angeles Clippers to join the Nuggets in free agency during the offseason, remains sidelined by a left calf strain. He missed a third straight game but is getting closer to making his Denver debut, resuming practice in a limited fashion.","401267204"
"LeBron James comes up the steal and slams home a one-handed jam against the Trail Blazers. (0:20) LOS ANGELES -- — Damian Lillard scored 21 of his 31 points in the second half, and CJ McCollum had 20 points and 11 assists in the Portland Trail Blazers' 115-107 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night. “Hopefully we can build on it,” Portland coach Terry Stotts said. “We realize that we can be a good team. We just beat the defending champs, and they’re a great team."" Gary Trent Jr. matched his career high with seven 3-pointers while scoring 28 points in the Blazers' second straight win over the Lakers at Staples Center. “It makes us just a little bit more confident to be coming on the road and continuing to grow, continuing to build on our effort,” Lillard said. “We’re just getting more comfortable with each other, and we’re bringing our energy.” LeBron James had 29 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the NBA champions, who finished 2-2 on their season-opening homestand. Dennis Schröder added 24 points, but the Lakers' streak of 59 straight victories when taking a lead into the fourth quarter was snapped. Trent went 10 of 14 from the field while finishing two points off his career high in an impressive response after playing less than six minutes in Portland's win over Houston last Saturday. “I would assume any young player who was coming off the kind of season he had last season would expect to be in the rotation for more than six minutes,” Lillard said. “When that happened, I was like, ‘Let’s see how he responds.’ I think it says a lot about him that he came out and had this type of performance. It speaks to how tough he is mentally and how locked in he is to this season.” Los Angeles kept it close with strong games from James and Schröder, who clearly relishes his matchups with Lillard. But their teammates largely struggled on the second night of a back-to-back. “We were kind of stuck in mud a little bit,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I don’t know (why). We just had trouble sustaining that intensity.” The Lakers made a 15-0 run early in the second half and took a one-point lead into the fourth, but Lillard and McCollum traded big shots down the stretch. Portland finished on a 12-6 surge. TIP-INS Blazers: Carmelo Anthony and Nassir Little missed the game under the NBA's health protocols. ... Zach Collins sat out with a left ankle injury. Lakers: Alex Caruso missed the game under the NBA's health protocols. ... Los Angeles got just 23 bench points, led by Montrezl Harrell's nine. AD QUIET Anthony Davis had 13 points and 10 rebounds in a tentative return from a one-game absence due to a bruised calf. He managed just two points in 17 minutes in the first half, and went 1 for 4 in the second half. “We just weren’t moving the ball that well,” Vogel said. “I’ve got to make sure I get (Davis) the ball in opportunities where he can be aggressive.”","401267205"
"Julius Randle posts a triple-double of 28 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in the Knicks second straight win. (2:13) CLEVELAND -- — Julius Randle had 28 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists for his first triple-double in two years, leading the New York Knicks to a 95-86 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night. Randle, who scored 18 in the first half as New York built a 16-point lead, completed his seventh career triple-double with an assist on Elfrid Payton’s 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. It was the power forward’s first triple-double since Nov. 19, 2018, with New Orleans. “I just tried to take what the defense gave me while playing the game the right way,” Randle said. “We’ve got great spacing and when the defense collapses, I know I can make the right play. When you get wide-open shots, it makes it easier for everybody.” Reggie Bullock scored 17 points and Payton had 14 points, eight boards and seven assists for the Knicks (2-2), who won their second in a row and earned their first road victory of the season. New York made 14 of 25 3-pointers, increasing its NBA-best percentage to .459, with Randle making all four of his tries. The Knicks never allowed Cleveland to get closer than seven points in the fourth. “Julius came into camp in great shape, which is the biggest thing,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “He’s playing really well and he now knows his teammates’ strengths, which makes everyone better.” Andre Drummond notched his fourth double-double for the Cavaliers (3-1) with 18 points, 17 rebounds and a season-high six blocked shots. Cleveland started the season 3-0 for the first time since winning six in a row to begin 2016-17. The Cavaliers, who finished with the second-worst record in the NBA at 19-46 last season, missed their first 10 3-pointers and finished 7 of 32. Collin Sexton scored 20 points and Darius Garland had 17, but the starting guards were 12 of 35 from the field. “There were moments when guys tried to take it on themselves, individually,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “I felt like we were desperate and tried to make the home run play, instead of just playing good defense.” Randle had 18 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the first half, powering New York to a 53-46 advantage. Bullock made four of the Knicks’ 10 3-pointers, including a 31-footer at the buzzer in the second quarter. New York built a 29-15 lead in the first when Randle made all five of his shots in racking up 14 points, six boards and five assists. “I think we’ve got the right people in place from top to bottom in this organization now,” Randle said. “They challenged me going into the offseason and I challenged myself, as well, to come back a better player.” Larry Nance Jr. added nine points for the Cavaliers, who will be without Kevin Love (right calf strain) for at least three weeks. The five-time All-Star aggravated the lingering injury Sunday against Philadelphia. WHERE IS THE LOVE Love, who sat out the opener with the same calf strain, will not be re-evaluated until late January. He has missed 116 regular-season games since helping the Cavaliers win the 2016 NBA championship. “Predicting injuries is hard to do, but I feel bad for Kevin,” Bickerstaff said. “He’s been working his tail off, trying to get right for this season.” TIP-INS Knicks: G Alec Burks (left ankle sprain) did not play after being injured Sunday against Milwaukee. Thibodeau said Burks is day-to-day … G Dennis Smith Jr. (left quadriceps) could rejoin the team during its ongoing four-game trip. … Rookie F Obi Toppin (right calf) and G Immanuel Quickley (left hip) were inactive, along with G Austin Rivers (groin) and F Omari Spellman (right knee).

"Kelly Oubre Jr. dials in a 3-pointer for the first time this season and the Warriors' bench is beside itself. (0:26) DETROIT -- — Stephen Curry scored 31 points and Andrew Wiggins added 27 to lift the Golden State Warriors to a 116-106 victory over the winless Detroit Pistons on Tuesday night. The injury-plagued Warriors have won two in a row after dropping their first two games by a combined 65 points. The decisive stretch Tuesday came with Curry on the bench. Rookie big man James Wiseman had a dunk and Wiggins followed with a 3-pointer to cap a 12-0 run that put Golden State up 98-89 in the fourth quarter. “Just a great feeling to turn what was a mess of a road trip into a really good one,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Jerami Grant led the Pistons with 27 points. The Warriors are without stars Klay Thompson (right Achilles tendon) and Draymond Green (right foot), but now Detroit has injury problems of its own. Blake Griffin ended up in the concussion protocol and did not play in the second half, and rookie guard Killian Hayes left with a sprained right ankle. The Pistons led 89-86 in the fourth before a 3-pointer by Wiggins tied it. Wiseman's dunk came after the 7-footer blocked a shot at the other end and dribbled most of the length of the court. That put the Warriors up by six and sent several Golden State players spilling from the bench area in excitement. Curry tossed a towel in the air after Wiggins' 3 moments later. The Pistons, who led by as many as 12 points in the first half, were up 51-48 after two quarters. Golden State went on a 17-3 run early in the third, but Detroit stayed close well into the fourth. Wiggins scored 17 points in the final quarter, and three of his five 3-pointers came in the fourth. “He was phenomenal,"" Kerr said. ""He just took over the game, knocking down 3s, getting to the rim, getting to the foul line. Andrew was fantastic, just that whole fourth quarter.” Wiggins has shot better the past two games after going 10 of 34 from the field to open the season against Brooklyn and Milwaukee. “Just keep shooting, it’s going to fall,"" he said. ""You’ve just got to believe in yourself.” TIP-INS Warriors: Announced after the game they exercised the third-year contract option for next season on G Jordan Poole. ... Golden State improved to 9-22 in regular-season games without both Green and Thompson in the lineup since 2012-13. Pistons: Griffin did not play in Monday night's loss at Atlanta because of left knee issues. He finished with eight points Tuesday. Derrick Rose, who did not play either on Monday, had 15 points against the Warriors. TOUGH START The Pistons have lost all four of their games, although none by more than 10 points. “We’re playing excellent basketball through stretches, but now that next step is to continue to close the deal,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""Some good things, but again, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.”","401267207"
"Malcolm Brogdon throws a slick bounce pass to a cutting Victor Oladipo, who elevates to the rim to flush a reverse dunk for the Pacers. (0:17) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens suspected history was repeating itself for the second time in three nights in his hometown. His team was “knocked all over the place” by the physical Indiana Pacers in a one-sided third quarter. But much to the satisfaction of Stevens, who played high school basketball in the Indianapolis suburb of Zionsville and coached Butler University to back-to-back NCAA championship games, his Celtics regrouped in a hurry to erase a 17-point deficit for a 116-111 road win on Tuesday. “We’re not where we want to be,” Stevens said, “but sometimes you’ve got to find a way to win. We’ve got a long way to go to get to as good as we need to be.” What changed? More defensive aggression, for starters. And Jayson Tatum stepped up with 14 of his 27 points in the final quarter, when the Celtics had a 33-18 advantage. “We knew we had to pick up the intensity,” Tatum said. “And we knew we had to get some defensive stops. We got on a roll and kept on going.” Tatum atoned for missing a 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds remaining that could have provided the Celtics with a win over the Pacers two nights ago on the same floor. In that game, the Pacers also had a huge third quarter before the Celtics rallied to take the lead. However, the Pacers won 108-107 on Domantas Sabonis’ layup with 8.4 seconds remaining. “We felt like we let the last game get away,” Jaylen Brown said. “We didn't want this one to get away, too.” Victor Oladipo, who sat out the previous game after scoring 22 points in each of his other starts, had 20 of his 24 through three quarters for the Pacers. T.J. Warren scored 15 of his 17 points in the third quarter. “Every game isn't going to be perfect,” Oladipo said. “We're still trying to figure things out. But the ceiling for this team is very scary. We can be a very good team.” The Celtics had four scorers with nine or more points for a 58-57 halftime lead. TIP-INS Celtics: Reserve guard Jeff Teague sank a 3-pointer in the second quarter to snap a streak of 15 consecutive missed shots dating back to the season opener. The Indianapolis native played one season for his hometown Pacers in 2016-17. Pacers: The last time this team started 4-0 was in 2013-14, when Indiana opened 9-0. ... Sabonis was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for Week 1 after he averaged 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and seven assists in three victories. THEY SAID IT “He won’t be back any time soon, certainly, you know we’re hopeful to get him back as soon as possible, but we want to make sure when we do it’s for good,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of the timetable for Kemba Walker to make his season debut as he recovers from a knee injury that required a stem cell injection in October.","401267208"
"Seth Curry knocks down a 3-pointer in crunch time as the 76ers hang on to defeat the Raptors 100-93. (0:18) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid had all of Philadelphia holding its breath when he grabbed the back of his right leg and needed a trip to the locker room. Coach Doc Rivers did not check on the 76ers big man because usually the health update is “bad news.” The bad news did, indeed, come — for Toronto once Embiid returned to the game. Embiid shook off the injury scare to score 29 points, grab 16 rebounds and lead Philadelphia past the winless Toronto Raptors 100-93 on Tuesday night. “He was terrific, dominant,” Rivers said. Embiid, who missed Sunday’s loss against Cleveland with back stiffness, walked gingerly to the locker room early in the third quarter with the leg injury. Team president Daryl Morey and general manager Elton Brand hopped up from their courtside seats and immediately hit the locker room to check on their All-Star center. Rivers, in his first season as coach, remained outwardly calm as he waited out Embiid. Embiid checked back into the game several minutes later with the Sixers down 11. He sank 14 of 16 free throws — as many makes as Toronto shot (12 of 14) to keep the Sixers in this one. Embiid dismissed the injury and smiled as he said “everything's fine” without elaboration. “I just did my job,” Embiid said. Tobias Harris had 26 points and 11 rebounds to help Embiid on a night the Sixers shot only 38% from the floor. Kyle Lowry scored 24 points for the Raptors. Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby each had 20. “We’ve got to stretch out our good moments,” coach Nick Nurse said. “We’ve played some great moments in all the games.” Lowry, the Philly native and former Villanova standout, had said the Raptors “gotta figure this out” after an 0-2 start, and a 14-point lead in the second half should have been enough to solve their early woes. Instead, they lost the lead in one of the weirdest ways possible. Aron Baynes appeared to hit a pump-fake 3 with the shot clock about to expire for a 90-87 lead. Embiid missed a free throw when officials stopped the game and ruled the shot clock had, in fact, expired and Baynes’ points were wiped off the board. Embiid made a second free throw and the Sixers suddenly led by one. Seth Curry swished a 3 from the top of the arc that pushed the 76ers’ lead to 96-91 and helped them move to 3-1. “We didn’t play well for long stretches of the game but we stuck it out,” Curry said. Ben Simmons, who had 11 points and 13 rebounds, joked before the restart last season that he hoped boos would get piped into the bubble if the Sixers played poorly to truly reflect the Philly atmosphere. Simmons and the Sixers would have been booed off the court had fans been allowed to watch a disaster of the first half. Simmons and Embiid were awful from the floor, a combined 2 of 11 start that let Toronto grab an 11-point lead. Embiid had made all nine free throws to at least keep Philly competitive. The Sixers are loaded with one-dimensional players who struggle to get their own bucket. In year three, Simmons continues to infuriate the faithful with his massive talent overshadowed by his desire to shoot beyond 15 feet. Simmons has been floated in trade rumors — Morey has said Simmons is off the table — but another dominant shooter would surely help the 76ers. “We can't do it without our teammates,” Embiid said. “Everybody that plays, we all come in with the same purpose, we all have the same goal.” TIP-INS Raptors: Nurse said the hardest part of adjusting to life in Tampa, Florida, is finding “where the snacks are” inside the arena. But so far, so good for the Toronto-turned-Tampa Raptors. “There’s a lot of bright side,” Nurse said. “Everybody loves the weather. That seems to put a smile on everyone’s faces around the organization.” ... C Chris Boucher scored 22 points, had 10 rebounds and seven blocked shots Saturday against San Antonio. He played 5 minutes against the Sixers. 76ers: Shake Milton missed five of his six 3-point attempts. ... Curry finished with 17 points. ... The bench had just 10 points.","401267209"
"Zach LaVine gets bumped then knocks down a nice fadeaway jumper. (0:25) WASHINGTON -- — Zach LaVine scored 23 points, including nine straight in the third quarter, and Coby White added 18 to lead the Chicago Bulls to their first victory of the season, 115-107 over the winless Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. Chicago improved to 1-4 while Washington fell to 0-4, its worst start since beginning the 2012-13 season with 12 straight losses. Russell Westbrook, who sat out Sunday’s game, had his third straight triple-double with 21 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists for Washington. Bradley Beal scored 29 points and Davis Bertans added 20 for the Wizards, who shot just 10 for 37 (27%) from 3-point range. They missed 10 of 11 in the second quarter, when Chicago took the lead. “The only way we can get out of this as a team is if we stick together,” Bertans said. “Being negative about the four losses isn’t going to help us come back and win games."" Chicago players presented a game ball to coach Billy Donovan, who earned his first victory with the Bulls. He coached Oklahoma City for the previous five seasons. “I thought it was important that we showed those two guys a crowd,” Donovan said about Beal and Westbrook. “Especially Russell in transition, if he sees creases and seams he takes advantage of it.” The Bulls had seven players in double figures. Otto Porter scored 16 points, Garrett Temple and Patrick Williams had 12 apiece, and Tomas Satoransky and Wendell Carter each added 10. FAMILIAR FACES Donovan coached Beal at Florida and Westbrook with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Donovan said Beal was a pre-med major during his one year in college, and wavered before deciding to leave school after a single season. “He obviously made the right decision,” Donovan said. In his four years coaching Westbrook, Donovan said he was never disappointed. “When you have your best player when you walk in there as a coach, and you’re never worried about whether this guy is going to show up and compete, it’s an incredible luxury,” Donovan explained. Washington coach Scott Brooks preceded Donovan as coach of the Thunder, and said Westbrook is teaching important lessons with the Wizards. “We haven’t won a game,” Brooks said. “But he’s teaching these young players how important our job is and that’s priceless."" TIP-INS Bulls: F Thaddeus Young, who missed the first three games of the season with an infection of his lower left leg, said after Tuesday’s shootaround he was ready to play. But he sat out again. ... The Bulls avoided their first 0-4 start since 2007-08. … F Lauri Makkenen reinjured his left calf and played just 19 minutes. “I wanted to be available and be there for my teammates, but it’s frustrating,” he said.

"Brook Lopez heads to the line for a 4-point play after getting fouled on the triple. (0:18) MIAMI -- — On Sunday, the Milwaukee Bucks endured their worst 3-point effort in just over a year. On Tuesday, they set the NBA record for 3's in a game. Go figure. The Bucks made a record 29 3-pointers in their 144-97 romp past the reigning Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat on Tuesday night. They shot 29 for 51 from deep, two nights after going 7 for 38 in a loss to New York. “Some nights, the basketball gods are with you a little bit,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “It's probably one of those nights.” Milwaukee used 13 players and 12 made at least one 3-pointer — the only exception being two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. Khris Middleton had four 3's and scored 25 points, Jrue Holiday made six 3's in his 24-point night and Donte DiVincenzo was 5-for-6 from deep to finish with 17 points. Antetokounmpo had only nine points. But his brother, Thanasis Antetokounmpo — who was 0 for 11 from 3-point range in his career entering the night — got into the act and made one from deep. “I knew we were shooting well,” said Bucks center Brook Lopez, who made three 3's. “I didn't know we were anything close to that.” The record-breaker was made by Sam Merrill, who got the 28th 3-pointer with 6:07 remaining, giving the Bucks a 131-86 lead. The previous record for 3’s in a game was 27, set by the Houston Rockets against the Phoenix Suns on April 7, 2019. Milwaukee’s previous most was 22, against Sacramento on Nov. 4, 2018. The most previously allowed in a game by Miami was 24, on Feb. 5 against the Los Angeles Clippers. Milwaukee was up 10-0 after 78 seconds, 21-3 after about four minutes, and the tone was set in the first meeting between the teams since last season's playoffs, when the Heat eliminated the Bucks in five games. “It looked like they have been thinking about this game for 80 days,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Milwaukee led 46-26 after one quarter, 83-51 at the half. Tyler Herro scored 23 points for the Heat. Miami’s Jimmy Butler missed the game with a sprained right ankle; it's unknown if he'll play Wednesday when the Heat and Bucks meet again. “Tomorrow, we're going to have to come out with a lot more energy or we're going to get embarrassed again,” Herro said. It was the biggest road win in Bucks history, topping the 39-point margin at New York on April 10, 1987. The 47-point margin matched the second-worst loss in Heat history; they lost 138-91 to Pat Riley and the Los Angeles Lakers in the eighth game of Miami’s first season. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee had 16 3’s by halftime, the most of any half in team history. ... The Bucks’ last three games have all been decided long before the final buzzer, with them beating Golden State by 39 on Christmas, then losing by 20 in New York on Sunday and leading by as many as 51 on Tuesday. Heat: The worst Heat loss was 148-80 against Cleveland in 1991. ... Tuesday's 32-point halftime deficit was second worst in team history, topped by a 33-point hole on March 8, 1989 when Riley and the Lakers led 76-43 at the break. ... Herro had 20 points by halftime, the first time he’s done that in his career. WELCOME BACK The Heat had about 100 fans at the game, all family and friends of players and employees. “I think it is a boost for the family, just to be able to have some normalcy and have a real opportunity to support their loved ones,” said Spoelstra, whose wife Nikki attended. STREAK ENDS Giannis Antetokounmpo’s streak of 108 consecutive regular-season games — and 132 overall — with at least 10 points ended. It was the first time since Feb. 13, 2017 that he played, scored less than 10 points and the Bucks won anyway.","401267211"

Orlando, 4-0 for the first time in the franchise’s 31-season history, is one of only two remaining unbeaten teams in the NBA, along with Atlanta. The Magic started 3-0 only three previous times before this season. “We’re happy where we are, to start the season 4-0, but we also at the same time are aware that there are so many things we can do better, especially on the defensive end,” Vucevic said. “The positive is knowing that we were able to win, so now we can work on those things and get better and take a step forward.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 23 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for Oklahoma City, which lost its second home game in two nights after winning its opener at Charlotte. The Thunder had won their last five games (and 15 of their last 18) against the Magic and now are 10-3 at home all-time against Orlando. Dwayne Bacon went 9 of 10 from the field and scored 18 points to go with eight rebounds for Orlando, which surpassed the 110-point mark for the fourth straight game. After the Thunder tied the score at 87-87 early in the fourth, Bacon scored six points in a 10-4 spurt that gave Orlando the lead for good. Oklahoma City made only 4 of 13 free throws in the fourth, thwarting the Thunder’s hopes to rally. Isaiah Roby, who hadn’t scored a point in a NBA game before Tuesday, had 19 points and seven rebounds for Oklahoma City, while Luguentz Dort added 15 and Mike Muscala had 14. “I thought we scrapped pretty hard tonight,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “I thought our competitiveness and engagement, in the first three quarters especially, was pretty good. There were a couple of times where the game could have gotten away from us and we made a play or made a stop. Obviously, (we) just didn’t get enough in the fourth, or throughout the game.” Orlando led 36-27 early in the second quarter before a 12-2 run — fueled by nine points from Hamidou Diallo — put the Thunder back ahead 39-38. The Magic again pushed its lead out, this time to 53-43, but Oklahoma City pulled within 60-56 by halftime. The Thunder briefly pulled even at 80-80 on a 3-pointer by Gilgeous-Alexander but Orlando led 87-85 entering the fourth quarter.

He now has 4,083 with the Magic, passing Nick Anderson (4,075) in that statistical category … Aaron Gordon started but coach Steve Clifford said Gordon remains on a minutes restriction as the player recovers from a hamstring injury he suffered last season. He scored 12 points in 22 minutes. Thunder: Center Al Horford didn’t play, resting on the second day of a back-to-back, while veteran guard George Hill missed the game with neck spasms … Roby and Justin Jackson both started for the first time this season for Oklahoma City. It was Roby’s first career start and he scored nine first-quarter points … The shooting woes continued for first-round draft pick Aleksej Pokusevski, who went 1 of 8 from the field, although he did score his first career points in the third quarter of his third NBA game. QUOTABLE: Clifford, on Vucevic setting the franchise’s record for field goals: “He’s such a professional and such a committed, conscientious player. … He gives me a lot of credit for him playing well since I got here. There’s no guy here that I’ve done less to help than him. The way he works, the amount of time he puts in, two years ago he was an All-Star and last year he was our best player. He is in a great place right now and he’s ready to have a terrific, terrific year.”","401267212"
"Devin Booker comes up with the steal and Chris Paul finishes on the other end for an easy 2. (0:21) PHOENIX -- — Chris Paul played OK. Devin Booker had one of his least productive games in recent memory. The Suns' best two players didn't really do much in an intriguing matchup between two of the league's rising teams. And Phoenix still won by 25 points. Jae Crowder scored a season-high 21 points, Cameron Johnson added 18 and the Suns showed off their newfound depth by rolling to a 111-86 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night. “It’s a team game, it’s not 1 v 1,"" Suns forward Mikal Bridges said. ""It’s five guys. We’re getting better every day.” The Suns broke the game open by outscoring the Pelicans 35-15 in the second quarter to take a 66-44 advantage into the break. Second-year coach Monty Williams said his team's stellar defense sparked the avalanche of points that buried New Orleans by halftime. “They missed shots tonight once we started playing with force on the defensive end,” Williams said. Phoenix turned its high-energy defense into a high-scoring offense. Even when the Suns weren't getting good looks the shots were falling. Crowder — in his first year with the Suns after helping the Heat to the NBA Finals last season — rattled home his fifth 3-pointer as the shot clock expired midway through the third quarter to push the Suns ahead 79-47. A frustrated coach Stan Van Gundy quickly called timeout for the Pelicans but the damage was already done. “The middle two quarters, I don’t even know what to tell you,” Van Gundy said. “There was nothing. Nothing good, it wasn’t one thing. We couldn’t contain them on the dribble, we couldn’t handle the ball, their pressure really got us, the pace got us. They had a much higher energy level.” Six Suns scored in double figures as they improved their record to 3-1. Deandre Ayton had 13 points and 12 rebounds, Bridges and Cameron Payne also added 13 points and Dario Saric scored 10. “If you can win a game like that and only play Booker and Chris no more than 25 minutes, it gives the other guys confidence,” Williams said. “But we know who are two best players are. There’s no mistaking that.” New Orleans fell to 2-2 this season. Zion Williamson led the Pelicans with 20 points and 9 of 13 shooting from the field. Brandon Ingram had 13 points and Steven Adams added 11. New Orleans shot just 3 of 24 from 3-point range. Phoenix made 19 3s. Johnson was credited with two points after Williamson was called for goal-tending at the third quarter buzzer, which put the Suns ahead 100-61. Both teams played mostly reserves in the fourth quarter. Phoenix earned its big halftime lead despite the backcourt of Paul and Booker combining for just seven points. Paul finished with nine points and nine assists while Booker had eight points. Crowder made all three of his 3-point attempts in the first half and led the Suns with 15 points. Bridges and Ayton both had 11. The Pelicans shot nearly 53 percent from the field in the first half but were just 1 of 11 on 3s. The Suns made nine 3s before the break. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson shot 6 of 7 from the field in the first half and had 14 points. Suns: Forward Dario Saric played in his first game this season. He missed the first three with right quad soreness. ... Rookie forward Jalen Smith missed the game because of a sprained left ankle. ... The Suns debuted their new uniforms that show ‘The Valley’ on the front and feature a bright desert sunset over a skyline on a black jersey. “I’m not going to lie, I wish we could wear these jerseys the whole season,” Ayton said.","401267213"
"Jarrett Culver spins to the basket for a layup, but Ivica Zubac meets him at the top and completely shuts down the shot attempt with a rejection. (0:16) LOS ANGELES -- — Lou Williams led seven Clippers in double figures with 20 points and Los Angeles routed the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-101 on Tuesday night in a game missing stars for both teams. The Clippers bounced back from a 51-point shellacking against Dallas two days earlier despite playing without Kawhi Leonard for the second straight game because of a mouth laceration. Minnesota big man Karl-Anthony Towns sat out with a dislocated left wrist. “It feels good to get a win after that atrocious loss,” said Reggie Jackson, who finished with 11 points. “We knew that wasn’t necessarily who we are.” Paul George added 18 points, Serge Ibaka had 16 points and eight rebounds, and Luke Kennard scored 15 for the Clippers. D'Angelo Russell led the Timberwolves with 22 points. Malik Beasley added 19 and Ricky Rubio had 17. Jarrett Culver equaled his career high with 10 rebounds. “We started the game the right way, but when things aren’t going our way, everybody plays selfish,"" Rubio said. ""We've got to learn.” The Timberwolves were coming off a 36-point loss to the Lakers on Sunday. “We didn’t learn nothing from the game against the Lakers,” Rubio said. “We came with the same mindset of just, go out there and hoop. That can’t continue. We are way worse than 2-2 right now.” The Clippers led by 20 at halftime and 31 in the third quarter on Williams' three-point play. That's when they made six 3-pointers, including four in a row, with George hitting two of his three in that stretch. Williams' points came off the bench to go with 12 by Ivica Zubac, helping the Clippers' backups outscore Minnesota's reserves 56-32. “Zubac was making their team kind of pay for being a smaller team,” Jackson said. “He made it easy on us.” The Wolves were quicker out of the gate, opening a nine-point lead to start the game. The teams were tied once in the second quarter, just before the Clippers' 31-11 run, including 12 in a row, that extended their lead to 70-50 at the break. “They couldn’t stop us after that,” Zubac said. “Guys were just more aggressive. Our coaching staff made a point that in the game against Dallas we had the least paint drives. Our focus was to put the ball on the floor and get into the paint.” All 12 Clippers players scored in the game. They shot 56% from the field and had a season-high 32 assists, equaling their total against Denver on Christmas. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Also missing the game were G Jaylen Nowell (left ankle) and G Josh Okogie (left hamstring strain). Clippers: Los Angeles coach Tyronn Lue said he isn't sure when Leonard will get the eight stitches out of his mouth that were needed after he accidentally got elbowed by Ibaka going for a rebound last Friday at Denver. ... The team is using prerecorded video performances of the national anthem and reruns of rap performances from previous seasons at halftime. CROATIA EARTHQUAKE Zubac grew up just east of the Croatian border and is a citizen of the country where a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck southwest of the capital of Zagreb on Tuesday. Buildings were destroyed and at least seven people were killed. “I feel like I represent the whole country, coming from a small place. People are very proud from Croatia,"" Zubac said. “It’s tough times over there. That city that was hit (Petrinja) the most was ran over during the war and the place was still in bad condition, a lot of old buildings and houses.” Zubac said he spoke to people he knows in Croatia and they weren't seriously affected by the quake.","401267214"
"Nikola Jokic scores 26 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds to notch his 44th triple-double, a Denver franchise record. (1:22) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Tyrese Haliburton scored eight of his 13 points in the fourth quarter as the Sacramento Kings pulled away to beat Denver 125-115 on Tuesday, spoiling a record-setting night for Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic. The 12th pick in this year’s draft, Haliburton made several sleek plays and gave the Kings a needed lift down the stretch. Sacramento’s rookie guard hit two of his three 3-pointers in the final 9½ minutes and added a steal and fast-break layup during an 11-0 run that put the Kings ahead 120-108. “Tyrese continues to impress,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “He hit some big shots. He had some big-time playmaking for us. He was a plus-20 on the night. He’s one of those players, you feel confident when the ball’s in his hand.” Haliburton played the entire fourth quarter, when he also had five of his six assists. “I was just proud of our team being a young team playing against a team like that with experience,” Haliburton said. “We could easily have folded after a bad third quarter like that. We got a little complacent. We thought we were really going to open it up in the second half.” De’Aaron Fox had 24 points and 10 assists for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes scored 20 and Buddy Hield added 12 points and seven rebounds. Jokic had 26 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds to set a Nuggets record with his 44th career triple-double. The NBA leader in assists going into the game, Jokic broke the previous mark he shared with Fat Lever while logging 38 minutes. As good as Jokic was offensively, he also was charged with 10 of Denver’s 20 turnovers. Essentially, the Denver 7-footer had a quadruple-double. “Twenty turnovers on the road for 37 points,” Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. “Nikola had 10. Unacceptable. He can’t have 10 turnovers in a game.” Jokic thought the Nuggets' offense got too stagnant. “We kind of made ourselves easy to guard,” he said. “Collectively we need to move our bodies better, then move the ball. We helped them a lot, just standing and not moving around.” Monte Morris had a career-high 24 points starting in place of Jamal Murray for Denver. Michael Porter Jr. finished with 30 points and 10 rebounds. Murray was held out of the game one day after the Nuggets guard bruised his head when he collided with Jae’Sean Tate of the Rockets in the third quarter. Murray held his hand to his head for a couple of minutes but got up and walked under his own power to the locker room for further examination. He was back on the bench midway through the fourth but did not re-enter. The Kings beat the Nuggets in Denver on Buddy Hield’s buzzer-beating tip-in in overtime in the season opener for both teams last Wednesday. QUOTABLE “I would say good teams don’t beat themselves, but that would be giving (us) a compliment we don’t deserve.” — Malone on the Nuggets. TIP-INS Nuggets: Porter had three 3s in the third quarter. … The game marked the 1,000th of Paul Millsap’s 14-year career. Millsap previously played for Utah and Atlanta. … Malone was whistled for a technical in the first quarter moments after Jokic’s dunk put Denver up 18-16. Kings: Hield has made at least one 3-pointer in 70 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NBA. … Harrison Barnes dished out a career-high eight assists. … The Kings were charged with a technical after Fox yelled at officials from the bench in the third quarter.","401267215"
"Jaylen Brown scores a career-high 42 points in just 29 minutes of work as the Celtics down the Grizzlies 126-107. (1:55) BOSTON -- — Jaylen Brown had a career-high 42 points before sitting out the fourth quarter on Wednesday night, when the Boston Celtics coasted to their 10th straight victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, 126-107. “He’s just really improved. Worked hard to improve,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of the fourth-year forward, who has also been one of the leaders of the team's social justice efforts. ""Got a lot on his plate. He wants to have a lot on his plate, and that’s good.” Jayson Tatum scored 16 points and Marcus Smart had 14 before they, too, sat out the fourth quarter of the blowout. Robert Williams III had 10 rebounds for Boston, which hasn't lost to Memphis since 2016. Brown matched his career best of 34 points with three minutes left in the third. His seven 3-pointers made (on 10 attempts) tied a career high. “Since I’ve been here I’ve seen Jaylen grow every year,” forward Daniel Theis said. “He got a hot hand, hit five or six shots in a row, so we kept looking for him.” Hours after announcing they will be without leading scorer and reigning Rookie of the Year Ja Morant for three to five weeks because of a sprained ankle, the Grizzlies lost guard Grayson Allen in the first half to an ankle sprain. Jonas Valanciunas had 20 points and 11 rebounds for Memphis, and Gorgui Dieng scored 17 points. ""When we’re down players, especially when we’re down Ja, everybody has to bring their A-game or it’s not going to be good for us,"" Dieng said. “Hopefully we can hold it down until those guys get back.” Memphis opened a 4-0 lead before giving up the next 12 points of the game. The Celtics led 31-19 after one quarter and had a 17-0 run in the second — two 3-pointers from Tatum and three 3s and a putback layup from Brown — to open a 57-30 lead.

"Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant find their momentum in the second half, combing for 58 points as the Nets top the Hawks 145-141. (1:52) NEW YORK -- — In a game that was almost all about offense, Kyrie Irving just couldn't get into the act. Then in the fourth quarter, he shot the Hawks down from the unbeaten list. Irving shook off three rough quarters to score 17 of his 25 points in the fourth, Kevin Durant had 33 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and the Brooklyn Nets handed Atlanta its first loss with a 145-141 victory on Wednesday night. The opener of a two-game series was the third game in Nets franchise history where both teams had 100 points through three quarters. But Irving was just 3 for 16 from the field and getting badly outplayed by point guard counterpart Trae Young. Then he made three 3-pointers in the final period after missing all seven through three as the Nets rallied to win after dropping two straight following their 2-0 start. Irving and Durant combined for Brooklyn's final 20 points over the final 5 1/2 minutes of a game that left everyone spent. “Yeah, I definitely need a beer,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. Young had 30 points, 11 assists and six rebounds, and John Collins had 30 points and 10 rebounds. But it wasn't enough for the Hawks, who had won their first three for the first time since 2016. The Hawks were down one after Collins made two free throws with 45 seconds left, but Irving knocked down a jumper, then found Durant for a dunk that made it 141-136 with 15 seconds to go. “This is what finishing is about, execution on both sides of the basketball,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Bogdan Bogdanovic made six 3-pointers and scored 22 points and Cam Reddish had 20 for the Hawks, who led for most of the first three quarters but never by too much because the Nets — except Irving — were just as hot. Atlanta, which came into the game second in the league with 124.7 points per game, had 68 by halftime, when Irving was 1 for 10, but only led by one. “The good thing about that is even though we didn’t shoot the ball well, us two, we were still only down one point,” Durant said of he and Irving. Brooklyn put seven players in double figures, with Joe Harris adding 23 points. TIP-INS Hawks: Danilo Gallinari, who missed the last two games with a bruised left foot, came off the bench in this one but played only five minutes before leaving with a sprained right ankle. ... Pierce wasn't sure how the Hawks planned to spend New Year's Eve in New York. “We’re definitely not going anywhere. But depending on what’s allowed, we’ll have a team dinner, maybe some champagne or something in the hotel, but it won’t be anything extensive,” he said. “We’re in New York, it’s a business trip, middle of a pandemic, I think we’ll be smart and do what we continually need to do.” Nets: Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot started in place of the injured Spencer Dinwiddie and had three points. He made his first start Monday against Memphis and scored 21 points. ... Nash said F/C Nicolas Claxton, sidelined by a right knee injury, is improving, but he thought still weeks away from being ready to return. TEAMMATES TOGETHER Nash hosted Pierce on his college visit to Santa Clara, where they played together for two years and become close friends. Pierce said some of their teammates had a group text going in advance of the game and noted the slim odds of two guys from a mid-major college coaching in the NBA against each other. Nash said he was proud of all Pierce's accomplishments, praising his work on voting and civil rights initiatives in Georgia. “He’s inspired me and to get a chance to coach against him is really special,” Nash said.","401267217"

Terry Rozier, who scored 18 points, hit a pair of 3-pointers early in a 14-0 run to start the second half, giving the Hornets a 25-point lead coming off their first win — over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets — after an 0-2 start. Charlotte silenced Luka Doncic and the Mavericks, who are still without European sidekick Kristaps Porzingis as the 7-foot-3 Latvian recovers from knee surgery. Still, Dallas was coming off its first victory after dropping the first two games as well, a 51-point blowout at the Los Angeles Clippers that included an NBA-record halftime lead of 50 points (77-27). “For us it’s just about building and growing,” Charlotte coach James Borrego said. “We didn’t have the best training camp. There’s a lot of factors there, but I believe now we have found our footing.” The Hornets were up 68-57 at the break and outscored Dallas 30-12 in the third quarter. Doncic was limited to 12 points for the game and sat the fourth with the game out of reach while Tim Hardaway Jr. led Dallas with 18 points. “Their game plan was to come out as aggressively and as physically as they could and try to take any rhythm out of our game,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “They succeeded on some levels. It’s clear Luka doesn’t have his rhythm yet.” Charlotte went 5 of 10 from 3-point range in the third while the Mavericks missed their first nine after the break from long range, including three in one possession, and finished the quarter 1 of 15 from beyond the arc. Dallas was 11 of 41 for the game. Ball, the third overall pick in the draft, finished 7 of 10 from the field, including 4 of 5 from deep and made all four free throws to easily beat the high from his first three games of 13 points.

"Becky Hammon addresses what it means to become the first woman to act as head coach in the NBA, taking over when Gregg Popovich was ejected, and how the players respond to her. (0:56) SAN ANTONIO -- — Becky Hammon would have preferred a victory over history after becoming the first woman to coach an NBA team. The assistant coach took over the San Antonio Spurs in the second quarter after coach Gregg Popovich was ejected in a 121-107 loss to LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night. “I try not to think of the huge picture and huge aspect of it because it can be overwhelming,” Hammon said. “I really have had no time to reflect. I have not had time to look at my phone. So, I don’t know what’s going on outside the AT&amp;T Center.” Hammon and the Spurs already had a lot to contend with against the defending league champion Lakers. James celebrated his 36th birthday with 26 points, eight assists and five rebounds in the Lakers’ third double-digit victory. The teams will complete the two-game set Friday night. “(I was) trying to get the guys in the right spots,” Hammon said. “Trying to get them motivated. Obviously, it’s a learning situation for all of us, but I would have loved to have walked out there with a win with the guys.” Popovich was ejected by official Tony Brown with 3:56 remaining in the second quarter. Popovich screamed at Brown and entered the court following a non-call on DeMar DeRozan’s attempted layup and a subsequent attempted rebound by Drew Eubanks. As he exited the court to applause from several of the team’s family members in attendance, Popovich pointed a finger at Hammon and had a succinct message. “You got ‘em,” Hammon said. “See? He doesn’t treat us any differently than he does you guys.” Said LeBron James: “Obviously she’s been paying her dues over the last few years and Coach Pop has given her the opportunity. ... It’s a beautiful thing just to hear her barking out calls, barking out sets. She’s very passionate about the game. Congrats to her and congrats for our league.” Hammon took over the team’s huddles during timeouts and walked the sideline following Popovich’s ejection. Hammon was the first full-time female assistant coach in league history. “Well deserved,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I’ve talked to her before and she really knows her stuff and obviously she’s here for a reason. She’s equipped, intelligent (and the) guys have great respect for her. She’s going to be a great coach one day.” A three-time All-American at Colorado State, Hammon played for the New York Liberty and San Antonio Stars in the WNBA as well as overseas before retiring to join Popovich’s staff in 2014. “Even in timeouts with Pop as head coach, she is quick on her feet,” DeRozan said. “She tells us about defensive assignments, offensive sets we should run. Seeing her in the forefront, it would have definitely been cool to have won for her.” The Lakers contributed to Popovich’s frustration and the Spurs’ fortunes didn’t get much better after the veteran coach exited. Dennis Schroder had 21 points, Anthony Davis had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Lakers. Wesley Matthews was 6 for 6 on 3-pointers in scoring 18 points off the bench. The Spurs opened with a 9-2 run, including an uncontested drive through the lane by Keldon Johnson for a two-handed slam. The Lakers responded with an 11-0 run that promoted a timeout by Popovich. The Lakers took their first double-digit lead at 35-25 on Kyle Kuzma’s 3-pointer with 1:14 remaining in the first quarter. Dejounte Murray had a career-high 29 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. “At the end of the day, it don’t mean nothing, we lost,” Murray said. DeRozan added 23 for the Spurs, who lost their second straight after opening the season with two consecutive wins.

It was the Clippers’ second straight blowout win to close out the year. They beat Minnesota by 23 points a night earlier after bouncing back from an ugly 51-point defeat against Dallas last weekend. Leonard wore a clear plastic mask held in place by two white straps around his head to protect his mouth, where he had eight stitches after getting elbowed by teammate Serge Ibaka a week ago. He started slowly, scoring 12 points in the first half, when the Clippers shot 58% from the floor. Leonard and George came out firing to start the second half. They combined to score the Clippers' first nine points, extending their lead to 85-57. George had 10 rebounds, while he and Leonard had seven assists each. Six Clippers scored in double figures.

"Thon Maker gets around 2 defenders and goes up and under for the layup. (0:18) INDIANAPOLIS -- — All-Star center Domantas Sabonis is piling up some big numbers. Reserve forward Doug McDermott is getting on the act, too. Sabonis led the Pacers with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and McDermott provided a spark with 18 points and nine rebounds off the bench in a 119-99 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday. It's the fourth time in five games that McDermott has scored in double digits. He hit three 3-pointers as the Pacers were 16 of 35 from long range. Because opponents are wary of his 3-point shooting and have adjusted defending him accordingly, that's provided more opportunities to drive to the rim. “Coming into the year, I wanted to be as aggressive as possible,” McDermott said. “I'm going to keep doing my thing and hopefully we can keep this thing rolling.” All-Star guard Victor Oladipo hit four 3-pointers. “Even though 2020 has been tough, find your triumph,” Oladipo said. “At the end of the day, we're all blessed to see 2021.” Sabonis, the 6-foot-11 center who usually does most of his work inside, made both of his 3-point tries and shot 10 of 14 overall. The NBA's first Eastern Conference Player of the Week also had 11 rebounds. Two days after blowing a 17-point, third-quarter lead in a home loss to Boston, the Pacers pulled away again after halftime to take a 20-point advantage into the fourth quarter. Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren pointed to defense. “They came out of the locker room ready to defend,” Bjorkgren said about the 31-17 third quarter. Indiana, playing seven of its first nine at home, improved to 4-1. Shooting guard Collin Sexton led the Cavaliers with 28 points, and point guard Darius Garland added 21. Cleveland was 12 of 23 on 3-pointers in the first of six straight road games. The Cavs are 3-2. Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff had an extended postgame meeting to express his displeasure in how tentative his team played at times. “Things are easy when they're good,” Bickerstaff said. “Things become more difficult when it's hard. That was the message to our guys. We have to do things decisively. You just can't be hesitant.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: Sexton has scored at least 20 points in 10 consecutive games, dating to last season. Pacers: T.J. Warren missed the game with a sore foot and the Pacers announced he will have surgery to repair a small left navicular stress fracture. The team said he will be out indefinitely and updates will be provided as warranted. “They’re figuring it out,” Bjorkgren said. “T.J. wants to play so bad. He wants to be out there. That’s the kind of guy he is. That’s why I love him. ... They’re going to keep monitoring it.” ...

"Rui Hachimura overthrows his pass and it ends up stolen by Chicago as the Bulls edge the Wizards 133-130. (0:18) WASHINGTON -- — Otto Porter scored 28 points, Zach LaVine added 22 and the Chicago Bulls, playing without four players who were in the NBA health and safety protocol, beat the winless Washington Wizards 133-130 on Thursday. The Bulls played without Lauri Markkanen, their second-leading scorer and top rebounder, as well as forward Chandler Hutchison and guards Ryan Arcidiacano and Tomas Satoransky. Russell Westbrook had his fourth straight triple-double in his four games with Washington, finishing with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Thomas Bryant and Bradley Beal each had 28 points for Washington (0-5). “There’s a lot of season left,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. “That first win is always going to be tough.” The Bulls, who lost their first three games and beat the Wizards twice in three days, took the lead on Coby White’s two free throws with 1:01 to play. Chicago had taken an 11-point lead in the third quarter, but couldn’t hold it. “Our defense wasn’t very good. We fouled way too much,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “Their speed and their pace is way better than ours, and we have got to change that for ourselves right now.” Chicago had seven players in double figures for the second straight game. White and Wendell Carter had 16, Daniel Gafford and Thaddeus Young added 15 and Patrick Williams had 10. “I hate that we lost the guys that we lost today,” Gafford said. “It’s a big opportunity because we had to step up, and we had to show that we were ready to play, especially in a game like this because they have two elite guards in Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. “We had to come out. We had to lock in.” Beal is upset with Washington’s start. “We don’t do moral victories,” he said. “I have to do better on the floor. I have to close the game out.” TIP-INS Bulls: Donovan said the missing players won’t be back for Friday’s game at Milwaukee. “My guess is yes, it’s going to go on here for a period of time,” he said before the game. “How long, I’m really unsure of that. I think daily testing helps bring some clarity where guys are at. I don’t know how long it will be, but I think it will be some time.” Wizards: Westbrook will sit out Friday’s game at Minnesota, the second half of a back-to-back. He also missed Sunday’s game, also the second half of a back-to-back…. F Rui Hachimura was activated after missing the season’s first four games with an eye injury. He started and played 25 minutes, scoring 17 points. “It’s been tough,” Hachimura said of being idle. “They didn’t beat us. We beat ourselves. We still have (67) games left.” NO HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE The Wizards haven’t won despite playing four of their five games at home. Brooks said that he doesn’t think there’s much of an advantage to playing at home in the fanless environment. “You get to stay home,” Brooks said. “You get to use your practice facility. At the arena, it’s all the same. What makes it challenging, you always have a boost with your home fans.” TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES Five technical fouls were assessed. Four were called against the Wizards’ Beal, Bryant, Westbrook and Davis Bertans. Gafford picked up Chicago's.","401267223"
"Ben Simmons drills a corner 3-pointer and his 76ers teammates show their excitement. (0:18) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Joel Embiid had 21 points and nine rebounds in three quarters and the Philadelphia 76ers handed the Orlando Magic their first loss with a 116-92 victory Thursday night. Off to a 4-0 start for the first time in franchise history, the Magic never had much of a shot at a fifth win because of the surprising outside shooting of the 76ers, who even got a 3-pointer from Ben Simmons. Philadelphia, which entered the game 27th in the NBA in 3-point accuracy, made eight of its first 12 attempts from beyond the arc and built a first-half lead as large as 37 points. Seth Curry added 21 points and five 3-pointers, and Tobias Harris chipped in 20 points, nine rebounds and three 3-pointers for Philadelphia (4-1), which had 38 first-quarter points and 75 by halftime. ""Tonight, we did a good job of moving that ball around and mixing it up with 3-point shots off the double teams and driving the basketball,’’ said Curry, who made seven of 12 shots and five of seven 3-point shots. The Sixers made a season-high 15 3-pointers. Simmons, who sank just the third 3-pointer of his career in the first quarter, finished with nine points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. ""We know we have a lot of potential and ways to grow, but to be 4-1 already is good,’’ Curry said. The Magic (4-1) were the NBA’s last undefeated team. Nikola Vucevic finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Magic, while rookie guard Cole Anthony scored 16 points off the bench. ""We’re not putting enough into guarding the ball and helping. We’re not,’’ Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""Things that we’ve been very good at for two years we’re not doing, and that’s the hard things.’’ Orlando was without reserve guard Terrence Ross — its leading scorer at 21 points per game — because of a right hamstring irritation. The Magic also lost starting guard Evan Fournier eight minutes into the game because of back spasms. He had three points and two assists and watched the lopsided second half from the bench. Already up 38-22 after one quarter, the Sixers made 14 of 22 shots and four of seven 3-pointers in the second period to build their lead to as large as 72-35 late in the opening half. Harris and Curry each hit three 3-pointers in the early going, while Matisse Thybulle sank two shots from beyond the arc in the first half. TIP-INS 76ers: Dwight Howard, who starred in Orlando from 2004-12, was booed when he first checked into the game and fans derisively cheered when he picked up his first foul nine seconds later. Howard drilled Philadelphia’s 14th 3-pointer of the game — and the 10th of his 17-year NBA career — in the fourth quarter. Howard had seven points and five rebounds in 14 minutes. … Thursday’s game was Philadelphia’s second of the season with fans in attendance. Sixers coach Doc Rivers said he was ""surprised’’ at the number of ""mask-less’’ citizens walking around downtown Orlando a day earlier. Asked if he felt safe, Rivers said, ""I do in the arena. You go from state to state, but you still have the same NBA protocols and that’s really important.’’ Magic: James Ennis III, who the Magic acquired last February in a trade with Philadelphia, went through drills on Thursday and Clifford said the forward is close to returning.","401267224"
"James Harden throws an alley-oop pass that Christian Wood and Danuel House throw down together. (0:25) HOUSTON -- — John Wall had 22 points and nine assists in his first game since 2018, James Harden had a big finish to score 33 points and the Houston Rockets beat the Sacramento Kings 122-119 on Thursday night. Late in the fourth, Wall found Harden in transition for a deep 3-pointer that gave Houston a one-point lead. The two celebrated with a high-five at midcourt. “It was cool,” said Wall, who cited the 735 days since his last game in postgame interviews. “It was great to get our first win. My job is to help James as much as possible and to try and make it easier for him.” Sacramento cut Houston’s lead to 118-117 with 22.4 seconds remaining on Tyrese Haliburton’s 3-pointer, but Harden answered with two free throws. Sacramento missed two close 3s in the final seconds. Harden also had eight assists and six rebounds in the first of a two-game set with the Kings. They will meet again Saturday in Houston. “We’ve just got to keep building now,” Harden said. “It’s very difficult to beat the same team two times in a row so we know how important it is to be locked in and stay focused.” The Rockets were playing their first game with Wall, DeMarcus Cousins and Eric Gordon, who missed the first two games due to COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Houston’s scheduled opener on Dec. 23 against Oklahoma City after COVID-19 quarantine protocols depleted the roster below the eight players required by the NBA to play a game. “We were kind of in and out of the game throughout the game,” said Rockets coach Stephen Silas, given the game ball by Wall after his first career win as head coach. “We had our highs and our lows but were keeping our composure and fighting back and dealing with adversity -- all of those things, we did tonight.” Wall, acquired from Washington for Russell Westbrook, scored his first points since Dec. 26, 2018, on a thunderous left-handed dunk in transition. Wall looked explosive on several drives to the basket and dunks in his first game back from a ruptured Achilles tendon. Cousins came off the bench and quickly drained a 3-pointer for his first basket since June 13, 2019. In 14 minutes, Cousins had eight points and three assists in his Rockets debut. Christian Wood had 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Gordon added 17 points. Harrison Barnes led the Kings with 24 points, De’Aaron Fox and Richaun Holmes each had 22, and Buddy Hield added 19. DOUBLE STUFFED Early in the third quarter, Harden threw an alley-oop in transition that appeared to be dunked through the basket simultaneously by both Wood and Danuel House Jr. The points were attributed to Wood. “He thought the points should’ve went to him,” Wood said. “If they could give them to both of us, I would’ve been happy with that, too.” TIP-INS Kings: SG DaQuan Jeffries suffered a Grade 3 left ankle sprain during 4-on-4 play Tuesday and will miss at least six weeks, the Kings said Wednesday. . PF Jabari Parker (back stiffness) remained sidelined and has yet to make his season debut. Rockets: Houston was hosting its first regular-season home game since March 10, before COVID-19 derailed last season. There were masked fans in attendance, but far below 25% capacity and only about a dozen fans sitting courtside. ...

"Brandon Ingram is ejected in the third quarter for a flagrant 2 foul while attempting a block on Isaiah Roby. (0:51) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Brandon Ingram had 20 points and seven rebounds before being ejected in the third quarter and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 113-80 on Thursday night. Eric Bledsoe added 17 points and Lonzo Ball had 16 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for New Orleans, which lost all four of its games last season to the Thunder. But in their first meeting this season, the Pelicans built an 11-point halftime lead and never were seriously threatened after that. “Early in the year, we’re trying to get better,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We’ve been struggling offensively so it was good to see the ball go in the basket. It was good to score some points. I thought our defense was pretty good overall. It was just a good night and we need to keep moving forward. The games come fast and furious here.” Oklahoma City, which lost its third straight game — all at home — after winning its season opener at Charlotte, had won 10 of its 12 previous games on New Year’s Eve. Al Horford led the Thunder with 17 points and six rebounds. The Pelicans led 77-67 with 3 minutes left in the third quarter when Bledsoe’s arm caught Isaiah Roby across the face as Roby looked for a layup on a fast break. Officials ruled it a flagrant foul and ejected Ingram, but Roby missed both free throws and Oklahoma City came no closer than seven points the rest of the quarter. The Pelicans extended their lead to 85-73 entering the fourth quarter and continued pulling away, eventually leading by as many as 33 points while matching their season high in scoring. Steven Adams, in his first game against the Thunder after being traded during the offseason, had 14 points and 10 rebounds. Josh Hart added 12 points and 11 rebounds. TIP-INS: Pelicans: New Orleans posted a 58-40 rebounding advantage … Ingram entered the game averaging 10.3 points this season during the third quarter and had eight against the Thunder before his ejection … JJ Redick and Oklahoma City’s Hamidou Diallo each were slapped with a technical foul in the third quarter after jawing at each other. Thunder: George Hill returned to the starting lineup after missing Tuesday’s loss to Orlando due to neck spasms … The Thunder matched their season high with 15 3-pointers (in 48 attempts). QUOTEABLE: Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, on his team’s high volume of 3-point attempts: “(The Pelicans) are really aggressive with their on-ball defense and on help defense, and that leaves the perimeter open. I keep telling the team we’ve got to take what the defense gives us. If you have open 3s, you’ve got to take them. You’d like to have a bit more balance, and I thought there were times we tried to do too much with the ball, but overall we took good shots.” ADAMS RETURNS Adams spent seven seasons in Oklahoma City, where the New Zealand native became a fan favorite. The Thunder posted a tribute video to Adams on social media before the game and during pregame introductions, they turned up the fake crowd noise in the arena to simulate extra applause for Adams.","401267227"
"Donovan Mitchell sets up Rudy Gobert for a Jazz alley-oop vs. the Suns. (0:18) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Phoenix Suns are becoming a dangerous team on both ends of the court. The Suns beat Utah 106-95 on Thursday night for their first 4-1 start since 2009, turning up the pressure on both offense and defense. Phoenix held Utah to 41.7% shooting from the field and forced 13 turnovers. Offensively, the Suns shot a sizzling 51.5% from 3-point range and made 17 3-pointers overall. Phoenix never trailed over the final three quarters. “We played balanced the whole game,” guard Devin Booker said. Booker had 25 points and seven assists. Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder added 16 points apiece for the Suns. Phoenix had six players score in double figures. Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 14 rebounds, and Mike Conley chipped in 16 points. The Jazz are 0-2 at home to start the 2020-21 season. “Teams have been coming out being aggressive and it’s taking us too long to react,” Gobert said. “We have all the weapons to counteract that, but tonight it took us too long to adjust again.” Cold shooting from the Jazz allowed the Suns to surge ahead in the second quarter. Utah missed 13 shots in the quarter and shot just 39.5% from the field overall before halftime. Phoenix used a 7-0 run capped by Chris Paul’s fadeaway jumper to seize a 30-24 lead. The Suns extended their lead to 48-33 late in the second quarter behind a flurry of baskets from Cameron Payne. “We executed, especially in the first half, defensively how we wanted to guard,” Booker said. Utah whittled a 13-point deficit down to three points early in the third quarter. Conley sparked a 16-6 run with back-to-back pullup 3-pointers. Gobert punctuated it with a running dunk that cut the Suns’ lead to 59-56. Bridges kept the Jazz at arm’s length with his outside shooting. He hit back-to-back 3-pointers to end Utah’s run and sank another two minutes later to boost Phoenix’s lead to 70-62. Phoenix scored on three straight possessions to end the quarter and kick-start a 16-2 run. Johnson made three baskets during the run, culminating in a jumper that put the Suns up 91-70 early in the fourth quarter. “That’s where we hang our hat is on the defensive end,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “We feel like we’re trending in the right direction.” Utah cut a 21-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 98-93 on Conley’s 3-pointer with 2:07 left. Mitchell and Conley combined to score on five straight possessions to get the Jazz back into the game, but Utah could draw no closer. “The biggest thing is just playing through it,” Mitchell said. “Teams are going to be aggressive. We played hard but we didn’t play smart.” TIP INS Suns: Deandre Ayton finished with a team-high nine rebounds. … Paul led the Suns with eight assists. ... Phoenix scored 34 bench points over the final three quarters after the second unit went scoreless in the first quarter. Jazz: Jordan Clarkson got whistled for a technical foul in the second quarter after dribbling into a referee and shoving him following a turnover. … Bojan Bogdanovic went 0-of-5 from the field. … Utah scored 18 points off 15 turnovers. LOSING STEAM Utah has trailed over the final three quarters in both of its home losses. The Jazz have rallied from double-digit deficits in the fourth quarter on each occasion, only to fall short in the closing minutes. It’s quickly becoming a frustrating trend for Utah, which is allowing teams to take it out of its offense early. “If we are not playing to our strengths, it is going to be difficult for us,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. BRIDGES BUILDING Potent outside shooting is quickly becoming a trademark for Bridges. The third-year forward made four 3-pointers. It is the third time in five games he has made at least four 3-pointers. Bridges is averaging 15.6 points while shooting 50% from 3-point range. “He’s a guy where we value everything he does,” Williams said. “His intentions are great. It’s good to see his work paying off.”","401267228"
"Bismack Biyombo attempts an unsuccessful 3-pointer that leaves Hornets broadcaster Eric Collins in complete shock. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Dillon Brooks scored 21 points and the undermanned Memphis Grizzlies beat the Charlotte Hornets 108-93 on Friday night. Memphis, which had seven players ruled out for various health reasons and dressed just nine, closed out a three-game road trip 2-1. “Being down a few guys, it’s the next-man-up mentality,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. Kyle Anderson finished with 18 points and a career-best 11 rebounds, and Brandon Clarke 15 scored for Memphis. “Either way, I’m going to play hard off the bench or if I start,” Clarke said. “I’m able to do either one of them, and it’s fun.” Jonas Valanciunas had 14 points and 10 rebounds, Gogul Dieng scored 14, and Desmond Bane 10 for the Grizzlies. Tyus Jones led all players with 12 assists. “I think they’re overall aggressive and they were the aggressive team,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “In (a win on Wednesday at) Dallas, we were the aggressive team. Tonight, Memphis was the more aggressive team. Give them credit.” Bane was 2 of 7 from long distance and extended his streak of games with multiple 3-pointers to five, second-most in NBA history. Bismack Biyombo led Charlotte with 16 points and 12 rebounds, and LaMelo Ball had 15 points and a team-best six assists. The Hornets got 14 points each from Gordon Hayward and Caleb Martin. P.J. Washington finished with 10 points. “A lot of it is on the offensive end,” Borrego said of the Hornets’ struggle to score Friday. “We can’t find a rhythm offensively. We can’t get good looks or we’re turning it over. So, it’s something that we’ve got to address. There are some areas that we’ve got to refocus on and there’s not a lot of practice time here. So, we’re just going to have to do it through game reps and we’ve got another shot tomorrow night (in Philadelphia).” Charlotte was slowed by 9-of-31 shooting from 3-point range, shot just 40.7% from the floor and trailed by as many as 24 points. “That’s how you create your juice and your energy, night in and night out,” Jenkins said of the defensive effort against Charlotte, which was held to eight points in transition. “To hold a team that can score at a high level under 30 points in all four quarters. … I thought was huge.” MELO MAKING CASE FOR STARTING ROLE After a pair of impressive games, LaMelo Ball looks as if he could be a nice addition to the starting lineup for Charlotte. Coach James Borrego said he’s continuing to evaluate the team’s lineup. “I’m looking at everything right now in evaluation,” Borrego said. “We’re only five games in now. … I’ve got to continue to look and look at it hard.” Before his 15-point, six assist performance against Memphis, Ball registered 22 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in a win against Dallas. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Forward Grayson Allen, who played at Duke, missed the game with a left ankle sprain. He was one of seven Memphis players listed as out for the game. … The Grizzlies have not started the same lineup in any of their five games. … Valanciunas has posted a double-double in all five games this season. Hornets: Biyombo reached 4,000 career rebounds with seven in the first half. … Charlotte will play consecutive games in Philadelphia on Saturday and Monday to start a four-game road trip that includes stops in Atlanta and New Orleans.","401267229"

Rookie Saddiq Bey added 17 points and seven rebounds for the Pistons, who had lost four straight to start the season. Blake Griffin (concussion protocol) did not play, but Mason Plumlee filled in with 17 rebounds and eight points. “I've been a fan of Saddiq's since he was at Villanova, so I knew we had an asset when we drafted him,” Rose said. “Teams are giving him open looks and he's a shooter. When I'm on the floor with him, I'm always watching to see when I can get him the ball.” Jayson Tatum had 28 points for the Celtics. Jaylen Brown scored 25, but missed a tying 3-pointer in the final seconds. Boston didn't score in the final 4:15, missing its final 10 shots. “I thought we had a lot of open looks down the stretch, but we couldn't get anything to go down,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “But that's also a very long, hard-working, well-coached team. They aren't going to be easy to score on.” The Pistons led by as many as 21 points in the first half and had a 55-40 advantage going into the third quarter, but the Celtics' defense got them back into the game. Boston had nine points off turnovers in the quarter to cut the deficit to 79-73. “I don't know what happened at the start of the game,” Stevens said. “We just weren't running.” Bey, though, scored 12 points in the quarter to keep the Pistons ahead. “We don't know what we've got from Saddiq, because he's not a finished product, but he had another big game for us,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. Brown scored the first seven points of the fourth to give Boston its first lead, and Tatum's 3-pointer made it 93-88 with 4:15 to play. The Celtics missed their next seven shots and Rose's layup put the Pistons ahead 94-93 with 1:20 left. “I was so proud of our guys because they finished that game with so much defensive energy,” Casey said. “You aren't going to shut down guys like Tatum and Brown every night, but we can make it hard for them every time.” Bey's free throw made it 95-93 with 25.5 seconds left, and Marcus Smart missed a tying shot with 5.6 seconds remaining. Plumlee missed the first of two free throws, giving the Celtics a last chance to tie the game, but Brown missed from the right wing.

ROOKIE'S IMPACT Pistons rookie Isaiah Stewart had three offensive rebounds in 18 minutes against Boston, giving him 12 in his first three games. “It's amazing what he has been able to do without playing big minutes,” Plumlee said. “He's always working to get to the glass, which is huge for us.”","401267230"
"Luka Doncic hits a crossover to get into the lane before using a Hakeem Olajuwon style ""Dream Shake"" move to make an easy lay-in. (0:30) DALLAS -- — Luka Doncic had season highs of 27 points and 14 rebounds for his first double-double of the season to lead the Dallas Mavericks past the Miami Heat 93-83 on Friday night. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 18 points as the Mavericks rebounded from a 118-99 loss at home to Charlotte on Wednesday during which they trailed by 30 points in the second half. Bam Adebayo scored 19 points and Avery Bradley 15 for Miami. The Mavericks scored the final nine points of the second quarter to lead 46-31 at halftime. They padded their lead with a 10-2 run to open the third quarter and led by as many as 24 before a late Heat surge. When Doncic hit a step-back 3-pointer late in the first half, it ended a personal 12-shot drought from long range. He finished 3 for 9 behind the arc and added seven assists. The 21-year-old two-time All-Star with 29 career triple-doubles recently acknowledged he's out of shape early this season. “Luka’s going to get there,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “He’s busting his tail. He’s working hard. You saw him working out after the game (Wednesday). Everything for him now is trending in a good direction conditioning-wise.” Heat All-Star Jimmy Butler scored two points, both on free throws, and shot 0 for 6 from the floor over 27 minutes in his first appearance since playing only the first half on Christmas against New Orleans because of a sprained right ankle. Miami missed all 12 of its 3-point attempts in the first half and finished 7 for 33 behind the arc. TIP-INS Heat: Miami has used different starting lineups in all five games this season. … G Gabe Vincent, who played 15 minutes in his season debut Wednesday, was inactive with a right knee injury.

WE'RE NOT IN FLORIDA ANYMORE The Heat played their previous 35 games in the Sunshine State — 29 playoff games in the Orlando bubble, preseason games at home and in Tampa, four games this season at home and in Orlando – since playing at Washington on March 8. Because of pandemic protocols, coach Erik Spoelstra reported no highlights in coming to Dallas. “You get on a plane, you land, you take a bus, go to your hotel, order room service and that’s it,” Spoelstra said. “It’s a little bit different than our NBA experience in a typical year. That’s just the deal, and we’re grateful that we have an opportunity to continue to play.” SECOND EFFORT NEEDS WORK The Heat and Mavericks went into the game bringing up the rear in the NBA in second-chance points, averaging 7.8 and 7.5 respectively. And they couldn’t match those figures Friday. Dallas converted four offensive rebounds into seven points, Miami five offensive boards into four points.","401267231"

As does Brooklyn, which left first year coach Steve Nash lamenting both its offensive and defensive performance. “Our defense can be a lot better,” Nash said. “We have to get better offensively.” Even though Kevin Durant scored 28 points and Kyrie Irving had 18 points and 11 rebounds, the Nets have lost three of four. The Nets came back to beat the Hawks on Wednesday night in a 145-141 thriller. The Hawks ensured Brooklyn would not rally this time. Atlanta led 61-52 at halftime and extended the advantage to 89-73 at the end of the third quarter. The Hawks pushed the lead to 100-80 early in the fourth quarter. “Our attention to detail,” defensively pleased Collins. Atlanta held Brooklyn to 40.7% shooting from the field (35 for 86) and 18.9% (7 for 37) from 3-point range. “This really helps our growth to see the mistakes we made (in the last game) and play the same team, which is going to do similar things, and really learn from it,"" he said. ""I feel that was it. We locked into the small things.” That helped facilitate their offensive attack. The Hawks finished with 46.2% shooting from the field (43 for 93) and knocked down 41% of their 3s (16 for 39). “We were scrambling,” said Joe Harris, who scored 12 points for the Nets. “We know what we have to clean up.” Added Jeff Green: “We got away from our principles. ... We allowed the offense to dictate the defense.” TIP-INS Nets: Nash is concerned with his team's rebounding early in the season. The Nets are seventh in the league with 37.2 rebounds per game, but rank 13th in offensive rebounding at 10 per game. Reserve Jarrett Allen is Brooklyn's top rebounder, entering Friday with an average of 12 per game. “Gang rebounding has got to be habitual for us,” Nash said. “We’re going to struggle there until we’re really good at gang rebounding in my opinion.” Hawks: Pierce was pleased with his team's offensive efficiency despite Wednesday night's loss. “I think 92 of 99 shots last game were either in the paint or 3(s), so that’s tremendous. If we can continue to keep our turnovers low and if we can continue to play ball movement and body movement, I think we’ll stay with high-efficient shots,” Pierce said.","401267232"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo gets a rebound and takes it all the way down the floor, makes a move and powers home a thunderous slam. (0:24) MILWAUKEE -- — The Milwaukee Bucks believe their offseason roster overhaul made them a better 3-point shooting team. Their recent efficiency from beyond the arc bears that out. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 29 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists and the Milwaukee Bucks used torrid shooting to blast the Chicago Bulls 126-96 on Friday. Milwaukee shot 22 of 45 on 3-point attempts. This came three nights after the Bucks made an NBA-record 29 3-pointers on 51 attempts in a 144-97 rout of the Miami Heat. “The guys that we have, they're ready,” Antetokounmpo said. “They're ready to shoot the ball right now. I told them to stay ready because that ball is coming.” Antetokounmpo was two assists from a second straight triple-double. The reigning two-time MVP had 26 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists Wednesday in a 119-108 loss at Miami. He only went 1 of 5 from 3-point range Friday but set up many of his teammates for open shots. “We feel like we’ve added a little more shooting depth, more guys who can make shots,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “I just feel like Giannis is really doing a great job of kind of being a facilitator, a point guard, finding shooters and finding opportunities.” Three of the players the Bucks added were Jrue Holiday, Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis. That trio went a combined 9 of 14 from 3-point range Friday. Forbes had 18 points in 22 minutes and was the Bucks' second-leading scorer. “It took some time to get acclimated,” the former San Antonio Spurs guard said. “New system. New players. New coach. I think it took a lot just to kind of find my groove and where I fit in on this team. They've got confidence in me, and playing with guys like Giannis and Khris (Middleton), it makes my job easy.” The Bucks shot just 7 of 38 on 3-point attempts in a 130-110 loss at New York  on Sunday, but they’ve gone 67 of 137 in three games since. Their latest 3-point outburst helped the Bucks beat the Bulls for an 11th straight time. “We really felt like we needed to try to jam the lane up a little bit, try to keep the ball out of the paint, certainly try to take away (Antetokounmpo’s) driving angles to the rim,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “Tall order to do. We gave up a lot of 3’s because of that.” Zach LaVine scored 16 points and Denzel Valentine had 14 for the Bulls. Wendell Carter Jr. and Coby White each added 12. Middleton had 14 for the Bucks. Bobby Portis provided 13 points and 12 rebounds. Donte DiVincenzo, Pat Connaughton and Holiday added 11 points each. TIP-INS Bulls: Valentine went to the locker room midway through the fourth quarter after the right elbow of Bucks forward Thanasis Antetokounmpo hit the left side of Valentine's face as they were battling for a rebound. ... This trip to Milwaukee concluded a three-game road swing for the Bucks, who had won back-to-back games at Washington on Tuesday and Thursday. They briefly come home to face Dallas on Sunday before playing four straight road games. Bucks: The Bucks played a third straight game without reserve forward Torrey Craig, who underwent surgery Thursday after fracturing his nose Sunday in a loss to the New York Knicks. Budenholzer said he doesn’t expect Craig to be available during this five-game home stand. “I don’t know that we’ve really set a timeline,” Budenholzer said. “I think we’re just kind of seeing how he comes out of the procedure that he’s had. But my guess is it’s longer than that."" SHORT-HANDED BULLS Chicago played its second straight game without forwards Lauri Markkanen and Chandler Hutchison as well as guards Ryan Arcidiacono and Tomas Satoransky as part of the NBA’s health and safety protocols related to COVID-19. Markkanen is the Bulls’ second-leading scorer (17.3) and top rebounder (6.8). Donovan said before the game that Hutchison had tested positive and was still in Washington, where the Bulls played their last two games. Markkanen, Arcidiacono and Satoransky were back in Chicago. KEY STAT Since the start of the 2018-19 season, the Bucks have gone 28-3 against Central Division opponents. They were 13-1 against the Central last season.","401267233"
"Bradley Beal gets to the short corner and sinks a jump shot for the Wizards vs. the Timberwolves. (0:23) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Bradley Beal had 31 points and seven assists, and the Washington Wizards beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 130-109 on Friday night without Russell Westbrook for their first win of the season. Westbrook sat out for rest on the second game of a back-to-back, but the Wizards (1-5) looked like a much better team than the one that lost the night before to Chicago at home. Washington jumped to an early lead and answered every Minnesota challenge. “The energy's totally different; it's just positive,” Beal said of earning the team's first victory. “It's uplifting. It's like a weight off your shoulders in a way, but it's even better to know we played the right way and played the way we know we're capable of playing.” With Beal leading the way, the Wizards finished the third quarter on a 29-7 surge and scored 40 points in the period for a 100-79 lead. Beal had 14 in the quarter. Malik Beasley scored 21 to lead the Timberwolves (2-3), who have lost three in a row with star center Karl-Anthony Towns missing all three games because of a dislocated left wrist. D’Angelo Russell had 14 points for Minnesota. “Our energy was low,” Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said about the third quarter. “They were desperate tonight and we should have been that team, too, after our LA trip. We were not and it was evident in that third quarter."" Thomas Bryant added 18 points and seven rebounds for Washington, which had eight players score in double figures and shot a season-high 55.1% from the field. Westbrook missed his second game of the season, but Beal has grown accustomed to playing without a star backcourt mate. John Wall missed last season and played only 73 games over the past three seasons while Beal developed as one of the NBA's top scorers. Beal scored 14 points in the first quarter as the Wizards led by as many as 12 and went without a turnover. He didn’t play in the fourth. “We can have seven, eight straight losses and we still believe in ourselves,” rookie Deni Avdija said. ""Mark my words — we’re gonna be good.” Russell, the Wolves’ sidekick for Towns, couldn’t pick up the slack without him. He shot 6 of 16 from the field and had five turnovers. Without their main man in the middle, Minnesota allowed more than 120 points for the third straight game. “We don't feel like you have to add to your load just because a guy like Karl is out,” Saunders said. “It's on all of us. We need more offensively, more defensively. That's not just from an individual player, that's from a collective group. With that, individually, we need more from guys to get out of this rut."" TIP-INS Wizards: Raul Neto made his second start this season in place of Westbrook and had 12 points, including a pair of 3-pointers. … Beal has scored at least 20 points in 29 straight games, the longest current streak in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard started the day second on the list with 14 in a row. Beal is the first player in team history to score at least 25 points in the first six games of a season. … Davis Bertans was 3 of 7 from 3-point territory a day after going 0 of 8. Timberwolves: Minnesota was also without forward Josh Okogie, who missed his second straight game with a left hamstring strain. … No. 1 overall draft pick Anthony Edwards had 17 points. Naz Reid scored 17 starting in place of Towns. LEARNING ON THE FLY Avidja, the No. 9 overall draft pick, had a season-high 11 points and added seven rebounds, three assists and three steals. His best game of the season earned accolades from coach Scott Brooks. “I thought Deni took another step in a young career,” Brooks said. “I thought he was able to make a few plays that we can maybe utilize him more in the future.”","401267234"
"LeBron James goes for 26 points while Anthony Davis puts up 34 in the Lakers' 109-103 win over the Spurs. (2:28) SAN ANTONIO -- — The Los Angeles Lakers know they are not always going to feel or play like the defending league champions. Anthony Davis had 35 points and 11 rebounds and LeBron James added 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists as the Lakers rallied to beat the San Antonio Spurs 109-103 on Friday night. The Lakers closed the game with a 9-0 run for their second win against the Spurs in three days. “We persisted through our struggles,” Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel said. “That’s going to happen from time to time. In a 72-game season, you are going to have some wins that are uglier than others. We knew coming into this season, with the quick turnaround, there was going to be some ugly nights. The key is to find a way to win when you are not at your best.” The Lakers found a way to win by attacking the paint late against the youthful core of the Spurs. San Antonio forward Keldon Johnson blocked James’ layup attempt, but Kyle Kuzma tipped in the follow to give the Lakers a 105-103 lead with 53.9 seconds remaining. James followed with a layup and Davis closed the scoring with two free throws. “Their game plan tweaked,” Kuzma said. “They added a little bit of a different element for us. We had to adjust down the stretch.” Johnson had a career-high 26 points and added 10 rebounds for his fourth game of 20-plus points in two seasons. Only Hall of Famer Tim Duncan had more 20-point efforts through his first 25 career games with the Spurs, getting six during his rookie season. “He’s a competitor,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said of Johnson. “He’s a fine young player and he’s going to have a great career. That’s about all I can say. He’s been wonderful.” Johnson was 5 for 9 on 3-pointers, including a 26-footer with 6:30 remaining that put the Spurs up 95-94. Unlike in Wednesday’s 121-107 loss, the Spurs were able to keep pace with the Lakers early. “We played a heck of a basketball team, and we were a good basketball team tonight also,” Popovich said. “So, I was happy with their play.” The Lakers picked up their pace to start the second half, resulting in a 10-2 advantage in fast-break points and a 64-57 lead a minute into the third quarter. Los Angeles closed the game with a 12-9 advantage on fast-break points. Lakers guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope exited in the second half after mildly spraining his left ankle when he stepped awkwardly driving for a layup. Caldwell-Pope remained down for about a minute before being assisted off the court. He had 11 points before exiting with 8:31 left in the third quarter. DeMar DeRozan had 23 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for San Antonio, which has lost three straight after opening the season with two victories. Spurs guard Derrick White had nine points in 23 minutes in his season debut after undergoing toe surgery in the offseason. TIP-INS Lakers: The Lakers entered the game shooting 42 percent on 3-pointers, which is second in the league. They were 14 for 33 on Friday. … Wesley Matthews was scoreless, going 0 for 2 on 3-pointers after going 6 for 6 on 3s and scoring 18 points in Wednesday’s victory over the Spurs. … James fell to the court after taking an elbow from Drew Eubanks early in the fourth. James continually grabbed his side for a few possessions after but appeared fine afterwards. Spurs: LaMarcus Aldridge missed his second straight game with an undisclosed illness as well as a sore left knee. ...

"Jamal Murray drains the 26-foot step-back jumper right over DeAndre Ayton late in the third quarter. (0:16) DENVER -- — Chris Paul presented a convincing argument in persuading his coach to challenge a late call. There was no argument necessary to convince anyone who should take a clutch shot in the closing seconds. Paul came through yet again. The point guard hit a big jumper with 7.3 seconds remaining after a successful coach's challenge on the other end and the Phoenix Suns moved to an NBA-best 5-1 by holding off the scuffling Denver Nuggets 106-103 on Friday night. They were last 5-1 in 2009-10. Moments like this are precisely why the Suns acquired Paul in a deal with Oklahoma City. Paul led the NBA in clutch scoring last season. “Him being able to knock down shots, and the ability and will to take those shots, is huge for us,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. His lobbying skills proved just as powerful. With Phoenix leading 102-100 with around 30 seconds remaining, Mikal Bridges was called for a foul that would've sent Gary Harris to the line. But on the advice of Paul, Williams decided to challenge the play. Replays appeared to show Bridges sliding underneath Harris near the basket — and with no contact — as Harris lost the ball. “Usually, fouls aren’t overturned,” Williams explained. “But he’s like, ‘Coach, why not?’ ... That's how it happened. He’s an asset to our team in many ways."" Phoenix's Deandre Ayton won the jump ball and Paul hit a jumper to help send the Suns to the victory after blowing a 16-point lead. Jamal Murray's shot at the buzzer rimmed out. Ayton had 22 points and 11 rebounds, Devin Booker added 22, and Paul 21 for Phoenix, which won the night before in Utah. That's two big wins over two playoff teams from a season ago. “It just shows our resilience,” Paul said about blowing a second-half lead against Denver and bouncing back. “We want to learn in these situations and win at the same time.” Murray returned from a bruised right elbow and found his range early, scoring 14 of his 31 points in the first quarter. Nikola Jokic finished with 17 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds despite foul trouble. The Denver big man is posting big numbers but his production isn’t translating into wins as the Nuggets fell to 1-4. The Nuggets are struggling to find their rhythm after making the Western Conference finals last season. “Did a lot of really good things. Gave ourselves a chance,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “But this is not Year 1 or Year 2 where that’s acceptable. We lost another game. We lost another game at home. We have to be better.” The Nuggets were missing forward Michael Porter Jr., who was held out in accordance with the league’s health and safety protocols concerning COVID-19. Gone with him were 19.5 points per game. Phoenix appeared on its way to an easy win when Booker extended the lead to to 87-71 on a 3-pointer with 2:17 left in the third. But Denver stormed back, with Monte Morris giving the Nuggets a 98-97 lead on a 3-pointer with 2:41 remaining. Paul then hit two free throws and Booker a 3-pointer to restore some separation down the stretch. TIP-INS Suns: F Dario Saric (sore right quad) sat out on the second night of a back-to-back as a precaution. ... Williams said F/C Jalen Smith (sprained left ankle) is “on a course to be back here soon."" Nuggets: F JaMychal Green scored eight points in his Nuggets debut. The free-agent pickup missed the start of the season with a strained left calf. “Just happy to be back out there,"" he said. TEACHING MOMENT Nuggets coach Michael Malone is using the situation with Porter as a way to further emphasize the importance of adhering to all of the safety protocols in regard to the virus. Porter could miss multiple games because of contact tracing. “These are real protocols. They’re in place for a reason,” Malone said. “Unfortunate, but this is the current situation we’re in.” PRAISE FOR PAUL Count Malone as a big fan of Paul. “A first-ballot Hall of Famer,” Malone said.","401267236"
"Mike Conley drains a 3-pointer from the corner late as the Jazz hang on to defeat the Clippers 106-100. (0:16) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Mike Conley endured many frustrating moments during his first season after being traded to Utah from Memphis. Everything from injuries to struggles absorbing the Jazz offensive system kept him from finding a rhythm for much of last season. Conley is not feeling that same frustration in his second season with Utah. He made seven 3-pointers and scored a season-high 33 points to lead the Jazz to a 106-100 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night. Conley consistently made the right reads on offense as evidenced by his seven assists. It added up to one big play after another for the veteran point guard. “He just did a great job of controlling the whole game and just making big plays for us,” forward Derrick Favors said. Conley came into the season with a focus on building off his solid performances inside the NBA bubble. In a short time, he’s already demonstrating his growth. He credited Utah coach Quin Snyder with giving him a chance to adapt and learn. “He stuck true to me,” Conley said. “He’s given me nothing but confidence.” Donovan Mitchell added 15 points for the Jazz. Favors chipped in with 14 points and 11 rebounds off the bench as Utah earned its first home victory of the season. Paul George had 25 points, eight rebounds and six steals to lead Los Angeles. Kawhi Leonard added 20 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists. The Clippers shot just 38.8% from the field. Los Angeles trailed by as many as 20 in the second half before rallying in the fourth quarter. The Clippers cut Utah’s lead to 95-94 after George drained a 3-pointer with 3:15 left. Rudy Gobert answered with a layup and then Conley sank his seventh 3 with 1:49 remaining to keep Los Angeles from overtaking the Jazz. “This is a hard-working team,” George said. “We play hard. We never count ourselves out. We continued fighting all the way to the end and gave ourselves a chance.” The Clippers became sluggish on offense as the first quarter progressed. Los Angeles shot just 25% from the field during that 12-minute stretch and scored only two baskets after taking a 13-11 lead on a 3-pointer from Nicolas Batum midway through the quarter. That opened the door for the Jazz to surge ahead late in the quarter, and Utah had no trouble finding its shot. The Jazz shot 52% from the floor during the opening period. Utah scored baskets on seven straight possessions and nine of 10 to fuel a 24-4 run over a 5½-minute stretch spanning the first and second quarters. Conley scored five of those baskets — including Utah’s final three field goals of the first quarter — and totaled 12 points in the first quarter alone. Jordan Clarkson and Conley punctuated the run with back-to-back 3s, giving the Jazz a 37-19 lead a minute into the second quarter. “Conley was great. He was special,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “We did a great job on Donovan and (Bojan) Bogdanovic, giving different looks and coverages … but Conley’s shot-making made the difference tonight.” The Clippers nearly erased the deficit before halftime. Los Angeles scored on four straight possessions, bookended by baskets from Leonard, to trim the deficit to 43-42. Utah weathered the surge and scored three straight baskets to end the half, capped by a dunk from Favors. The Jazz then opened the second half with three unanswered baskets and extended their lead to 67-47 on a corner 3 from Conley midway through the third quarter. “It was a fun night and a night we definitely needed,” Conley said. TIP-INS Clippers: George shot 6 of 21 from the field. … Leonard totaled 10 rebounds in his first three games of the season. … Los Angeles finished with just eight turnovers. Jazz: Joe Ingles set season highs in assists (seven) and rebounds (eight) to go with 11 points. … The NBA fined Clarkson $25,000 for shoving a referee during the second quarter of Utah’s 106-95 loss to Phoenix on Thursday. … The Jazz outscored the Clippers 46-30 in the paint. EMBRACING HIS ROLE Favors notched his first double-double in his second stint with the Jazz, finishing with season highs in points and rebounds. Friday was also the first time this season the veteran forward had more than 10 rebounds in a game. He averaged 5.5 rebounds through his previous four. Favors’ defensive mindset has bolstered Utah’s second unit. Coming off the bench is a new role for him, but one he has fully embraced since his return. “Credit to him, he’s always ready to play,” Snyder said. “Whatever you ask him to do, he’s going to embrace (it).” DIFFERENT KIND OF MASK Leonard played his second straight game wearing a protective facemask. The facial apparatus has been in place since he missed two games after taking an inadvertent elbow from teammate Serge Ibaka on Christmas. The blow caused a nasty laceration. Until the stitches come out, the mask stays on. The Clippers forward has averaged 24 points, 9.5 rebounds and 8.0 assists in the mask. But that doesn’t mean he’s feeling comfortable in it. “I don’t know how you get used to wearing something like that on your head,” Leonard said. “I don’t want to wear it but I need to protect myself and it’ll be off soon.”","401267237"
"Damian Lillard drops 34 points in the Trail Blazers' blowout victory over the Warriors. (2:10) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Damian Lillard joined Hall of Famer Clyde Drexler as the only Portland players to score 15,000 points for the franchise, finishing with 34 as the Trail Blazers spoiled Golden State's home opener with a 123-98 win over the Warriors on Friday night. “Fifteen thousand is a huge accomplishment, something that I’m proud of but my work is far from done,” Lillard said. CJ McCollum added 28 points for Portland, knocking down 4 of 5 3-pointers early as the Trail Blazers hit 10 of 15 from long range to start the game. McCollum became the second player in NBA history to make 25 or more over the first five games of a season. Stephen Curry did it twice. He shot just 4 for 12 from deep and had 26 points, eight rebounds and five assists for the Warriors, Andrew Wiggins scored 15 and Kelly Oubre Jr. contributed 10 points in his first home game with the team. Golden State finally got back to Chase Center for its first home game in a 297-day span. But the Warriors took another lopsided loss following a 2-2 road trip in which they were outscored by 65 points in defeats at Brooklyn and Milwaukee then won at Chicago and Detroit by a combined 11 points. ""They came out smoking hot, they were making everything,"" coach Steve Kerr said. Lillard, from the Warriors’ former city of Oakland, shot 11 for 21 with six 3-pointers and also dished out eight assists. He averaged 43.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and 8.0 assists in three games against the Warriors last season — including a 61-point performance on Jan. 20, 2020. Draymond Green didn't score and had four rebounds, four assists and four fouls over nearly 18 minutes making his season debut for Golden State, his first game since Feb. 27 against the Los Angeles Lakers and a stretch of 309 days. He had been sidelined the first four games by a right foot injury after being delayed starting training camp because he had the coronavirus. “Draymond just looks like he’s getting his wind. He looked like a guy who missed training camp and has been working his way to get onto the floor,” Kerr said. “It looked like an exhibition-style game for him. That’s not a criticism, it’s just where he is physically.” No. 2 overall draft pick James Wiseman gave Golden State a scare when he went down grabbing his left ankle late before walking off on his own. It wasn't serious and he is expected to play Sunday. Images of the late Clifford Robinson wearing both Warriors and Blazers jerseys were shown on the big screen during a first-quarter break. He died Aug. 29 at age 53. NO FANS The Warriors moved their championship banners down beneath one basket, a nice touch for fans to glimpse on TV. NEW YEAR’S HOOPS The Warriors played at home on New Year’s Day for just the fourth time in franchise history and the first time since a 125-93 win against the Kansas City Kings in 1982 for the 499th career coaching victory by Warriors Hall of Famer Al Attles. Golden State hadn't played Jan. 1 since 2011 at Miami. “I’m happy the year is ending, like most people. It’s been a lousy year for everybody,” Kerr said leading into the game. “As a coach my job is to remind our players that better times are ahead, on and off the court. On the court we had the worst record in the league in 2020. ... If you look at the off-the-court stuff, there is a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccines and with just a glimpse of the future and we’ve got to all continue to try to inspire others to be smart, be safe, try to protect each other, wear our masks and be really patient and understand that we’re all going to get through this eventually. It’s not going to happen overnight.” TIP-INS Trail Blazers: F Rodney Hood was limited to five minutes because of a cramp in his left quadriceps. ... Drexler scored 18,040 points. In Lillard's 620th game played, he tied Larry Bird as 21st-fastest in NBA history to score 15,000 points and fourth among active players behind LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony. ... Anthony's 18 points gave him 26,499 and he passed Tim Duncan (26,496) for 14th place on the all-time NBA scoring list. Warriors: The Warriors began 3 for 12 to fall behind 22-7. ...

"De'Aaron Fox uses a spin move through the lane to avoid the defense and goes up to put down a two-handed dunk. (0:15) HOUSTON -- — John Wall scored 28 points and the Houston Rockets beat the Sacramento Kings 102-94 on Saturday despite playing without an injured James Harden. Harden, who sat out with a sprained right ankle, was not listed on the injury report and coach Stephen Silas did not mention his injury in his pregame availability. The team announced that he wouldn’t play about 38 minutes before the game was scheduled to begin. Wall, who sat out Houston's first two games because of COVID-19 contact tracing, missed all of last season and played just 32 games two years ago because of injuries. He scored 22 points in his Rockets' debut on Thursday after a trade from Washington to make him the first player to score 50 points in his first two games after an absence of at least two years since Michael Jordan did it in 2001, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. “I just put in a lot of hard work and dedication to get to this point,"" Wall said. “I couldn’t ask for a better start to be 2-0 in my first two games."" Silas wasn't sure what to expect from Wall after being out for so long. But he has definitely been impressed. “Whatever expectations I had, he’s obviously exceeded them,"" he said. The Rockets scored the first nine points of the fourth quarter to extend their lead to 92-81 with about 8½ minutes left. Eric Gordon led the team in that stretch, making a 3-pointer and three free throws. Sacramento ended a scoring drought of more than 3½ minutes soon after that on an alley-oop dunk by Richaun Holmes. Both teams struggled to score after that as they combined to miss 10 shots in a row. Gordon finally made a shot for Houston with just less than five minutes to go, and Wall added a bucket a few seconds later to extend the lead to 96-83. Silas raved about his team's defense on Saturday and said without Harden's scoring prowess it was even more important to concentrate on that part of the game. “We really buckled down and played some defense,"" Silas said. “In order for us to be good we have to be good on defense. We can’t just outscore people."" The Kings used an 8-2 run, capped by four points from Harrison Barnes, to get within 98-91 with less than a minute to go. But Christian Wood responded with a dunk to put the game out of reach. Harden had started Houston’s first three games this season and is averaging a league-leading 37 points with 11 assists. De’Aaron Fox had 23 points for the Kings, who lost to the Rockets for the second straight game after winning three of their first four games. “The guys should feel bad about the loss just like I do, losing is painful,"" coach Luke Walton said. “But they should also feel very good about how they are playing as a group.” He said they got stagnant offensively in the second half and was particularly disappointed in their lack of assists. “We only had 11 assists tonight as a team, which is awful,"" he said. “That’s not who we are as a group.” Wood had 20 points and 16 rebounds and Gordon added 21 points for Houston. The Kings cut the lead to two points on a 3-pointer by Buddy Hield with about 7½ minutes left in the third quarter. Wall made four quick points after that to stretch the lead to 79-73. The Rockets were up by seven late in the third before Fox scored the last five points of the quarter to cut the deficit to 83-81 entering the fourth.

"Malcolm Brogdon can't miss a shot as he puts up 17 points on 6-of-6 shooting in the first quarter. (0:29) INDIANAPOLIS -- — New coach Tom Thibodeau expects the New York Knicks to play tough and physical. He also knows a veteran like Austin Rivers can help show his young team how it's done. Rivers made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 3:23 to play and added another clutch basket during the game-sealing run Saturday night to help the Knicks record a rare 106-102 victory over Indiana. “I think the experience is huge and it gives us another guy who can put the ball on the floor,"" Thibodeau said. “He can makes 3s, he can play defense and I think that’s the way the league is going right now. I thought he made big shots, big plays and he’s still working his way through the conditioning piece of it.” Rivers missed New York's first four games with a groin injury before returning to the lineup Thursday. Two nights later, he made an impact. Less than two weeks after the Knicks lost to Indiana for the ninth time in 10 meetings, by a 14-point margin, Rivers helped them find a way to rebound. No, he wasn't the team's top scorer. That honor belonged to RJ Barrett, who had 25 points. And, no, Rivers didn't have a second straight double-double. That was Julius Randle, who had 13 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. But Rivers was effective inside and outside, and his teammates took the cue by following their coach's calling card. New York outrebounded Indiana 51-32, with the Pacers grabbing just five offensive rebounds. “That’s the difference in the game,"" Indiana guard Malcolm Brogdon said. “Their ability to rebound the ball and be physical inside was huge."" Brogdon led the Pacers with a career-high 33 points but his 3 was blocked by Mitchell Robinson with less than a minute to go, which led to Rivers' breakaway basket during the decisive 11-0 run. Neither team earned style points in a game played with typical post-holiday sluggishness. But after trailing 51-50 at the break, the Knicks opened the second half on a 16-5 scoring flurry to retake the lead and extend it to 66-56. And after Justin Holiday tied the score at 82 with a buzzer-beating 3 at the end of the third quarter, Randle broke the tie with a 3 to start the fourth. Then after Indiana charged back to take a 96-93 lead, Robinson started the closing run with a dunk. Rivers followed with the 3, and his breakaway basket sealed it. “(Thibodeau) just tells me to go play because he knows I really don’t have any familiarity with the sets,"" Rivers said. “The easiest thing to do sometimes is just go play.” TIP-INS Knicks: Barrett apparently likes playing at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, where he was 4 of 5 on 3s in this one and is 7 of 8 from long range this season. He is 0 for 21 on 3s in every other venue. ... Robinson had 16 points and nine rebounds. Pacers: Brogdon was 6 for 6 from the field in the first quarter. The rest of his teammates made just four first-period baskets. He finished 7 of 10 on 3s. ... Domantas Sabonis had his sixth straight double-double with 13 points and 13 rebounds. ... Myles Turner had 17 points and one block. ... Indiana was 19 of 50 on 3s and forced 15 turnovers. HOLIDAY START Pacers guard Aaron Holiday made his third start of the season and his second straight in place of injured forward T.J. Warren. Warren is out indefinitely after having surgery on his left foot, meaning Aaron Holiday could see significant minutes for the foreseeable future. The Pacers need him to play better than he did Saturday, though. He missed all six shots, including five 3s, and did not score. He had two rebounds and one assist. “I think T.J. is the best pure scorer on the team,"" Brogdon said. “So that hurts us a lot.”","401267240"
"Magic pressure defense results in a loose ball picked up by Terrence Ross who wins a footrace for a bucket on the other end. (0:19) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Darius Bazley had a season-high 19 points, George Hill scored 13 of his 18 points in the third quarter and the Oklahoma City Thunder dominated the second half of a 108-99 win over the Orlando Magic on Saturday. The Thunder ended a three-game losing streak and bounced back nicely from a 33-point loss to New Orleans two nights earlier. Oklahoma City also avenged a 118-107 home loss against the Magic five nights ago. “I just thought it was a good, resilient game for us because we carried a lot of stuff over from the New Orleans game that we wanted to address and from the last time we played Orlando,” coach Mark Daigneault said. “Orlando is a good team that makes you play a clean game to win and I was pleased with how we did that.” Orlando (4-2) has dropped two straight after starting the season 4-0. The Magic were routed 116-92 by Philadelphia on New Year’s Eve and lost on Saturday after making just 37% of their shots. Orlando was even worse in the fourth quarter when it made just eight of 28 shots (28.5%) and missed all 10 of its tries from 3-point range. That allowed the Thunder to outscore the Magic 24-17 over the final 12 minutes to break open a close game. “It started with one-on-one defense and we weren’t getting stops,” said Magic forward Aaron Gordon, who had 15 points, eight rebounds and five assists, but made only 6 of 15 field goal attempts. “It’s just one-on-one defense and that just comes down to pride, technique and energy.” Nikola Vucevic scored a season-best 30 points by making 13 of 21 shots, including four 3-pointers. He also grabbed 13 rebounds. Terrence Ross added 26 points and four 3-pointers off the Orlando bench. Six players scored in double digits for Oklahoma City, which shot 44.2% from the floor with 13 3-pointers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 16 points, while Al Horford, Hamidou Diallo and rookie Theo Maledon each scored 12 points. Bazley converted a driving, left-handed dunk with 4:37 left to give the Thunder a 99-91 lead, their largest of the night up to that point. Horford drilled a straight-on 3-pointer with 50 seconds to play, sending the Thunder on their way to the second road victory of the season. “Our coaches really harped on what we needed to improve upon from last game and we carried it over,” Horford said. “We did much better job of setting the tone early in the game.” The Thunder trailed by three points just after halftime, but they grabbed the lead late in the third quarter and never trailed the rest of the way. They outscored the Magic 22-15 in the fourth period. Standout guard Evan Fournier missed Saturday’s game with back spasms. Michael Carter-Williams started in place of Fournier and missed nine of his 11 shots and all four tries from 3-point range. “We struggled a little offensively, especially toward the end, because we didn’t work the offense enough and we could have gotten some better shots,” said Vucevic, who missed four of his six attempts in the final quarter. TIP INS Thunder: Saturday’s game was the first stop on a five-game, 10-day road trip for the Thunder. The trip will allow the Thunder to face two teams — Orlando and New Orleans — that they have already lost to this season. ... The Thunder entered Saturday’s game ranked 30th in the league in free throw percentage (62.3%), 29th in makes (12) and 28th in attempts (19.3). They were 19 of 21 from the line on Saturday. Magic: Orlando entered Saturday last in the league in 3-point attempts (26.8) and makes (8.8) per game. They hit just 10 of 38 attempts from beyond the arc on Saturday.","401267241"
"Seth Curry fires a beautiful no-look lob up to Ben Simmons at the hoop for a nice alley-oop in transition vs. the Hornets. (0:18) PHILADELPHIA -- — Tobias Harris punctuated a drive with a dynamic dunk that should have made a packed arena quake. He had to settle for leaving the Hornets shaken. Joel Embiid had 19 points and 14 rebounds and Harris scored 24 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 127-112 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. Ben Simmons had 15 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists to help the Sixers beat the Hornets for the 12th straight time. Philadelphia has not lost to Charlotte since Nov. 2, 2016. “When we're shooting the ball like that, we're dangerous,” coach Doc Rivers said. “We can every night. We have great shooters.” Terry Rozier scored 35 points for the Hornets. The Sixers are rolling in Rivers’ first season on the bench and followed a 24-point win over Orlando with another victory where they led by double digits for most of the game. Maligned in Philly for a paycheck not commensurate with his production, Harris has become the catch-and-shoot 3-point ace the Sixers needed to give them another scoring threat alongside All-Stars Embiid and Simmons. Yet it was Harris' full-court drive-and-dunk down the lane that posterized — or perhaps GIF’d in the modern era — Bismack Biyombo and left the Hornets reeling. “He’s made a huge leap from the past year to now,” Simmons said. The Sixers got a little something from everyone, including 21 points from Seth Curry and 13 from Danny Green, two offseason pickups the Sixers hoped would address outside shooting woes. “The key is, we're shooting well because we're getting open shots,” Green said. Harris blossomed when he played for the Clippers (43% on 3s) under Rivers before he was traded to Philadelphia in 2019. Harris stumbled from long-range in his 1 1/2 seasons with the 76ers only to find the reunion with his old coach the spark he needed to find his stroke. He hit all 3 attempts in the first half and the Sixers hit 12 of 22 overall before halftime to lead 73-58. “They’re making my job easier when they do that,” Simmons said. The Sixers hit a lull in the third. Green’s lazy entry pass was picked off by Rozier and Rivers threw up his hands in exasperation. Rozier hit Gordon Hayward for the bucket that cut it to 94-83 and the Sixers called timeout. No worries in Philly. Simmons scored consecutive buckets late in the fourth, the second on an alley-oop from Curry that had the Sixers drummers — aka the Sixers Stixers — going wild. Hey, someone had to with fans still banned from the Wells Fargo Center. TIP-INS: HORNETS: Coach James Borrego said it was too early in the season to consider shaking up the starting lineup. “If there’s changes to be made, we’re going to make them,” he said. That meant another game off the bench for the No. 3 overall pick, LaMelo Ball. Ball scored 13 points had four steals and continued to show flashes as the best Hornet on the court. 76ERS: F Mike Scott sat out with an injured left knee suffered Thursday in Orlando. SLUMPING GRAHAM The Hornets lost 108-93 to the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night and got little production from Devonte’ Graham in both games. He missed nine of 10 shots and scored five points against the Sixers. He is 2-for-20 from the floor the last two nights. “I've just go to help him,” Borrego said. “It's on me to try to help Devonte. That's on me. He's going to do his part. He's going to put his work in. I've got to find him ways to get him better looks, open looks."" BANGED UP Borrego said forward PJ Washington played limited minutes in the second half because of a thumb issue. HE SAID IT Much like predecessor Brett Brown, Rivers downplays Simmons’ struggles from 3-point range. Simmons hit his first 3 of the season -- and third ever in 222 games — Thursday against Orlando. “We didn’t have a parade or anything, I can tell you that,” Rivers said.","401267242"
"JaVale McGee drives down the lane and somehow gets a left-handed layup to fall while being fouled. (0:20) ATLANTA -- — Collin Sexton scored 27 points, Andre Drummond had 12 points and 11 rebounds and the Cleveland Cavaliers wiped out a 15-point deficit in the third quarter and beat the Atlanta Hawks 96-91 on Saturday night. The Cavs' keys to the game defensively were to prevent Atlanta from spending the whole game shooting free throws and from firing at will from beyond the arc, two categories in which the Hawks are among NBA leaders. “In the first quarter they were having their way with some 3s,"" Larry Nance Jr. said. “Get them off the free throw line, get them off the 3-point line and anything in between that we'll live with. Andre and JaVale are way too good at the rim contesting shots. It's hard to finish over that kind of length."" JaVale McGee, who finished with 14 points, scooped in a runner to help the Cavs reclaim the lead at 84-83, and Sexton made it a three-point lead with a 17-footer on the next possession to keep Atlanta on its heels. Clint Capela had 16 points and 16 rebounds for the Hawks, who had 22 turnovers in the final three quarters but tied it at 88-all on Bogdan Bogdanovic's 3 before Sexton hit a 3 to put the Cavs up 91-88 with 27.2 seconds remaining. John Collins missed an ensuing dunk attempt before Darius Garland hit a free throw and Sexton hit four foul shots to end the scoring in the closing seconds. “It feels good just to have my teammates behind me each night,"" Sexton said. “Early on they were like, ‘Keep going, keep going, you're going to get your rhythm.' ... They pretty much have a lot of confidence in me."" Collins' alley-oop dunk on a feed from Trae Young gave the Hawks their biggest lead at 15 points with 6:28 left in the third, but the Cavs went on an 18-5 run to trim it to 72-70 on Garland's 3 in the final minute of the period. They finally took the lead early in the fourth when Cedi Osman's 3-pointer from the right wing made it 76-74 with 9:47 remaining. Atlanta took its first double-digit lead when Young’s acrobatic layup made it 30-19 at the 2:49 mark of the first. Young had other highlights in the second, stealing the ball and passing from his knees to Cam Reddish for a layup that made it 45-35, and assisting Capela from the left side for an inside basket that kept the lead at 10 at the 2:39 mark. The Hawks, coming off a win at Brooklyn on Thursday, looked sluggish throughout, but still carried a 56-44 lead into intermission. The closest Cleveland got in the second quarter was a 3 by Osman that made it 53-44, but Kevin Huerter quickly followed with a 3 from the right wing to push the lead back to 12. The Hawks began the game leading the NBA in scoring (125.8) and free throws made per game (25.2), and ranking second in 3-pointer made, second-chance points (17.0) and rebounds (49.4). “It happened tonight where they're in a rhythm and getting back into the game,"" Young said. “We've just got to lock in a little bit more.""

"Brandon Ingram goes to the free throw line and says, ""It's over,"" multiple times as he knocks down both shots to ice the game for a Pelicans win over the Raptors. (0:43) NEW ORLEANS -- — Eric Bledsoe capped a 19-point, 10-assist performance with a go-ahead 3-pointer in the final minute, and the New Orleans Pelicans held on for a 120-116 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night. Brandon Ingram added 31 points, capped by four free throws in the last 13 seconds to seal the victory. Zion Williamson scored 21 points, highlighted by a pair of driving spin moves in the lane to set up left-handed leaners off the glass. The Pelicans lost a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter, briefly falling behind in the final four minutes, but were able clamp down defensively and limit the Raptors to just one point during the final 2:47. “The thing I like the best is our resilience,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “It’s not easy to give up a double-digit lead with (8:30) to go and then go behind. A lot of teams sort of fade away at that point.” Fred VanVleet scored 27 points and Chris Boucher added 24 for Toronto. Pascal Siakam scored 10 points, but fouled out with 8:30 remaining. “He struggled, there was no doubt about it,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Siakam. “He had a few decent plays and a few good drives in there, but again he obviously struggled.” The Pelicans led 101-89 when Josh Hart made a free throw just after Siakam fouled out. But Kyle Lowry quickly responded with a 3, igniting a 22-9 run that ended with 3s by OG Anunoby, Powell and VanVleet to put Toronto up 111-110 with 3:16 to go. Ingram's free throws tied it at 113 with 1:08 left. And after Toronto lost the ball out of bounds, Bledsoe hit his pivotal left-wing 3 with 41.6 seconds left. “I was kind of locked in,"" Beldsoe said, noting that he expected Toronto to double-team Ingram and leave someone open on the perimeter. ""I was just trying to stay ready and when I got the ball I was going to shoot it with confidence.” VanVleet scored 11 of his 21 first-half points during the last seven minutes of the second period to push Toronto in front late in the half. Lowery added a 3 from 30 feet away to put the Raptors up 60-50 before a 3 by Lonzo Ball and Steven Adams' putback dunk trimmed it to 60-55 at halftime. Although they've lost four of their first five games, the Raptors didn't sound inclined to start panicking yet. “Once we start winning some games and get a lot of minutes — good minutes — together as a team playing solid defense, and getting stops, and running, and things like that, you know, it’ll get back to normal,” Siakam said. ""I just think that the game is focusing on little things and continuing to get better as a team and an individual.” TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto went 26 of 27 on foul shots. ...

""He was outstanding.” MEA CULPA Van Gundy said he couldn't play Williamson as much as he wanted to in the final few minutes because he had lost a timeout when he unsuccessfully challenged a foul called against New Orleans in the second half. “I made a huge mistake in the game that you guys should all write about and criticize me for because you'll sound like you really know what's going on,” Van Gundy said, noting that even though he thought he might win the challenge, it was too risky to jeopardize what few timeouts he had left. “We should have never challenged that."" Van Gundy explained that he felt matchups dictated removing Williamson in favor of having four perimeter players to defend in the final minutes, adding, ""We couldn't take a timeout to get (Williamson) back in on offense.”","401267244"
"Jayson Tatum knocks down an uncontested jumper after Blake Griffin loses his footing. Griffin's heave would fall short on the other end to lock up the Celtics' win.

Jaylen Brown led Boston with 31 points. He hit a late 3-pointer and was 13 of 16 from the field, two nights after his late miss sealed a loss in the opener in Detroit. “We haven’t been good, especially down the stretch, executing-wise,” said Marcus Smart, who added 17 points and eight assists. “We got to our spots, we got the ball where we wanted it, and those two players made great shots and great reads.

"Kyrie Irving takes Bradley Beal to the baseline, then shakes him with a crossover before dropping the ball off for an easy slam dunk. (0:21) NEW YORK -- — First Kyrie Irving, then Kevin Durant. Once both superstars had missed, a Brooklyn Nets team that believes it's good enough to win a title wasn't even good enough for a winning record. Bradley Beal had 27 points, 10 rebounds and the assist on Thomas Bryant's go-ahead dunk with 14.9 seconds left, leading the Washington Wizards to a 123-122 victory over the Nets on Sunday. Irving and Durant missed jumpers in the final six seconds, dropping the Nets to 3-4 in their first season with the duo playing together. “It’s just taking time and it’s not going to be put together overnight, nor am I expecting it to, nor am I going to get frustrated over six games or however many games we’ve played,” Irving said. “The object of this regular season was to continue to get better and prepare for the 16 wins in the playoffs.” Russell Westbrook had 24 points and 10 assists but only five rebounds after recording triple-doubles in his first four games with the Wizards. Bryant finished with 21 points and 14 rebounds as Washington won its second straight after an 0-5 start. “We guarded our tails off. We defended without fouling late down the stretch,” Beal said. “We know how hard of a job that is. We’ve got two of the best players ever to touch a basketball on the other side, so it’s a tough task, man, but I think we did an excellent job of accepting that challenge.” Irving had 30 points and 10 assists for the Nets, while Durant had 28 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. But Durant also had six of the Nets' 20 turnovers that led to 23 Washington points. “I can live with two or three, but six of them is too much for me,” Durant said. The lead changed hands frequently down the stretch before Beal missed a jumper with the Wizards down by one. Bryant grabbed the rebound and the ball got back to Beal, who drove into the lane and dished it to his big man. Irving then missed a 3-pointer but the Nets grabbed the rebound and got it to Durant, whose jumper with 1.5 seconds left was off. The Nets, who pulled out a 145-141 shootout against the Hawks on Wednesday, were on pace for another one at halftime. Down 12 early in the second quarter after being outscored 11-0 to start the period, they finished with a flurry to lead 71-70. The Wizards picked up their defense in the second half and went aggressively to the boards, finishing with 23 more shot attempts. “I thought we had a chance to extend the lead a couple of times but that’s a team that’s ready for the championship this year with all that talent they have,” Washington coach Scott Brooks said. “They just keep coming with talent but I thought we competed.” TIP-INS Wizards: Rookie Deni Avdija turned 20 on Sunday. Brooks joked that the first five games with the first-round pick were rough. “I don’t like coaching teenagers,” Brooks said. ... Westbrook had no rebounds in the first half.

James had 22 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists, Anthony Davis added 17 points and nine rebounds as the Lakers opened a two-game set in Memphis with a 108-94 victory over the Grizzlies on Sunday night. “We were doing a lot of jostling with Memphis,” James said, “At the start of the fourth, I wanted to try and implement myself and my scoring a little bit more. Get a bit more in attack mode and see if I could kind of open the game up and we were able to do that.” James played within the offense for the first three quarters, then became more aggressive to start the fourth, scoring the Lakers first 10 points of the period.

Gasol played 10-plus seasons with the Grizzlies. The Raptors did not travel to Memphis after COVID-19 stalled last season. The Grizzlies had a video tribute to Gasol during a first-quarter timeout. “You always have in the back of your mind – when am I going to play Memphis again,” Gasol said of the post-trade situation. “In your mind is the stands are full. …It makes it a little less special because with people it would have made this journey here to Memphis unique and special to me.” James added: “I hope when we get our fans back, that Marc can get another (video),” James said. “I truly hope that they re-show that video again.","401267247"
"Nikola Jokic drives in and dishes a nice assist to PJ Dozier for the bucket, giving Jokic the assist he needs for a triple-double. (0:22) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Jamal Murray scored a season-high 36 points, Nikola Jokic had 19 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists for his fourth triple-double of the season and the Denver Nuggets beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-109 on Sunday night. Murray kept Denver afloat while Jokic dealt with early foul trouble for the second straight game. Murray scored 26 points in the first half, including 16 in the second quarter. Jokic then helped the Nuggets overcome a Minnesota lead at the start of the fourth to pull away and snap a two-game losing skid. The teams will complete home-and home set Tuesday night in Denver. “We weren’t great tonight, but we got a win and we needed a win,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “We play them in a couple days. We’ll have to be even better than we were tonight.” Malik Beasley, the former Denver draft pick traded to the Timberwolves last season, scored a season-high 25 for Minnesota. It lost its fourth straight game without Karl-Anthony Towns, who is out with a left wrist dislocation. D’Angelo Russell finished with 18 points and seven assists for the Wolves. “I’m not happy now because a loss is a loss,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “But I’m happy with in those moments where you see that growth and you see things that you work constantly with these guys at, they’re getting better.” Russell keyed a third-quarter comeback for the Wolves, who led 84-83 before the start of the fourth. Russell had 10 points and six assists in the third, while Beasley had 11 and Jarrett Culver added 10 in the quarter as Minnesota’s offense finally found some rhythm without Towns. With Jokic on the court, Denver took control with a 20-2 run in the fourth and didn’t look back. The Nuggets outscored the Wolves 41-25 in the quarter, while Jokic had seven points and three assists. “Someone needed to kind of pick it up a little bit, just the energy,” Jokic said about starting the fourth with Murray on the bench. “I think I had a couple of defensive rebounds and pushing the pace. I didn’t think of the score, but we were pushing. We were playing a little bit harder and a little bit faster. That helped us a lot.” Minnesota allowed at least 120 points for the fourth straight game, and surrendered at least 40 points in a quarter for the second straight game. “Not thinking that we need any type of home run play or home run defensive stand to stop the bleeding, but us to just focus on winning one possession,” Saunders said. TIP-INS Nuggets: Michael Porter Jr. missed his second straight game as part of the league’s health and safety protocols for COVID-19. … Murray had his fourth straight game with at least 20 points. … Facundo Campazzo was 5 of 7 from 3 for his season high. Paul Millsap had four 3s and JaMychal Green added three in his second game with the Nuggets. Timberwolves: With Saunders moving Davis and Juancho Hernangomez into the starting lineup, Minnesota had its fifth different starting group in six games this season. … Josh Okogie missed his third straight game with a left hamstring strain. … Culver finished with a season-high 20 points. FROM DOWNTOWN Campazzo, a rookie free agent from Argentina, was a spark off the bench and a hit three of his 3s in the fourth to help Denver pull away. “Facu, you knew he was going to break out,” Malone said. “The guy has played at a high level in the Olympics, the world championships and the biggest games over in the Euro league. It was great to see that.”","401267248"

"Coby White accelerates to the rim and gets bumped, but gets the layup to fall. (0:25) CHICAGO -- — Zach LaVine had 39 points and Coby White scored 21 of his 23 points in the second half to lead the Chicago Bulls to a 118-108 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night. Jalen Brunson, starting in place of the injured Luka Doncic, had 31 points for the Mavericks. Otto Porter Jr. added 15 for the Bulls, who were without starter Lauri Markkanen and reserves Tomas Satoransky, Chandler Hutchison and Ryan Arcidiacano. Chicago has won three of four and won for the first time in four home games. “I thought Zach was very aggressive, which we need him to be,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “He was big for us tonight. He had half our points in the first half. I told him he needs to remain aggressive, and that just doesn't mean scoring.” Doncic sat out because of a left quadriceps contusion. He was injured Friday night in the second quarter of a home victory over Miami Heat. He continued to play and finished with season highs of 27 points and 15 rebounds. He’s listed as day-to-day, with his status Monday night at Houston uncertain. “We’ll see how he is tomorrow,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “We don’t think this is a long-term thing.” The 21-year-old Slovenian star is off to a relatively slow start this season. He’s averaging 24.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 6.4 assists, shooting 43.2% overall and 16.1% on 3-pointers in five games. Dallas led 60-59 at halftime despite LaVine scoring 29. LaVine was 9 for 13 from the field while the rest of the Bulls were 10 for 27. Brunson had 18 first-half points on 7-for-8 shooting for the Mavericks. “I had a little more opportunity and tried to help my team win,” Brunson said. “We came up a little short. We're capable of doing so much better.” Chicago scored the final seven points of the third quarter to take an 86-81 lead into the fourth. The Bulls stretched the lead to 100-91 with just over 8 minutes on a pair of free throws by White — the largest lead to that point by either team to that point. The Mavericks pulled to within 103-98 on a basket by Josh Richardson with just under 5 minutes to go. Porter Jr. answered on the end with a 3-point play on an offensive rebounds to build the lead back up to 106-98. Dallas responded with six straight points (four by Brunson) to make it 106-104 with 3 1/2 minutes to play. LaVine then was fouled at other end and hit two free throws. Following a defensive stop, LaVine fed Porter Jr. for a layup to make it 110-104 with 2:50 remaining. “Otto does a great job of reading the play,” LaVine said. “Otto made a quick backdoor cut and I hit him with it. It was a smart play.” White hit a 3-pointer with 1:33 left for a 113-105 lead. TIP-INS Mavericks: F Kristaps Porzingis (right knee surgery) has been cleared for full contact, but there is no timetable for his return. He is expected to participate when the team holds its next practice session on Wednesday. “There's nothing imminent with him playing (in a game),” Carlisle said. “But we're a lot closer than we were.” Bulls: Markkanen, Satoransky, Hutchison and Arcidiacono each missed his third straight game under the NBA's health and safety protocols. Satoransky and Hutchison have tested positive for COVID-19. None of the four is expected back until at least the end of the upcoming four-game West Coast trip. WINNING PLAY LaVine has scored a lot of points the previous two seasons for a losing team, but Donovan wants him to focus on doing things to help the Bulls win. “I think he wants to learn,” the coach said. “He's a bright guy. I think he is learning. I've seen a lot of growth in him. He wants to win.”","401267250"
"Paul George takes exception to a hard foul and he and Devin Booker have to be separated after some jawing. The two would be assessed technical fouls. (0:56) PHOENIX -- — Paul George scored 39 points and the Los Angeles Clippers held on to beat the Phoenix Suns 112-107 on Sunday night after nearly blowing a 31-point lead in a matchup of two of the Western Conference’s top early season teams. At 5-2, the Clippers are tied with the Suns and Los Angeles Lakers for the West lead. George was 7 of 10 from 3-point range and Los Angeles was 17 of 29 overall. Kawhi Leonard added 15 points, but shot 4 of 21 from the field, and Luke Kennard came off the bench to add 14 points. “I had to be aggressive and stay in attack mode,” George said. “It is not going to be everybody’s night every night. I had to step up and help our best player on the team, help Kawhi. My job is to help him lead and help him score and give him a break from time to time.” Devin Booker led Phoenix with 25 points, and Deandre Ayton added 24. Chris Paul, who played six seasons for the Clippers, had 15 points, nine rebounds and six assists. They had won four in a row and 13 of 14 dating to their perfect run in the NBA bubble. Los Angeles opened the second quarter with 15 straight points to make it 50-24. George, Kennard and Reggie Jackson each had five points in the run. The Clippers pushed the lead to 31 at 60-29 with 6:28 left in the half and led 64-44 at the break. Phoenix cut it to 88-81 at the end of the third. In the fourth quarter, Phoenix pulled within a point at 90-89 on Cameron Johnson’s 3-pointer with about 10 minutes left. “It was obviously not the start we wanted,"" Suns coach Monty Williams said. “They came out shooting the heck out of the ball. Even the 3s they made were off the dribble with a hand in their face. It is like, `What defense do you have for that.'” Two 3s by L.A.‘s Serge Ibaka extended the lead to 96-91. The Suns pulled to 107-104 in the final minutes, but Nicolas Batum hit a 3-pointer to put it away. “I was ready anytime to make a shot and a play for the team,"" said Batum, who missed much of last season with injuries. “It is great to be on the court after what happened to me the last 18 months, basketball wise, to play on a team like that and in those situations. The trust of my teammates and from a guy like (George) to give me the ball and make a shot. It feels great.” TIP-INS Clippers: Prior to the game it was announced that seven members of the Clippers’ support staff will begin a seven-day quarantine after one person in the group tested positive for COVID-19. There were no players or coaches included in the quarantine. … Forward Marcus Morris missed his seventh game. He has not played this season because of right knee soreness. Suns: The Suns held a moment of silence for Hall of Famer Paul Westphal. He died Saturday of brain cancer at age 70. He went to the NBA Finals as a player and coach with the Suns. ... Forward Abdel Nader, who was acquired in the Chris Paul trade, sat out again because of concussion protocol. Nader suffered the concussion in a preseason game against Utah.","401267251"
"Steph Curry goes nuclear, scoring a career-high 62 points to lead the Warriors as they earn a hard-fought 137-122 home win over the Trail Blazers. (2:31) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Stephen Curry twirled an arm in the air to acknowledge a small cheering section of family members in a near-empty arena, then gleefully disappeared down a tunnel to celebrate his best scoring night yet. Curry let it fly from way out under pressure with a minute-plus left for another perfect swish on the way to a career-high 62 points, and the Golden State Warriors beat Portland 137-122 on Sunday night to split the two-game set with the Trail Blazers. “I love it. I love everything about what this game offers, the competitiveness and the fire,” Curry said. “I never run from it. Just excited to be in that atmosphere where I get to play at the highest level and do what I do.” Curry delivered the highest-scoring game in the NBA this season early in his 12th campaign, finishing 18 for 31 and 8 of 16 on 3-pointers after beginning with a 21-point first quarter. He had his 10th career 30-point half to help the Warriors take a 66-54 at the break, then doubled his total exactly with his teammates telling him his count at every chance. “He was making every shot within like 10 seconds and we couldn’t even keep up,” rookie James Wiseman said. One small blemish in his brilliant night: Curry had his streak of free throws snapped at a franchise-record 80 in the first. The run dated to March 29, 2019, vs. Memphis. ""And then he just choked. It’s just incredible,"" cracked coach Steve Kerr, who jokingly offered the game ball to Wiseman before handing it over to the most deserving recipient. Against Portland, Curry made a career-high 18 of his most attempts yet at 19. No fear, the 6-foot-3 Curry even took it right at imposing 7-footer Jusuf Nurkic. ""He did a little bit of everything,"" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Curry boogied. He smacked the floor and screamed in delight. The 32-year-old two-time MVP closed his eyes and showed off a open-mouthed grin as brother-in-law and teammate Damion Lee poured water over his head — this kind of night was a long time coming after a broken left hand limited Curry to five games in the coronavirus-shortened 2019-20 season. “When you have something to be excited about you kind of feed off your own energy,” said Curry, who says the “great ones” learn how to block out the critics and embrace the expectations. “He came out looking like a man on a mission,” Draymond Green said. Damian Lillard scored 32 points for Portland, and CJ McCollum added 28. McCollum shot 2 for 8 from deep after his 25 3-pointers over the initial five games left him and Curry as the only players to ever do so. After Portland’s 25-point win Friday night, the Warriors were embarrassed and determined to be more aggressive and defend better after the Blazers came out firing to finish 20 of 43 from deep — and they looked more energetic on the defensive end. Portland shot 14 of 43 on 3s Sunday. Curry did it all on the other end. When he sat down for good in the waning seconds and received hugs from teammates, the piped in crowd noise seemed extra loud in an arena devoid of real fans. “It's just a privilege to coach him, it really is,” Kerr said. “Sheeeesh (at)StephenCurry30!!” injured Splash Brother Klay Thompson posted on Twitter with a fire emoji. “Welcome to the club big bro #62.” Green had eight assists and scored one point playing his second game of the season with his minutes increased from just below 18 to 28. He was sidelined the first four games by a right foot injury after being delayed starting training camp because he had the coronavirus. WILT'S 60-POINTERS Wilt Chamberlain had 27 60-point performances for the Warriors franchise, the only one in team history with more than one. Thompson scored 60 on Dec. 5, 2016, against Indiana. LILLARD VS. WARRIORS Lillard, who became just the second Portland player joining Hall of Famer Clyde Drexler to reach 15,000 points Friday night, is at his best against the Warriors. Lillard has scored at least 29 points in seven straight games against the Warriors and has made at least five 3-pointers in six of those games. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: F Rodney Hood didn't play after he strained his left quadriceps Friday night and played just five minutes. ... McCollum had five assists, nine rebounds and two steals. Warriors: Curry's previous career high was 54 points on Feb. 27, 2013, at New York's Madison Square Garden. ... Curry scored 20 or more in a quarter for the 27th time in his career. ... Golden State went 13 for 34 from deep after making just 7 of 35 from 3-point range Friday. ... Andrew Wiggins has scored in double figures every game so far.","401267252"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Free of the minutes’ restriction that had been placed on him early this season as he recovered from a hamstring injury, Orlando forward Aaron Gordon made the most of his extra time on the floor. Gordon broke out of a shooting slump Monday night, hitting six of nine 3-pointers on the way to a season-high 24 points as the Magic beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 103-83. Orlando snapped a two-game losing streak that had followed four straight victories to open the season. The Magic made a season-high 15 3-pointers, easily surpassing their previous season high of 11. Orlando entered the game 30th in the NBA in 3-point makes per game with nine. Gordon entered having made just three of 20 3-point attempts. He tied a career best with the six made 3s midway through the third quarter. Gordon scored 13 points in the third as the Magic broke open a close game. He also grabbed a season-best 11 rebounds in 28 minutes. “They bumped me up a little bit and I think I’m around 28 or 30 minutes now, and I want to be on the floor as much as I possibly can,” said Gordon, who is still nursing a hamstring injury from late last season. “I don’t want to be limited in any way. I just want to go out there and be free and play in the game’s flow.” Up two points at the break, Orlando outscored Cleveland 38-18 in the third period, pushing its lead to 89-67. The Magic made six of 10 shots from beyond the arc in the third period and posted their second-highest scoring quarter of the season. “We were better in the second half, but they’re hard to play against,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said of Cleveland’s zone defenses. “They switch things up, which takes away your rhythm. In the second half, we did a better job of taking care of the ball and Aaron Gordon was great.” Nikola Vucevic scored 23 points and grabbed eight rebounds, while Terrence Ross chipped in 15 points off the bench. Khem Birch added 12 points and 12 rebounds, while rookie guard Cole Anthony added nine points, five rebounds and four assists. Cleveland lost its fifth straight to Orlando, a streak that dates to 2019. The Cavaliers are 1/3 since starting the season 3-0. Cleveland guard Collin Sexton scored 24 points and tied LeBron James’ franchise record for consecutive games with at least 20 points to open a season. Sexton, who came into Monday 10th in the NBA in scoring at 26 points per game, has scored at least 20 points in all seven games. James scored at least 20 in seven straight to open the 2004-05 season. Cedi Osman scored 13 of his 18 points in the first half and added seven rebounds and seven assists. Andre Drummond had 10 points and 14 rebounds for his seventh straight double-double. TIP INS Cavaliers: Already without starters Kevin Love (calf strain), Darius Garland (shoulder strain) and Isaac Okoro (foot sprain), Cleveland lost guard Dante Exum to a left leg injury just 47 seconds in. Cleveland is already down seven players. “It is what it is and we’ve just got to figure it out,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We are down bodies and we talked about adversity a few games back and this is the epitome of it. We’ve just got to figure it out.” Magic: Magic coach Steve Clifford chatted with Washington Football Team head coach Ron Rivera on Monday morning to congratulate him on getting Washington to the NFL playoffs. Clifford and Rivera are close friends from their time together in Charlotte — the former with the Hornets and the latter while coaching the Panthers. “We communicated this morning and we have a good friendship,” Clifford said. “He’s a great coach and a tremendous human being. They’ve had a phenomenal season after a tough start. His teams always get better and better.’’","401267253"
"Ben Simmons gets the ball and does a behind-the-back dribble and a behind-the-back assist to Joel Embiid for a smooth finish. (0:17) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid wore a sweatshirt with “The Process” emblazoned on the front, his nickname that’s a nod to the path the 76ers took from a forlorn franchise to one that has the best record in the NBA. And just maybe, the best player, too. Embiid had 14 points and 11 rebounds, Tobias Harris scored 22 points and Philadelphia beat the Charlotte Hornets 118-101 on Monday night for their fourth straight win. “The main thing we have is Joel,” coach Doc Rivers said. “Joel sets the table for us.” The Sixers swept the two-game set necessitated on the schedule this season because of the pandemic and beat the Hornets for the 13th straight time. Philadelphia has not lost to Charlotte since Nov. 2, 2016. Embiid has been the biggest reason the Sixers are off to a 6-1 start in Rivers’ first season. Perhaps motivated by the birth of his son, reinvigorated under a new coaching staff or both, the 26-year-old has seemingly harnessed his talent and developed into a workload-heavy force on both sides off the ball. Gone are the days when Embiid’s minutes were limited because of injuries — Sixers fans still cringe at “load management” — and he needed to sit out just one game of a back-to-back set to rest up. Embiid entered Monday night averaging 33.4 minutes (and 25.0 points), the most on the Sixers. “He can handle it,” Rivers said. “I think he played the other night almost 37, I didn’t like that, but that’s going to happen. You go through the year and it evens out, that 34, 33. I don’t really have a minutes barometer, I just know where I’d like to keep it.” Embiid added a personal chef, nutritionist, physical therapist and massage therapist — making $29.5 million this season, he can afford the staff — to help turn those flashes of greatness into a sustained MVP campaign. “Everything I’ve been doing, I guess has been working,” Embiid said. “I’m glad to have the support I put in place. I’ve got to keep on doing it. We’ve got to keep on doing it.' Want rim protection? Embiid can do it. Gordon Hayward learned on a drive late in the third when he saw Embiid’s outstretched arm and tossed a wild shot high above the rectangle. Embiid grabbed one of his 10 defensive boards. Also in the third, Embiid ran straight into a double team out on the wing. He didn’t force his way into making a play that wasn’t there — he kicked it to Seth Curry for a wide open 3 and a 61-45 lead. “Any time they come from any angle, we’re putting guys in spots where Joel can see them and make easy decisions,” Rivers said. “All great players are going to get trapped. I have this attitude, if you trap us, we will score. You can feel the guys believing it.” Embiid even hit a little fadeaway in the third as the Sixers turned this one into a rout and he got his rest at just 25 minutes Ben Simmons was steady with 12 points and 10 rebounds, and Danny Green hit three 3s for 13 points. Hayward had 18 points and struggling Devonte’ Graham added 15 for the Hornets, who also lost Saturday in Philly 127-112. “We couldn’t score tonight,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “We couldn’t find the bucket and it bled over into our transition defense. Until we figure out the offense and find guys that can score and put the ball in the hole, we’re going to have to play defense consistently.” TIP-INS Hornets: C Cody Zeller still hasn’t been cleared to use his left hand in shooting drills after breaking his ring finger in the season opener. The Hornets hope Zeller can return in early February. 76ers: Harris was named Eastern Conference player of the week, averaging 23.3 points, 9.7 rebounds and 4.0 assists over three games. ... Team owner Josh Harris sat courtside and chatted with decision makers Daryl Morey and Elton Brand. FINE MESS The NBA adopted a tougher policy regarding masks on Monday. Rivers, who frequently pulled his down to communicate with players and officials, said he was fined $10,000 by the league this season for violating policy.","401267254"
"Julius Randle puts up 28 points, 17 rebounds and 9 assists as the Knicks come from behind to defeat the Hawks. (2:01) ATLANTA -- — Julius Randle scored 28 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, Austin Rivers hit a huge 3-pointer and the New York Knicks kept up their strong start with a 113-108 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night. The Knicks capped a four-game road trip with their third win, improving to 4-3 under first-year coach Tom Thibodeau. This is New York's best record after seven games since a 6-1 start for the 2012-13 team, which was also the last Knicks squad to finish with a winning record. “We didn't play great, but we found a way to win,” Thibodeau said. “I love the fight in our team.” The Hawks took their second straight home loss after winning four of their first five, squandering a 15-point lead late in the third quarter. Atlanta's three losses have been by a total of 14 points. “I feel like we've lost three games we shouldn't have lost,” John Collins said. De'Andre Hunter brought Atlanta to 107-106 on a 3-pointer with 1:40 remaining, but Rivers answered with a trey of his own to give the Knicks some breathing room. Randle sealed it with a put-back, tipping the ball in after Rivers missed on a drive with 46.1 seconds to go. “Julius had a monster game,” Thibodeau said. RJ Barrett  wasn't bad, either, contributing 26 points and 11 rebounds. And rookie Immanuel Quickley came up big down the stretch. The rookie guard, who had 16 points, put New York ahead to stay on a pair of free throws that made it 103-101. But his biggest play came with the shot clock running down, when he got off a wild 3-pointer that had no chance but drew a foul from Trae Young. Quickley made all three free throws with 2:34 remaining, pushing the Knicks ahead 106-101. “It's become a big part of the NBA to get to the foul line,” Quickley said. “That foul I drew on him was just from watching a lot of great players.” Young had 31 points and 14 assists for the Hawks. Hunter chipped in with 23 points. New York raced to an early double-digit lead, forcing the Hawks to call a timeout after Barrett's dunk off a pass from Elfrid Payton gave the Knicks a 24-14 edge. Atlanta finally found its offensive rhythm late in the first quarter and led 58-54 at halftime. The Hawks stretched the lead to 82-67 on Hunter's lay-in with 4:47 remaining in the third, but they couldn't put New York away. The Knicks closed the period on a 17-6 run. ROAD WARRIORS The Knicks have played five of their first seven games on the road. While not exactly a favorable schedule, Thibodeau said the time away from home has helped to build team chemistry. “It's almost like going away to training camp,” he said. “I take the positives out of that. With all the team meals and film sessions, sort of being around each other as much as we are, that's been very productive for us.” TIP INS Knicks: C Nerlens Noel was a late scratch with a sprained left ankle. ...

"Goran Dragic finds a driving Jimmy Butler on the baseline for an easy two-handed dunk. (0:20) MIAMI -- — Kelly Olynyk became the latest option in Miami’s starting lineup. He made a case to stick around. Olynyk made five 3-pointers on his way to 19 points, Bam Adebayo led all scorers with 20 on 9-for-10 shooting and the Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 118-90 on Monday night. Miami has played six games, alternating losses then wins in all six, and has used a different starting five every time. “I think the starting lineup is so overstated in so many ways,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “The more important thing is us building consistency to how we want to play."" Jimmy Butler scored 18 points for Miami, which used a 20-0 third quarter run to turn what was a four-point game into a runaway. Olynyk had 11 points in that spurt, including three 3-pointers, and the Heat stretched the lead to 35 — their biggest such cushion of the young season. “It's a different flow and a different game when you start,"" Olynyk said. “You can kind of let the game come to you. ... But nonetheless, you've got to play your role, whatever it is."" Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 18 points for the Thunder, who sat their starters in the fourth quarter. Darius Bazley scored 16 and Luguentz Dort scored 12 for Oklahoma City — which saw its chance slip completely away during that five-minute stretch of the third quarter. “We want to be a team that plays 48 minutes,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. The Thunder were just 13 of 48 from 3-point range. “The way our offense is set up, guys are going to get open looks,"" Bazley said. “A lot of the teams we play, they're like packed into a shell ... guys are set up to get good looks, especially when you're playing off the ball."" The Heat shot 57%; the Thunder shot 37%. Duncan Robinson scored 12 points for the Heat, all of them coming from 3-point range. Adebayo became the fourth player to have multiple games shooting 9-for-10 or better in Heat history, joining Hassan Whiteside (five times), Alonzo Mourning (four) and Udonis Haslem (three). Adebayo also went 9 for 10 on Jan. 5, 2020 against Portland. TIP-INS Thunder: Rookie Aleksej Pokusevski (concussion protocol) missed the game. ... Oklahoma City was down 63-49 at the half, its biggest deficit at the break so far this season. ... The Thunder went 0 for 10 from the field during Miami’s 20-0 run, seven of those misses from 3-point range. Heat: Butler missed all six of his shots in Dallas on Friday, so the Heat got him a layup on the first possession of the game Monday. ... The Heat debuted their latest “Vice” court and uniform. ... Miami has played six games; it has led by at least 20 in two and trailed by at least 20 in two others. REF HURT Crew chief Kane Fitzgerald left with 3:50 remaining in the first quarter with a left leg injury, possibly to his hamstring. That left two officials to finish the game, referee Aaron Smith and umpire Brandon Schwab — a non-staff official. RARE WIN Miami got a home win over the Thunder for the first time since Dec. 3, 2015. The Thunder didn’t come to Miami in 2017 or 2020; the 2017 quirk was just based on the way the schedules fell, and last season’s “home” game for the Heat was played inside the bubble at Walt Disney World.","401267256"
"Jayson Tatum leads all scorers with 40 points as the Celtics defeat the Raptors 126-114. (1:39) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Jayson Tatum scored 40 points and the Boston Celtics rolled to a 126-114 win over the Toronto Raptors on Monday night. Playing without three of their top guards, the Celtics shook off a slow start to lead by as many as 26 in the second half. They shot 48.8% overall. Tatum turned the game around with 21 points in the second quarter. He hit five 3-pointers on the night and converted all 13 free throws, finishing one point short of his career high set against New Orleans last January. “Disappointed? No,” Tatum shrugged. “I’m going to get there soon enough.” Rookie guard Payton Pritchard had 23 points and eight assists in 32 minutes for the Celtics (5-3), and Jaylen Brown scored 19. Robert Williams III came off the bench to contribute 11 points and 15 rebounds. “Tatum was tremendous tonight but we had a lot of good performances, playing on a back-to-back with no excuses,” Boston coach Brad Stevens said. “We had a lot of guys out.” Playing in front of fans for the first time in 10 months was a refreshing change for Tatum. A maximum-allowed crowd of 3,740 attended the game in 19,000-seat Amalie Arena. “It felt great,” he said. “I missed playing in front of people. There were a lot of Boston people here. It felt different with people in the stands, but I enjoyed it.” Fred VanVleet led the Raptors (1-5) with 35 points and eight rebounds. VanVleet scored 14 in the first quarter and Toronto made seven of its first nine 3s to lead 28-15 through the first eight minutes. But the Raptors missed their next 13 tries from 3-point territory, and by the time VanVleet hit one with 7:24 left in the third quarter, they were down by 15. Tatum took over late in the first half, scoring 13 points during an 18-2 Boston run. He finished the half with four straight free throws to put the Celtics up 61-46. They stretched the lead to 23 in the third quarter, and when Tatum went to the bench with five fouls with 9:52 left in the game, Boston led 109-83. The Raptors, who have held double-digit leads in every game this season, shot 40% overall and finished 13 for 37 from behind the arc. TIP-INS Celtics: Injuries to Marcus Smart (sprained right thumb) and Jeff Teague (sprained left ankle) depleted the backcourt. Kemba Walker is still recovering from a knee injury. ... Tremont Waters got his second NBA start at point guard. ... Boston had a 56-37 advantage in rebounds. Raptors: VanVleet tied C.J. Miles' franchise record of 38 consecutive games with a 3-pointer. ... Raptors coach Nick Nurse said 6-foot-6 Stanley Johnson will get more minutes because Toronto's smallish guards have been getting burned on defense. “I can't keep putting out another small guard,” Nurse said. “Defense is mostly what we need.” ... The Raptors entered as the worst shooting team (41.4%) in the NBA. NO HOME TEAM TO VISIT The irony of playing on the road against a team playing 1,300 miles from its real home was not lost on Stevens, who didn’t see an advantage nor a disadvantage to playing in Tampa. “It is pretty interesting that the first time we’re going to play in front of fans is down here in Florida,” he said.","401267257"
"Luka Doncic tallies 33 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists as Dallas beats Houston 113-100. (2:05) HOUSTON -- — Luka Doncic had 33 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists, and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 30 off the bench as the Dallas Mavericks used a big fourth quarter run to pull away in a 113-100 win over the Houston Rockets on Monday night. Dallas was on top by 3 with about seven minutes remaining before using a 14-3 spurt, with seven points from Hardaway, to extend the lead to 106-92 with about 2½ minutes remaining. Houston couldn’t get anything going as the Mavericks took over. The Rockets missed five shots and had two turnovers in that span. Hardaway, who made 8 of 10 3-point attempts, added another 3-pointer down the stretch to put the game out of reach. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle changed his starting lineup to get more size against the Rockets and moved Willie Cauley-Stein, who is 7 feet tall, in for Hardaway for the first time this season. Carlisle heaped praise upon Hardaway for the way he played off the bench. “It was a really strong character performance by Tim,"" he said. “He was great at both ends of the floor... Tim Hardaway showed what class and professionalism is in responding to a lineup change."" Hardaway didn't feel like the move was that big of a deal. “You’ve got to be a pro,"" he said. “I’m here to help this team out any way I can. I just had to make sure I was ready when I got in the game to make an impact."" Christian Wood had 23 points to lead the Rockets and James Harden added 21. “We were way too stagnant, didn't move the ball enough to put pressure on them and make it hard on them,"" coach Stephen Silas said. Both Doncic and Harden were back after sitting out in their team’s last game with injuries. Doncic returned after missing Sunday’s loss to Chicago with a bruised quadriceps. Harden played after sitting out on Saturday against the Kings because of a sprained ankle. Carlisle was impressed that his team was able to slow Harden down and limit the Rockets to just 100 points. “Defensively is where we’re going to make our ground this year,"" he said. “That’s just how it’s going to be. We’ve got to build on this somehow."" Houston made just 11 of 40 3-pointers and Harden was 3 of 11 from long-range and 5 of 17 overall. “I'm really just disappointed in our offensive effort tonight because that's not the game that I envisioned us playing,"" Silas said. The Mavericks led by seven points to start the fourth before Houston opened the quarter with an 8-1 run to tie it with about 10 minutes remaining. Eric Gordon made three free throws to get things going and Sterling Brown had a 3 that tied it. Dallas had a 16-point lead after a three-point play by Doncic with about eight minutes left in the third quarter. The Rockets then scored the next 14 points to get within 72-70 four minutes later. Harden had a step back 3-pointer in that stretch and Jae’Sean Tate capped it with six straight points. Doncic struggled during that time, turning the ball over three times and receiving a technical foul. The Mavericks finally ended a scoring drought with a 3-pointer by Hardaway with less than three minutes left in the quarter. Another 3-pointer by Hardaway later in the third extended the lead to six points before Gordon hit a 3 for Houston. But Doncic scored the last four points of the quarter to put the Mavericks up 84-77 entering the fourth. DeMarcus Cousins was ejected after receiving two technical fouls in about three minutes in the second quarter. The first one came when he and Cauley-Stein both got one after jawing at each other after fighting for a rebound. Cousins was ejected when he yelled at an official after not getting a foul call after a layup with about nine minutes left in the first half. Silas was clearly unhappy with the call and stood inches away from a referee pointing and arguing about it for a couple of minutes before he was pushed away by Harden. TIP-INS Mavericks: James Johnson received a flagrant-1 foul after hitting Tate in the face on a foul in the third quarter. ... Cauley-Stein added 15 points with seven rebounds. Rockets: Danuel House missed the game with back spasms. ...

"Giannis Antetokounmpo gets rolling early in the game and never stop going, as he scores a season-high 43 points and the Bucks get a 125-115 win. (1:38) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 43 points and the Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Detroit Pistons 125-115 on Monday night to move above the .500 mark for the first time this season. The reigning two-time MVP scored 30 points by halftime, shot 17 of 24 from the floor overall and finished with nine rebounds. Antetokounmpo said he might have gotten a little more room to operate inside because the Bucks (4-3) have shot so well from 3-point range lately. Milwaukee made at least 20 3-pointers in three of its first six games, including 22 in a 126-96 blowout of Chicago on Friday. “They know that the previous game I’d been finding my teammates for a lot of 3s, finding the shooters,” Antetokounmpo said. ""Coming to this game, they probably were like, ‘Don’t let them pick us apart with our passing.’ That’s why there was a lot of space.” Antetokounmpo's presence helped the Bucks outscore the Pistons 62-42 in the paint, including a 40-14 edge in the first half. “Next game we've just got to make it harder for him,” said Detroit guard Derrick Rose, who scored 24 points off the bench to match Jerami Grant for the team lead. “Nobody was taking any charges tonight against him. We didn't make him think.” The Bucks (4-3) have won their last eight regular-season meetings with the Pistons, which represents the longest streak for either team in the history of the series. Detroit (1-6) played without two of its top three scorers in Blake Griffin and Josh Jackson. The Pistons rested Griffin to protect his surgically repaired left knee after he played 29 minutes a night earlier in a  122-120 loss to Boston. Jackson has a sprained right ankle. Milwaukee's Khris Middleton scored 19 points, Jrue Holiday had 15 and D.J. Augustin 11. Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis added 10 each. Sekou Doumbouya, Wayne Ellington and Svi Mykhailiuk scored 13 each for the Pistons. Milwaukee went ahead for good midway through the first quarter and led by as much as 18, though Detroit cut the margin to single digits in the fourth quarter. The Bucks led 118-110 with just over two minutes left when Doumbouya drove into the lane and had his shot blocked by Antetokounmpo. The star forward followed that up with a putback on the other end to give Milwaukee a 10-point edge with 1:39 remaining. Detroit never threatened again. “They just kept coming at us, coming at us,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “They made some big 3s, tough 3s, and that blocked shot and then the putback was big.” TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit coach Dwane Casey is optimistic Jackson will return for Wednesday’s game at Milwaukee. “If it was up to him, he’d probably be ready to go again tonight. But take our time, let it get fully healed and try not to cause any further damage,” Casey said. Bucks: Milwaukee didn’t have reserve guards Pat Connaughton or Sam Merrill available. Budenholzer said Connaughton strained his left groin in practice and Merrill sprained his left ankle while landing on a stanchion during Friday's game. Budenholzer didn’t have a timeline for when either player might return. HAYES HURT Pistons rookie guard Killian Hayes headed to the locker room early in the third quarter after he got hurt making a diving attempt to deflect a pass. Casey said Hayes would get an MRI on Tuesday. “They thought it was a hip flexor, but they weren't sure, so they're going to see,” Casey said.","401267259"
"Malcolm Brogdon hits the deciding shot with less than two seconds left in overtime as the Pacers defeat the Pelicans. (0:38) NEW ORLEANS -- — Malcolm Brogdon capped a 21-point, 11-assist performance by bouncing in a driving, one-handed floater with 1.7 seconds left in overtime, and the Indiana Pacers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 118-116 on Monday night. “It was pretty simple,” Brogdon said of the winning basket. “Coach (Nate Bjorkgren) trusts me with the ball. He wanted me to get it, get to my spot and make the last shot. I got to my spot and it dropped."" Victor Oladipo scored 25 points for Indiana, hitting a 29-foot 3-pointer and following that up with a steal from Lonzo Ball to spark a six-point comeback in the final 20 seconds of regulation. “We have a lot of guys who can step up and hit big shots and it’s huge for this team,"" Oladipo said. ""Our team did a good job of weathering the storms tonight.” After Oladipo's steal, Brogdon got the ball to Myles Turner, who made an open, game-tying 3 from straight away with 8.2 seconds left in regulation. “I’m very confident in everything I do. Obviously it was a big shot,"" Turner said. ""I’m always ready for moments like that and I let the game come to me. I say it all the time: ‘I work too hard on my shot not to trust it.’” Turner had 17 points and three blocks before he fouled out with a minute left in overtime. Domantas Sabonis had 19 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out with about four minutes left in regulation. “This team doesn’t quit,” Turner said. “It’s just a winner’s mentality, and that’ll carry you a long way.” Brandon Ingram scored 31 points and Zion Williamson added 24 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans, which led 104-94 with 3:46 left in regulation after Ingram's three-point play on a short pull-up as he was fouled by Sabonis. Pelicans guard Eric Bledsoe had 12 points and 11 rebounds for his second double-double in as many games. “I'm not discouraged,” Ingram said. “Anybody can win or lose on any given night. So, we believe in our guys. We're not discouraged. We're ready for the next test.” The Pelicans were still up by six with less than a half-minute to go when JJ Redick missed a 3-point attempt from the near the right sideline, setting up the dramatic sequence in which the Pacers tied it. “I screwed that up,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “All we had to do was get a timeout when we were struggling with the press and advance the ball up the floor and we probably end up winning the game. So that one's on me.” Ingram pulled up from 20 feet at the end of regulation, but was unable to connect, forcing overtime. Turner and Oladipo each scored five points in overtime before Brogdon's winner. TIP-INS Pacers: Made 19 3s on 45 attempts (42.2%). ... Doug McDermott scored 11 points. ... Oladipo had his fourth 20-point outing in six games. ... Turner committed his fifth foul with 8:36 left in the third quarter. ... Brogdon and T.J. McConnell each had three steals.

Williamson now has four double-doubles in seven games this season after registering two in 24 games as a rookie. ... The Pelicans went 9 of 27 from 3-point range. TURNOVER TROUBLE The Pelicans committed 18 turnovers, leading to 22 Pacers points. “We just got to get better with the ball. It's been a major problem,” said Van Gundy, who is in his first season as Pelicans coach but was also alluding to how the team played before he arrived. “We have some games where we take care of the ball and when we do we play well and we win and when we don't, we struggle. But a lot of that is just individual guys making better plays and being more solid with the ball. They were very physical tonight — a lot of grabbing and holding — an we've got to play a lot stronger.”","401267260"
"Draymond Green wildly jumps up and down to orchestrate the Warriors' offense. (0:24) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Stephen Curry followed up his career-high 62 points a night earlier with another 30 points, nine rebounds and eight assists to lead the suddenly clicking Golden State Warriors past the Sacramento Kings 137-106 on Monday. Curry had 23 points at halftime on 7-for-11 shooting, including 4 of 7 on 3-pointers — nine fewer than his total at the break the night before but impressive nonetheless on a winning back-to-back. He finished with five 3s. “It’s a statement to us that we’re getting better. That’s all you can ask for,” Curry said. With 92 points over the past two nights, Curry posted his third-highest point total in a two-game span, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He scored 97 combined on Feb. 25 and 27, 2016, and 93 on Feb. 24-25, ’16. After another stellar outing, Curry's sister, Sydel, chimed in — apparently at critics of No. 30, who peeled a wrap off his right quad muscle before the second half began and used a wrap on his lower back during breaks that coach Steve Kerr said is ""just maintenance."" “Now please shut up! Respectfully, proud lil sis,” she posted on Twitter. Kelly Oubre Jr. took some pressure off Curry on the perimeter by knocking down four 3-pointers on the way to 18 points. Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins dished out five assists apiece as the Warriors totaled an NBA season-high 41. Golden State jumped to a 19-7 lead and the Kings called a timeout after Curry's first 3 of the night at the 5:24 mark in the opening quarter. With Green back and healthy playing his third game this season, the Warriors again showed more effort and energy on the defensive end as they did Sunday to split a two-game home set against Portland. “That's got to be the identity of this group,” Green said. “As we continue to figure each other out offensively, figure out where shots are coming from, the one thing we can be consistent on is our energy and effort on the defensive end."" Sacramento's Harrison Barnes had 18 points and nine rebounds against his former team, and De’Aaron Fox added 18 points and seven assists. The Kings, coached by former Warriors top assistant and Kerr close friend Luke Walton, dropped their third straight. They were coming off consecutive losses at Houston. “Well that was a frustrating one, clearly,” Walton said. “We looked like the team that played on a back-to-back instead of them.” STOPPING STEPH Walton texted Kerr late Sunday about Curry's career performance — and then got to work trying to figure out a way to slow down the two-time MVP who shoots from anywhere his heart desires. “Obviously, Luke is beloved around here; he's got a lot of friends. He said something about how much fun it was to watch Steph and then he had that moment of ... ‘Now I’ve got to guard him tomorrow night, I don't know what we're going to do.'” The 32-year-old Curry received Western Conference Player of the Week honors for the 15th time in his 12-year career. “Part of Steph’s magic is when he gets going he lights up the gym and he lights up the basketball world. Everybody’s watching and talking about him,"" Kerr said. ""Our guys were thrilled on the sidelines. It was so much fun to be part of and to witness it and when that happens there’s just a natural glow in the building.” NO LETDOWN Kerr wasn't sure what to expect from his young group after the high of Curry's special night and a quick turnaround. “We've got to back it up,” he said. “If we're going to be a good team, these are the games we have to win to build some momentum and continue to build our identity and figure out who we are, what kind of team we are.” TIP-INS Kings: F Jabari Parker missed the game for personal reasons. ... The Kings fell behind 30-14 while making only four of 14 shots to begin the game. ... Sacramento had won the last three in the series, and two in a row on the Warriors' home floor. ... Buddy Hield is at 73 straight games with at least one 3-pointer dating to Nov. 3, 2019, the NBA's longest active such streak.

"Kyrie Irving goes behind the back to set up Jarrett Allen's one-hand dunk. (0:30) NEW YORK -- — Kyrie Irving scored 20 of his 29 points in the first half to lead the undermanned Brooklyn Nets to a 130-96 win over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night. Brooklyn, which entered the game having lost two straight and four of five, never trailed. The Nets led 35-14 after the first quarter and 63-44 at halftime. Brooklyn’s 19-point halftime lead was its biggest in about 10 months. In the Nets’ 139-120 win over San Antonio on Mar. 6, 2020, they had a 21-point (75-54) halftime lead. Irving was a prime factor in the Nets’ first-half attack, scoring 18 points in the first quarter and 20 by halftime. Irving’s 18 first-quarter points were the third-most scored by an player on any team in an opening quarter this season. His 20 first-half points marked the fifth time this season he had that many in an opening half. “(Irving is) going to score,” Bruce Brown said. “He was hot. ... Kyrie just went crazy today.” As brilliant as he was individually, Irving had help from Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert. Allen recorded his third double-double of the season with 19 points and 18 rebounds. Allen credited a change of his pregame meal from pasta with pesto sauce to pasta with alfredo sauce for his season high in points and rebounds. “I think that was the thing that turned my game on tonight,” Allen said with a grin. LeVert came off the bench to score 24 points off the bench. Joe Harris chipped in with 10 points. “It’s really satisfying,” LeVert said. The Nets did not let up in the second half as they cruised to their fourth win in eight games this season. A sequence in the final 1:34 of the third quarter all but put the game away. It began with an Allen alley-oop dunk off a feed by LeVert, followed by a jumper by LeVert, a breakaway layup for the Nets’ sixth man, and Brooklyn’s young big man buzzer-beating putback. In that stretch, Brooklyn extended its lead from 92-70 to 98-73. Donovan Mitchell led Utah (4-3) with game-high 31 points. Jordan Clarkson added 12, and Rudy Gobert and Royce O’Neale had 10 each for the Jazz, whose two-game winning steak was snapped. “We didn’t come out ready for their pressure,” Mitchell said. “We just didn’t do much right. ... We have to figure out who we want to be.” TIP-INS: NETS: Brooklyn came into the game short-handed, missing Spencer Dinwiddie (right knee anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery) and Kevin Durant (quarantining after coming into contact with a positive COVID-19 test). Tuesday night’s game was the first of four for Brooklyn this week — the Nets host Philadelphia on Thursday and Oklahoma City on Sunday, and travel to Memphis on Friday. Before the game, first-year coach Steve Nash said “the length of the quarantine is kind of a moving target.” Nash did add that he didn’t think Durant would be able to participate in “on-court activity” this week. Durant, who was replaced in the starting lineup by Taurean Prince, is averaging 28.2 points, which leads the Nets and ranks fifth in the NBA. He is also averaging seven rebounds and 4.8 assists, and had played in six of Brooklyn’s first seven games prior to Tuesday night after missing all of 2019-20 recuperating from a ruptured right Achilles tendon. JAZZ: In light of a report from ESPN which said seven seven members of the Los Angeles Clippers’ support staff are quarantining due to a positive COVID-19 test following the Jazz’ 106-100 win on New Year’s Day, Utah coach Quin Snyder expects outbreaks of the virus will challenge all of the league’s teams. “We’ve gone through similar things and I’m sure everybody will at some point this this season,” Snyder said. “Everybody’s in the same boat.”","401267262"
"LeBron James drives around a defender and then bounces a pass to Anthony Davis for a two-handed dunk. (0:18) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Anthony Davis and LeBron James each scored 26 points, rallying the Los Angeles Lakers to a 94-92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. James added 11 rebounds and seven assists, and Dennis Schroder finished with 12 points for Los Angeles. “That’s why he’s great,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said of James taking over the game with Davis. “He finds a way to make those superhero-type of plays. Our focus is on making sure we don’t need those superhero-type of plays to close games out.” Jonas Valanciunas, Dillon Brooks and Gorgui Dieng led Memphis with 13 points apiece, and Brandon Clarke added 12 points. Valanciunas finished with 11 rebounds. On a poor shooting night for both teams, the Lakers were able to depend on James and Davis down the stretch. Los Angeles trailed 79-77 with five minutes left when the two big men combined for a 9-2 run and an 86-81 lead. The final basket came on a dunk by Davis on an assist from James. James and Davis combined for a run of 15 points late in the fourth to take the lead to 92-83 with 31.1 seconds left. “I have a lot of confidence in LeBron James in the fourth quarter,” Vogel said. ""I don’t really know any other way to say that. I trust him.” Memphis was able to put together some late baskets to make it close, but couldn’t overtake the Lakers, who won their fourth straight. “Obviously in a hard fought game like that, you hope to come out with a victory,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “But our guys were amazing. “Effort again. But the attention to detail, the execution. These guys, for 48 minutes, were unbelievable. Came up a little short in the end.” TIP-INS Lakers: Entered the game as the only NBA team ranked in the top 5 in offensive efficiency (2nd/115.7) and defensive efficiency (4th/104.5). … Both Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (left ankle sprain) and Alex Caruso (health and safety protocol) again sat out. Both appeared headed for return in the coming games, according to Vogel. Grizzlies: Valanciunas recorded his seventh straight double-double. … Rookie Desmond Bane saw his streak of games with multiple 3-pointers end at six. That marked the second-longest streak to start an NBA career behind Chicago’s Lauri Markkanen’s 10 straight to open the 2017-18 season. … Swingman John Konchar was the latest Memphis player to miss a game after suffering a left ankle sprain. SOCIAL JUSTICE: Several Laker players referenced news earlier in the day regarding no charges filed against the Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer who shot Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed. “The flame is already lit,” guard Wesley Matthews said. “It just has to continue to keep burning, but burn the right way. Not where anything can be sidetracked.” Matthews later added: “It really is disheartening. But leaders have to be leaders and everybody has to take ownership for their own community.” LIKE ORLANDO: The NBA season has led to creative scheduling. For example, the Lakers ended a road trip where they played consecutive games in San Antonio and then Memphis. And with very little outside interaction in hopes of avoiding the coronavirus. “It’s almost like we were in the bubble, except we’re not in the bubble,” Vogel said. “You kind of go to work, go back to the hotel and not too much else.”","401267263"
"Jared Vanderbilt gives a no-look pass to Anthony Edwards, who barely misses hitting his head on the backboard as he slams it down. (0:22) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic showed his cool down the stretch after losing it earlier in the game. Jokic scored 13 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter and the Denver Nuggets scrambled late to beat Minnesota 123-116 on Tuesday night for their 10th straight win over the Timberwolves. Denver's big man shook off two second-quarter technical fouls — one for hanging on the rim and another for jawing at an official — to lead the Nuggets to the comeback victory. He also had 15 rebounds. “That’s part of basketball,” Jokic said of the calls. “You just forget it.” And remember this: Teammate Will Barton's pregame advice. “I tell him before every game, ‘Just go out there and win MVP. You could be the best player in the world if you want to,’” recounted Barton, who scored 20 points. ""When he’s aggressive, it’s over with.” JaMychal Green had 17 points off the bench for the Nuggets, who squandered an 18-point lead in the first half and fell behind by eight in the third quarter. They went on a 15-0 run in the fourth to take control. Denver held Minnesota scoreless for more than five minutes during the decisive stretch. D’Angelo Russell scored 33 points and Juancho Hernangomez added 25 against his former team. It was the fifth straight loss for the Timberwolves. “We didn't play with a flow,” Hernangomez said of the fourth-quarter struggles. “We need that. We played really good the first three quarters. We have to watch film and figure it out for the next game.” This game appeared headed toward a blowout when Denver opened a 49-31 lead with 7:30 remaining in the first half. But the Timberwolves caught fire behind the shooting of Hernangomez, who was acquired along with Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt in a deal with Denver last February. It was the second time in three days the teams faced each other. Denver beat the Timberwolves 124-109 in Minnesota on Sunday behind Jokic’s triple-double. Jokic entered this one leading the NBA in assists (12.8 per game) — and turnovers (5.3). The miscues come with the territory when he touches the ball so much, coach Michael Malone conceded. Although, Malone wants to see Jokic’s assist-to-turnover ratio around 3-to-1. “He understands he has to be better and I’m sure that he will,” Malone said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota rookie Anthony Edwards scored 15 points. ... Beasley had 15 and Vanderbilt 11. Nuggets: F Michael Porter Jr. missed a third straight game due to the league’s health and safety protocols involving COVID-19. ... The Nuggets won a coach's challenge late in the third. P.J. Dozier's foul on a 3-point attempt was overturned. ... Denver attempted 45 free throws, its most in a non-overtime game since Jan. 3, 2016. FLASHBACK TO ’18 The last time Minnesota beat Denver was Game No. 82 to close out the 2018 season. That was a winner-goes-to-the-playoffs situation, with the Timberwolves prevailing in overtime. “I don’t think that game resonates at all with our guys anymore,” Malone said. Since then, Denver has captured back-to-back division titles. “Even though we lost the game in our third year with a chance to go to the playoffs, there was no need to panic, there was no need to make wholesale changes,” Malone explained. “Everybody wants the get-rich-quick scheme. Sometimes you have to build it, let it grow and let it come together like we’ve done.” TOWNS UPDATE Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said center Karl-Anthony Towns has “progressed steadily” from a dislocated left wrist, but wouldn't be available against Denver or again Thursday at Portland. “He’s doing a little bit more where he can kind of handle a basketball on the court,” Saunders explained. “Once we get back to Minnesota, we’ll evaluate more, and get him around the team and see where he is at that point.”","401267264"
"Patrick Beverley shoves Patty Mills in the back with two hands while fighting for a rebound. (0:33) LOS ANGELES -- — Patty Mills hit a career-high eight 3-pointers and scored 27 points off the bench, and the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 116-113 on Tuesday night to snap a four-game skid. Dejounte Murray added 21 points, Rudy Gay had 16 points, LaMarcus Aldridge 14 points and Keldon Johnson grabbed a career-high 11 rebounds for the Spurs. They led by 24 in the first quarter and withstood an onslaught by Kawhi Leonard in the third before nearly blowing their lead in the fourth. The Spurs tied a franchise record with 20 3-pointers. “It was a mentality we came out with on the defensive end. It has nothing to do with shooting the ball,” Mills said. “Playing team defense like that fuels the fire and confidence for everyone to be able to play with the same sort of energy.” Leonard scored a game-high 30 points and had 10 assists. He had 11 points in the third, when Patrick Beverley made three 3-pointers, and the Clippers closed within one. Nicolas Batum had 21 points and nine rebounds, and Beverley finished with 20 points. “He was pushing the pace in transition, getting to the paint and throwing it out to shooters,” Leonard said of Beverley. “He was very active on defense.” The Clippers were without Paul George, who tweaked his ankle in Sunday’s win over Phoenix. They sorely missed his averages of 25.1 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.1 assists per game. The Spurs opened the fourth with a 12-2 run that restored their lead to double digits. Mills hit three 3-pointers in a row to extend San Antonio's lead to 111-96. But the Clippers kept clawing. They closed the game on a 17-5 run despite Leonard scoring just two points in the fourth quarter, when his shot from the right side with five seconds left missed under defensive pressure from DeMar DeRozan. “That’s what we wanted,” Spurs rookie guard Devin Vassell said. “We knew they couldn't get an open 3 off.” The Clippers scored 40 points in the third to pull to 85-84. Leonard had 11 points and Beverley hit three 3-pointers to help them rally from 19 down at halftime. The Spurs opened the second quarter with an 18-3 run that pushed their lead to 54-30. Five players scored, led by Murray with five points. Leonard scored the Clippers' final 11 points. TIP-INS Spurs: They have the franchise's youngest roster since Gregg Popovich became coach in 1996, with an average age of 25.5 years.

"Derrick Jones Jr. continues to amaze with his flashy dunks as he takes off and flies for the one-handed jam in the third quarter. (0:23) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Zach LaVine was blunt: The Chicago Bulls of the recent past wouldn't have come back to beat the Trail Blazers like this. The short-handed Bulls rebounded from a 20-point first-half deficit to down Portland 111-108 on Tuesday night. Coby White had 21 points and a career-high 10 rebounds, while Otto Porter Jr. added 19 points and 13 rebounds. The Bulls had seven players in double figures. “We didn't stop playing,” said LaVine, who finished with 18 points and nine assists. “After the first quarter, they came out hitting a lot of tough shots. It's not like we were playing bad, it just happens in a game. We got to a timeout and we just said we're going to keep playing regardless, and we got back into it."" Asked point-blank if it was a game last season's Bulls would have won, LaVine emphatically said “No.” CJ McCollum led the Blazers with 26 points, including six 3-pointers. Damian Lillard had 24 points and nine assists. The Blazers led by as many as 20 points early in the game, but the Bulls chipped away at the lead, tying it in the fourth quarter at 91 on Porter's 3-pointer. Garrett Temple's 3 gave the Bulls a 96-94 lead with 6:36 left. Portland went up 100-98 lead on Carmelo Anthony's 3-pointer before Chicago rookie Patrick Williams' floater tied it again with 4:12 to go. Porter's pull-up jumper made it 104-100 with just over three minutes left. Lillard was fouled on a 3-point attempt and made all his free throws, pulling Portland within 106-103. He added two free throws with 30.8 seconds left to narrow the gap further. LaVine's step-back 3-pointer appeared to be the winner for Chicago — until Lillard made a 3 to get the Blazers within a point again with 5.7 seconds to go. White made a pair of free throws in the final moments and Portland fell short. “I think the guys just had a real good disposition when we were down about what we had to do to get back in the game,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. The Blazers (3-4) were coming off a 137-122 loss to Golden State on Sunday. Golden State's Stephen Curry scored a career-high 62 points against Portland. “Make no mistake. We didn't shoot the ball in the fourth quarter,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""We lost this in the second half. Chicago out played us, they played harder than us. We let down our guard and gave up 66 points in the second half after having an outstanding first half defensively.” After going 0-3 to start the season, the Bulls have improved with wins in four of their last five games, including a 118-108 victory over the Mavericks, paced by LaVine's 39 points. The Bulls were without Lauri Markkanen, Ryan Arcidiacono, Chandler Hutchinson and Tomas Satoransky for the fourth straight game because of the league's COVID-19 protocols. Hutchinson and Satoransky tested positive and are isolating. The Blazers made four straight 3-pointers to open the game and went on a 14-0 run to close out the first quarter with a 39-21 lead. Gary Trent Jr.'s shot from distance gave Portland a 47-27 lead. The Bulls closed the gap with a 13-0 run capped by Porter's 3-pointer to get within 47-40. The Blazers went into halftime with a 54-45 lead. “When that adversity hits and there are momentum swings, it’s no reason to hang your head and get down,"" Donovan said. ""It’s part of the game, and you've gotta be able to compete through those moments. I thought our guys did a good job of competing and staying the course.” TIP INS Bulls: It was the first of a four-game road trip for the Bulls. ...

"Kendrick Perkins says Max Kellerman is ready to put a ring on his take that the 76ers should hold off on trading for James Harden. (1:44) INDIANAPOLIS -- — The Indiana Pacers needed Malcolm Brogdon to play a bigger role when T.J. Warren injured his foot. Brogdon has thrived in it. He scored 35 points, his second career high in three games, and made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:22 left to lead the Indiana Pacers past the Houston Rockets 114-107 on Wednesday night. “I think he’s comfortable with the offense, comfortable with coach (Nate Bjorkgren), he knows where to get his shots and when to be aggressive,” two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo said. “He’s playing great for us right now. We’re going to need him to do that all year.” Brogdon has logged more than 40 minutes in each of the past three games, and on Wednesday he even played the leading role on defense against the usually high-scoring James Harden. Harden finished with 15 points, his second straight sub-20-point performance as the Pacers won their second straight and beat Houston at home for the first time since January 2017. “My team trusts me with the ball, my coaches trust me with the ball,” Brogdon said. “These shots were already made this summer, these shots were already made in preseason."" But the Pacers won this one with defense, too. After Harden scored on a late layup to make it 107-106, Brogdon answered with the go-ahead 3, Domantas Sabonis scored on a putback to extend the margin to four and Brogdon sealed the victory with two free throws with 29.9 seconds to go. Indiana scored the final eight points. Justin Holiday had a season-high 20 points for Indiana, while John Wall scored a season-best 28 points in his fourth game with the Rockets. Harden also had 12 assists for Houston — not enough to avoid a second straight loss. “They were really good at driving the ball into the paint and that was one of the things for us this game, was to protect the paint,"" coach Stephen Silas said. “They had 60 points in the paint, so that tells you how well we did. But the 8-0 run, we had a turnover in there. We’ve just got to be better.” TIP-INS Rockets: David Nwaba had a season-high 15 points. ... Houston was 8 of 30 on 3s and had 16 turnovers. ... Houston is 1-2 when Harden and Wall are in the lineup together. ... The Rockets are 1-4 when allowing 110 or more points and 0-3 on the road this season. ... F Christian Wood did not play. ... Houston has had at least two players score 20 or more points in all six games. Pacers: Holiday's first 3-pointer of the game late in the first quarter was his 133rd off the bench for Indiana. That broke a tie with Sam Perkins for No. 7 in the franchise's NBA history. Holiday finished with three 3s. ... Myles Turner had eight blocks, matching his career best for the second time this season. ... Sabonis had 22 points and 12 rebounds, his eighth straight double-double this season. ... Doug McDermott left in the second half with a sprained left ankle and did not return. He scored six points. HELPING HAND DeMarcus Cousins got off to a strong start, scoring nine points and grabbing 10 rebounds in the first half. The second half wasn't nearly as impressive. Cousins was shut down over the final two quarters, going 2 of 9 from the field and finishing with 14 points and four blocks. Silas appreciated the effort. “I thought he was great,"" Silas said. “He started the game off really good and really rebounded the ball well and attacked the rim.”","401267267"
"Markelle Fultz's knee gives out as he drives to the rim, sending him to the floor in excruciating pain. (0:28) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Former top overall draft pick Markelle Fultz suffered a season-ending tear of the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the first quarter of the Orlando Magic’s 105-94 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night. Fultz, who was off to the best start of his career, was driving to the basket less than five minutes into the game when he was cut off by Isaac Okoro and his left knee buckled without contact. The Orlando point guard writhed in pain on the floor for several minutes before he was helped into a wheelchair. The team confirmed after the game that Fultz tore his ACL. “It’s a huge blow for us,” said Magic center Nikola Vucevic, whose team also will be without standout forward Jonathan Isaac this season because of an ACL tear. “Unfortunately for (Fultz) this is really sad because for two years he had the injury with his shoulder, then last year he finally got to play and this year it was supposed to be a big year for him. He was ready and he started the season out awesome. This really sucks for a guy like him who has worked his way back. It’s hard to see and you feel for the guy.” Fultz signed a three-year, $50 million extension last month and was finally showing the promise that made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft as he led the Magic to a quick start this season. He came in averaging a career-best 14-3 points in seven games. Fultz was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers as part of their lengthy rebuild but struggled for years with a difficult-to-diagnose shoulder injury ultimately determined to be thoracic outlet syndrome, a nerve ailment that affected the feeling in his arm and hand. He was traded to the Magic in February 2019. Rookie Cole Anthony, who had eight points, four rebounds and three assists on Wednesday, will now be the starter at point guard for the Magic. Fellow rookie Jordan Bone will also see playing time with Michael Carter-Williams out with a sprained foot ligament. Terrence Ross scored 20 points and hit five 3-pointers to lead the Magic, who beat the Cavaliers for a second time in three nights. “This is part of the league. It happens, people get hurt,” Ross said. “We play a lot and go through a lot and people get hurt. We’ve still got to keep playing ball. We have a way to play and we can’t let the whole season fall or collapse because of a couple of injuries.” Dwayne Bacon added 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting and Nikola Vucevic chipped in 16 points, seven rebounds and six assists for an Orlando squad off to its best eight-game start since the 2017-18 season. Down by as much as 13 points early on, the Magic surged ahead by as much as 21 early in the fourth quarter. Collin Sexton scored 21 points for Cleveland, his eighth straight game with at least 20 points to start the season. That broke LeBron James’ franchise record from 2004-05. Sexton played through a left ankle sprain suffered in the first half. Orlando missed its first six 3-point tries but made 10 of 17 from beyond the arc in the second and third quarters. Cleveland was 4 of 26 from 3-point range. Andre Drummond had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Cavs, his eighth straight double-double. TIP-INS Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said he stopped his preparations for the game to watch supporters of President Donald Trump storm the U.S. Capitol. “It’s saddening and it’s disgusting, to be honest with you. Our democracy has been a beacon for hundreds of years of what the world ideologically should be, and people have looked up to us all over the world.

"Bradley Beal drops 60 points vs. 76ers to tie Gilbert Arenas for the Wizards' single-game scoring record. (2:45) PHILADELPHIA -- — Bradley Beal sank his free throw in the final seconds to reach a milestone, a Washington record-tying 60 points. Dominant again, Joel Embiid had already made it a moot point. Embiid scored 38 points and the NBA-leading Philadelphia 76ers overcame Beal's first career 60-point game in a 141-136 win over the Wizards on Wednesday night. The Sixers are an NBA-best 7-1 in coach Doc Rivers' first season in Philadelphia. “They pay me to take over the game, and they pay me to dominate,"" Embiid said. Beal scored 57 points through three quarters and seemed poised to not only smash the 60-point mark, but complete Washington's rally from 21 points down. Embiid snuffed that out in the fourth, scoring 11 points to just three for Beal. “I put it on myself to close it out,” Beal said. “I've got to be better.” Beal was stuffed on a layup and missed a 3-pointer inside the final minute, nearly coming up short of joining Golden State’s Stephen Curry as 60-point scorers this season. Curry scored a career-high 62 points on Sunday night. Beal, who once scored 53 and 55 points in consecutive games, sank a free throw with 4.4 seconds left to hit the mark. He went 20 of 25 from the floor, made 7 of 10 3-points and went 13 of 15 from the line to match former Wizard Gilbert Arenas for the franchise single-game mark. “There’s no reason anybody should drop 60 on us,” Embiid said. Beal was sensational from the start, going 11 of 16 (four 3-pointers) from the floor in the first half for 32 points and joined Michael Jordan (34 points in 2001) and Arenas (33 points in 2006 and 30 in 2007) as Wizards to score 30 in half over the last 20 years. He hit seven 3s and reached 57 points through three quarters, and that should have been enough to give the Wizards the lead. But Washington's defense was atrocious in the first half. They gave up 82 points and trailed by as many as 21 points, Beal outscoring the rest of the Wizards. “He can score a lot of points on any team on any given night, but he wants to lead us in victories,” coach Scott Brooks said. Arenas, who turned 39 on Wednesday, scored 60 points on Dec. 17, 2006. Beal failed to win again on a night on which he topped 50 points. “All my career highs have been losses,” he said. “I don’t give a damn.” Embiid again carried the Sixers after a rare slow start and continued his torrid early season run. He missed all six shots in the first quarter and scored one point. He then scored 14 in the second and helped the Sixers roll to a 19-point lead. Embiid tossed in a fadeaway and made the free throw to give the Sixers a 131-127 lead. His second three-point play in 90 seconds made it 134-131. He then buried a 3 to seal Philadelphia’s fifth straight win. Seth Curry hit six straight 3-pointers in the first half and finished with 28 points. Ben Simmons had 17 points and 12 assists. Tobias Harris scored 19. The Sixers made 18 of 29 3-pointers and shot 62% overall from the floor. Russell Westbrook played a dislocated finger on his right hand and scored 20 points for the Wizards. RIVERS SPEAKS Rivers used his voice to condemn the riots in Washington much in the same way he denounced racial injustice in the NBA bubble as teams grappled with how to deal with issues far more important than basketball. He was invited to speak at a Joe Biden rally after the President-elect used Rivers’ words in an October speech, calling for racial unity at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Rivers again decried the riotous mob Wednesday in Washington, though he cautioned, “democracy will prevail.” “I’ll say it because I don’t think a lot of people want to: Could you imagine today if those were all Black people storming the Capitol and what have happened,” Rivers asked. “That to me is a picture worth a thousand words for all of us to see. It’s something for us to reckon with, again, no police dogs turned on people, no billy clubs hitting people. People peacefully being escorted out of the Capitol. It shows you can disperse a crowd peacefully, I guess.” Rivers added: “As an older black male, I’ve seen police dogs being unleashed on people, and then you see today where there’s nothing, and so that’s an emotion that I have, right?” TIP-INS 76ers: The Sixers haven’t lost at home since Dec. 20, 2019. ...

"Gordon Hayward leads all scorers with 44 points as the Hornets defeat the Hawks 102-94. (1:32) ATLANTA -- — Gordon Hayward scored a career-high 44 points and the Charlotte Hornets recovered after trailing for the first time in the fourth quarter and beat the Atlanta Hawks 102-94 on Wednesday night. The Hornets led by double figures most of the game before Atlanta claimed its first lead, at 86-85, on John Collins' three-point play with 5:22 remaining. Hayward answered with a jumper and his own three-point play and the Hornets never trailed again. Hayward said it was a true career high — the most points he had scored at any level. “I never scored 40 in high school,” Hayward said before giving credit to his teammates. “People were finding me all night.” Hayward made 15 of 25 shots, including 4 of 9 from behind the arc. “I was proud of Gordy,” said Charlotte coach James Borrego. “He understood we needed pressure taken off our offense tonight, and he took the pressure.” Collins led Atlanta with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Kevin Huerter had 19 points. Trae Young, averaging 28.6 points, scored only seven points while making 2 of 9 shots from the field. De’Andre Hunter added 17 points. The Hawks entered the game fourth in the league in scoring, but with Young struggling they couldn't find their scoring touch against the Hornets. The Hawks have lost three consecutive games. “Tonight was nasty,” said Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce. “There’s no shaking that. I’m thankful our guys were able to get back and take the lead and show the resiliency we need in this league."" Pierce said he wasn't worried about his team. “Our guys, they’re high-confidence,"" Pierce said. ""They’re learning each other. They’re high-character guys.

YOUNG'S OFF NIGHT Young’s only points of the first half came on a drive midway through the second period. He wasn’t the only Atlanta player to struggle from the field. The Hawks’ 40 first-half points set a season low for any half. Young had seven turnovers and three assists. “I don’t know what the cause was,” Young said. “For me, personally, I had a lot of turnovers in that first half, kind of just losing the ball out of my hands trying to make passes, things like that.”","401267270"
"Goran Dragic ties the game with a 3-pointer, but Payton Pritchard comes through at the other end as he banks in the game-winner for the Celtics. (0:50) MIAMI -- — Rookie guard Payton Pritchard wasn't there last season when the Boston Celtics lost to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference finals. He helped Boston get a measure of revenge Wednesday. Pritchard's putback with two-tenths of a second left capped a wild finish, and the Celtics — who strongly considered not playing the game in response to the latest Jacob Blake decision and the scene at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday — beat the Heat 107-105 in the first matchup this season of last year's East finalists. “To be honest ... I didn't think we were playing,"" said Celtics coach Brad Stevens, who emerged from a pregame team meeting to call his wife about a half-hour before game time and tell her the same. “And then coaches left the room, players finished talking and chose to play."" Jayson Tatum scored 27 points and Jaylen Brown had 21 for the Celtics, who wasted an early 17-point lead and a 10-point lead in the final minute before winning. “Sports is often used as a way to lift people up and spread some joy,"" Brown said. Jimmy Butler had 26 points for Miami, which got 16 points from Duncan Robinson, 15 points from Bam Adebayo and 14 from Goran Dragic. The teams knelt for the national anthem in response to the decision earlier in the week to not charge the police officer who shot Blake last year — as well Wednesday’s developments at the Capitol, where a violent mob loyal to President Donald Trump delayed Congress from certifying the results of November’s election. “Tip your hat to all the pros in both locker rooms,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “It's legitimate that everybody does have a lot on their mind and heavy hearts, disappointment, discouragement, all of these different emotions."" The Celtics went on a late 13-0 run to go up 10 with 1:17 left — only to see the Heat score 10 points in 55 seconds to tie the game on a pair of 3-pointers by Robinson, one while getting fouled, and another from Dragic. “Obviously, there, the urgency is heightened,"" Robinson said. “It just shows how capable we are."" Marcus Smart missed a layup on Boston's last possession, but Pritchard swooped in for the rebound and gamewinner. Miami's last-ditch try was knocked away as time expired and the Heat have now alternated losses and wins in all seven games this season. “We've got to figure this out before it's too late,"" Adebayo said.

The Knicks trailed by 18 in the first half but outplayed the Jazz in the second and won for the fifth time in six games. “It just shows you our spirit and our growth,” Rivers said. “This is a young team, so for us to do that against a team like this, a top tier-caliber playoff team, that’s pretty impressive.” Rivers made four 3-pointers in the final 4:17. “When he gets going like that he’s hard to stop,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said, “and he’s got a lot of toughness to him. Mental toughness, physical toughness, the courage to take those shots, but we had a lot of guys step up in the second half and really fight.” Elfrid Payton scored 22 points for the Knicks (5-3), who have already won more times under Thibodeau than they did in their first 22 games last season under David Fizdale, who was fired when they were 4-18. Jordan Clarkson had 19 points and Donovan Mitchell added 18 for the Jazz, who were swept in a back-to-back set of games in New York. The Brooklyn Nets routed them 130-96 on Tuesday, but Mitchell said the Jazz will get things figured out. “At the end of the day, we’re going to do this,” he said. “It’s just a matter of when.” It appeared the Jazz would bounce back easily after building a big lead in the second quarter, but the Knicks outscored Utah 68-44 in the second half. It was tied at 96 with under five minutes to play before Rivers' surge. He scored five straight points before a basket by Mitchell, then nailed consecutive 3s to give New York a 107-98 lead with 2:22 to go. Mitchell scored again but Rivers answered with another 3 for a 10-point lead with 47 seconds remaining. Utah coach Quin Snyder said it was hard to have a normal preparation for Wednesday's game because of the difficulty concentrating on basketball while watching the violence in Washington. Yet, the Jazz appeared much more ready to play Wednesday than a night earlier, when they trailed 35-14 after one quarter. A 19-5 spurt pushed their lead to 34-20 and they were ahead by as much as 18 later in the period. But the Knicks outscored the Jazz 34-19 in the third. TIP-INS Jazz: Rudy Gobert had 14 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks. ...

Pistons rookie Saddiq Bey had 20 points and 10 rebounds while shooting 6 of 10 from 3-point range. Pistons coach Dwane Casey said his team hurt itself by starting slowly in the first and third quarters. “We didn't start the right way,” Casey said. “Subsequently, we had a 15-point loss.” Brook Lopez scored 17 points, Bobby Portis had 16, rookie Jordan Nwora provided 11 and Jrue Holiday added 10 for the Bucks. Wayne Ellington scored 12 and Derrick Rose had 10 for the Pistons. Rose left the game early with a bruised right knee. The game got a bit testy in the closing minutes with physical play that included Antetokounmpo falling to the floor after tangling with Detroit’s Isaiah Stewart. Antetokounmpo went to the Pistons’ bench after the game and exchanged words with Stewart before they were separated. MAKING A STATEMENT On the night after a  prosecutor decided not to file charges against a white police officer who shot a Black man in Wisconsin,  both the Bucks and Pistons offered their response  at the start of the game. After the Bucks won the opening tip, Antetokounmpo held the ball as players from both teams took a knee. After the ensuing inbounds pass, Detroit's Blake Griffin held the ball while players again took a knee. Budenholzer proposed doing something during the game — when it would be more visible — rather than during the national anthem. The Bucks said they held the ball for seven seconds to reflect the seven times Jacob Blake was shot. “We know that when the game starts, people are going to be paying attention,” Antetokounmpo said. “That was the right time to do it. It was a great idea by Bud.” Blake was left paralyzed after getting shot in the back by Kenosha police officer Rusten Sheskey on Aug. 23. The Bucks sat out a first-round playoff game  with the Orlando Magic last summer to protest that shooting. TIP-INS Pistons: Rookie guard Killian Hayes tore the labrum in his right hip during the third quarter of Monday’s game. The Pistons announced the severity of Hayes’ injury  Wednesday without offering a timetable for his potential return. Bucks: Milwaukee was 19 of 43 from 3-point range and just missed reaching 20 3-pointers in a game for the fourth time this season. Before this year, the Bucks had made at least 20 3-pointers in a game just four times in franchise history.","401267273"
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander drives inside and finishes with a floater high off the backboard. (0:19) NEW ORLEANS -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 points, George Hill hit the go-ahead free throws with 12 seconds left, and the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 111-110 on Wednesday night. “It was a fun win. Guys were excited after that one because we had to earn that one, all 48 minutes,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “We stuck together and we made plays. Guys made plays tonight when they had to.” The Pelicans had the final possession, and top scorers Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson both touched the ball. But it was second-year reserve guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker who took the last shot from 3-point range. It rattled out with a couple of seconds remaining and neither team could control the rebound before time expired. “I saw an open Nickeil,"" said Ingram, whose pass set up the final shot. “A shot that I’ve seen him make a thousand times in practice and different games. He was open. He almost made it. It just rolled in and out. It was a good play.” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy took no issue with the final play, either. It was the Thunder's 27 fast-break points that annoyed him. “I don’t think the last play had much to do with anything. The bottom line is we didn’t play any defense,” Van Gundy said. “Been going on too long with this group. Dig in, and play the game defensively. ... If you can’t win scoring 110 points, there’s something wrong.” Darius Bazley had 20 points and 12 rebounds for Oklahoma City, which avenged a home loss to New Orleans last week while winning for just the second time in six games. Reserve forward Mike Muscala scored 18 points, hitting five 3-pointers. Hill finished with 13. Williamson scored 29 points, while Ingram had 24 points and 11 rebounds. Steven Adams had 10 points, 10 assists and 11 rebounds for his first career triple-double. Adams scored five points in the final 2:30. He put the Pelicans up 104-100 with a putback while he was fouled and later gave New Orleans a 106-103 lead with 1:35 left. Gilgeous-Alexander tied it at 106 with a driving layup as he was fouled by Alexander-Walker. He later baited Lonzo Ball into a shooting foul behind the 3-point line and made all three free throws to put Oklahoma City up 109-108 in the final minute. Williamson's short turnaround off the glass briefly put New Orleans in front once more before Al Horford beat the Pelicans to a rebound of Gilgeous-Alexander's miss and the ball found Hill, who was fouled by Ball to set up the decisive free throws. ""We did a great job of staying resilient and making plays when we had to,” Hill said. TIP-INS Thunder: Made 19 3-pointers on 46 attempts (41.3%). ... Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with nine assists. ... Oklahoma City led by as many as 14 points in the game and by 10 in the fourth quarter before allowing New Orleans to take several late leads. Pelicans: JJ Redick bruised his right knee and did not play in the second half. ... New Orleans missed 18 of 22 3-point attempts (18.2%) but shot 49.4% (44 of 89) overall. ... The Pelicans outscored the Thunder 58-36 in the paint and outrebounded Oklahoma City 52-38. ... Alexander-Walker finished with 13 points. Ball scored 15 points and Eric Bledsoe 13. ... Josh Hart grabbed 10 rebounds. ADAMS' ASSISTS Daigneault, a Thunder assistant during Adams' last season in Oklahoma City, wasn't surprised to see the 7-footer finally get double-digit assists. “He showed last year that when you play through him, he can glue your offense together and that was on display tonight,"" Daigneault said. ""We made a couple mistakes on cuts and he really made us pay for it. That’s what makes him a really good player. He not only does the dirty work, but he can quarterback it a little bit, too.”","401267274"
"Chris Paul sneaks an inbounds pass to Cam Johnson, who sinks a 3-pointer. (0:22) PHOENIX -- — Devin Booker scored 24 points, Jae Crowder added 21 and the Phoenix Suns made 21 3-pointers on the way to a 123-115 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night. The Suns made at least 20 3-pointers in a game for the fourth time in franchise history and hit from long range all night, making nine in the first half and 12 more in the second. Crowder led the way with six 3s while Cameron Johnson added four. The Suns have won five of their past six and improved to 6-2, which is tied for tops in the Western Conference with the Los Angeles Lakers. Phoenix has continued the momentum it gained at the end of last season, when it won all eight games in the NBA’s Florida bubble and nearly qualified for the playoffs. Crowder was an under-the-radar signing for the Suns during the offseason after helping Miami reach the NBA Finals last year. The veteran forward has scored at least 15 points in four of eight games. Suns coach Monty Williams said Crowder is useful because he can contribute scoring without being the focal point of the offense. He's quickly found his role with the Suns, providing tough defense and sliding into spaces where he can make shots. “I just think Jae figures it out,” Williams said. “He’s one of those guys who knows how to space and knows how to read the defense when they close out.” Johnson scored 16 to lead the Suns bench, which poured in 42 points. Dario Saric added 15 points and Cameron Payne tied a career high with 10 assists. “We just play really hard,” Payne said. “We try our best to play hard and find each other in the right spots.” The Suns finished 21 of 40 (52.5%) from 3-point range. “Give them credit — they kept stepping into them and kept making them for the most part,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “The 3-point defense hurt us tonight.” Pascal Siakam scored 32 points on 11-of-21 shooting and Kyle Lowry added 24 points for the Raptors, who fell to 1-6 and had their six-game winning streak against Phoenix snapped. The Raptors shot nearly 50% from the field but couldn’t keep up with the Suns. Phoenix led 96-87 going into the fourth quarter and extended its advantage to 105-90 on a corner 3 by Saric with about 9:30 remaining. The Raptors cut the advantage to 121-115 with 35 seconds left but Chris Paul made two free throws to turn back the rally. The game stayed tight throughout the first half and the Suns took a 58-54 lead into halftime. Crowder scored 15 points in the first half and made four 3-pointers. Johnson came off the bench to add 13 and made three 3s. Siakam had 19 points before the break, shooting 7 of 10 from the field. ANTHEMS The teams met at center court and linked arms during the singing of the Canadian and U.S. national anthems, reacting to a tumultuous day on which a violent mob supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. “Just a sign, a symbol of unity and togetherness that we want to be a part of as a league and a country,” Williams said. “We realize these are some different times.” TIP-INS Raptors: Forward Aron Baynes returned to the desert after playing last season with the Suns. He averaged a career-high 11.5 points per game last season, playing particularly well early in the season when Ayton was out because of a 25-game suspension. Baynes finished with no points and five rebounds in 13 minutes. ... Lowry was hit in the face during the fourth quarter while trying to defend Ayton. Officials reviewed the play but said no “hostile act” occurred. Lowry stayed down for a minute but returned to the game. Suns: Deandre Ayton had 11 points and 16 rebounds. ... The Suns shot 22 of 24 on free throws. ... Paul had 12 points and eight assists.","401267275"
"Draymond Green and James Wiseman connect for a high-flying alley-oop in the third quarter. (0:16) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Kawhi Leonard scored the tying basket with 6:40 to play, then put his team ahead with a jumper the following possession on the way to 21 points, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Golden State Warriors 108-101 on Wednesday night in the first of two straight matchups between the Pacific Division rivals. Paul George returned from a one-game absence with a sore right ankle to add 21 points and 12 rebounds in the Clippers' fourth straight win against Golden State, which got just 13 points from Stephen Curry on a cold shooting night for the two-time MVP. He tweaked his left ankle late but it wasn't considered serious and Curry will receive treatment Thursday. He had scored 92 the previous two games, including his career-high 62 against Portland on Sunday night. Players and coaches on both sides knelt for the national anthem following earlier chaos at the U.S. Capitol. Marcus Morris Sr. made his season debut after being sidelined by a right knee injury but didn't think the teams should have played. It wasn't discussed, he said. “It’s hard to really put it into words just the direction this country is going in,” Morris said. “... It’s just unfortunate the state that we’re in in this country.” “It was so disheartening,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""I think everybody came into the arena this evening just sort of dazed.” Draymond Green received a Flagrant-1 foul with 4:58 left and Leonard converted both free throws. Patrick Beverley made a 3 with 4:14 left, then Nicolas Batum hit from deep the next two times down. Leonard told coach Tyronn Lue he wanted to play in back-to-backs this season, not typically his routine in recent years, so it’s something they will evaluate regularly. “I was patient and I'm able to play,” Leonard said of health previously dictating his days off. Eric Paschall came off the bench to score nine quick points over five minutes on the way to 19 for the Warriors, who used a 9-0 run over the final 1:13 of the second quarter to get within 52-51 at halftime. The teams were a combined 3 for 19 from 3-point range in first quarter, 1 of 10 by Warriors as they trailed 21-15. Curry missed his three tries from deep and started 1 of 6. He shot 5 for 17 overall, missing five of six 3s. “Our philosophy is we want to try to take the best player out,” Lue said. “We know Steph could go for 60 like he did the other day.” KERR REFLECTS Lue and Kerr were open to their players taking a stand — or a knee — after the violence in Washington and the two coaches talked before tipoff. “I started the day thinking about how we were going to guard Lou Williams without fouling him, suddenly that didn't seem quite as important when I turned the TV on as shootaround was beginning,” Kerr said. ""... It’s just a clear reminder that the truth matters in our country.” DYNAMIC DUO Lue knows when Curry and Green get going, Golden State is tough. Green played in his fourth game of the season since returning from a right foot injury. “With Draymond back, they have a great two-man connection,” Lue said. TIP-INS Clippers: Serge Ibaka had 12 points and 14 rebounds for his first double-double of the season. ... L.A. swept the season series with the Warriors 3-0 last season, holding Golden State to 41.2% from the floor with a 127.0-109.7 scoring advantage. ... The Clippers are 6-2 against the Western Conference, 4-0 vs. the division and 4-1 on the road. Warriors: Green had six of the Warriors' 25 assists and Curry added five, down from their NBA season-high 41 in a rout of the Kings on Monday. ... Andrew Wiggins had 19 points and has scored in double figures in every game, but didn't have a block after getting at least two in each of the previous four games.","401267276"
"Coby White double clutches and finishes with the floater off the backboard while being fouled by Marvin Bagley III. (0:27) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Buddy Hield converted a four-point play with 38 seconds left to make up for a horrible shooting night, and the Sacramento Kings held off the Chicago Bulls 128-124 on Wednesday. Hield missed 12 of his first 14 shots and was 1 of 8 on 3-pointers before hitting one from the top of the arc and getting fouled by former Kings teammate Garrett Temple. Hield sank the free throw to give Sacramento a 124-119 lead and finished with 10 points. “I was joking that the only reason he made the last one is somebody hit him in the head,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “It knocked off his calibration. The only time I ever worry about Buddy shooting is if he turns down a shot, and I haven’t seen him do that yet.” First-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton scored 15 of his season-high 17 points in the fourth quarter and made a key steal in the backcourt. Haliburton followed Hield’s pivotal 3 with one of his own against a pair of Chicago defenders to help the Kings end a three-game losing streak. Marvin Bagley III had 21 points and 12 rebounds for Sacramento, which played most of the game without De’Aaron Fox. The point guard strained his right hamstring midway through the first quarter and did not return. Richaun Holmes had 24 points, eight rebounds and five assists for the Kings. Harrison Barnes added 20 points. Coby White had a career-high 36 points and seven assists for the Bulls. Zach Lavine scored 32 and Wendell Carter Jr. added 11 points and a career-best 17 rebounds. Hield’s clutch shot bailed out the Kings after Sacramento blew a 12-point lead in the first half and trailed with 6 minutes remaining. “Even if (Temple) didn’t foul him, he made the shot anyway,” Chicago coach Billy Donovan said. “They made three 3s coming down the stretch and one of them was a four-point play. I thought they were all well-contested.” Haliburton’s 3-pointer was equally big, making it 127-121 with 12 seconds remaining just before Barnes missed a pair of free throws for Sacramento. Lavine countered with a 3 to cut it to 127-124 with 2.6 seconds to play. Haliburton missed the previous two games with a bone bruise in his left wrist but played the entire fourth quarter of this one while Fox watched from the bench. “I was kind of disappointed in my performance up to that point,” Haliburton said. “Without me, De’Aaron has been asked to do a lot. When he’s out of the game, and even when he’s in the game, sometimes when we’re getting into our half-court offense we tend to walk it up. I was just trying to keep everyone involved. That leads to us winning games.” Before the game, players from both teams locked arms with their teammates during the national anthem. That followed a pattern set by other teams around the NBA after a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to prevent Congress from certifying the results of last November’s presidential election. TIP-INS Bulls: Denzel Valentine had seven points in the final 3:51 of the first quarter. … Carter was called for defensive three seconds, resulting in a technical foul. … Temple scored 11 points in 33 minutes. … Patrick Williams spent much of the first half in concussion protocol after getting hit in the head. Williams finished with nine points. Kings: Walton lost a challenge after Bagley was whistled for a foul early in the fourth quarter. … Jabari Parker missed a second consecutive game for personal reasons.","401267277"
"With Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving out, the Nets still pull off a convincing 122-109 win vs. the 76ers. (1:51) NEW YORK -- — The Brooklyn Nets couldn't put Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant into those throwback blue tie-dye jerseys from 30 years ago. The NBA's leading team still couldn't come close to beating them. Joe Harris scored a season-high 28 points and the Nets shook off the absence of their two superstars to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 122-109 on Thursday night. Brooklyn jumped out quickly and had a double-digit lead for much of the second half while winning its second straight, both without Durant. “Obviously it’s a totally different team when those guys are out here,” guard Caris LeVert said, “but I think we’ve done a great job of having a next-man-up mentality, guys stepping into those roles and fulfilling what we need as a team.” LeVert had 22 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds, and Jarrett Allen added 15 points and 11 boards for the Nets. Irving was ruled out Thursday afternoon for personal reasons, though coach Steve Nash said before and after the game he hadn't spoken to his point guard and didn't know the reason for his absence, calling it a personal matter. LeVert said Irving texted his teammates before the game and they supported his absence. The Nets said Irving would not travel with the team to Memphis on Thursday night. The Nets already knew they’d be without Durant for a second consecutive game because of the NBA’s health and safety protocols. Nash said Durant would be able to return Sunday if he continues to test negative for the coronavirus until then. Nash said he didn't think the strong performance without them sent a message to the rest of his players. “I think the message is for the whole group that when we play connected and we have that fighting spirit, we give ourselves a great chance every night no matter who’s available,” he said. The 76ers came in at 7-1 and off their best performance of the season, when they shot an NBA season-high 61.7% in a 141-136 victory over Washington on Wednesday. But they couldn't duplicate that, with Joel Embiid starting slowly before finishing with 20 points and 12 rebounds. Shake Milton had a season-high 24 points in his first start of the season in place of Seth Curry, who had a sore left ankle, but Ben Simmons was limited to 11 points, four rebounds and two assists. Milton said he didn't believe the Sixers had a letdown because of the Nets' absent stars. “I don’t think that was it at all,” he said. “It’s the NBA and it was a back-to-back, but guys in the NBA know they can play. So if you don’t come out and you’re not on top of your game and you’re not ready to go, not mentally locked in, you can get beat by anybody.” The Sixers quickly fell into a 20-8 hole, but recovered to move into the lead early in the second quarter. The Nets broke away again late in the period, going up by 16 before taking a 65-51 lead to the locker room, and were never seriously threatened afterward. TIP-INS 76ers: Dwight Howard had an eventful night, totaling nine points, 12 rebounds and six fouls in just 16 minutes. ... Coach Doc Rivers said he believed Curry was hurt late in Wednesday's victory, when the guard scored a season-high 28 points. Rivers didn't believe the injury was severe but said it was best to rest Curry. Nets; Brooklyn was also without G Tyler Johnson because of the health and safety protocols. Nash said he believed it was due to contact tracing. ... Jeff Green scored 14 points. OLD JERSEY Irving, who grew up in New Jersey, missed the chance to wear the Nets’ uniforms they wore while playing there. Their blue uniforms were a throwback to the tie-dye ones they wore during the 1990-91 season. The franchise switched to black and white after moving to Brooklyn in 2012.","401267278"

(0:16) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Andre Drummond had 22 points and 15 rebounds, Larry Nance Jr. added 18 points on 7-for-7 shooting from the field and the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 94-90 on Thursday night. Cedi Osman scored 16 points as Cleveland snapped a two-game skid. JaVale McGee added 13 points. Jonas Valanciunas led Memphis with 17 points and 10 rebounds, while Brandon Clarke had 14 points. Dillon Brooks scored 11 but was 4 of 13 from the field. “Pretty bad game for us,” Valanciunas said. “We’ve just got to bounce back. Play better offense. Play better defense. A little more effort in the game. All of us, me included.” A key sequence came with 34 seconds left. On a breakaway by Memphis guard Tyus Jones, Isaac Okoro was called for a foul on Jones’ layup attempt, which the rookie from Auburn blocked. Cleveland challenged, the foul was overturned and the Cavaliers won the ensuing tip. That led to a dunk from Okoro with 10.6 seconds left for a 93-90 lead. “What Isaac understands is there are a multitude of ways you can impact winning throughout the game, and especially in the clutch,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “That chase-down block, if it wasn’t the middle of January, we’d be talking about that block for a long, long time. It was phenomenal.” The Cavaliers were minus leading scorer Collin Sexton, who sat out with a left ankle sprain. That left Cleveland trying to pick up Sexton’s missing 25.1 points a game. In the aftermath of Wednesday’s chaos at the U.S. Capitol, and to protest racial and social injustice, the teams paused at the opening tip, went to the sideline, locked arms and took a knee. They were joined by coaches, staff and reserves covering the entire sideline from end line to end line. The three officials knelt at midcourt behind the line of players. “I’m just so proud to be a part of this league. Our league is at the forefront of all … positive change in my mind,” Nance said. “All things equality. All things social justice. I couldn’t be more proud of the players, the teams, the league we’re in.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: With a steal in the third quarter, Nance reached 400 for his career. He leads the NBA with 2.38 steals per game. ... G Damyean Dotson started his second game of the season. … Played their first game against a Western Conference opponent. ... Drummond has a double-double in all nine games this season. Grizzlies: Have not won a home game this season. Their only two wins came on the road at Brooklyn and Charlotte. … Had 14 steals, a season high. SOCIAL STANCE Both coaches addressed Wednesday’s events in Washington and other questions regarding social justice in the country. “The last nine or 10 months has given us all a priority check, I think,” Bickerstaff said. “Through the civil unrest. Through COVID itself. We have to be able to sit back and prioritize what is important, and there are larger issues at hand that we deal with on a day-to-day basis. … How we interact with each other as a society and as a larger community is more important.” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins noted the first three words of the U.S. Constitution are “We the people,” and said those are strong words to remember as the country reflects on recent events. “It starts with each individual. ‘We the people’ have the power to make change … knowing that better days need to be ahead of us. And they will be ahead of us if we all take that long, hard look at what part can I play in making a difference in positive change?”","401267279"
"Luka Doncic sinks a 3-pointer in overtime as the Mavericks edge out the Nuggets. (0:18) DENVER -- — Luka Doncic is always ready to take the big shot, but he isn’t afraid to pass to a teammate with the game on the line. Maxi Kleber rewarded Doncic’s trust with a clutch 3-pointer late in regulation, then set up a teammate himself for another huge 3 in overtime to lead the Dallas Mavericks over the Denver Nuggets 124-117 Thursday night. Doncic came within one rebound of his second straight triple-double, finishing with 38 points and 13 assists. He sat out Sunday’s loss to Chicago and responded with his first triple-double of the season against Houston on Monday. He followed that up with a season high in points. Nikola Jokic scored 20 of his 38 points after halftime and grabbed 11 rebounds for Denver. Jamal Murray added 21 points and nine assists. The Nuggets led by one in the final seconds of regulation when Kleber came through. Doncic had the ball with time running out, and when the defense collapsed on him he found Kleber, whose 3-pointer put Dallas up 109-107 with 2.4 seconds left. “He’s a great shooter. He's a great player. He does a lot of stuff that few people see,” Doncic said. “Our whole team sees that. It was a great shot. Even if he would have missed it, it was a great shot.” Jokic capped a 17-point fourth quarter with an 18-foot jumper at the horn to send the game to overtime, and Kleber delivered again. He fed Josh Richardson for a 3 with 1:25 left that put the Mavericks ahead 119-114. Denver got within three on a 3-pointer from Jokic, but Doncic scored four straight to ice it for the Mavericks. Richardson finished with 14 points, including a tiebreaking jumper before his 3-pointer. “We had the game. We had the game,” Murray said. “We just didn’t close it like we should have.” Dallas rallied from four down to take a 101-97 lead on a 3 by Kleber, his first points of the night, but Jokic scored the next five to put Denver ahead. “I’m trying to be ready and take that shot with confidence,” Kleber said. “Shots are going to fall or not — you just have to trust and believe.” TIP-INS Mavericks: G Trey Burke wasn’t with the team but coach Rick Carlisle said “to my knowledge, it is not COVID-19 related.” ... F Kristaps Porzingis (knee) is on the trip and making progress but there is no timetable for his return. ""He is ramping things up and the hope is that his progress can continue without issue and then we can see where things are as we move forward,” Carlisle said. Nuggets: F Michael Porter Jr. was expected back Thursday night but he was ruled out hours before tip-off due to health and safety protocols. Porter missed the previous three games because of COVID-19 contact tracing. “He’s not here right now, so I’m not even going to speak on that,” coach Michael Malone said after the game. “We have guys that are talented, have been in the league. They got to step up and help us play. We’ll speak about Michael when he gets back to our team.” SHOW OF UNITY The teams locked arms in a circle and kneeled for the national anthem before the game as a show of solidarity following the insurrection by rioters Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol. “We came together as a team, and we talked to the opponent today, and we wanted to stand together and that’s why we decided before the game to kneel,” Kleber said. “We all have a platform and stand for the right thing.

"Damian Lillard scores 39 points as the Trail Blazers defeat the Timberwolves 135-117. (1:24) PORTLAND. Ore. -- — Damian Lillard had 39 points, including seven 3-pointers, and the Portland Trail Blazers handed the Minnesota Timberwolves their sixth straight loss with a 135-117 victory Thursday night. CJ McCollum added 20 points for the Blazers, who led by 33 in the second half. Jusuf Nurkic had 17 points and seven rebounds before Portland rested its starters in the fourth quarter. D'Angelo Russell and Anthony Edwards each scored 26 points for the Timberwolves (2-6), who continue to struggle without Karl-Anthony Towns as he recovers from a dislocated left wrist. He’s missed six games, coinciding with Minnesota's losing streak. Lillard, who also had seven rebounds and seven assists while playing less than 30 minutes, said he made a point of coming out strong. “I need to be more aggressive, be in attack mode, just trying to lift the level of urgency from the start,” Lillard said. The Timberwolves had a narrow 29-28 edge after the opening quarter, paced by Russell with 11 points. Portland (4-4) pulled in front in the second, taking a 46-36 lead on Gary Trent Jr.'s 3-pointer. Robert Covington's 3, which capped a 15-0 run, extended the lead to 54-36 as Minnesota's offense stalled. After leading 75-56 at the break, the Blazers pushed their advantage to 95-65 in the third quarter on Lillard's 3-pointer from 33 feet out. Edwards dunked to get Minnesota to 116-100 with just over six minutes left. “Losses when they stack up, it hurts,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “We're all competitors here. You’ve got to fight the natural instinct to let go of the rope when things get tough. You grab onto somebody next to you when things get tough.” Saunders said help might be on the way soon because Towns has been making progress. “Once we get back to Minnesota, we’ll evaluate more, and get him around the team and see where he is at that point,” Saunders said. Until their big man does return, Malik Beasley said the Timberwolves need to weather this slump. “We've got to help each other. We've got to trust each other. That’s the main thing. We've got to have each other's back. I don't think we're doing that right now. We’ve got to come together,” he said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota was also without Josh Okogie, who has missed five games with a strained left hamstring. ... Saunders said the Timberwolves discussed the mob of President Donald Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. “It was disgusting to watch in so many ways and it shows just how far we have to come as a country when it comes to coming together,"" he said.

CAPITOL SEIGE Lillard was asked his reaction to the events that unfolded Wednesday in Washington, D.C. “Guys around the league have spoken about it, talk about how we pretty much live in two different Americas,” Lillard said. “Being a Black man, I know what that situation would have been if people of color decided to take that kind of route. I know it wouldn't look the way it looked.” PRAISE FOR DAME “Whatever we did, we didn’t do it good enough because he really got going tonight,” Saunders said. “There's a reason why Damian Lillard is an MVP-caliber basketball player. If you’re not in tune with all the details on how to cover him, he’ll make it really tough on you.”","401267282"
"Delon Wright dishes to Saddiq Bey who sinks a 3-pointer from the wing for the Pistons vs. the Suns. (0:21) DETROIT -- — Even while losing seven of their first eight games, the Detroit Pistons competed. None of those defeats was by more than 15 points. So perhaps it was no surprise that after falling behind by 23 against an impressive Phoenix team, Detroit gamely fought back. Jerami Grant had 31 points, 10 rebounds and a crucial assist near the end of regulation, and the Pistons beat the Suns 110-105 in overtime Friday night. Coach Dwane Casey was pleased his team's effort resulted in a win. “They’ve got to get some reward,"" Casey said. ""Slowly but surely, I think we’re going to come together — we’re coming together.” Detroit scored the first nine points of the extra session after barely leading at all during regulation. Grant had only two assists on the night, but one of them was to Mason Plumlee for a dunk that tied it at 93 with 9.6 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. “I’m very impressed with his patience and his decision-making,” said teammate Blake Griffin, who had 16 points and 12 rebounds. “Had a big pass to Mason, obviously, to tie the game. So his decision-making is unbelievable.” Devin Booker missed a jumper that could have won it for the Suns at the end of the fourth. Booker scored 23 points for Phoenix, including a 3-pointer with 40.7 seconds left in overtime that brought the Suns within three. Grant answered with a 3-pointer in front of the Detroit bench to double the lead. The Pistons said the win marked their largest comeback victory in at least the last 20 years. Phoenix entered the game with the best record in the Western Conference. Detroit came in with the worst mark in the NBA. It looked like that for much of the first half. Langston Galloway scored 17 points in the half for the Suns against his former team, and Phoenix led 54-31 in the second quarter. Detroit went on a 17-2 run to end the half and eventually tied it at 70 in the third quarter. TIP-INS Suns: F-C Jalen Smith was out due to health and safety protocols. ... After making 21 3-pointers in a win over Toronto on Wednesday, the Suns made 17 on Friday, but they needed 52 attempts. They also shot just 6 of 13 on free throws. Pistons: Detroit was 25 of 29 on free throws, and that was important because the Pistons shot 41% from the field. ... Detroit has won eight in a row against the Suns. ... The Pistons tied a franchise record with their fourth straight game shooting at least 85% on free throws. ADJUSTMENTS Detroit slowed Phoenix by playing plenty of zone defense. “It was good to us,"" Casey said. ""We weren’t stopping them man to man, so we had to give them a different look.” Suns coach Monty Williams said his team didn't make the zone work hard enough. “We got 52 3s up, so we didn’t have a problem getting up shots. We didn’t make shots,” he said. “When we’re flowing offensively, teams are throwing different defenses at us, and we have to respond the right way.” BIG HALF Galloway, who played three seasons with the Pistons from 2017-20, made his first six shots — five from 3-point range. He didn't score after that, however. “It felt good,” he said. “Just kind of upset and disappointed we didn’t pull that one out. That’s one you’ve got to have.”","401267283"
"Jayson Tatum and Bradley Beal chat shortly before Tatum's positive COVID-19 test, causing Beal to miss time due to contact tracing. (0:16) BOSTON -- — Jayson Tatum had 32 points, Jaylen Brown had 27 points and 13 rebounds, and the Boston Celtics held off Bradley Beal and the Washington Wizards 116-107 Friday night for their fourth straight win. Beal had 41 points and eight rebounds a game after tying the franchise record with 60 points against the 76ers. Tatum hit 14 of 27 shots to power the short-handed Celtics, who were without Tristan Thompson, Grant Williams and Robert Williams. The trio is sidelined in COVID-19 health and safety protocol for the next seven days. “Our job’s not to make excuses for who’s not here,” coach Brad Stevens said. “It’s to play as well as we can with who is and let the results take care of themselves.” Rui Hachimura had 17 points and Davis Bertans had 13 as the Wizards dropped to 2-7. The Celtics were cruising early, outscoring the Wizards 33-19 in the second quarter. They increased a 19-point halftime lead to 28 in the first five minutes of the third quarter. The Wizards rallied from there, clawing within 99-95 with 7:36 left in the game. Boston scored seven straight points to build a small cushion. It was 106-101 when Marcus Smart led a fast break and found Brown for a corner 3-pointer with 2:08 remaining. Coach Scott Brooks said he may have played Beal too many minutes down the stretch. “It’s really on me. I tried to get him some extra minutes because we were right there,” Brooks said. ""He’s been playing probably three minutes too many. It doesn’t sound like a lot. But it does add up.” Russell Westbrook was in action just two days after dislocating a finger on his right hand late in Washington’s loss to Philadelphia on Wednesday night. He played with his right ring and pinkie fingers taped together. He finished with 12 points on 4-of-16 shooting from the field. Daniel Theis started at center for Boston and picked up two quick fouls, prompting Stevens to play second-year, 7-foot-5 Tacko Fall for just the second time this season. Fall made the most of the opportunity, coming up with a block at the rim on Westbrook in the first quarter. He also was the recipient of an alley-oop from Brown in the second. “The coaches have been on me to just stay ready,"" Fall said. ""The game has slowed down a lot which has made my game a lot easier. ... I know I belong, it’s just a matter of going out there and doing my job on a consistent basis.” TIP-INS Wizards: Despite playing the 76ers on Wednesday, a day before Philadelphia guard Seth Curry tested positive for the coronavirus, coach Scott Brooks said they haven’t had any positive tests. ... Westbrook was assessed a technical foul from the bench in the third quarter. Celtics: Had a pregame moment of silence for former NBA player and coach Paul Westphal, then continued to take a knee for the national anthem. Westphal was a member of the Celtics’ 1973-74 championship team. ... G Jeff Teague returned after missing two games with a sprained left ankle. ... Led by 21 in the first half. ... Semi Ojeleye scored eight straight points in the opening three minutes of the third quarter. WALKER CLEARED FOR PRACTICE Celtics All-Star point guard Kemba Walker has been cleared to begin practicing. Walker hasn’t played this season after receiving a stem cell injection in his left knee prior to the start of training camp last month. He’s been on a 12-week strengthening program since the early October procedure. Stevens said Walker’s been pain-free during individual workouts and that the next step is for him to go through some live practices with teammates.","401267284"
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander feeds Hamidou Diallo for the throwdown, sealing the Thunder's 101-89 win vs. the Knicks. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, Hamidou Diallo scored a season-high 23 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame an ugly start to beat the New York Knicks 101-89 on Friday night. Al Horford added 15 points and was practically the only offense early for the Thunder, who got almost nothing to fall at the start but got better as the game went along and improved to 4-1 on the road. “We just stick with it, no matter what it is,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. RJ Barrett scored 19 points for the Knicks, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Julius Randle, scoreless in the first half, finished with 18 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. “From top to bottom, we just didn’t get it done,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “We’re capable of doing much better than we did.” Oklahoma City came in scoring an NBA-low 102 points per game, the Knicks were 28th at 104.4, and even those paltry stats seemed way out of reach the way the game started. The Thunder shot 20.8% in the first quarter — Horford had three of their five baskets — and trailed 24-15. But the Knicks managed just 18 in the second quarter and the game was tied at 42 at the half. “I just felt like today on both ends of the floor, for whatever reason, we just didn’t play for each other and it happens,” Randle said. “You go through that, but the biggest thing is that we nip it in the bud right now and take care of it right now and get back to playing unselfish, playing for each other.” Coach Mark Daigneault praised Diallo and the reserves who helped get the Thunder going after the starters were cold at the start. “They really amped it up and then we carried it through the rest of the game,” Daigneault said. Gilgeous-Alexander was 6 of 7 for 12 points in the third quarter, when the Thunder opened a nine-point lead before Austin Rivers beat the buzzer with a 3-pointer that cut it to 69-63. The Thunder broke it open with an 11-3 spurt in the fourth, with Gilgeous-Alexander's 3-pointer making it 89-76. TIP-INS Thunder: Diallo had 11 rebounds. ... Daigneault coached his first NBA game at Madison Square Garden, but has been part of victories in the arena. He was a student manager at UConn from 2003-07 under Jim Calhoun, winning one Big East tournament title. Knicks: The Knicks have lost the last four meetings. ... Elfrid Payton scored 16 points but shot 4 for 16. NEW KNICK Thibodeau said the Knicks hoped Taj Gibson, signed Thursday, would be cleared to begin playing next week. The veteran forward played for Thibodeau in both Chicago and Minnesota and spent last season with the Knicks, which made him a good fit for a short-handed frontcourt. “I think his career speaks for itself and obviously he embodies all the things that we believe in,” Thibodeau said. FAMILIAR FACE Daigneault has on his staff Mike Miller, who finished last season as the Knicks' interim head coach after David Fizdale was fired. He previously coached the Knicks' team in the G League, where the coaches became acquainted. “He did a great job here,” Daigneault said. “He left a great impression here. Everyone here had great things to say about him. He’s an old-school worker but a new-school thinker.”","401267285"
"Zion Williamson elevates to mash down a two-handed dunk over a defender, drawing a foul for a three-point opportunity. (0:18) NEW ORLEANS -- — Gordon Hayward scored 22 of his 26 points in the second half and the Charlotte Hornets methodically came back from an 18-point, second-quarter deficit to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 118-110 on Friday night. “He’s a pro. He’s been here before. He’s not fazed by a bad half, a bad quarter,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""He gives us a calming force, a presence that we may not have had in the past. “Even in that fourth quarter as that game got tight, there was no panic,” Borrego added. ""And a lot of it has to do with Gordon finishing.” Miles Bridges scored 20 points and Devonte Graham had 17 for the Hornets, who didn't take their first lead until the fourth quarter, when they outscored New Orleans 36-23. Zion Williamson scored 26 points and Josh Hart had 19 for the Pelicans, who've lost three straight, all at home. “There is some frustration because I just want to win,"" Williamson said of the recent skid, characterized by untimely defensive lapses. “We’ve got to hold ourselves accountable for those types of losses, whether it’s the turnovers, whether it’s the lack of rotation, communication."" Brandon Ingram added 17 points but was 3-of-10 shooting. JJ Redick also scored 17 for New Orleans, hitting four 3s. The game marked the first time brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball — both top-three draft choices within the past four years — played against one another. LaMelo Ball, picked third overall in 2020, had the better night, nearly notching a triple-double with 12 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. “He was free and easy out there, kind of what we expect now,"" Borrego said. “He’s not fazed by the moment.” Although the Ball brothers were matched up only intermittently, LaMelo Ball hit a 3 with his brother guarding him and also blocked his brother's driving layup. Lonzo Ball, a second overall draft pick by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2017, missed 6 of 7 3-point shots and finished with five points. “It was cool to be out there with him,” LaMelo Ball said. “Whenever we win, I feel it works out great.” TIP-INS Hornets: Terry Rozier finished with 15 points and Bismack Biyombo scored 11. ...

New Orleans won only once during its four-game home stand. MOMENTUM SHIFT The Pelicans led by double digits most of the first half and by 18 points when Redick’s 3 made it 47-29 in the middle of the second quarter. New Orleans was still up 59-47 to open the second half, but Charlotte quickly began tightening things up. Rozier hit a 3 and Hayward added short jumper and another 3, cutting the lead to 62-55. Another 3 by Hayward, two more by Rozier and one by Bridges in a span of less than three minutes got the Hornets within 72-69. The Pelicans gradually rebuilt their lead to eight late in the period, but LaMelo Ball hit his step-back 3 over his brother to make it 87-82 heading into the final quarter. Graham’s driving right-handed floater as he was fouled by Nickeil Alexander-Walker put Charlotte up for the first time at 105-103 with 5:46 to go. Hayward’s 3 with 3:43 left put the Hornets ahead 109-105. “I’ll keep using the word resiliency,” Borrego said. “It speaks volumes about their character more than anything.

Houston was up by 29 at halftime and had extended the lead to 81-43 after consecutive 3-pointers by John Wall and P.J. Tucker with about five minutes left in the third. “Obviously, they were very decimated... so we took advantage,"" Houston coach Stephen Silas said. “But we really played hard and it seems like our concepts are really sinking in more."" The Magic looked nothing like the team that opened the season 6-2. Aaron Gordon sat out with a left hamstring injury in the team’s first game since guard Markelle Fultz sustained a season-ending knee injury in a win over Cleveland on Wednesday night. A disgusted coach Steve Clifford spoke for only about 30 seconds and left without taking any questions. But it was plenty long enough to get his point across. “This game had a lot more to do with a lack of readiness and a lack of professionalism and a lack of effort than it did talent,"" he said. He talked about the numerous mistakes his team made before punctuating his remarks with: “So that's your story, nothing else mattered,"" and leaving the podium. A 3-pointer by James Harden ended his night and left the Rockets ahead by 36 after three, and a 3 by Ben McLemore extended the lead to 103-63 with about nine minutes remaining.

Silas said he wasn't sure what to expect from McLemore, but is excited to see what he'll bring to the team this season after Friday's performance. “It just gives us a stone-cold shooter on the perimeter,"" Silas said. “As you can see from our previous games, we need that on the floor.""","401267287"
"Gorgui Dieng gives the ball to Brandon Clarke, who gets the bucket and the foul. The basket puts Memphis up for good in a win over Brooklyn. (0:20) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Despite losing another key player — this time for coronavirus safety concerns — the Memphis Grizzlies were able to hold on for their first win at home this season. Dillon Brooks scored 24 points and Memphis pulled out a 115-110 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday night after center Jonas Valanciunas left midway through the game due to health and safety protocols. Brandon Clarke added 21 for Memphis. “Great job by our team. … What an unbelievable game,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. The Memphis victory came despite 43 points from Caris LeVert, including 25 in the second half as Brooklyn overcame a 22-point, first-half deficit. “We could have easily folded,” said reserve guard Joe Harris, who finished with 13 points. “The first half was not great by any means.” There were key starters missing for both teams. The Nets were without Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, while Memphis continued missing reigning Rookie of the Year Ja Morant and forward Jaren Jackson Jr. “For us to be a great team, a team that we know we can be, everyone has to be playing at full strength,” LeVert said. “Everyone has to be confident. Everybody has to be ready.” The teams were tied at 104 with 4:15 left. Memphis scored the next seven points, capped by a 3-pointer from De’Anthony Melton, who had 14 points on the night. LeVert’s 3-pointer with 11.4 seconds left pulled Brooklyn within 113-110, but the Nets could get no closer. Memphis lost momentum when Valanciunas did not come out for the second half due to the health and safety protocols. What had been Memphis domination on the boards quickly changed, and the Nets began shooting better than they had in the first half. “As soon as we got notification and in conversations with the league, we had to pull him from the game with an abundance of caution,” Jenkins said, adding that Valanciunas is not positive for COVID-19. In the third quarter, LeVert would connect on 6 of 8 from the field, including all five of his 3-pointers to pull the Nets back into the game. “That third quarter they got going,” Jenkins said. “They had a huge spark. A lot of momentum. Our guys just rallied and stayed the course despite a big run by the Nets.” TIP-Ins LeVert passed Richard Jefferson for 13th on the Nets’ career 3-pointers made list. … LeVert was 15 of 23 from the field, 7 of 9 from 3-point range.

He later said as far as future availability that no decision has been made regarding Sunday’s game against Oklahoma City. As for Durant, who is under the health and safety protocols, Nash said: “Kevin, I believe, is still on track for Sunday, so we just hope the tests continue to be negative and everything stays as is.”","401267288"
"Royce O'Neale hits a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer from 27 feet out to give the Jazz an 85-77 lead over the Bucks. (0:21) MILWAUKEE -- — Utah’s record 3-point shooting ended the Milwaukee Bucks’ home-court dominance. Donovan Mitchell scored 32 points and the Jazz shot 25 of 53 from 3-point range to win 131-118 on Friday night and hand the Bucks their first home loss. Utah’s 25 3-pointers set a franchise record. The Jazz also became the first team in NBA history to have five players make at least four 3-pointers in the same game. “I think more than the total number, the balance is something that I think is significant for us,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “That’s a strength of our team. We’ve got a lot of guys who can make those shots. It’s been something we’ve been banging that drum (about) from the first day. We want guys to take 3s.” Utah players who made at least four 3-pointers included Royce O’Neale (6 of 8), Mike Conley (5 of 10), Jordan Clarkson (5 of 12), Mitchell (4 of 9) and Bojan Bogdanovic (4 of 10). Clarkson scored 26 points, Bogdanovic 20, O’Neale 18 and Conley 17. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 35 points and eight rebounds for the Bucks, while Khris Middleton had 31 points and 10 rebounds. Jrue Holiday scored 17 points, Brook Lopez had 12 and Donte DiVincenzo added 11. The Bucks (5-4) had won their first four home games by an average of 23.5 points but trailed nearly the whole way this time. The Jazz ended a two-game skid after double-digit losses at Brooklyn and New York. “Certainly they played well,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “They executed their offense well. They shared it well. They made shots well. And on top of that, when they did miss, it felt like they were on the offensive boards all night.” Utah broke open a close game by scoring the first 12 points of the fourth quarter to grab a 116-96 edge. The Bucks didn’t score their first points of the final period until Antetokounmpo dunked with 6:47 left. “That’s the team we have to be,” Mitchell said. “The last two games, last few games, don’t really represent who we are. We have to stay at that level. We can’t bring it against Milwaukee and not bring it against New York.” TIP-INS Jazz: Clarkson’s big night continued his productive season off the bench as he improved his scoring average to 16.7. Heading into Friday’s action, Orlando’s Terrence Ross was the only NBA reserve with a higher scoring average. Bucks: Milwaukee didn’t get nearly enough from its bench. All five of the Bucks’ starters had at least 11 points, but Utah had a 35-12 edge in bench scoring. Milwaukee’s reserves shot a combined 4 of 18 overall and 0 of 8 from beyond the arc. SCARY MOMENT Antetokounmpo took a bad fall with 9:30 left in the third quarter, as he leaped in front of the basket to defend Utah’s Rudy Gobert and landed hard on his front side. The two-time reigning MVP rolled around and grabbed his left side. He went into the tunnel but immediately returned to the game. INGLES’ STREAK SNAPPED Utah’s Joe Ingles didn’t play due to a sore right Achilles tendon, snapping what had been the NBA’s longest active streak of consecutive games played. Ingles had appeared in 384 straight games. This marked the first game Ingles has missed since Dec. 16, 2015. “It makes you pause for a second and you reflect on what a streak of consecutive games like that means and what it says about Joe — his toughness, his commitment, the type of teammate he is,” Snyder said before the game. “You pause and reflect for a second and you understand why you respect him like you do.”","401267289"

Paul George had 25 points for the Clippers (6-4) and Kawhi Leonard added 24, but Golden State turned up the defense after the Clippers scored 65 in the first half. Curry got payback after being held to just 13 points in Wednesday’s loss. His nine 3-pointers Friday were the most by a Warriors player this season, and he added 11 assists. “It’s just who Steph is,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “He’s been doing this for many, many years and it’s one of the reasons he’s a two- time MVP. Usually with Steph, when he has a tough game he bounces back with the next one.” Andrew Wiggins scored 16 for the Warriors but Curry was predominantly a one-man show through the first three quarters. He got help in the fourth as Eric Paschall, Brad Wanamaker and Kent Bazemore all hit big shots. The Clippers shot 58.7% from the floor in the first half and led 65-51. George had 17 points on 6-of-7 shooting, including 4 for 4 from beyond the arc. “I think it’s good something like this happened to us early in the season,"" George said.

James and Harrell led the way as Los Angeles held off the Bulls down the stretch without injured starters Anthony Davis and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. The Lakers lead the Western Conference at 7-3 despite the challenges of injuries and several roster changes. “Through the first 10 games, I think we’ve played B, B-plus basketball, and that is absolutely OK,” James said. “We’re a team that added basically five pieces to the rotation, and we’re still learning each other. We’re getting accustomed to different lineups, playing different guys, and we’re playing pretty good basketball. We want to be better. That lets me know we have room to improve, which is a bright spot.” LaVine scored 19 points in the first quarter for the Bulls, who have lost seven straight to the Lakers. Dennis Schröder scored 17 points and hit a 3-pointer with 2:39 to play to put the Lakers up 113-107, but Chicago trimmed the lead to 116-115 on Garrett Temple's 3-pointer with 37 seconds left. James missed an extra-long 3-pointer to put the game in Chicago's hands, but LaVine missed his contested jumper, and his teammates fumbled the ball out of bounds. “From my view, he got off a pretty good look,” Chicago coach Billy Donovan said. “That’s what we wanted. ... I think we’ve gotten better competing. Now I think we’ve got to start to address getting better and not beating ourselves.

"Fred VanVleet scores 34 points to lead the Raptors to a comeback victory vs. the Kings. (1:58) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Pascal Siakam had 17 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds, Toronto made 20 3-pointers and the Raptors set a franchise record for scoring while winning for the second time this season, 144-123 over the Sacramento Kings on Friday night. Fred VanVleet scored 34 points to help the Raptors (2-6) snap a three-game losing streak. Toronto’s only other win came on Dec. 31 against the New York Knicks. Nick Nurse’s team won its seventh straight against the Kings despite being without point guard Kyle Lowry (personal reasons). That, and the poise the Raptors showed after falling behind by 19 points in the first half, had Nurse beaming afterward. “When there’s a whole bunch of guys hitting the floor with that level of fight, it kind of snowballs a little bit. It’s contagious,” Nurse said. “There wasn’t a whole lot to hang our heads about other than the start, and we didn’t then.” Chris Boucher added 23 points and 10 rebounds for Toronto. Norman Powell scored 22 points and Terence Davis had 18. “We did a great job of playing with energy throughout the game, even at the start,” said Powell, who made four 3s. “We clawed our way back into the game and the guys showed a lot of heart, toughness and togetherness to give us a chance going into that second half.” De’Aaron Fox scored 23 points and rookie Tyrese Haliburton had 15 points and eight assists for Sacramento. Toronto outscored Sacramento 33-20 in the fourth quarter. “They manhandled us, especially in that second half,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “We built up a nice, big lead, and you see it all the time in the NBA ... they got hot. It didn’t matter who they put in the game, they weren’t missing. We relaxed, and as soon as we relaxed they found a nice smooth rhythm.” The Raptors’ previous record for scoring in the regular season was 140 points, last done against the New Orleans Pelicans on Oct. 22, 2019. Toronto scored 150 points against the Brooklyn Nets on Aug. 23 in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto had six players in double figures. … The Raptors dominated on the boards 44-26. Kings: Sacramento shot 81% (17 of 21) with six 3s and scored a season-high 43 points in the first quarter. … The Kings had a season-high 36 assists. … Haliburton had a 3-pointer taken away upon review in the first quarter when it was ruled he stepped out of bounds before shooting. … Richaun Holmes picked up his fourth foul with 3:46 left in the second. BEATS STANDING IN LINE Fans have not been allowed inside Golden1 Center all season but that hasn’t stopped some from getting as close a look as possible. Two elderly women in wheelchairs peered through the glass doors encircling the arena and were able to see the game being shown on the giant scoreboard above the court, a ritual they have taken on for every home game this season. They were joined Friday night by a small group of people wearing Kings jerseys who were socially distanced nearby.","401267292"
"Doc Rivers says the team has eight active players and only seven will play, as he won't use Mike Scott. He also claims Dwight Howard will be playing point guard. (0:42) PHILADELPHIA -- — The Philadelphia 76ers opened the week with the best record in the NBA — and now face an uncertain future with a starting lineup fit for the preseason. Nikola Jokic had 15 points and 12 assists to lead the Denver Nuggets past Philadelphia 115-103 on Saturday, beating a 76ers team that had only seven available players. “COVID created this but the concern is not COVID now,” Sixers coach Doc Rivers said. “The concern is injuries.” The Sixers tipped without four regular starters — All-Stars Ben Simmons (sore left knee) and Joel Embiid (back) sat due to injury, and Seth Curry and Tobias Harris over virus concerns. Curry tested positive for the virus Thursday, and the ensuing contact tracing and COVID-19 health and safety protocols led to a slew of unavailable players. The team met the minimum eight active players by including injured forward Mike Scott, who was not actually able to play. Rivers said he didn’t think the game should be played. “We’ve got be very careful in how we navigate the next week,” Rivers said. Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia's 2020 first-round pick out of Kentucky, scored 39 points in 44 minutes on 18-of-33 shooting in his first career start. Isaiah Joe had 13 points. “I had to hunt my shot just a little more because it was needed,” Maxey said. Gary Harris scored 21 points for the Nuggets, who played without Michael Porter Jr. (19.5 points per game) because of health and safety protocols. Danny Green was the only regular in Philly’s starting lineup, joined by backups Dakota Mathias, Dwight Howard, Joe and Maxey. Mathias and Joe also made their first career NBA starts. Mathias, Maxey and Joe all played at least 41 minutes. “It was a good thing for the team even though I still hate losing,” Rivers said. The Sixers play Monday in Atlanta, the first of five games in seven days, and the roster may not change much. Curry will miss five more games at least. Harris and reserves Shake Milton, Matisse Thybulle and Vincent Poirier could miss at least a week because of the protocols. “We don’t know anything,” Rivers said. “I don’t know enough about any of this.” The team was forced to spend Friday in New York after playing at Brooklyn on Thursday and underwent additional testing before arriving back in Philadelphia at 1 a.m. — 14 hours before the afternoon tipoff. “The last 36 hours have been nuts,” Rivers said. Sparked by Maxey, the undermanned, feisty Sixers stuck with Denver throughout the first half. Maxey scored on a fastbreak dunk and Joe hit consecutive 3s to tie the game at 26. A 13.5-point favorite, the Nuggets led only 28-26 at the half before foul trouble caught up with Philadelphia. The Nuggets were off to a slow start at 3-5 but got a chance to regroup against the Sixers and took control in the third. Harris hit two 3s, the Nuggets shot 68% (13 of 19) and outscored the Sixers 35-21. “It seems like every time we get off to a good start and build a lead, we get kind of lax in our approach and allow teams to get back in the game rather quickly,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. TIP-INS 76ers: Maxey’s 22 points were the most in the first half for a Sixer this season. ... Howard moved into 13th on the NBA’s career rebounds list. Nuggets: Jamal Murray and Will Barton each scored 14 points. ALL-STAR ABSENCE Simmons and Embiid sat out with previously undisclosed injuries. “Joel started complaining about his back, that started yesterday,” Rivers said. “And we didn’t know if he was playing or not but honestly, with the minutes we would have to ask, it would be insane to play him tonight.”","401267293"
"Hawks guard Bogdan Bogdanovic suffers a fractured right knee after tripping in a game against the Hornets on Saturday. (0:43) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — LaMelo Ball isn't wasting any time making an impact in the NBA. The rookie point guard became the youngest player in league history to record a triple-double, with 22 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists on Saturday night, helping the Charlotte Hornets beat the Atlanta Hawks 113-105 for their third straight win. “A 19-year-old rookie does not look like this,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""This is rare what you’re seeing.” Ball's history-making performance came just two nights after he missed out on his first triple-double when he finished with 12 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists in a win over his brother Lonzo's New Orleans Pelicans. He said he hasn't begun to process the accomplishment. “I live my life and I know what I’m capable of, so stuff like doesn’t move me like that,"" Ball said. “I know that's supposed to happen.” Ball replaced Markelle Fultz as the youngest NBA player to record a triple-double by 177 days. “He's a tall PG who can pass, can rebound and he's a smart player,” said Atlanta's Trae Young. “Things are going to become even easier for him in this league as he plays more and more games.” Terry Rozier had 23 points to lead the Hornets. Cam Reddish scored 21 points and De’Andre Hunter had 20 for the Hawks. Young struggled all night, shooting 5 of 19 from the floor to finish with 15 points and 10 assists. Ball tied his highest scoring night on 9-of-13 shooting from the field as the Hornets handed the struggling Hawks their fourth consecutive loss. He became only the fifth rookie in NBA history to record a triple-double and the first Hornets player to do it coming off the bench. Borrego said he loves Ball's spirit and his energy, but what has impressed him the most is his poise and confidence. “He's not rattled by the moment. It's like he's been doing this for a number of years,"" Borrego said of Ball, who played overseas before becoming the third pick in the NBA draft. Ball had several sharp passes, including a perfect behind-the-back strike to set up a 3-pointer by P.J. Washington. “It's tough because you don't know when it's coming. He might throw it behind his head, behind his back or straight to you,” joked Washington, who also had 22 points and was on the receiving end of several of Ball's passes. “You have to be active and aware when he has the ball. It's always fun playing with a guy like that.” TIP-INS Hawks: Bogdan Bogdanovic got the start over Reddish but left in the second quarter with a knee injury and did not return. There was no immediate update on his injury. Hornets: Charlotte came in leading the league in assists and had 27 against the Hawks. ... Gordon Hayward finished with 13 points after averaging 35 points over the past two games. YOUNG'S INJURY Young had his wrist iced after the game, saying he fell on it while trying to take a charge. He had X-rays after the game but said it is “nothing severe,” although he added “it's definitely hurting.” Young doesn't seem too concerned about failing to make a 3-pointer in his last two games. “You never get too high or too low,” Young said. “Whenever shots aren't going I understand the work that I put in and I know it's going to pay off.” WASHINGTON BLOCKING SHOTS The 6-foot-7 Washington has been asking the play the 5 position for the Hornets when they go to a small-ball lineup and he has responded well. He had six blocks against the Hawks as the Hornets got back to .500 on the season. ""I love blocking shots because it gets us out in transition,"" Washington said.","401267294"
"Mikal Bridges takes on the scoring load as he puts up a career-high 34 points to lead the Suns to a 125-117 win over the Pacers. (1:31) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Mikal Bridges found his shooting touch quickly, then finished with a flourish. The third-year forward scored a career-high 34 points and made the 3-pointer to cap the decisive scoring spurt midway through the fourth quarter, helping the Phoenix Suns pull away from Indiana for a 125-117 victory Saturday. “Whenever you hit the first couple of shots everything feels good, so you start feeling more aggressive,” Bridges said. “It felt amazing. I know when I get comfortable, I keep telling myself to keep being aggressive. Don't relax and just keep going."" Bridges was 12 of 18 from the field, 6 of 8 on 3s and 4 of 4 from the free throw line. Devin Booker added 25 points as the Suns pulled into a tie with the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers for the best record in the West at 7-3 while earning their first win in Indy since 2016. Phoenix knocked down 16 more 3-pointers after making 38 in its previous two games. The Suns also became the ninth team in league history to open the season with 10 straight games of 10 or more 3s. It was simply too much for the Pacers, despite All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis finishing with 28 points, a career high-tying 22 rebounds and the first 20-20 game of his career. “He was good, really good,"" two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo said. “He did a really good job following up misses and playing his iso plays, getting rebounds. It was big. Unfortunately, we came up short."" Phoenix used a late first-half run to take a 56-53 halftime lead, then opened the second half by scoring the first five points. While Sabonis almost single-handedly kept the Pacers close with 16 points in the final six minutes of the third quarter, Indiana never took the lead. Instead, Bridges heated up again late, knocking down a 3 to cap an 11-0 run that gave Phoenix a 109-96 lead with 5:49 to go. TIP-INS Suns: Teammates doused Bridges with an ice cold celebration following the game. ... Phoenix had only three turnovers just one night after having 20. ... The Suns are 3-0 on the second game of a back-to-back this season. ... Perennial All-Star Chris Paul had 15 points and 10 assists. ... DeAndre Ayton didn't score until 8:43 left in the third quarter and finished with eight points and 14 rebounds. ... Phoenix has its best 10-game record since starting 8-2 in 2009-10. Pacers: Malcolm Brogdon had 22 points, nine assists and six rebounds. ... Oladipo scored 16 points while Myles Turner had 15 points and 10 rebounds and four more blocks. ... Justin Holiday continued his strong play as of late with 17 points, including 14 in 14 first-half minutes. ... Sabonis has a double-double in all nine games this season. ... Indiana is 4-3 at home this season. ... The eight-point difference was Indiana's most lopsided loss this season. ON THE BUBBLE The recent spike in positive COVID-19 tests around the NBA has prompted some to speculate whether the league might have to rethink playing inside a “bubble.” Oladipo made it clear he's no fan of going back in the bubble, especially with up to 1,000 fans to soon be allowed inside Bankers Life Fieldhouse. “I hope not,"" he said of the bubble talk. “But I think the NBA is doing all they can and the NBPA as well, working together to make sure we’re as safe as possible. But it’s tough. You can try your best and unfortunately some people may still catch it. We’ve got to do the best job to limit the virus as much as possible. Hopefully it doesn’t end up being another bubble, but at the end of the day we’ve got to do what’s safest for us.""","401267295"
"Jimmy Butler and Precious Achiuwa run a pick-and-roll for an alley-oop dunk vs. the Wizards. (0:24) WASHINGTON -- — The Miami Heat allowed 71 points in the first half to the short-handed Washington Wizards, and that was too much for coach Erik Spoelstra. With Washington playing without its three leading scorers, the Heat picked up its intensity, held the Wizards to 15 points in the third quarter and won 128-124 on Saturday night. Tyler Herro scored a career-high 31 points and Jimmy Butler nearly had a triple-double with 26 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. “Everybody could see it,”’ Spoelstra said. “We were not defending with enough energy and connection. It was pretty obvious. It was just going back and forth. It almost felt like a pickup game in the first half. In the third quarter, it was much more committed defensively.” Miami (4-4) has alternated wins and losses through its first eight games. “This team has a very deep roster,” Herro said. “Any given night, anyone can score. I’m not really worried about the numbers.” The Wizards (2-8) lost their third straight game and are winless in five home games. Washington played without the NBA’s leading scorer, Bradley Beal, who was a late scratch when he was placed in the NBA’s Health and Safety Protocol. “Found out maybe about an hour before the game,” coach Scott Brooks said. “On the one hand, it surprised me. On the other hand, this is what we kind of have to expect to happen. You hate for it to happen. You hope for the best, but don’t know the next step.” They were also without their other starting guard, Russell Westbrook, out with a left quad injury. Westbrook, who had triple-doubles in his first four games with the Wizards, was intending to play the second half of a back-to-back for the first time after sitting out the first two. Washington’s starting center, Thomas Bryant, suffered a left knee injury less than two minutes into the game, and didn’t return. Brooks said Bryant would have an MRI on Sunday. Garrison Mathews led the Wizards with 22 points. Deni Avdija scored 20. The Heat, which led nearly all the way, outscored the Wizards 28-15 in the third quarter to take a 103-86 lead. TIP-INS Heat: G Goran Dragic had 21 points on seven 3-pointers. … C Bam Adebayo had 16 rebounds despite playing only 21 minutes due to foul trouble. … C Meyers Leonard suffered a shoulder strain. Wizards: Brooks was assessed a technical in the fourth quarter. … The Capital City Go-Go, Washington’s G League affiliate, will flex assign players to the Erie Bayhawks, New Orleans’ G League affiliate, during the season that begins next month in Orlando, Florida. EXPANDABLE ROSTERS The NBA is allowing teams to have 15 active players for each game this season, up from 13 in previous seasons. Brooks said that enables him to give opportunities to players such as Mathews and C Moritz Wagner. “We have open spots and open minutes available, and we’re just trying to search it out and figure it out,” Brooks said. PATCHWORK LINEUP While the Heat’s lineup was familiar to fans who watched Miami’s surprising run to the NBA Finals in October, Washington's lineup wasn't as recognizable with Beal, Westbrook and Bryant out. Jerome Robinson, who started in place of Beal, had scored 15 points in five games. He had 12 points Saturday night. Beal leads the NBA with an average of 35 points.","401267296"
"Khris Middleton scores 27 points with 6 assists and 5 rebounds in the Bucks' 100-90 win over the Cavaliers. (1:40) MILWAUKEE -- — Khris Middleton scored 27 points and the Milwaukee Bucks withstood the absence of two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 100-90 on Saturday night. Antetokounmpo sat out with back spasms after taking a hard fall one night earlier in a loss to the Utah Jazz.  Middleton, an All-Star each of the last two seasons, continued his habit of putting up big numbers whenever Antetokounmpo is sidelined. “The ball's probably in his hands a little bit more on a night like tonight,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “When a teammate is down, he's a guy that wants to be there to help not just pick up that guy but the whole group. It's certainly been a trend for him. It's just a testament to how good he is.” Bobby Portis replaced Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee’s starting lineup and scored 17 points as the Bucks (6-4) closed a five-game home stretch in which they went 4-1. After Jrue Holiday made the game’s first basket, Portis scored the Bucks’ next 10 points. The Bucks overcame a huge performance from Cleveland’s Andre Drummond, who had 26 points and 24 rebounds. Drummond was the first Cavalier to have at least 20 points and 20 rebounds in the same game since Anderson Varejao did it against Boston on Jan. 31, 2012. “When he's the initiator of the force, there's nobody in the league who can guard him,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “I think we saw that tonight and against Memphis (a 94-90 win on Thursday). When he decides to put his chin down and play with that force, he's unguardable.” Cleveland (5-5) needed a big night from Drummond because it was missing so many weapons as it completed a six-game road swing. Collin Sexton, who averages a team-high 25.1 points, missed a second straight game with a sprained left ankle. Other sidelined Cavaliers included Kevin Love (strained right calf), Matthew Dellavedova (concussion), Dante Exum (strained right calf), Darius Garland (sprained right shoulder), Kevin Porter Jr. (personal reasons) and Dylan Windler (fractured left hand). Damyean Dotson scored 21 and Larry Nance Jr. added 17 for Cleveland. Holiday had 15, D.J. Wilson scored 12 and Donte DiVincenzo added 11 for Milwaukee. “I can’t say enough about what these guys are doing,” Bickerstaff said. “They’re many men down, and they haven’t used it as an excuse. They just continue to go out and scrap, continue to go out and fight. We came up short tonight, but I’m proud of their effort and the way they fought.” Cleveland rallied from a 19-point deficit to tie the game late in the second quarter, but Milwaukee closed the first half with a 10-0 run and led the rest of the way despite posting its lowest point total of the season. “Great teams, they don’t just win a game one way,” Middleton said. “They can win it in many different styles. The key thing is to win those games, no matter what.” TIP-INS Cavaliers: Bickerstaff said before the game that Cleveland’s short-handed roster means the Cavs must “make the game as ugly as we possibly can” by winning with defense. The Cavs became the first team to hold Milwaukee below 108 points this season, but they didn't have nearly enough offense to win the game. Bucks: Wilson had fallen out of the Bucks’ rotation and hadn’t played in their last three games, but he got an opportunity Saturday and capitalized. He shot 5 of 9 from the floor in his 16-minute stint. ... Pat Connaughton returned to action after missing three games with a groin injury. He scored six points in 11 minutes.","401267297"

"Luka Doncic flips in a a shot through contact facing away from the basket. (0:26) DALLAS -- — Tim Hardaway Jr. scored a season-high 36 points, Trey Burke did the same with 29 and Luka Doncic had another triple-double as the short-handed Dallas Mavericks beat the Orlando Magic 112-98 on Saturday night. Hardaway and Burke took on expanded roles to help Dallas get over .500 for the first time this season with starters Josh Richardson and Dorian Finney-Smith and backup point guard Jalen Brunson sidelined by COVID-19 protocols. The three Mavericks didn't return with the team from Denver following a 124-117 overtime win Thursday, and coach Rick Carlisle wouldn't discuss how long they would be out. One of the three, who hasn't been identified, tested positive for the virus. Hardaway and Burke made it a rather quiet second triple-double of the season for Doncic, combining to go 15 of 21 from 3-point range while the star point guard had 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. “We got here at 5 o’clock off the whole thing with the Denver trip,” Carlisle said of the team skipping a morning shootaround because of the COVID-19 issues. “I was really impressed with our level of focus and concentration. And it all started with Luka. He understood exactly what the situation was.” Burke, who missed the Denver trip because of an illness that Carlisle said wasn't coronavirus-related, was 7 of 8 from long range to help the Mavericks finish 20 of 40 against an Orlando team tied for the fewest 3s allowed per game coming in. “He’s a dangerous scorer,” Carlisle said. “One reason I think he plays well for us is that he knows that we have great confidence in him. He’s a guy that can just get white hot out there.” Nikola Vucevic had 30 points and 15 rebounds, and Aaron Gordon scored 16 points a night after missing a 42-point loss in Houston with a sore left hamstring as the Magic lost their ninth straight game in Dallas and fell to 2-4 since a 4-0 start. It was Orlando's second game without guard Markelle Fultz, out for the season with a knee injury, and Gordon said it was the first time he has played point guard since high school. “The team needs me to step up and carry some of the load of initiating the offense,” Gordon said. “I've got to take it on my shoulders to get us more organized. There were some times that it was just chaotic.” TIP-INS Magic: F Evan Fournier missed his fifth straight game with back spasms. Coach Steve Clifford said he might return Monday against Milwaukee. ... Vucevic missed his first five 3s and finished 2 of 7 while Gordon was 1 of 7. Orlando was 6 of 31 from beyond the arc.

Then he scored 16 in a roughly seven-minute span to begin the third as Portland rattled off a 22-8 run that ended any hopes of a Sacramento comeback. “He's just playing. He's finding his rhythm,” Portland forward Carmelo Anthony said. ""He’s in his groove right now, and he’s leading us at this moment. We all know he can score the basketball. but it’s how he’s doing it. ... His feel for the game is getting better each year.” Damian Lillard scored 17 points for Portland and Anthony added 13. Marvin Bagley III had 15 points for the Kings, who shot just 40.7 % (33 for 81) from the floor. They went 8 for 30 from beyond the arc and committed 15 turnovers that Portland converted into 30 points. But defense is the biggest issue for the Kings right now. “We just have to understand at this level, against a team like Portland and whoever we're playing, we have to bring it every single night, and that’s what we’re looking for,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""It was a tough one for us tonight.” The Blazers made eight of their first 13 shots on the way to a 38-point first quarter.

They had the ball down five late in the fourth, but Rudy Gobert blocked a shot by Mason Plumlee, and Mike Conley made two free throws to make it 93-86 with 1:00 remaining. “The offense was really good in the first half,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""For us to be able to get stops when we weren’t clicking on offense — we won a different way this game.” Conley finished with 22 points. Utah improved to 3-2 on its seven-game road trip. The Jazz beat Milwaukee on Friday, making a franchise-record 25 3-pointers in the process. Their shooting took a turn for the worse in Detroit, where they went just 11 of 35 from beyond the arc, but the Pistons were even worse at 10 of 42. Detroit trailed by 15 after the first quarter, and it ultimately didn't matter that the Pistons outscored the Jazz the rest of the way. “It goes back to our starts,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""You spot a team that much — 34 to 19 in the first quarter — it’s tough to survive that way.” The Jazz shot 61% from the field in that first quarter. “It sets the tone, whether it’s offensive or defensively, when we have a start of the game like we had today,"" Gobert said.

"Kawhi Leonard pours in 35 points, including 21 in the third quarter, to fuel the Clippers' 130-127 win over the Bulls. (2:00) LOS ANGELES -- — Freed from the pesky mask he'd been wearing on court for two weeks, Kawhi Leonard cut loose. Getting a steal and a dunk, hitting 3-pointer after 3-pointer. He finished with a season-high 35 points, going over 10,000 in his career, and the Los Angeles Clippers rallied to beat the Chicago Bulls 130-127 on Sunday. “It's a steppingstone, but I don't really care about it,” Leonard said of his milestone. “Maybe when I retire I’ll sit back and look at the accomplishments. Right now it’s about being greedy and wanting more.” Leonard reached the 10,000 plateau on one of his five 3-pointers in the third quarter, when he scored 21 points. His points and 3-pointers made were the most in a single quarter in his career. “He understood how they were guarding him and he took advantage of it,” teammate Paul George said. “He was hot, so we definitely kept finding him.” Leonard's last 3-pointer in the quarter gave the Clippers their first lead since they scored the game's first basket. In all, he had seven 3-pointers, tying his career high. “We needed every bit of it,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said.

He got a steal and dunk for his first points of the third, then made five straight 3-pointers before closing out his explosive quarter with a pair of baskets, the last of which tied the game at 87. For the first time in two weeks, Leonard no longer needs the on-court mask he wore strapped around his head to protect eight stitches in his mouth. He got hit by teammate Serge Ibaka's elbow at Denver on Christmas. George had 28 points, seven rebounds and nine assists for the Clippers, who avoided their first three-game losing streak of the season. Lou Williams added 21 points off the bench. Zach LaVine led six Bulls in double figures with a season-high 45 points — four off his career high — and he made a season-best 10 3-pointers. Garrett Temple added 18 points and Patrick Williams had 17 points. Coby White had a career-high 13 assists. Chicago dropped its third in a row for the first time since starting the season 0-3. “We were frustrated we kept letting him (LaVine) get looks that he liked,” George said, “but at our end we were happy and excited that Kawhi had it going.” The Bulls shot 61% from the floor and 55% from 3-point range. The Clippers chased the Bulls through the first three quarters, falling behind by 13. Lou Williams' basket tied the game at 94 heading into the fourth. Los Angeles led by six in the fourth before Temple's three-point play put the Bulls ahead 119-118. Nicolas Batum hit a 3-pointer in front of the Clippers' bench with Thaddeus Young in his face, got fouled and made the free throw, launching an 8-0 run that gave Los Angeles a 126-119 lead. LaVine had a three-point play and a 3-pointer over Marcus Morris Sr. to pull the Bulls to 126-125. White got called for his fourth foul, putting George at the line. He made both for a 128-125 lead. LaVine airballed a 3-pointer from the top of the key with six seconds to go. “I got ten 3s. I’m going to come down and try to make a play,” he said. “I got a clean look. I just didn’t get legs on it.” LaVine got called for his fourth foul and George made both free throws for a 130-125 lead. Temple's late basket closed the scoring for Chicago.

"Caris LeVert gets creative as he bounces the ball between Al Horford's legs to Jarrett Allen for a dunk. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 129-116 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. Gilgeous-Alexander was one of six players to finish in double-figure scoring for the Thunder, who won their third straight and beat Brooklyn for the fifth consecutive time. “It’s been a great road trip,” said Hamidou Diallo, who finished with 25 points, Al Horford had 22, George Hill added 14, and Lugentz Dort and Isaiah Roby had 13 each. Whereas the Thunder left Barclays Center feeling good about themselves, Brooklyn's first-year coach Steve Nash had the opposite feeling about his team's play. “I didn't sense the pride. I didn't sense the competitive fire in the second half,” Nash said of the Nets. Kevin Durant scored 36 points to lead Brooklyn. The loss was the second straight for the Nets. Caris LeVert added 21 points, Jarrett Allen had 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot scored 12. “We (have) to toughen up and show a little more pride,” Nash said. Making the loss harder to digest was the Nets had gotten Durant back after he had sat out Brooklyn’s previous three games — a stretch in which they won two of three — due to the league’s quarantine policy after being exposed to COVID-19. “COVID put us under these circumstances and a lot of guys around the league are under protocol, so it was something we knew coming into the season may happen,” Durant said. “I'm glad I'm back playing, (though).” Midway through the third quarter, Durant drove past Darius Bazley and flipped in a layup as he drew a foul. As Durant strolled to the free-throw line, a frustrated Bazely disgustedly fired the ball off the stanchion. The three-point play gave Brooklyn a 74-69 lead. It didn’t last, as Oklahoma City went on a 25-7 run to finish the quarter with a 94-81 advantage. The Thunder kept the pressure on in the fourth, as they opened the quarter with a Diallo dunk and a 17-foot jumper sandwiched around a 3-pointer from Theo Maledon. “We have a team that’s really well-intentioned,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “We want to run through the finish line.” TIP-INS: Nets: Despite the return of Durant, Brooklyn was not at full strength as Kyrie Irving missed his third straight game due to an undisclosed issue which is believed to be the guard’s distress over the insurrection at the Capitol on Wednesday. During his pregame availability, Nash said Irving and the team have been in communication but declined to offer specifics, saying the talks are “a private matter.” Irving had started Brooklyn’s first seven games, averaging 27.1 , 6.1 assists, and 5.3 rebounds. “I don’t worry about (Irving) falling out of rhythm,” Nash said. “He’s a brilliant basketball player.” Thunder: Oklahoma City was coming off of a 101-89 rout of the New York Knicks on Friday night at Madison Square Garden. Entering Sunday night’s game, opponents were outscoring the Thunder by an average of 6.1 points per game, while Brooklyn ranked third in the league in scoring with an average of 118.8 points per game. “Tactically,” rookie forward Aleksej Pokusevski said during his pregame availability, “we have to be there.” They were as the Thunder limited Brooklyn to seven second chance points and nine fast break points.","401267303"
"Gary Harris gets a hand in the way of the pass and corrals the loose ball before taking it coast-to-coast for an easy slam. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — Nikola Jokic had 22 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in another short night, and the Denver Nuggets reached .500 for the first time this season with a 114-89 victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday. The Nuggets opened 1-4 after reaching the Western Conference finals last season but have now answered with four wins in five games. The last two were easy. The Nuggets pulled away from the seven-man 76ers in the third quarter and rested their starters in the fourth of a 115-103 victory Saturday. They jumped on the Knicks much earlier Sunday and it was never a game after halftime. This was the first time the Nuggets allowed fewer than 100 points this season. “I think our defense in the last five has been a lot better than it was to begin the season in the first five games,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “A marked improvement.” Gary Harris added 14 points for the Nuggets, who got only nine from star guard Jamal Murray. “I think Jokic puts a lot of pressure on you, so you can’t let your guard down for a second,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “And I thought we got in a hole early and when you give a team like that that type of confidence, it’s very difficult to come back on them.” Julius Randle had 29 points, 10 rebounds and five assists for the Knicks, which the team said made him the only player other than Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson to have at least 200 points, 115 rebounds and 70 assists in his team’s first 10 games of a season. But Randle had little help with nobody else over 12 points as the Knicks dropped their second straight following a three-game winning streak. They were held to an anemic 89 points in both games. Denver led 28-21 after one, then made its first six shots of the second with its reserves on the floor to open a 40-22 lead on JaMychal Green's layup. The lead ballooned to 22 late in the first half before the Nuggets took a 59-38 advantage to the break. “We huddle up before the tipoff and just say let’s be better than the other team’s bench,” reserve Monte Morris said. “Let’s go out there and try to bring the energy and if the starters start slow let’s pick them up ,and if they start fast let’s sustain whatever they got going on.” Jokic had eight points while playing the whole third quarter and the Nuggets led by as much as 30 in the fourth. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver has won 19 of the last 24 meetings. ... Morris and PJ Dozier both scored 12 points off the bench. Knicks: Thibodeau said rookie Obi Toppin, limited to one game thus far because of a strained right calf, is making steady progress but still not cleared for anything except individual work. Frank Ntilikina (sprained right knee) is probably out another week before a further update. COACHING COLLEAGUES Thibodeau and Malone were Knicks assistants two decades ago under Jeff Van Gundy, part of a staff that included current Orlando coach Steve Clifford and former NBA Coach of the Year Don Chaney. “We had a lot of guys and so I think we all learned from each other,” Thibodeau said, “and that was the best part of that staff, is you felt like you were going to the best clinic in the world every day.” Malone recalled when the demanding Thibodeau got to coach the Knicks' entrant in the former Boston summer league. “I remember Don Chaney would have ice bags on after practice because Thibs’ summer league practices were like five hours long,” Malone said.","401267304"
"DeMarcus Cousins receives a flagrant foul for his hit to the head on the steal attempt against LeBron James and is ejected from the game. (0:52) HOUSTON -- — Anthony Davis had 27 points, LeBron James added 18 and the Los Angeles Lakers won for the sixth time in seven games with a 120-102 victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday night. “(Tonight) was just A.D. being A.D. and just having him back in the lineup gives us a whole other dynamic both offensively and defensively,"" James said. It was a testy game that included five technical fouls, two flagrant fouls and the first-half ejections of Markieff Morris and DeMarcus Cousins. Davis, who sat out on Friday with a groin strain, helped the Lakers finish with 62 points in the paint in a game in which they led by as many as 27. “His shot-making just makes him so difficult to guard and he can hurt you in so many ways,"" Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel said. The Lakers were up by double figures for most of the night and opened the fourth quarter with a 10-4 run to push the lead to 98-79 with about nine minutes remaining. Houston used a 7-2 run, with a 3-pointer from Ben McLemore, later in the quarter to get within 15 with about five minutes to go. But former Rocket Montrezl Harrell scored four quick points to make it 108-89 and both teams took out most of their starters soon after that. Christian Wood scored 23 points and James Harden had 20 in the first of two straight games against the Lakers with the second one coming Tuesday night in Houston. “Two things for us were the turnovers and transition,"" Houston coach Stephen Silas said. “The transition doesn’t have anything to do with us being together for a day, a month, or a year. Run back.” Morris was ejected in the first quarter after an altercation with Cousin s. Morris knocked Jae’Sean Tate to the ground in the lane with a hard shoulder to the chest and Cousins quickly pushed Morris to the ground. Cousins then turned and was bending down to help Tate off the court when Morris jumped up, charged at Cousins and shoved him with both hands. He was quickly pulled away by teammates and officials but continued jawing at Cousins and trying to follow him to the Houston bench. After a video review Morris received a flagrant 1 foul for the play on Tate and was given a technical foul and ejected for the ensuing dustup. Cousins was also given a technical foul but was not ejected. But he wouldn’t remain in the game much longer. James was driving to the basket early in the second quarter when Cousins tried swipe at the ball but instead hit him in the head and face. James fell to the court where he remained for a few seconds before slowly getting up and remaining in the game. The play was reviewed and Cousins was given a flagrant 2 foul and ejected. Houston came out flat after Friday night’s blowout win over the Magic and the Lakers had a 19-point lead at halftime. Los Angeles opened the third quarter with an 11-3 run, capped by a 3 from Dennis Schroder, to make it 76-49 with about nine minutes left in the quarter. TIP-INS Lakers: Talen Horton-Tucker had 17 points off the bench. ... Harrell had 16 points and eight rebounds. Rockets: Danuel House missed his fourth straight game with back spasms. ...

"D'Angelo Russell hits Malik Beasley in stride with a sweet bounce pass through traffic. (0:16) MINNEAPOLIS -- — D’Angelo Russell had 27 points, five rebounds and five assists as the Minnesota Timberwolves snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 96-88 win Sunday over the San Antonio Spurs. Russell scored eight of his points in the fourth quarter, including a 3-pointer to tie the score with 7:02 left and two free throws to ice it with 31.5 seconds remaining. Russell and Malik Beasley, who added 24 points, helped the Wolves get their first win since Dec. 26. “I thought we had a number of guys who just got fed up with losing at that point and knowing that the defensive end was where it was going to get done,” said Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders. With the score tied at 81, Minnesota scored five straight points and didn’t relinquish the lead. One of the biggest shots in the fourth quarter was a 3-pointer by forward Juancho Hernangómez, who had airballed his previous two shots from 3-point range earlier in the game. Minnesota was playing without star big man Karl-Anthony Towns, who returned to action Saturday after missing six games with a partial dislocation of his left wrist. Sunday’s absence was part of the plan to ease Towns back in and not a result of any reaggravation of his injury. Sunday’s win was Minnesota’s first without Towns this season. The Spurs were also without their leading scorer in DeMar DeRozan, who did not play due to personal reasons. DeRozan had 38 points in Saturday’s overtime win against Minnesota. Lonnie Walker IV picked up the scoring slack with DeRozan out, with a season-high 25 points to lead the Spurs. He paced the offense in the first half with 17 points on 8-of-14 shooting. “It’s been a good run here on the road, but we just ran out of gas,” said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. ""We hit a wall and couldn’t get through it.” LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points for the Spurs, and Patty Mills scored 18. Minnesota’s defense down the stretch was instrumental. This was the first time the Timberwolves had held an opponent to under 100 points since Jan. 2, 2020. “I felt like defensively, the last couple games have been lacking a spark,” said guard Josh Okogie, who returned to the floor Sunday after missing six games with a strained left hamstring. “That’s just why I tried to come in here and focus my energy on defense.” GETTING DIRTY Timberwolves forward Jarred Vanderbilt scored just five points off the bench Sunday, but his work on the glass received praise from his coach and teammates. Vanderbilt had a team-high eight rebounds in 19 minutes, earning himself a comparison to another pretty good rebounder. “He’s like Dennis Rodman for us,” Beasley said. “He does the dirty work.” TIP-INS Spurs: Walker’s previous season high was 16 points in the season opener against Memphis. … Mills scored 13 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter. Timberwolves: Okogie returned to action Sunday after missing six games with a hamstring injury. He was on a minutes restriction and scored six points in 20 minutes. … Rookie Anthony Edwards went scoreless on 0-for-8 shooting. He had a career-high 26 points at Portland on Thursday.","401267307"
"Steve Kerr says he once fined Steph Curry, Draymond Green and Drake for being late to the Warriors' plane. (0:58) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Damion Lee converted the tying and go-ahead free throws with 3.3 seconds left and the Golden State Warriors withstood a rough fourth quarter to hold off the Toronto Raptors 106-105 on Sunday night despite uncharacteristic struggles by Stephen Curry. Curry shot 2 of 16 and missed nine of his 10 3s for 11 points after scoring 143 over his previous four games, including a career-high 62 one week earlier against Portland. “My offense, I expect it to be there every night,” Curry said. “With how teams are defending night to night, being able to figure that out, in terms of us just having confidence across the board no matter who’s out there on the floor, I like where we’re at right now.” Pascal Siakam missed a jumper as the buzzer sounded but finished with 25 points, and Fred VanVleet scored 21 for Toronto in a rematch of the 2019 NBA Finals won in six games by the Raptors. “It went in and out, pretty clean look,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Siakam's last look. The Raptors challenged a foul call on Kyle Lowry beyond the right side of the arc that originally would have given Lee three shots. It was determined on review the foul was before the shot — the third play that went to replay in the final 34.4 seconds. All three calls were confirmed. Andrew Wiggins had 17 points and matched his career high with four blocked shots as Golden State nearly squandered away a game it led by 17 against an opponent that had scored a franchise-record 144 points Friday at Sacramento. Kent Bazemore made a go-ahead lay-in with 1:06 to play for Golden State before VanVleet knocked down a jumper on the other end. Curry turned the ball over with 34.4 seconds remaining and that went to review. Lowry missed a 3-point try and Golden State got one more chance with 7.6 ticks on the clock — another review that stood determining it was Warriors ball. Lowry missed Friday’s game for personal reasons but returned and contributed 17 points, nine rebounds and six assists. His layup with 7:13 remaining pulled the Raptors within 94-90. VanVleet's basket at 4:05 made it a one-point game before Kelly Oubre Jr. hit his first 3-pointer of the night moments later. Eric Paschall scored 15 points off the bench on a night the Warriors reserves produced 46 points. Lee had 13 with three 3s. Late in the third, Golden State's defense showed just how much it is doing for the Warriors: drawing a 24-second violation by Toronto one possession, and then Yuta Watanabe stepped out of bounds the next. Toronto committed another shot-clock turnover in the fourth. “We have enough talent, enough weapons to overcome a bad shooting performance,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. HONORING EDUCATORS For their “Educators Night,” the Warriors hosted 50 fans from the Oakland and San Francisco Unified School Districts to watch from their virtual fan section at Chase Center, recognizing them for their essential work. Kaiser Permanente donated $40,000 to be split evenly between districts. TIP-INS Raptors: Chris Boucher had six blocks before fouling out against his former team. ... Toronto missed its first nine shots and initial five 3s. ... The Raptors are 1-5 on the road. ... Toronto had won three straight in the series, most recently beating the Warriors to clinch a playoff berth in March 2020. Warriors: Curry didn’t take his first shot until sinking a 12-foot jumper with 2:50 left in the first. ... Draymond Green added 10 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. ... Wiggins didn't practice in Saturday's light shootaround session but was probable despite a sore left quad — and he has still scored in double figures every game.","401267308"
"Kevin Knox II goes in for the layup but gets surprised by P.J. Washington who comes in and swats the ball off the court. (0:17) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Gordon Hayward came to Charlotte looking for an expanded role and an opportunity to turn a struggling Hornets franchise into a winner. The 30-year-old small forward is getting both done while playing some of the best basketball of his career. Hayward scored 34 points and the Charlotte Hornets beat the New York Knicks 109-88 on Monday night for their fourth straight win. Hayward has been on fire for the Hornets during the team’s winning streak, averaging 29.2 points while shooting 55% from the floor and 92% from the foul line. “It's been a lot of fun playing with my new teammates and under this coaching staff,” Hayward said. “I'm having a great time. As long as we keep doing our jobs and playing hard every night I think the wins and losses will take are of themselves.” Hayward scored 28 points in the first half on 8-of-12 shooting from the field and 10-of-10 shooting from the foul line to give the Hornets 57-50 lead at halftime. He finished 11 of 17 from the field as the Hornets came in with an aggressive approach against a Knicks team playing on the second night of a back-to-back. “This is why we brought Gordon Hayward here,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “He set the tone for us and came out aggressive. He understands the significance of every game.” Devonte Graham had 19 points and seven assists for Charlotte, and P.J. Washington had 13 points as the Hornets handed the Knicks their third straight defeat. Kevin Knox had 19 points to lead the Knicks, and Mitchell Robinson had 12 points and 11 rebounds. The Hornets scored 24 points off 17 Knicks turnovers. Charlotte committed 10 turnovers while climbing above .500 for the first time this season. Knicks guard Austin Rivers said everyone needs to take a “deep breath” and not worry about the team's losing streak. “We have played some of the best teams in the NBA ... and half of our team is out with injuries,” Rivers said. “So guys have to step up and be better. Our defense has been horrendous and that has led to a bad offense.” RANDLE QUIET Julius Randle came into the game averaging 23.2 points and 11.8 rebounds per game for the Knicks but was held to 11 points and five rebounds and was a non-factor for much of the night. “Julius is getting double-teamed and triple-teamed right now with his post up, trying to get the ball out of his hands and we can operate off of that,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeaux said. “We have to have good spacing, and right now we are hesitating a little bit and I don’t want them to do that.” BALL UPDATE LaMelo Ball, who became the youngest player in NBA history to record a triple-double on Saturday night against the Hawks, was 3 of 13 from the field and finished with eight points, a career-high 14 rebounds and seven assists.

"Brandon Clarke reaches way back with one hand for the alley-oop dunk vs. the Cavaliers. (0:18) CLEVELAND -- — Dillon Brooks had 21 points and seven rebounds, and the Memphis Grizzlies recovered after blowing a 16-point lead to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 101-91 on Monday night. Brandon Clarke scored 15 points and Tyus Jones had 13 points, seven assists and three steals for the Grizzlies, who won their second straight and improved to 3-1 on the road. Kyle Anderson added eight points, six rebounds and nine assists. “The togetherness of this group impresses me and these guys embrace the challenge of being on the road,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “You have to create your own energy when you’re not at home and they’ve been able to do that.” Memphis led 73-57 late in the third quarter, but Cleveland responded with a 27-8 run capped by Damyean Dotson’s basket with 6:43 left in the fourth to go ahead by three. A 3-pointer by De’Anthony Melton put the Grizzlies back in front for good at 89-86. Brooks closed out the victory by drawing the sixth foul on Cavaliers center Andre Drummond and making two free throws in the final minute. “It felt amazing to figure it out and to execute plays with the right pace at the end,” said Brooks, who had 12 points, five boards and two blocked shots in the second half. “It’s great to win. We just have to keep it going.” Drummond had 19 points and 14 rebounds for his 11th straight double-double to start the season, extending his team record. Dotson had 14 points and six assists, and Cedi Osman scored 14 points. Point guard Collin Sexton was expected to start but was a late scratch for Cleveland with a sprained left ankle. The third-year pro, who is averaging a team-high 25.1 points, missed his third game in a row. Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said he was informed Sexton couldn't go right before the national anthem. Cleveland returned to Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse after its longest road trip of the season, covering six games and 10 days. The Cavaliers beat the Grizzlies 94-90 four days earlier. The Grizzlies took their largest lead at 73-57 on an uncontested layup by rookie Desmond Bane. Their 26-11 run to open the second half was highlighted by an alley-oop from Jones to Clarke. “When you turn the ball over 21 times, it's damn near impossible,” Bickerstaff said. “We hit some bumps tonight.” Cleveland failed to reach 100 points for the eighth straight game and is 2-6 during that span. The Ohio Department of Health permitted 1,944 fans inside the arena, which is 10% of capacity. Cleveland had been limited to 300 spectators due to COVID-19 restrictions. NEXT MAN UP Dotson made his third consecutive start filling in for Sexton. They were his first three NBA starts at point guard. “I give a lot of credit to Dot for helping us a ton,” Bickerstaff said. “It’s not easy for a shooting guard to move to the point. Instead of just worrying about yourself, you have to worry about 14 other guys.” TIP-INS Grizzlies: G Ja Morant (left ankle sprain) missed his seventh straight game after being injured on Dec. 28 at Brooklyn.

"Aaron Gordon powers down the lane and dunks over Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:16) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo returned from a one-game absence because of a minor back injury and scored 22 points as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Orlando Magic 121-99 on Monday night. Antetokounmpo, the reigning two-time NBA MVP, started slowly and battled through second-half foul trouble before coming alive in the fourth quarter. Milwaukee won a second straight and beat Orlando for a fifth consecutive time in the regular season. “At the end of the day, I had five fouls, but I was just trying to play the game, go downhill and get my teammates involved,” said Antetokounmpo, who had six rebounds and four assists. “I was just wanting to execute down the stretch.” Khris Middleton finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Bucks, while reserve Bobby Portis played well for a second straight game, scoring 20 points. Nikola Vucevic had 28 points and 13 rebounds to lead the short-handed Magic, who have lost three straight since Markelle Fultz was lost to a season-ending knee injury. Aaron Gordon had 21 points, eight assists and five rebounds and contributed solid defense against Antetokounmpo. “We felt like we played OK for three quarters and we were right there and then we just made too many mistakes on both ends of the fourth,” Vucevic said. “Milwaukee is a team that’s going to take advantage of it.” Milwaukee missed 17 of its first 24 3-point shots but drilled six 3s in the fourth quarter. Seconds after Gordon spectacularly dunked over Antetokounmpo to get the Magic within 88-86, Milwaukee’s superstar forward hit a straight-on 3-pointer that quieted the pandemic-restricted crowd of 3,248. He followed that up by finding Portis for another 3 as the Bucks went on a 22-2 run. “He puts in a lot of time and effort in and he’s growing in all ways,” Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. “It was just two big plays because the momentum could have swung on the (Gordon) dunk. It’s a huge momentum swing for him to make the 3 and then to create the open 3 for Bobby.” The teams were playing for the first time since last August, when they squared off in a first-round playoff series in the bubble at Walt Disney World. Orlando won Game 1 of that series before Milwaukee captured the next four. Milwaukee also won the four regular-season meetings with Orlando last season. Milwaukee led 63-54 at the half despite missing 13 of its first 17 3-point shots. The Bucks forced eight turnovers in the second quarter and 11 in the first half and turned those Magic mistakes into 17 points. In the fourth quarter, the Magic shot 7 of 21, including 1 of 8 from 3-point range. “The game was the first 3 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter where we had just poor possessions on offense, lack of purpose and fouling at the other end of the floor,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Bryn Forbes added 14 points and three 3s for Milwaukee, which shot 50.5% from the floor. TIP-INS Bucks: Monday marked the Orlando return of D.J. Augustin, who played for the Magic the previous four seasons. Augustin averaged double digits in scoring each of the last three seasons and hit the game-winning 3 for the Magic in Game 1 of the 2019 NBA playoffs. After drafting point guard Cole Anthony with the No. 15 pick, the Magic informed Augustin that they wouldn’t be pursuing him in free agency. Said Clifford: “In my 21 years, for me, he’s one of the favorite guys I’ve ever coached. … Those calls when people leave are never easy. That was a difficult conversation.” Augustin finished with eight points and four assists on Monday. Magic: When guard Evan Fournier hobbled off the court on Dec. 31 because of back spasms, the injury wasn’t initially thought to be serious. However, Fournier missed his sixth consecutive game on Monday. Clifford said the guard won’t play Wednesday and could miss Friday and Saturday’s games as well. ... After initially being ruled out earlier in the day, James Ennis started and played on a strained hamstring.","401267311"

Mikal Bridges also had 14. “We didn’t play our basketball,” Booker said. “We played the brand of basketball that they play, and it didn’t work out for us.” Beal, the NBA’s leading scorer, had eight rebounds and nine assists. He missed Saturday’s game with Miami because he was in the NBA’s health and safety protocol. “I was a little beat up,” Beal said. In his previous two games, Beal scored 101 points, tying the team record with 60 points on Wednesday at Philadelphia and hitting for 41 at Boston on Saturday. Washington never trailed and was ahead by 32 with 4:16 to play in the second quarter. They held the Suns to just 14.8% (4 for 27) from 3-point range. “I think we did a good job of defending,” Beal said. “Tonight was the first time we guarded the right way.” The Wizards played their first game without center Thomas Bryant, who suffered a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Bryant injured the knee in the first two minutes of Saturday’s game and is likely to miss the rest of the season. Robin Lopez started in Bryant’s place and had 11 points and 11 rebounds. He’s having a great time playing with Beal. “Watching him handle the ball, watching him do his work, it’s something incredible,” Lopez said. “You see something different. You see something special so often.” Davis Bertans had 18 points for Washington, all on 3-pointers. TIP-INS Suns: F/C Jalen Smith missed his third straight game for health and safety protocol reasons. … G Cameron Payne was out for the second time with a strained right ankle. Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks said Westbrook originally hurt the quadriceps more than a month ago. “He got hit pretty bad in his quad in training camp,” Brooks said. “It bothered him. He pushed through it.” Westbrook aggravated the injury Wednesday in Philadelphia, and Brooks said he also dislocated a finger, and the rest will help both injuries. HI MOM! Phoenix coach Monty Williams saw his mother on Sunday for the first time since Thanksgiving 2019, but it was a socially distanced visit. Williams, who’s from the Washington D.C. area, had his mother drive to the parking lot of the team’s hotel, and using a selfie stick, took a photo. “I was able to talk to her from a distance and that’s all you can do, man,” Williams said. “I wanted to abide by the rules, but I also wanted to see my mother’s face. That was a good thing for me.” REPLACING BRYANT Brooks said that losing Bryant was difficult to digest. “It was a punch in the gut,” Brooks said. “He’s pretty bummed out, for obvious reasons.” Without Bryant, Brooks said that Lopez and Moritz Wagner would get additional minutes. “We’ve got options,” Brooks said. “Moe is going to get opportunities. If everything stayed the same, his minutes were going to be limited. Now, he has a golden opportunity.”","401267312"
"Cam Reddish runs down the lane and elevates for an alley-oop dunk vs. the 76ers. (0:20) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 26 points, including the first three baskets of Atlanta's dominant start to the second half, and the Hawks beat the short-handed Philadelphia 76ers 112-94 on Monday night. De'Andre Hunter and Brandon Goodwin had 15 points as the Hawks snapped a four-game losing streak. Clint Capela added 12 points and 10 rebounds as six Atlanta players scored in double figures. Young, who was held to a combined 22 points in his last two games, regained his scoring touch. He opened the second half with a jumper before adding back-to-back layups. “We were just playing fast, getting back to what we do and the shots were just going in,” Young said. “You could see the confidence with everybody rolling.” Young's spurt keyed Atlanta's 15-2 run to open the half. The Hawks stretched a 65-50 halftime advantage to an 80-52 lead with the run. “I think the most important part of the game was how we came out after the break, and Trae was a big part of that,” said Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce. Atlanta led 95-65 late in the third before Young and other starters sat out the final period. Joel Embiid led Philadelphia with 24 points and 11 rebounds. Isaiah Joe had 18 points. The Sixers used nine players. That may have seemed like an abundance of depth after Philadelphia was limited to only seven players in Saturday's 115-103 home loss to Denver. Forward Mike Scott (knee) and Embiid (back tightness) returned to add depth. Philadelphia is far from full strength. Ben Simmons (sore left knee) was again held out. The depth problems will continue through the week after Seth Curry tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday. Tobias Harris and reserves Shake Milton, Matisse Thybulle and Vincent Poirier were again held out due to COVID-19 protocols. The NBA called off two games on Monday due to the virus. “No one is going to feel sorry for us,” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers. “We’ve got to try to win these games. We’ve in a tough spot with COVID. ... I have a sneaking feeling a lot of teams are going to have this problem.” Rookie Tyrese Maxey, who scored 39 points in his first start against Denver, had 15. TIP-INS 76ers: Rivers said he hopes Simmons (sore left knee) can return Tuesday night against Miami after missing his second consecutive game. “We thought it'd be one game and now it's two,” Rivers said. The team was fined $25,000 on Monday for failing to list Simmons on the initial injury report Saturday's game against Denver. ... F Furkan Korkmaz (groin) was held out. Hawks: Pierce had no update on the severity of G Bogdan Bogdanovic's avulsion fracture in his right knee. The team announced Sunday soft tissue inflammation and a bone bruise also was diagnosed. Bogdanovic was one of the major offseason acquisitions for Atlanta, signing a four-year, $72 million contract in free agency. ... G Tony Snell (right foot) made his season debut midway through the fourth period and missed each of his three shots. ALL 3s John Collins took only seven shots, and all were 3s. He made four of them to score 12 points. “He shot 3s because they played big and they played down the floor,” Pierce said of the Sixers. FAMILY AND FRIENDS ONLY The Hawks have pushed back their plan to allow about 1,700 ticketed fans to home games. The target date to allow 10% capacity was changed from Jan. 18 to Jan. 26. The Hawks credited “an abundance of caution” for making the change after after consulting with state and health officials. The team has had only a few family and friends attend home games.","401267313"
"Damian Lillard takes the defensive rebound down the court, past defenders, knocks down the reverse layup, and draws the foul. (0:27) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — CJ McCollum scored 30 points, including the go-ahead jumper with 9.6 seconds left to give the Portland Trail Blazers a 112-111 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Monday night. Damian Lillard added 23 points and Carmelo Anthony scored 20 off the bench for the Blazers, who erased a 17-point deficit and overcame Pascal Siakam’s first career triple-double of 22 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. McCollum hit his clutch shot over Fred VanVleet off a spectacular series of dribble moves. “I work on this stuff,” McCollum said. “I work on my game. I tell people all the time: `I’ve been ready.’” Anthony had 13 points in the fourth quarter, including several big shots from right in front of Toronto’s bench — where the Raptors made noise all night. He relished the moment and the banter. “Yeah, it’s fun,” Anthony said. “You’re going to hear it even more with no fans. You live for those moments. You want that pressure on you. (There’s) nothing like making shots in front of the opposing team’s bench as they are yelling at you.” Siakam’s potential game-winning shot rimmed out on the final play — for the second time in two nights. The same thing happened to him in a one-point loss Sunday to Golden State. McCollum also thought he had something to do with Robert Covington’s defense on Siakam’s shot. “I told (Covington) that Siakam felt like he had a matchup against him tonight and I think he took it personally,” McCollum said. For the Raptors, it was yet another close loss that left them 2-8, tied for the worst record in the NBA. “We fought hard to get wins and it came down to a couple of possessions,” Siakam said. “If we had made a couple of shots, we’d have a different record right now. But if you look at the record, it’s tough.” Portland starting center Jusuf Nurkic went to the locker room in the first half with a bruised quadriceps and did not return. His replacement, Enes Kanter, did a solid job filling in with 14 points and six rebounds in 16 minutes off the bench. Siakam gave the Raptors a 111-110 lead with 54 seconds left on a cutting layup. After an empty Blazers possession, VanVleet missed a jumper on the other end for Toronto before McCollum put Portland ahead. Siakam was dominant early, racking up 12 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the first quarter, which he capped by hitting a jumper at the buzzer. Toronto held a 32-21 lead after the Blazers shot just 36% in the period. The Raptors pushed their lead to 52-35 in the second quarter, but Portland closed the half on a 20-8 run and trailed 60-55 at the break. Kanter gave the Blazers their first lead at 61-60 in the third quarter, but the Raptors answered and led 86-76 heading into the fourth. Siakam picked up his fifth foul while guarding McCollum with 6:37 remaining. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland coach Terry Stotts was asked before the game about the bench pairing of Kanter and Anthony, particularly on the defensive end. “I look at the net rating rather than offensive and defensive rating,” Stotts said. “The last four or five game they’ve been a net positive. There’s been a lot of conversation about that. I think Enes and Melo have played really well together the last five games.” Raptors: Relying on a smaller unit again, coach Nick Nurse benched starting center Alex Len for the entire second half. Fellow big man Aron Baynes did not play. Toronto began the day ranked 18th in the NBA in defensive rating, but held Stephen Curry to 2-for-16 shooting Sunday night against Golden State. According to Nurse, part of that was going small — but he hopes to find more time for Len and Baynes while still playing solid defense. “Our last six quarters of defense are what we’re used to,” Nurse said before Monday’s game. “Maybe it’s some other factors, but it seems to me the small lineup has given us a chance to play that way. But again, we have to figure something out with those guys on the floor.”","401267315"
"De'Aaron Fox throws down a monster dunk on Malcolm Brogdon, sending the Kings' bench into a frenzy. (0:25) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Buddy Hield made a big 3-pointer moments after Indiana’s Domantas Sabonis had a basket taken away following a replay review, and the Sacramento Kings beat the Pacers 127-122 on Monday night. Hield finished with 18 points on six 3s as the Kings won for the second time in seven games. Harrison Barnes had a season-high 30 points and eight rebounds, and De’Aaron Fox added 21 points and nine assists. “This was probably our best win just because it was consistent throughout,” Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. “It wasn’t a ton of highs or a ton of lows. It was just consistent basketball. Win or lose, this is how we have to play.” The Kings held a one-point lead when Sabonis went up underneath the basket and was credited with a bucket as Richaun Holmes was called for goaltending with 1:25 remaining. After a lengthy review, the call was overturned. After Hield’s 3 made it 121-117, Indiana’s Victor Oladipo missed from beyond the arc. Fox then scored on a soaring one-handed dunk. “As a group we know we didn’t put forth our best effort these last couple of games,” Holmes said. “It’s about staying locked in. This is how we feel we can play every night. This has to be the standard.” Sabonis had 28 points and 11 rebounds for the Pacers. Malcolm Brogdon added 24 points, while Oladipo and Doug McDermott scored 21 apiece. Indiana forced turnovers on two of the first three possessions of the game, but coach Nate Bjorkgren felt the Pacers' defense broke down at key times. “We have to do a better job on the ball, just being more active there, so they can’t have their pinpoint precise passes right into their shooting pocket like a coach would pass it,” Bjorkgren said. “That wasn’t much fun tonight.” Oladipo scored 14 of 17 points for Indiana during a late stretch in the fourth. He, too, blamed the Pacers' defense. “We just have to do a better job of getting stops and do a better job of sacrificing on that end,” Oladipo said. “We have to talk better. We have to communicate better. We have to be decisive and smart. It’s the little things right now. It’s not something major we can’t fix.” Fox made a buzzer-beating 3 to end the first half with the Kings up 65-64. It came 10 seconds after Brogdon’s 3-pointer over the outstretched arm of the 6-foot-10 Holmes. TIP-INS Pacers: McDermott had 13 points in the second quarter on 5-of-6 shooting. … Myles Turner followed an offensive rebound with a tomahawk dunk in the first half. ... Bjorkgren won a challenge in the fourth quarter after Turner was initially called for his fourth foul. The call was overturned and the foul rescinded. Kings: Holmes had 16 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high six blocks. “He’s our motor,” said first-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton, who scored 12 points. “When he’s energetic and makes plays like that … it just goes down the line.” ... Sacramento has scored 60 or more points in the first half of five of its 11 games.","401267316"
"Dakota Mathias makes his only bucket of the night, draining a deep 3-pointer in overtime to give the 76ers a lead. (0:21) PHILADELPHIA -- — Pick a position, Joel Embiid got to the basket at will and continued to stir early-season MVP hype. Dakota Mathias needed only one open look to squeeze his way into Embiid's personal highlight reel. Embiid had 45 points and 16 rebounds, Mathias’ only basket of the game was a go-ahead 3-pointer with 26.1 seconds left and the Philadelphia 76ers hung on to beat the undermanned Miami Heat 137-134 in overtime on Tuesday night. “I've got a goal. I want to win the championship and I can't do it alone,” Embiid said. Embiid had some of the great moments of his career and carried the Sixers with a perfect third quarter and clutch buckets in OT to put them on the brink of victory. “He willed that game for us,” coach Doc Rivers said. It was little-known Mathias with the stunner that won it. Mathias, who went undrafted in 2018 and signed this season with the Sixers as a two-day G League player, got the ball from the top of the arc and buried it for the 134-132 lead. “No hesitation,” Rivers said. “It says a lot about him.” With Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic among the Heat sitting out for COVID-related reasons, they pushed the Sixers into OT with a mad-dash end to the fourth. Tyler Herro helped the Heat overcome Embiid’s dominant effort when his 3-pointer tied the game 115-all with 2:25 left. Precious Achiuwa scored two straight baskets -- the first off Philly’s shot clock violation, then off a turnover -- for a 119-115 lead. Embiid buried the pull-up jumper just inside the 3-point arc with 3.3 seconds left that tied it 120-120 and sent the game into overtime. It was his only bucket of the fourth after he made all eight shots in the third. Embiid’s go-ahead three-point play with 2:37 left in OT put the Sixers up 126-124, and Herro matched his regulation theatrics with another tying 3 for 129-all. Danny Green matched the 76ers' record with nine 3-pointers and scored 29 points and Mike Scott had 16 points. Herro finished with 34 points, Duncan Robinson had 26 and Gabe Vincent 24. “It's a shame because our guys did more than enough to put ourselves in position to win,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “They could have kept on going another two overtimes. It wasn't a matter of lack of want or lack of effort. Our guys emptied it all out there. It's just a matter of getting over this hurdle of really finishing plays.” Embiid finished plays in bunches and took over the third quarter when scored 20 points and in OT when he scored 11 points. Embiid was all over the court in the third. He smacked the ball away under the basket to break up a Miami possession, then hustled down to hit Isiah Joe for a 3 and cut the hole to four. Embiid followed that by shaking off a double team and tossing an underhand shot for the basket. He made the free throw and Sixers were down one. Embiid made it back-to-back three-point plays when he got the Heat to bite on a pump-fake from the free-throw line. The big man even handled the rock with ease and went the length of the floor to hit a little fadeaway and extend the lead. He was 16 of 23 from the floor and made all 13 free throws. Embiid had five steals and a blocked shot. “There was no chance we were going down,” Embiid said. “Whatever I had to do and whatever my teammates had to do, we did it.” Achiuwa had 17 points and 13 rebounds and the Heat made 19 of 56 3-pointers. “We're not just trying to develop guys for the future.,” Spoelstra said. “We're trying to develop guys to learn how to win at the highest level, this year. Right now.” TIP-INS Heat: F/C Meyers Leonard sat out with a strained left shoulder. ... The Heat continued to struggle with roster issues after their game Sunday against Boston was postponed because they couldn’t field the minimum number of players. 76ers: Rivers said Ben Simmons had to be summoned back to New York after he tried to return to Philadelphia when the team needed to stay an extra day for additional COVID-19 testing. Simmons had five points, 12 assists and fouled out. ... Dwight Howard moved into 13th on the NBA’s career blocked shots list. ... Dana Barros hit nine 3s on Jan. 27, 1995 vs. Phoenix. DAY OFF Embiid said it was “unfortunate” the 76ers had to play when they were short-handed over the weekend because of COVID issues while other games were postponed. “I guess the league keeps making us play,” he said. “There's really no other explanation behind it.”","401267317"
"Adrian Wojnarowski details what's next for Kyrie Irving as the NBA is reviewing videos circulating on social media of a maskless Irving at what appears to be a family birthday party. (1:12) NEW YORK -- — Kevin Durant had 34 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds, Bruce Brown made a huge contribution while starting for the absent Kyrie Irving, and the Brooklyn Nets rallied from 18 down to beat the Denver Nuggets 122-116 on Tuesday night. Brown scored a season-high 16 points, including the tying and go-ahead baskets down the stretch. Durant followed with Brooklyn's next six points, including a 3-pointer that essentially put it away at 120-113 with 27 seconds to play. “Guys have pride. They want to come out and compete, and everybody came with it tonight, especially in the second half,” Durant said. Nikola Jokic had 23 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds for the Nuggets, who were trying to sweep a three-game road trip. But they were outscored 68-46 in the second half and squandered their chance to climb above .500 for the first time this season. Denver coach Michael Malone said his short-handed team might have been a little tired at the end of a tough stretch. “But we have to find a way to fight through that and hopefully we can realize once again that playing three quarters is not going to get it done in this business,” Malone said. “You have to find a way to play as close to 48 (minutes) as possible and when we do that, I think we have a chance to be a pretty good team.” Caris LeVert added 20 points for the Nets, who had dropped two in a row during Irving's four-game absence for personal reasons and seemed well on their way to a third when they trailed 79-61 early in the third quarter. But they got hot from 3-point range and Durant from just about everywhere. “All we need to do is bring energy, play hard and play defense, and we did that tonight,” Brown said. They blew past the Nuggets with a 29-4 run that gave them a 90-83 lead, and when Jokic checked out after the next possession he kicked over a chair in the last row of Denver’s bench in frustration. Will Barton scored 22 points for the Nuggets, making six 3-pointers. Jamal Murray scored 20. Jokic scored 13 points in the first quarter and Denver already led by double digits barely a minute into the second. The lead was eight with about four minutes left before Murray finally got going with three baskets, including a 3-pointer that made it 70-54 at the break. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver gave 7-foot-2 Bol Bol his first career start, with Gary Harris out for personal reasons. Bol Bol finished with five points in 16 minutes. ... Monte Morris scored 14 points. Nets: Before the game, coach Steve Nash wasn't sure if Durant would play Wednesday at New York. Durant, who missed last season recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon, sat out the second half of the Nets' first back-to-back of the season. “I really hope Kevin plays tomorrow, but we’ll see,” Nash said. “We have to judge these things day to day and moment to moment.” Durant said afterward he planned to play. ... DeAndre Jordan, the starting center to begin the season, didn't play. IRVING UPDATE The Nets and the NBA are looking into Irving’s actions after a video showed the point guard at an indoor family gathering not wearing a mask. General manager Sean Marks said a date for Irving's return hadn't been determined, and the All-Star could face a fine if the NBA determines he violated the health and safety rules in place during the coronavirus pandemic.","401267318"
"Mike Conley crashes into the lane and passes out to Bojan Bogdanovic for an easy 3-pointer. (0:15) CLEVELAND -- — Donovan Mitchell and the Utah Jazz are headed home with a victory, albeit a little earlier than expected. Mitchell scored 27 points and the Jazz rolled to a 117-87 win over the injury-depleted Cleveland Cavaliers, wrapping up their six-game road trip Tuesday night. Utah was scheduled to play Wednesday at Washington, but the NBA postponed the game because the Wizards do not have the minimum eight available players. “It’s a weird time, but we also have a job to do,” Mitchell said. “The key is staying locked in on the task at hand with basketball and being unselfish off the court. We’ve got to continue to be safe and make sure guys are being as careful as possible.” Jordan Clarkson had 21 points and eight rebounds off the bench and Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 points for the Jazz, whose largest lead was 114-80 on a 3-pointer by Miye Oni. Utah went 4-2 on its 10-day journey. “We did exactly what we were supposed to do against a team we were supposed to beat,” Mitchell said. Mitchell, who scored 17 points in the third, and Clarkson each made five 3s as Utah went 24 of 45 beyond the arc. The Jazz nailed a franchise-record 25 triples at Milwaukee on Jan. 8. “Right now, I think all of us are glad to be getting on a plane, going West not East,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “You obviously appreciate the extra rest at any point in the season, but it didn’t factor into how we played this game."" Cedi Osman paced Cleveland with 17 points and six assists. Rookie forward Isaac Okoro and Damyean Dotson had 11 points apiece for the Cavaliers, who failed to score 100 for the ninth straight game and have lost three in a row. Cleveland center Andre Drummond (right Achilles bruise), averaging an NBA-high 15.1 rebounds, was a late scratch after being stepped on Monday against Memphis. The Cavaliers also were without shooting guard Collin Sexton (left ankle sprain) for the fourth straight game, along with power forward Kevin Love (right calf strain), point guard Darius Garland (right shoulder sprain) and four other rotation players. “Not making excuses, but there is just so much that’s different because of the amount of injuries,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “We’ve got to figure out a way to maintain our identity.” Clarkson scored 14 points in the first half and Utah carried a 49-36 lead into the break. The teams combined for two free throw attempts, 31 3-point tries and five airballs on uncontested shots in the first half. NOT YOUR AVERAGE BEAR Cavaliers G Yogi Ferrell, who had 10 points and four assists, spent one day with the Jazz during training camp. The fifth-year pro signed a 10-day contract Monday when the NBA granted Cleveland a hardship exception. “Yogi is a smart player and he knows the league,” Snyder said. “He’s played that position his whole life, so it’s easy to adapt to a new situation.” TIP-INS Jazz: F Joe Ingles (right Achilles soreness) was sidelined for the second time on the trip. His streak of playing in 384 straight games ended last week at Milwaukee. … Utah has started the same lineup all season with center Rudy Gobert, forwards Bogdanovic and Royce O’Neale, and guards Mitchell and Mike Conley. Cavaliers: G Kevin Porter Jr. (personal), who was slated to be the team's sixth man, has been inactive for all 12 games after his offseason arrest in Eastern Ohio. Bickerstaff continues to be vague about Porter’s status. “We’re still following our plan as an organization,” the coach said. “Every day, we have conversations.”","401267319"
"LeBron James says Dennis Schroder bet that he wouldn't make a no-look 3 as he was shooting. He also addresses comparisons to Steph Curry's no-look 3-pointers. (1:23) HOUSTON -- — James Harden publicly acknowledged his discord with the Houston Rockets for the first time Tuesday night following back-to-back blowout losses to the Los Angeles Lakers. “We're just not good enough ... I love this city. I literally have done everything that I can,” Harden said. “I mean, this situation is crazy. It’s something that I don’t think can be fixed.” Harden had remained quiet through months of speculation that he is unhappy in Houston. Numerous reports have indicated he’s looking to be shipped to Brooklyn to play with former Oklahoma City teammate Kevin Durant, who left and became an NBA champion with Golden State. For all his accomplishments, Harden is still seeking an NBA title. He’s been asked repeatedly to address the trade rumors since the season began but has deflected questions and refused to reveal any frustration. That all changed after a 117-100 blowout loss to the Lakers on Tuesday night. The Lakers led by 30 points in the third quarter after leading by 27 during a 120-102 on Sunday. Harden didn't elaborate or take any additional questions following his initial comments. Harden’s words will surely be noticed by NBA officials, but it wouldn’t seem that what he said postgame would merit a trade demand — and subject him to a fine. The league has a longstanding rule about players not being able to publicly express a desire to be traded and has issued $50,000 fines in recent years to players like Anthony Davis and Dewayne Dedmon for breaking that policy. Harden was fined $50,000 earlier this season for conduct detrimental to the league related to him not following the health and safety protocols put into place by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association for navigating a season during a coronavirus pandemic. Harden won each of the last three scoring titles by notable margins — 2.3 points over Davis in 2017-18, 8.1 points over Paul George in 2018-19 and 3.8 points over Bradley Beal last season. His 24.8-point average so far this season ranked 18th in the NBA, still putting him among the leaders but obviously well off his usual pace. He’s averaged at least 25 points per game in each of his eight full seasons with the Rockets. The Rockets traded Russell Westbrook to the Washington Wizards in exchange for John Wall and a future first-round draft pick before the season in what was seen as an attempt to pacify Harden. So far, the pairing of the two ball-dominant guards hasn't gone well. The Rockets are 3-6 and looked completely overmatched in their last two games against the reigning champions. Wall was asked how he and Harden have worked together on the court so far after Tuesday's game. “It’s a little rocky,"" Wall said. “I don’t think it’s the best it could be, that’s all I could say.”","401267321"

(0:25) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Lonnie Walker IV scored 24 points and San Antonio beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 112-102 on Tuesday night, allowing the Spurs to finish a five-game trip with four wins. Keldon Johnson added 18 points for the Spurs, who won their 2,200th game since joining the NBA in 1976. The Spurs committed a season-low four turnovers. “I feel like we fought the whole road trip,” Johnson said. “We gave one away in Minnesota ... but we knew we just had to bounce back and continue to keep fighting and trusting each other and we came out a winner.

They got a shot every time down,” Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. “We didn’t kick the ball all over the gym, but they really converted, obviously, when we did turn it over.

They’ve just taken care of the ball really well. We’ve done nothing special. We’ve called a few more plays to get them a little bit more organized, so it’s a little bit less frantic than in the past. That’s all I can think of, really.”","401267322"
"Aaron Holiday's basket is all the Pacers need as they pull away from the Warriors late in the fourth quarter. (0:17) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Edmond Sumner earned a start for Indiana that came with a daunting assignment: defending Stephen Curry. Myles Turner made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:59 left and scored 22 points, Aaron Holiday converted a layup on the next possession and the Pacers held off Curry and the Golden State Warriors 104-95 Tuesday night. Indiana kept Curry in check by regularly playing him with a tough box-and-1 defense, though the two-time MVP still created his chances. He found his groove again following a rare off night Sunday against the Raptors to finish with 20 points. “People are going to throw everything at Steph,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""That’ll be a big theme this season and we’ve got to do a better job of attacking what people are throwing at us, and we’ll get better at it.” Justin Holiday also hit a key 3 late as the Pacers bounced back from a loss at Sacramento a night earlier to avoid dropping consecutive road games for the first time. Curry shot 7 for 17 with three 3-pointers. Indiana coach Nate Bjorkgren credited his team's defensive energy. “They were mad from last night and they came today with an edge to them,” he said. Curry was coming off an 11-point game in which he shot 2 for 16 and missed nine of his 10 3s in Sunday’s win against Toronto after scoring 143 over his previous four games, including a career-high 62 a week before against Portland. Kelly Oubre Jr. contributed 17 points and key reserves Damion Lee and Mychal Mulder hit consecutive 3-pointers during one fourth-quarter stretch for Golden State before the Pacers got hot. Andrew Wiggins scored 22 points as the Warriors concluded a seven-game homestand, their longest of the season, by going 4-3 at Chase Center in a span of 12 days. Wiggins also blocked a career-best five shots, giving him nine the past two games — the first time in his career he has had three or more blocks in back-to-back games. Turner had 11 rebounds and four blocks for the Pacers, playing a back-to-back following a 127-122 loss to the Kings that began a five-game road trip out West. Four players scored 20 or more points in that game, then five reached double digits Tuesday. Indiana's 12-1 run midway through the second quarter put the Pacers ahead 34-32 before the Warriors roared back with a 16-5 surge that made it 48-39. Golden State rookie James Wiseman picked up his fourth personal foul with 1:10 left in the second quarter. He played in the third until getting his sixth foul at the 6:25 mark. The Warriors honored front-line workers on “ Essential Workers Night, ” with those fans watching virtually and being shown on the LED boards. PASCHALL OUT Golden State forward Eric Paschall sat out and entered the NBA's COVID-19 health and safety protocol. That does not mean he has tested positive for the coronavirus. ""We've got to make up for Eric's loss and it's a big loss with the way he's been playing,"" Kerr said. THOMPSON IN TOWN Curry's injured Splash Brother, Klay Thompson, has been around the team the past couple of days, seeing the training staff Tuesday as he recovers from surgery on a torn right Achilles tendon. He is unlikely to travel with the club for now. Thompson is still in a boot but will begin running in a pool next week. “He’s in good spirits,"" Kerr said. ""He's very upbeat about everything. It was great to see him."" TIP-INS Pacers: Shot 9 for 28 from 3-point range. ... Indiana won on the Warriors' home floor in the lone meeting last season and scored its most points ever in the series in a 129-118 victory. Warriors: Curry missed his first two free throws of the game, rattling each one in and out, and shook his head in disbelief after the first one didn't drop. He had made a franchise-record 80 straight from the line before a miss Jan. 3 vs. Portland.","401267323"
"LaMelo Ball drives in and throws a no-look pass to Bismack Biyombo, who scores for the Hornets. (edited) (0:19) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — The dangerous duo is back in Dallas. Luka Doncic had 34 points, 13 rebounds, nine assists and a career-high four blocks, Kristaps Porzingis scored 16 points in his return from a knee injury and the Mavericks beat the Charlotte Hornets 104-93 on Wednesday night. “When both of those guys are out there at the same time it’s a game changer for us,” said Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, who became the 16th coach in NBA history to reach 800 career victories. “They are two guys who can play on the inside and space the court on the outside."" Tim Hardaway Jr. added 18 points for the Mavericks. They've won four straight after opening 2-4. Terry Rozier had 18 points to lead the Hornets. They shot 38% from the field and had their four-game winning streak snapped. Porzingis played for the first time since having knee surgery in October. The 7-foot-3 Latvian impacted the game at both ends with his size, easily able to shoot over smaller defenders while altering shots in the paint against the smaller Hornets. Charlotte attempted to counter at times with a small ball lineup, but struggled all night with Dallas' height and length. “That’s the first time we’ve seen this lineup and they’re long, they’re physical,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. “Those are two special players that can play at a high level. Give Doncic credit he played a great game tonight. Porzingis’ length and his size obviously was a factor out there.” Porzingis played 21 minutes, finishing 6 of 16 from the floor and 4 of 9 from beyond the 3-point arc. He had four rebounds. Porzingis said he felt good on the floor, but admitted he might have pressed himself into taking some bad shots because he was on a minutes restriction imposed by Carlisle. “I was trying to do as much as I could in the minutes that I had,” Porzingis said. “And sometimes you don't make the best decisions when you really want to be aggressive. But it's OK. It's a part of it. I wanted to be aggressive when I was out there.” “He’s an amazing player,"" Doncic said. “He has to get back into rhythm, but I think for the first game he played amazing.” Doncic appeared to grow frustrated with the lack of calls going his way in the second half, but used that as motivation. After a non-call, Doncic hustled back to block Gordon Hayward's shot, corralled the loose ball and drove the length of the floor where he lofted a one-handed alley-oop pass to Josh Green for the lay-in. Doncic got testy at the end of the third quarter after Charlotte's Caleb Martin said something to him. Doncic began walking toward Martin, shouting something back as officials assessed Martin a technical foul. 800 WINS Carlisle said looking back on 800 career wins he's been fortunate to have had “great ownership” and “exceptional players” during his time on the bench. ""It's just a privilege to be one of 30 guys coaching in this great league,"" Carlisle said. TIP INS Mavericks: Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell and Josh Richardson did not play due to the NBA health and safety protocols. Hornets: Hornets coach James Borrego said Hayward left the game in the fourth quarter because of a strained hip. After averaging 29.2 points during the four-game winning streak, Hayward was held to 16 points on 5-of-15 shooting by the Mavericks. ... P.J. Washington had 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists.","401267324"
"Khris Middleton dishes it out to Giannis Antetokounmpo at the top of the arc, and he takes the open lane to slam down a one-handed dunk. (0:18) DETROIT -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 22 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Milwaukee Bucks easily beat the Detroit Pistons for the third time this month, 110-101 on Wednesday night. The Bucks built a commanding early lead with a barrage of 3-pointers. Brook Lopez connected three times from beyond the arc in the first quarter, when the Bucks were 7 of 11 from long distance. Detroit was just 4 of 20 overall in the period and trailed 27-13 after one. That pattern continued through much of the second quarter. At one point, Milwaukee led 52-29 and had more 3-pointers (11) than Detroit had field goals (9). “We’ve just tried to keep building on shooting and making it a priority,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It takes good passing, good ball movement, and then guys have to knock down shots.” The Pistons cut the deficit to 11 at halftime but never seemed like a serious threat to overtake Milwaukee. Jerami Grant led Detroit with 22 points and Svi Mykhailiuk added 18. “As a young team, we just made enough mistakes at the right time to put yourself in a hole,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. It was the 20th career triple-double for Antetokounmpo. Jrue Holiday added 21 points for the Bucks in another solid performance after arriving in an offseason trade. “I knew he was really good, but every day I play with him, I realize how good a person he is, good a teammate he is, and how much better he is than what I thought,"" Antetokounmpo said. Milwaukee beat Detroit 125-115 on Jan. 4 and 130-115 two days later. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee has won three straight and six of seven. ... The Bucks finished 19 of 43 from 3-point range. ... Lopez didn't score after those early 3s. He had nine points and 11 rebounds. Pistons: Detroit fell to 2-9, but its margins of defeat have remained reasonably respectable. That 15-point loss to Milwaukee was the most lopsided of the season for the Pistons. ... Detroit had a 20-7 advantage in second-chance points. STRUGGLES Detroit shot a solid 40% from 3-point range, but the Pistons were just 22 of 57 inside the arc. “We shot way too many midrange shots tonight,"" Casey said. ""That’s what that team wants you to do.” MAJOR THREAT Antetokounmpo said after the game he wasn't on social media, so a reporter had to relay the NBA's big news of the day — a pending trade sending James Harden to Brooklyn. “It’s an amazing move for Brooklyn,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Obviously, they got better — way better.”","401267325"
"Kevin Durant reacts to the Nets' win vs. the Knicks and will wait till James Harden trade is finalized before commenting on it. (1:19) NEW YORK -- — James Harden might soon be in Brooklyn and Kyrie Irving could soon be back, giving the Nets a potentially tantalizing trio. Kevin Durant's focus was on something else Wednesday. ""We really wanted this game tonight and everybody played like that,"" Durant said. Especially the solo superstar poised to soon be fronting a brand new Big Three. Durant scored 26 points to lead the Nets — short-handed after agreeing to a trade for Harden — to a 116-109 victory over the New York Knicks. Durant was already scheduled to play on both nights of a back-to-back for the first time since surgery to repair his Achilles tendon. He maybe had to do a little more than planned after the Nets shook up their roster earlier in the day with a four-team blockbuster centered around the acquisition of Harden, the three-time NBA scoring champion. Durant, who has won four scoring titles, didn't want to talk about Harden yet, with the deal still not approved by the NBA. With Irving missing a fifth straight game for personal reasons, the Nets had only nine players. The four who are to be included in the trade, confirmed by a person with knowledge of the situation, were not at Madison Square Garden. The Nets lost some good ones — Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince have all been starters and played important roles — but still were plenty good enough and might be even better if the Durant-Harden-Irving tandem works out. “But tonight we had to focus on the task at hand and that was getting the ‘W’ tonight,” said Nets forward Jeff Green, a teammate of Harden's in Houston last season. Joe Harris and Bruce Brown each added 15 points for the Nets, who broke open the game with a 15-2 burst to close the first half. Julius Randle scored 30 points and RJ Barrett had 20 for the Knicks, who dropped their fourth straight but at least rediscovered some offense after being held below 90 points in the previous three. “I’m looking forward to the next game. We’re just trying to get back on track,” said rookie guard Immanuel Quickley, who scored 19 points. Brooklyn's lead was just 46-43 with about 4 1/2 minutes remaining in the half before Durant threw a lob that DeAndre Jordan slammed down while getting fouled. Durant followed with a 3-pointer and the two had consecutive dunks for the last two baskets of the half as the Nets opened a 61-45 lead. The lead was still 16 after three before the Knicks made it appear close in the final minutes, mostly while Durant was on the bench. Durant went over 20 points in his franchise-record ninth straight game to begin a season, his first game at Madison Square Garden since he and Irving joined the Nets in July 2019 while a Knicks team that had enough money to afford two superstars couldn't land any. Irving still hasn't played across town as a Net, missing one game last season while injured and sitting out the second on the day Kobe Bryant died. TIP-INS Nets: Coach Steve Nash said he had no new details on Irving's absence. ... The Nets played just their fourth road game. They came in tied with Houston for fewest in the league. ... Durant improved to 17-3 in his career against the Knicks. Knicks: Rookie forward Obi Toppin played a minute, his first action since the season opener. The college player of the year last season had been out with a strained right calf. ... F Taj Gibson, who signed last week, didn't play in the first game he was available. ... Barrett is Nash's godson.","401267328"
"On a fast break, Kyle Anderson sends up an alley-oop to Brandon Clarke, who throws down a dunk. (0:22) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Jonas Valanciunas had 24 points and 16 rebounds, Grayson Allen scored a season-high 20 off the bench and the Memphis Grizzlies came back to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-107 on Wednesday night. Brandon Clarke added 19 points for Memphis, which outscored Minnesota 38-17 in the fourth quarter to win its third straight game. Playing without Ja Morant for the eighth game in a row, the Grizzlies had a 50-21 advantage in points off the bench. De’Anthony Melton scored 15 and rookie Xavier Tillman chipped in with 12. “Our guys just kept fighting through, fighting through and when a window opened for us to attack, we took advantage of it,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Malik Beasley had 28 points for Minnesota. D’Angelo Russell added 25 and Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 25 points and 14 rebounds. The teams continue a two-game series Friday in Minnesota. “Got to be more physical,” Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. “That’s a physical group over there. Got to be more physical, plain and simple. Take pride in guarding the ball. Take pride in protecting the rim.” The two youngest clubs in the NBA to start this season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, are still trying to find their way through injury and ineffectiveness. Morant has been limited to three games because of a left ankle sprain, while Justice Winslow and Jaren Jackson Jr. haven’t played this season. “It’s always been next man up,” Allen said. “We just have a bunch of hoopers on this team. It makes it easy to just get different groups in there and just play. We’ve got a bunch of guys playing the right way, it makes it easy.” Towns has missed seven games after dislocating his left wrist. The Wolves were winless without their big man in the middle before beating San Antonio on Sunday with Towns sitting out the second game of a back-to-back. With Towns on the bench to start the fourth, Memphis went on a 14-0 run to take a 94-92 lead. Allen hit a pair of 3-pointers during the spurt as the Grizzlies’ bench again took advantage. The Wolves went to their starters to stem the tide, but couldn’t handle Valanciunas down low, while the Grizzlies upped their defensive pressure. “In the fourth, we didn’t play defense,” Towns said. TIP-INS Grizzlies: After scoring 20-plus points in two straight games, Dillon Brooks was limited to nine on 4-of-15 shooting. … Valanciunas set season highs in points and rebounds. He had eight offensive boards. ... G John Konchar was questionable with a left ankle sprain but was active. Timberwolves: In his second game back from a hamstring injury, Josh Okogie returned to the starting lineup, with Jarrett Culver coming off the bench. It marked the seventh different starting lineup in 11 games for Minnesota this season. … F Jake Layman missed the game for personal reasons. … The Wolves had 13 turnovers to seven for Memphis. PLAYING THE PAINT Led by Valanciunas, the Grizzlies scored 80 points in the paint. “One thing we talk about is getting downhill, getting a piece of the paint in a variety of ways and with a variety of different players,” Jenkins said. “We’ve got a lot of guys that can really finish in the paint. That’s our M.O. and we know if we can do that, that eventually opens up more looks from the outside that we shoot with confidence.”","401267329"
"LeBron James can't be stopped from behind the arc as he's shooting with ease, draining back-to-back 3-pointers. (0:22) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — LeBron James scored 26 points and the Los Angeles Lakers routed the Oklahoma City Thunder 128-99 on Wednesday night for their franchise-record seventh straight road victory to start the season. “We just have a bunker mentality on the road — just us,"" James said. ""But obviously, it’s even more just us because of the restrictions, COVID, everything that’s going on. So we've come together even closer.” Montrezl Harrell added 21 points, and Anthony Davis had 18 points and seven rebounds. The defending champion Lakers have won four straight to improve to an NBA-best 10-3. They surpassed the 1985-86 squad with the 7-0 road start. But the road is different this season with mostly empty arenas. “It’s all about execution and your level of focus,” James said. “You’ve got to be able to at times build up your own energy. Like tonight, we come off a back-to-back, three in four nights. For us to come off a back-to-back -- in Houston last night, getting in late to OKC and coming out to an arena with no fans — you’ve got to prosper your own energy from your group, yourself.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 17 points to lead Oklahoma City. The Lakers led by 24 in the second quarter before the Thunder cut it to 58-46 at halftime. James scored 15 points in the half. James hit a 3-pointer with Thunder defensive stopper Lu Dort in his face, then made a 3-pointer and was fouled by Isaiah Roby on the next possession. The free throw gave the Lakers a 74-50 lead. On the Lakers’ next possession, James made a layup to give him nine points in 66 seconds. James made 4 of 6 shots and scored 11 points in the third quarter to help the Lakers take a 93-71 lead. The Lakers’ biggest lead was 31 points in the fourth quarter. The Thunder never led. “It's one of 72 games, and they're all opportunities,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “They're all opportunities to compete and they're opportunities to learn, and we've just got to continue to use every experience to continue to grow and move forward.” TIP-INS Lakers: James extended his streak of games with at least 10 points to 1,008. ...

"Paul George gets the shot off and beats the halftime buzzer to extend the Clippers' lead. (0:28) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 28 points, Paul George added 27 and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans 111-106 on Wednesday night. The Pelicans were missing starters Zion Williamson, Lonzo Ball and Eric Bledsoe. Together, they account for 46.1 points and 15.6 rebounds per game. New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said Williamson was ruled out because of inconclusive test results. Nickeil Alexander-Walker led the Pelicans with 37 points and eight rebounds, both career highs in his first start of the season. “Walker really kept them in the game,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “He made 3s, layups and in-between layups. He pretty much got everything he wanted.” But the Pelicans didn’t get much production out of two other first-time starters. Josh Hart finished with six points, and former Clipper Sindarius Thornwell was scoreless. Brandon Ingram’s jumper drew the Pelicans within four, the closest they came in the fourth quarter. From there, Leonard and George combined to score 16 consecutive points. Leonard’s 3-pointer that restored the Clippers’ lead to double digits had team owner Steve Ballmer whipping his right arm in the air from his seat next to the basket. Leonard finished with nine assists. The Clippers saw their 12-point lead reduced to five in the closing minutes. “It just comes down to us putting the game away when we need to,” George said. “We’re really good in the first and second quarters. In the third and fourth is where we need to clean up and buckle down. That’s going to come.” Alexander-Walker scored nine points in a row for the Pelicans, but he couldn't singlehandedly outduel the Clippers' two stars. “Early on, I tried to let it come to me,” Alexander-Walker said. “As the flow of the game went on, I was just kind of riding its wave and figuring out where to assert myself.” Ingram added 22 points with the Clippers' defense focused on him. Jaxon Hayes grabbed 10 rebounds for the Pelicans, who dropped their fourth in a row. They hadn't played since losing at Charlotte last Friday. Their game at Dallas on Monday was postponed, delaying the start of what was scheduled as a seven-game trip. The Clippers rode a dominant second quarter, in which they outscored the Pelicans 33-15, to an 18-point lead on George's 3 that beat the halftime buzzer. Los Angeles maintained a double-digit lead in the third, when George didn't score and Leonard had six points. TIP-INS Pelicans: Bledsoe sat out with right eye irritation and Ball has bilateral knee tendinopathy. Clippers: Lou Williams missed the second half after experiencing hip soreness. ... George had at least 25 points and five assists for the third straight game, tying the longest such streak of his career. ...

"After grabbing his own missed shot, CJ McCollum sneaks a no-look pass to Enes Kanter for an easy bucket. (0:21) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Damian Lillard scored eight of his season-high 40 points in the final four minutes, and the Portland Trail Blazers tied a franchise record with 23 3-pointers to beat the Sacramento Kings 132-126 on Wednesday night for their fourth straight victory. Lillard and CJ McCollum led Portland’s shooting barrage from behind the arc with six 3s apiece. Lillard added 13 assists without a turnover, while McCollum had 28 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. Jusuf Nurkic had a season-best 18 points and 13 rebounds. “I liked the way we kept our focus,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “Sacramento was hot all night. More than anything else, I like how we fought back after things weren’t going our way in the third quarter.” The Blazers trailed by 20 midway through the second and were down 105-100 going into the fourth before rallying to win their second consecutive game against the Kings in five days. Portland won 125-99 on Saturday. Nurkic had 10 points in the fourth period but it was Lillard who came up big down the stretch. He made four free throws and a pair of driving layups as the Blazers outscored the Kings 16-9. De’Aaron Fox had 29 points, six assists and six rebounds for Sacramento. Buddy Hield scored 26, and first-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton added 17 points and nine assists. The Kings have lost six of eight. This one was particularly painful after they blew big leads of 58-38 and 94-75. “That’s the NBA. The elite teams find ways to finish those off and that’s what we’re building toward. We’re not there yet,"" Kings coach Luke Walton said. ""Down the stretch Dame and CJ hit some big shots.” Portland tied a team record for 3s set last year in the bubble. The Blazers shot 23 for 48 from deep but missed their final four attempts at breaking the mark. “Coach has been emphasizing we need to get more 3s up,” Lillard said. “We continued to penetrate and pitch and take those open shots. It really helped us that we were getting high-quality looks. We didn’t pass any of them up. We took them and kept firing.” The Kings led by 20 early in the second quarter following back-to-back buckets from Marvin Bagley III. Portland responded with a flurry of 3s, making four straight as part of a 20-4 run. After Derrick Jones Jr. dunked off an offensive rebound and Fox missed one of two free throws, McCollum made another 3 to pull Portland to 68-65. BLAME CJ It was the first time Lillard and McCollum both had 10 or more assists in the same game as teammates. “A lot of guys made shots tonight, too, so that helped,” McCollum said. “I don’t get 10 assists very often so that’s probably why we both haven’t done it.” DIFFERENCE MAKER Richaun Holmes sat out with left ankle soreness when Sacramento lost to Portland last Saturday, the only game the 6-foot-10 center has missed this season. Holmes was back in the lineup Wednesday and gave the Kings a big lift inside with 17 points, nine rebounds and six assists. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard is seven field goals shy of becoming the third player in franchise history to reach 5,000 for his career. Clyde Drexler (6,889) and LaMarcus Aldridge (5,121) are the others. … Nurkic was questionable before the game with a quad injury.

"Joel Embiid trolls the Heat with fake timeout calls after Tobias Harris throws down a dunk on the fast break. (0:18) PHILADELPHIA -- — Ben Simmons called trade rumors part of the NBA. With another triple-double, he showed why he's coveted around the league — and needed in Philly. Simmons had 10 points, 10 assists and 12 rebounds and Shake Milton returned from COVID-related issues and scored 31 points and lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 125-108 win over the Miami Heat on Thursday night. “There’s far worse things going on in the world,” Simmons said of recent trade talk. ""If you tell me I’ll never play the game again, that would be a different story.” The Sixers swept the two-game home set against a Heat team that continues to play with a depleted roster because of issues related to the virus outbreak. Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic sat out, and the Heat were roughed up early by Milton, Tyrese Maxey and Tobias Harris. Consider, the 76ers led 73-58 at the break — with only nine combined points from All-Stars Joel Embiid and Simmons. Embiid has emerged early as one of the top players in the NBA, and a 45-point, 16-rebound game Tuesday against the Heat was one of his best. He had only nine points on Thursday, but was barely needed. Duncan Robinson led the Heat with 22 points and Gabe Vincent had 21. “I don’t want to hear anything about fatigue,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Philly just outplayed us.” Simmons had his 30th career triple-double a day after he was dangled as trade bait to Houston in a potential deal for James Harden. Harden landed in Brooklyn in a trade that not only made the Nets the new favorites to win the Eastern Conference, it could ruffle the relationship between Simmons and the franchise that made him the No. 1 pick of the 2016 draft. Coach Doc Rivers talked it out with Simmons after trade rumors swirled earlier this season. Rivers and Simmons had a brief chat at shootaround, leaving the new Sixers coach to say everything was fine. “This is a business. Things like that happen,” Simmons said. ""The only thing I can control is how I approach my workouts, the games, and my day to day things. I’m just trying to be professional and do the right thing and help my team get wins.” The Sixers rolled early with the best record in the NBA until COVID issues sent them on a three-game losing streak -- including a loss last week when they had just seven players against Denver -- but have returned to form as more players returned to the active roster. Milton and Matisse Thybulle returned off the bench after a three-game break and Harris, who had 18 points, was back in the starting lineup. Only starting guard Seth Curry, who tested positive last week for coronavirus, remained sidelined against the Heat. The combination is good enough for Rivers. “I said it before, I like our team,” he said. “I like today after the trade that we are the same team.” Milton sank all three 3s and scored 19 points in the half and Maxey, a first-round pick out of Kentucky, continues to shine with his enthusiasm and floaters that made him an instant fan favorite. Sixers fans on social media were seemingly more outraged when Maxey, who scored 15 points, was rumored as part of a Harden deal more than how they felt about Simmons possibly leaving town. “As long as I’m here, I’m going to try to make Ben a better player,” Rivers said. “And to me, that is the most important part of our relationship.” EMBIID AND SIMMONS Embiid had a brief scare when he went up for a basket and slammed his head on the court when he was fouled by Chris Silva. Embiid came up holding the back of his head after the non-shooting foul. Sixers were yelling “He shot the ball! He shot it!” at the refs, to no avail. No worries, the Sixers kept possession and Maxey connected on an alley-oop to Simmons for a 61-47 lead. TIP-INS Heat: F/C Meyers Leonard sat out with a strained left shoulder. ... G Tyler Herro left the game early with back spasms. 76ers: F Mike Scott left in the first half with a sore right knee. ... Milton was 11 of 15 from the floor with seven assists. ...

(1:09) SAN ANTONIO -- — Houston’s first game without James Harden went better than anyone could have expected. Christian Wood had 27 points and 15 rebounds, and the Rockets rallied to beat the San Antonio Spurs 109-105 on Thursday night in their first game since trading away the franchise cornerstone. “It was fun. It was really cool stuff,” Houston’s first-year coach Stephen Silas said. Sterling Brown, who took Harden’s spot in the starting lineup, had 23 points, seven rebounds and three assists in 36 minutes. Jae’Sean Tate added 13 points, 10 assists and five rebounds. San Antonio forward Keldon Johnson had a career-high 29 points and Lonnie Walker IV added 16 points while tying a career-high with four 3-pointers. Houston sent Harden to the Brooklyn Nets in a four-team blockbuster trade on Wednesday. Victor Oladipo, Dante Exum and Rodions Kurucs, who the Rockets acquired along with numerous draft picks and draft swaps for Harden, are not with the team yet. It was Houston’s first game without Harden since 2012, when Oklahoma City traded its young guard to the Rockets primarily due to salary cap constraints. Harden remained publicly quiet through months of rumors about his unhappiness with the Rockets, but he broke that silence following a second blowout loss to the Lakers on Tuesday. He bluntly said the Rockets were “just not good enough” and that he did not believe the situation could be fixed. Houston showed otherwise, at least in their first opportunity to do so. “We had a team meeting after that last game against the Lakers and we drew the line there,” Tate said. “Everybody has so much to prove.” The Rockets were also without John Wall and Eric Gordon due to injuries. The upheaval led to more minutes for the remaining roster, and they took advantage of it. “Spirit is something I believe a lot in and talk a lot about,” Silas said. “We had spirit tonight.” Seven players scored at least nine points, with Mason Jones scoring a career-high nine points. The Rockets staged a 15-2 run to lead 105-101 with 1:46 left. “It’s got nothing to do with defense (or) offense,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of the late swoon. “It has to do with between the ears and being ready to play. And we had four or five guys who were out to lunch.” Brown had a wild, overhead shot land on the top of the backboard for an out-of-bounds call with 9.5 seconds remaining. San Antonio veteran DeMar DeRozan missed a 15-footer with 0.4 seconds left, and the Spurs fouled P.J. Tucker, who made two free throws to seal it. DeRozan had 13 points, seven assists and six rebounds in his return from a two-game absence due to personal reasons. The teams meet again Saturday at the AT&amp;T Center in the finale of a two-game set in San Antonio. TIP-INS Rockets: Wall missed the game with a sore left knee. ... Gordon was running and shooting 3-pointers prior to game but was ruled out due to tightness in his lower left leg. ... Wood was held to five points in the second quarter, shooting 2 for 7, after collecting 10 points in the opening quarter. Spurs: San Antonio is 6-3 with LaMarcus Aldridge in the lineup. The Spurs lost all three games Aldridge sat out with a sore left knee. He had 11 points Thursday. ... Walker has made 25 of 48 3-pointers in 12 games this season after going 41 of 101 to set career highs last season. He is shooting 40% on 3s in his career. ... Johnson has scored at 25 points twice this season, which is the fourth most through first 30 career games in Spurs’ history. David Robinson leads the list with 12.","401267336"
"Steph Curry scores 35 points on 14-of-23 shooting and grabs 11 rebounds as the Warriors face off against the Nuggets. (2:15) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic scored 18 of his 23 points in the second half to help Denver overcome Stephen Curry's sharp shooting as the Nuggets held off the Golden State Warriors 114-104 on Thursday night. Jokic also had 14 rebounds and 10 assists for his 46th career triple-double. The big man entered averaging a triple-double and leading the NBA in assists. “I think he’d definitely be in the MVP conversation, which is entirely too early to talk about,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “That’s the kind of impact he’s had on the game every single night."" Will Barton and Jamal Murray each added 17 points on a night when seven Nuggets scored in double figures. Curry finished with 35 points on 14-of-23 shooting. He hit five 3-pointers to give him 2,545 for his career. Curry is 15 from tying Reggie Miller for second place on the league's all-time list. Miller eagerly counted down Curry’s made 3s throughout the TNT broadcast. Ray Allen is first with 2,973. “Even though he had 35, we made some things tough for him,"" Malone said. ""We were able to get some stops.” Limited to four shots in the first half, a more aggressive Jokic took over in the third quarter and helped the Nuggets amass a 14-point advantage. But no lead is safe with Curry &amp; Co. around. The Warriors kept things interesting down the stretch. One of Jokic's biggest plays was a steal and assist on Monte Morris' basket with 5:11 remaining that allowed Denver to extend the lead back to 14. “It’s just a matter of our team connecting and figuring out who we are and what we are,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “We’re not really in sync yet. That’s going to take time.” There was a little bit of everything in the first half, when Denver led by as many as 17. Leading the list were a flying dunk by Bol Bol, Jokic's reverse slam on Warriors rookie James Wiseman and a four-point play from Curry. “We’ve got to be better,” Curry said of the defensive effort. “It doesn’t matter what the adjective is. We’ve got to be better.” TIP-INS Warriors: Curry played in his 711th regular-season game, tying him with Al Attles for No. 5 on Golden State’s career list. ... Curry had 11 rebounds and seven turnovers. ... Wiseman had 18 points and Andrew Wiggins added 16. Nuggets: G Gary Harris missed a second straight game for personal reasons. ... F Michael Porter Jr. remains out because of COVID-19 health and safety protocols. ... Denver reserve JaMychal Green had 15 points. MURRAY'S BOARDS Murray had nine rebounds against Golden State. He had just one total rebound on Denver's recent three-game trip. “I told Jamal that can’t be,” Malone said. “He responded in a big way.” PRACTICE, PRACTICE Kerr definitely can’t wait for this — back-to-back practice sessions. The Warriors haven’t had that since training camp. The extra training days opened up after their scheduled game with Phoenix on Friday was postponed because of contact-tracing issues with the Suns. Now, the plan is for the Warriors to fly home, rest and then hold two straight workouts. “This should be a good stretch for us,” Kerr said. PASCHALL RETURNS Warriors forward Eric Paschall returned following a one-game absence necessitated by a false positive coronavirus test and had eight points. He quarantined for 24 hours and missed a 104-95 loss Tuesday night to Indiana that wrapped up the Warriors’ 4-3 homestand, their longest of the season. Paschall’s next test was negative. “I’m good now,” he said. QUOATBLE Malone on defending Curry's deep shots: “I told them, ‘Guys, listen, when he makes his shots, don’t look over at me and say I played good defense when you didn’t,’” Malone said. “This guy is other-worldly, in terms of his talent and shooting ability. You have to guard him with that in mind.”","401267337"
"Myles Turner meets Jusuf Nurkic at the rim and denies him entry. (0:22) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — The Indiana Pacers figured if they slowed down Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, they'd have a good chance against the Portland Trail Blazers. The tactic worked. Domantas Sabonis had 23 points and 15 rebounds, and Indiana held Portland's dynamic backcourt duo in check for a 111-87 victory Thursday night. Malcolm Brogdon added 25 points and seven assists for the Pacers, who improved to 4-1 on the road this season and snapped an 11-game losing streak in Portland. Indiana led by 25 in the second quarter and maintained a double-digit advantage the rest of the way. McCollum and Lillard each scored 22 for the Blazers, playing the second of a back-to-back. “We talked about it as a team before the game — we've got to keep the ball out of Lillard and McCollum’s hands as much as we can and try to make them really work for everything they get,” Indiana's Doug McDermott said. The loss was costly for Portland: During the third quarter, center Jusuf Nurkic left the court holding his right wrist and the Blazers later announced he had sustained a fracture. The Trail Blazers (7-5) won in Sacramento 132-126 on Wednesday night. Lillard had a season-high 40 points in that one and Portland tied a franchise record with 23 3-pointers. The Blazers lead the NBA in 3s but they were off against the Pacers, making just 13 of 43 (30.2%). The Pacers (8-4) were coming off a 104-95 road victory over the Warriors on Tuesday night, when Myles Turner had a season-best 22 points. He finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds against the Blazers, along with four blocks. The Pacers traded Victor Oladipo to the Rockets as part of the four-team blockbuster Thursday that sent James Harden from Houston to Brooklyn. Indiana got guard Caris LeVert from the Nets and a draft pick in the deal. “We lost a very good player, but this team is going to play very good ball,” Brogdon said. Indiana led by six in the opening quarter, but the score was tied at 26 going into the second. A 12-0 run capped by McDermott's layup put the Pacers up 40-28. Indiana extended its lead to 25 before going into halftime up 59-36. The Pacers outscored the Blazers 33-10 in the second period. Portland was hurt in the third when Nurkic headed to the locker room after appearing to injure his right hand. The Blazers announced he fractured his wrist, but additional details were not available. Lillard was asked how Nurkic was doing after the game. “Frustrated. Disappointed. A little sad,” Lillard said. “Like anybody would be in that situation.” But the Blazers chipped away at Indiana's lead, pulling to 82-71 late in the third on Carmelo Anthony's 3-pointer. “I thought Myles and Domas — their aggressive mentality in all the actions, ball screens and pin downs — our guys did a great job of communicating and backing each other up,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. TIP-INS Pacers: Sabonis has 107 double-doubles with the Pacers, one shy of tying Roy Hibbert for seventh in team history. ... The Pacers hadn't won in Portland since 2007. ... T.J. McConnell returned after missing three games because of the birth of his son. Trail Blazers: Portland's 10 points in the second quarter were a season low. ... McCollum, who is from Ohio, punctuated his postgame chat with reporters by exclaiming, “Go Browns!” Cleveland plays the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL playoffs on Sunday.","401267338"
"Tacko Fall lines up with his foot on the 3-point line, banks the shot in and the Celtics bench goes berserk. (0:20) BOSTON -- — Jaylen Brown had 21 points and eight assists, Semi Ojeleye added 18 points and the Boston Celtics rolled to an 124-97 win over the Orlando Magic on Friday night in their return to action following a virus-related week-long hiatus. Jeff Teague finished with 17 points and rookie Payton Pritchard had 16 points to help Boston post its fifth straight victory. Boston returned to action after having three games postponed due to some players testing positive for the coronavirus and others being ruled out because contact tracing showed that they could have been exposed to it. “It’s hectic, A whirlwind tornado you might call it,"" Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. But the Celtics didn’t seem to be affected by the layoff, sharing the ball and turning stops into opportunities to run the floor against an Orlando team that struggled to find a rhythm at both ends. “It felt good. Obviously this COVID and this pandemic has affected not just us but every team in this league. Everyone is doing the best they can to cope with it and handle it,"" Smart said. ""The way that we played, with the pace and everything, that was the key for us."" Aaron Gordon had 17 points to lead the Magic, who have lost four straight. Nik Vucevic, Dwayne Bacon and Cole Anthony added 15 points apiece. Orlando had 13 turnovers that led to 16 Celtics' points. “The guys that are out right now, we’re very much challenged offensively,"" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. ""We can’t give possessions away.” The Celtics took an 88-72 advantage into the fourth quarter and opened the period with a 13-0 run to effectively put the game away. Jayson Tatum and Robert Williams remained in the NBA’s health and safety protocols Friday along with reserve guard Carsen Edwards. But the Celtics had 12 players available thanks to Brown, Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Javonte Green and Daniel Theis all being cleared to return. Magic center Mo Bamba didn’t travel with the team as a precaution while he goes through contact tracing, the latest roster hit to a team that has battled injuries throughout the season. Celtics coach Brad Stevens went deep into his bench to spread out minutes following the layoff. For the game, Boston held a 66-33 edge in bench scoring. “I thought, obviously, in one way our first wind would hit us pretty hard. But I also thought there’s the fresh advantage,"" he said. ""We were able to do that without anyone playing 28 minutes, which was good.” TIP-INS Magic: Were 3 for 12 from 3-point range in first half and finished 7 for 28 for the game. … Finished with 16 turnovers. Celtics: Went 17 of 42 from 3-point distance. … Led by as many as 14 in the first half and took a 60-48 lead into halftime. … Had no turnovers in the first quarter. NEW PROTOCOLS The NBA’s tightened safety protocols  were on display Friday with players being handed a mask along with the customary water and towel whenever they were subbed out.","401267340"
"Andre Drummond goes for 33 points and 23 rebounds in the Cavaliers' win vs. the Knicks. (2:00) CLEVELAND -- — Andre Drummond tied his career high with 33 points and grabbed 23 rebounds, and Cedi Osman scored 25 points in leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 106-103 win over the New York Knicks on Friday night. Drummond posted the Cavaliers’ first 30-20 game since Carlos Boozer had 32 points and 20 rebounds against Seattle on Jan. 20, 2004. He also had three assists, two blocks and two steals as Cleveland snapped a three-game losing streak. “I can’t speak enough about what Dre did, I thought he was awesome,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “He can punish you and when he plays with that determination and that force, there aren’t many people who can stop him one-on-one.” Julius Randle had 28 points and six assists, rookie Immanuel Quigley scored a season-high 23 points and R.J. Barrett had 20 points for New York, which lost its fifth in a row. The Knicks used a 16-0 run spanning the third and fourth quarters to go in front 84-80. Drummond, a 54% career foul shooter, made 13 of 19 free throws. He will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season and could be on the move sooner after Cleveland added center Jarrett Allen in a trade with Brooklyn. “If I do get traded, I can’t control that,” said Drummond, who leads the NBA in rebounding for the fifth straight season. “I know that I love the guys that are here and I’m having a lot of fun. You have to play hard every night because they go all-out for 48 minutes.” Bickerstaff admitted that talk of a potential Drummond trade could be distracting to the Cavaliers. “The optics are obvious, but Dre and I have built a great relationship based on trust,” he said. “Dre knows his worth and you can obviously see what he’s capable of.” Osman and Drummond each made steals in the final 31 seconds, preventing New York from getting closer than three points at 102-99. Rookie Isaac Okoro sealed the win with two free throws, making it 105-101 with 7.3 seconds remaining. “Those turnovers were costly and we need to understand that the intensity in that part of the game is different,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “We’ll keep evaluating and finding the best combinations to move forward. Everything is on the table.” Allen and forward Taurean Prince — acquired from Brooklyn — were inactive because all players in the three-team deal involving James Harden have not taken their physicals. The Cavaliers remain without three starters in five-time All-Star forward Kevin Love (right calf strain) and guards Collin Sexton (left ankle sprain) and Darius Garland (right shoulder sprain). Cleveland took its largest lead at 80-68 in the third, but New York immediately answered with 16 straight points, capped by back-to-back buckets by Randle. Drummond posted 20 points and 14 rebounds in the first half for the initial time in his nine-year career, helping Cleveland take a 57-55 lead into the break. Knicks forward Reggie Bullock returned after missing two games with a sore right hip, scoring four points. LONG LAYOFF The Cavaliers’ next two games were postponed by the NBA because the Wizards do not have the minimum eight available players. Cleveland was slated to play in Washington on Sunday and Monday, which was already problematic because of heightened security in the nation’s capital. “The city of D.C. logistically would have been a nightmare,” Bickerstaff said. “When you add in the COVID factor, it’s definitely the right move not to play those games.” TIP-INS Knicks: G Frank Ntilikina (right knee sprain) missed his ninth straight game and will be “out a while longer,” according to Thibodeau. Ntilikina was injured Dec. 29 in Cleveland. ... G Alec Burks (left ankle sprain), who last played Dec. 27 against Milwaukee, has been upgraded to day to day. Thibodeau said Burks has advanced to conditioning and is getting close to returning. Cavaliers: F Kevin Porter Jr. (personal reasons) joined his teammates on the bench for the first time this season. The second-year pro remains in limbo after an offseason arrest in Eastern Ohio. ... Bickerstaff is excited to have Allen on his roster. “What excites me the most is Jarrett’s ability to impact the game at both ends of the floor without the ball in his hands,” he said.","401267341"
"Giannis Antetokounmpo pours in a game-high 31 points as the Bucks beat the Mavericks 112-109. (2:03) MILWAUKEE -- — Khris Middleton made a couple of huge 3-pointers and the Milwaukee Bucks overcame poor free-throw shooting to snap the Dallas Mavericks' four-game winning streak. Middleton scored eight points of his 25 points in the final 2 1/2 minutes of the Bucks' 112-109 victory Friday night. Middleton took over after James Johnson’s corner 3-pointer with 3:09 left put Dallas ahead 104-103 — the Mavericks’ first lead since the opening five minutes. “He’s just a great decision-maker,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “He knows to take what the defense gives him. If he’s got a shot, he’s an incredible shot-maker, but he’s an incredible playmaker. ... He’s just a great finisher.” Middleton's 3-pointer put the Bucks ahead for good at 106-105 with 2:21 left. Middleton hit another 3-pointer 34 seconds later to make it 109-105. He also hit a pair of free throws with 7.8 seconds remaining to finish with 25 points. Those free throws were particularly noteworthy on a night when nobody could connect consistently from the foul line. The Bucks were 12 of 25 on free throws, with Giannis Antetokounmpo going 1 of 10. Dallas was 6 of 13. “He's just got to keep working through the free-throw line, continue to put the time in, grow his confidence and step up and make them,” Budenholzer said. Antetokounmpo still scored 31 points as the Bucks won their fourth straight. Luka Doncic had 28 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds for Dallas, which also got 22 points from Tim Hardaway Jr. The Mavericks entered the night having won 11 of the last 14 regular-season meetings with the Bucks. Dallas also swept two preseason matchups in Milwaukee last month. Milwaukee went 0-2 against Dallas and 56-15 against the rest of the NBA during the 2019-20 regular season. Dallas had chances to win this one late as well after trailing by as many as 14 early, but Trey Burke and Kristaps Porzingis missed potential go-ahead 3-point shots in the final 21 seconds. Doncic appeared to want a timeout to be called once Dallas got the offensive rebound off Burke's miss. The Mavs instead worked the ball to Porzingis, who missed with 10.4 seconds left. “It’s very difficult to call a timeout and go against a Milwaukee set defense out of the timeout,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. Carlisle added that he thought the Mavericks got two good shots. “It's Coach's decision,” Doncic said. “If we would have made the shot, everything would have been good.” Jrue Holiday scored 16 points, and Lopez had 11 for the Bucks, with Bobby Portis adding eight points and 13 rebounds. Dallas got 15 points from Porzingis, 13 each from Burke and Johnson, as well as 11 from William Cauley-Stein. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas played without Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jalen Brunson, Dwight Powell and Maxi Kleber due to health and safety protocols amid the pandemic. This was the third straight games that Brunson, Finney-Smith and Richardson have missed. Powell and Kleber have been out for two games. Bucks: Reserve forward Torrey Craig was cleared to return to action, though he didn't enter Friday's game. Craig hasn't played since fracturing his nose Dec. 27. Craig said he’s suffered a similar injury twice before, the difference this time being that he underwent surgery for it. Craig doesn’t like wearing a mask because it reduces his peripheral vision and makes him feel hot but added that “I guess I’ll tolerate it for the next few weeks and see what happens.”","401267342"
"After trailing by 10 with two minutes to play in regulation, the Thunder rally late to beat the Bulls in overtime. (1:25) OKLAHOMA CITY -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a career-high 33 points and 10 assists to help Oklahoma City beat the Chicago Bulls and former Thunder coach Billy Donovan 127-125 in overtime Friday night. Oklahoma City rallied from 22 points down in the second half. Zach LaVine, who led the Bulls with 35 points, could have won it in overtime but he missed a deep, off-balance 3-pointer in the closing seconds. Donovan knew all too well how good Oklahoma City can be under challenging circumstances. His Thunder team made a habit of rallying and winning close games last season on the way to a surprising playoff berth. “Those guys are great competitors when they’re down,"" Donovan said. “They play all the way through. I knew even being up 18 at the half that they were going to fight their way through and have some kind of momentum push there.” First-year Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, an assistant under Donovan last season, didn't get caught up in the matchup with his mentor. “I have great respect, obviously, for him,"" Daigneault said. ""I love the guy. But I have a responsibility. It’s like when players play against guys that they were teammates with. Once the ball goes up in the air, we’ve got to do our jobs. At that point, it’s just another game. The relationship lies outside of the competition.” Lu Dort scored 21 for the Thunder, who claimed their first home win in six tries this season. Coby White had 22 points for the Bulls, who lost their fourth straight. The Bulls led 68-50 at halftime, but Daigneault could tell the Thunder hadn't given up. “Coming out of the half, the guys — I thought it came from them today,"" Daigneault said. ""They made a decision walking out of the half to not let go of the rope.” The Bulls led 78-56 early in the second half, but the Thunder responded with a 13-0 run to get back into the game. Dort scored 13 points in a span of 2:33 to help trim the deficit, and Oklahoma City got as close as two points in the period. Chicago took a 95-87 lead into the fourth quarter. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 12 points in the fourth to help force overtime. LaVine missed a contested 3 in the closing seconds that could have won it for Chicago. Lavine's 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds to play in overtime cut the Thunder lead to 126-125. Oklahoma City's George Hill was fouled with 5.2 seconds left. He missed the first free throw and made the second to set up LaVine's final attempt. “I thought our relentless spirit in the game was what stood out,"" Daigneault said. ""And even if we didn’t win it, we stood back up tonight, which is progress for us. It was a really good response from the guys, and it came from inside them.” TIP-INS Bulls: F Lauri Markkanen hadn't played since Dec. 29 because of COVID-19 protocols. He scored 16 points but shot just 5 of 14. ... Oklahoma City scored 19 points off Chicago's nine turnovers in the third quarter. Thunder: C Al Horford sat out for personal reasons.

"Donovan Mitchell tracks down the ball before it goes out of bounds and Rudy Gobert converts with a dunk on the other end. (0:23) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Trae Young was surrounded wherever he went, while Donovan Mitchell found himself alone on the perimeter time and time again. Mitchell made six 3-pointers on his way to 26 points and the Utah Jazz used a 21-0 run in the second half to power past the Atlanta Hawks 116-92 on Friday night for their fourth straight win. “The biggest thing tonight was the way we defended. We wanted to get stops and run,” Mitchell said after the Jazz scored 27 fast-break points. Following a brilliant performance in the NBA bubble last year, Mitchell started this season slowly but is becoming more efficient and effective. He’s making more than half his shots from both 2- and 3-point range over the last four games and averaging more than 28 points. “It’s easier when we keep breaking the paint and finding people open,” Mitchell said. Meanwhile, Young was held to four points on 1-for-11 shooting with seven assists as the Hawks dropped their fifth game in the last six. That scoring total was tied for Young’s lowest since entering the NBA, matching Nov. 13, 2018, against Golden State. “Everybody that guarded him, primarily Mike (Conley) and Royce (O’Neale), they were solid. The main thing we talked about was not fouling, showing our hands,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “Rudy (Gobert) and (Derrick) Favors were great as well, protecting the rim.” Young has shot less than 36% overall and 25% on 3s over the last seven games. “Denied him the entire game as much as they could. You know, challenged him to work. Probably frustrated him,” Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 17 points, Gobert had 15 points and 13 rebounds, and Jordan Clarkson scored all 16 of his points in the second half to boost the Jazz. “We have been emphasizing pushing the pace, playing fast and getting downhill,” Clarkson said. Cam Reddish scored 20 and Clint Capela had 16 points and 11 rebounds for Atlanta. Kevin Huerter’s jumper trimmed Utah’s lead to 82-74 late in the third quarter but the Jazz went on a 21-0 spree to break the game open over the next 4:42. Clarkson’s seven consecutive points and Georges Niang’s 3-pointer staked Utah to its largest lead at 103-74. “We pushed back tonight, being able to withstand their run when teams start to be physical, and we got past that, unlike what we did earlier in the year,” Mitchell said. Capela scored six straight points to cap an 11-0 spurt to start the second half that drew the Hawks to 61-57 after a 15-point halftime deficit, but they never got closer. The Jazz pressured Young from the opening tip and occasionally trapped him to get the ball out of his hands. Young didn’t score until midway through the second quarter and the Hawks struggled to find a rhythm as Utah jumped to an 18-4 lead. “Our mindset coming in was to be more aggressive. We wanted to take our defense to them and not let them dictate the dance,” Conley said. Utah lives by the 3 this season more than ever and saw its margin ebb and flow depending on its accuracy beyond the arc. Two of Utah’s franchise record-high games with 3-pointers made have come in the last four outings, and the Jazz hit 20 of them for the third time in four games. “Our defensive containment on the basketball was a point of emphasis, and we didn’t get it done tonight at all,” Pierce said. On the other side, Atlanta made its first 3 with 4:34 left until halftime. The Hawks finished 5 for 28 from long range. Utah, which allows 1,500 fans in person, hadn’t played at home since beating the Los Angeles Clippers on New Year’s Day but gave the crowd plenty of long-range fireworks. Both teams had an unexpected day off Wednesday because of virus protocols. The Hawks’ matchup with Phoenix was postponed and the Jazz ended their scheduled seven-game road trip one day early because Washington didn’t have the minimum of eight available players. Utah went 4-2 on the trip. TIP-INS Hawks: Onyeka Okongwu, the No. 6 pick in the 2020 NBA draft, made his professional debut after several weeks with left foot inflammation. He had four points and a highlight-reel follow jam. “I haven’t played a game since last year in February, so to get out there and play means the world to me,” he said. … Several times Pierce threw his arms in the air and dropped his head in disgust as the Jazz got a bevy of wide-open looks from 3-point range and the Hawks’ defense scrambled. … Kris Dunn, Danilo Gallinari and Bogdan Bogdanovic all missed the game with injuries. Jazz: Joe Ingles, who had the league’s longest active streak of consecutive games played, missed his third in the last four because of Achilles soreness. ... Mitchell set a team record for consecutive games with at least two 3s, now sitting at 16. … Gobert is riding a seven-game streak with double-digit rebounds.","401267346"
"LeBron James elevates above everyone to grab the Kyle Kuzma miss and slam home a one-handed putback dunk. (0:29) LOS ANGELES -- — LeBron James had 21 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds, and Anthony Davis added 17 points against his former team in the Los Angeles Lakers' fifth consecutive victory, 112-95 over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit four 3-pointers while scoring 16 points, and Montrezl Harrell also had 16 for the defending NBA champions. Los Angeles fell behind by 15 points early, but rallied ferociously in its first game back at Staples Center after a perfect three-game trip. “We just settled in,” James said. “That first game after a road trip is always kind of difficult, but we got some stops and got back to playing our kind of basketball.” The Lakers remained unbeaten in five meetings with the Pelicans since the franchise-altering trade in July 2019 that sent Davis to LA and three starters to New Orleans. Davis averaged 36 points and 12 rebounds in his three reunions with the Pelicans last season, but he took a complementary role this time in another impressive team win led by James. Seven Lakers scored at least nine points, and LA committed a season-low eight turnovers while forcing 20. “We’ve been locking in defensively,” Davis said. “We had a slow start tonight, but we’ve been doing it on the defensive end. We want to keep that edge. We want to keep that mindset of being scrappy, being physical.” Brandon Ingram scored 17 of his 20 points in the first half against his former team for the Pelicans, who have lost five straight. Zion Williamson had 21 points and 12 rebounds after missing Wednesday's game against the Clippers due to the NBA's health and safety protocols, but New Orleans blew an early 15-point lead on its third stop on a seven-game trip. “There was a lot I wasn’t happy with, but over the last 30 minutes of that game, they were the far better team,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We played a good first 18 minutes, and then they turned up the defense and just dominated us at both ends after that.” Dennis Schröder had 12 points while sparking the Lakers with his aggressive defense, and Kyle Kuzma added 11 points and a season-high 13 rebounds. TIP-INS Pelicans: Lonzo Ball missed his LA homecoming with knee tendinitis. ... Eric Bledsoe scored seven points after being questionable with right eye irritation. ... JJ Redick converted a four-point play in the first quarter. Lakers: They've won 28 straight when holding their opponent under 100 points. ... Davis played despite lower back tightness. ... Alex Caruso had another outstanding two-way game, hitting three straight 3-pointers, adding four assists and posting a plus-28 in 18 minutes of play. GAME-CHANGER Los Angeles broke away with a 15-0 run late in the third quarter while forcing eight straight misses and three turnovers by New Orleans. All told, the Lakers made a 42-15 run in 15 minutes after trailing 70-67 late in the third. The Pelicans only scored 37 points in the second half.","401267347"
"Paul George knows he needed to get back to MVP form, especially after how last season ended for him. (1:24) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Kawhi Leonard had 27 points and six assists in three quarters, Paul George scored 26 and the short-handed Los Angeles Clippers manhandled the Sacramento Kings 138-100 on Friday night. The Clippers have won 15 consecutive road games against the Kings. Los Angeles hasn’t lost in Sacramento since March 19, 2013. The 138 points were the most the Clippers had scored since putting up 150 against Washington on Dec. 1, 2019, although coach Tyronn Lue seemed more pleased with his team’s defense. “We challenged our guys to be better defensively,” Lue said. “I thought we played the right way throughout the course of the game. The whole 48 minutes we played the game the right way and that was good to see.” Playing without guards Patrick Beverley (personal reasons) and Lou Williams (sore left hip), the Clippers led by eight at halftime and then broke the game open in the third quarter when they outscored the Kings 37-16. Leonard had 11 points during the blitz, including a jarring, one-handed dunk over Cory Joseph as part of a 17-2 run. Leonard sat out the fourth period as Lue emptied his bench. Los Angeles’ backups came up big all game to ease the absences of Beverley and Williams. Reggie Jackson started in place of Beverley and had 11 points, three assists and four rebounds. Marcus Morris scored a season-high 18 points, Terance Mann had a season-best 13 points and nine rebounds, and Luke Kennard scored 14. “Pat and Lou are a big part of our team. Missing them is definitely a lot, but we got other guys to step up,” Morris said. “T-Mann stepped up and Reggie stepped up. Kudos to them for staying ready and being ready when their number’s called.” Marvin Bagley III had 20 points and five rebounds for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes added 17 points and five rebounds. “That team just came and pushed us around,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “We have to understand as a group we have to be able to guard people and rebound when we get stops. Right now that’s something we have to figure out. It was evident tonight. They got what they wanted.” Serge Ibaka followed Leonard’s bucket with a backdoor feed to Kennard, and Mann’s dunk made it 99-69. Two nights after allowing Portland to match a franchise record for 3-pointers, Sacramento again struggled with its perimeter defense. The Clippers made seven 3s in the second quarter — three from George and four by Morris, one more than his previous season high. They finished 18 of 35 beyond the arc. MOVE IT, MOVE IT Lue lauded his team’s unselfishness as being key. Los Angeles had 29 assists, the sixth time this season the Clippers have had 28 or more. “When the ball’s hopping like that, everybody’s a part of it,” Lue said. MLK TRIBUTE In a nod to Martin Luther King Day on Monday, players for both teams wore black T-shirts with the phrase, “Now is the time to make justice a reality for all” on the front and “Honor King” on the back. TIP-INS Clippers: Morris shot 7 of 12 from the floor. … Williams sat out after playing nine minutes against New Orleans on Wednesday and not at all in the second half. Kings: With Hassan Whiteside nursing a sore hip, Chimezie Metu’s playing time has picked up as the backup center. A second-round pick of the Spurs in 2018 who is on a two-way contract with Sacramento, Metu played in back-to-back games for the first time this season and matched his career high of 10 points while pulling down eight rebounds.","401267348"
"Mason Jones finds a way to score the off-balanced bucket and draws the foul. (0:19) SAN ANTONIO -- — San Antonio couldn't match the intensity of the short-handed Houston Rockets for three quarters, yet a strong finish by the Spurs was enough to snap a four-game home losing streak. DeMar DeRozan scored 24 points, Dejounte Murray had 18 points and 10 rebounds and San Antonio rallied to beat an eight-man Houston squad 103-91 on Saturday. “We played our best defense in the fourth quarter,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “Which is a good idea.” After a lethargic effort in losing to Houston on Thursday, San Antonio crept along for three quarters in a rare afternoon start. Murray had seven points in the fourth quarter, including a breakaway dunk that put San Antonio up 97-85 with 3:18 remaining after stripping Mason Jones of the ball at midcourt. “We just fought hard,” Murray said. “We came in with the same game plan, but I think we started off real slow. We picked it up. The effort was there in the fourth quarter. We just stuck with it and won the game.” Houston center Christian Wood had 24 points and 17 rebounds, and Jones had a season-high 24 points in his first career start. Ben McLemore had a season-high 21 points on 4-for-7 shooting from 3-point range. No other player had more than seven points for the Rockets. Playing just its second game since trading away disgruntled star James Harden, Houston was on the brink of not having eight players available as required by the league. The Rockets only had seven healthy players after Sterling Brown was ruled out due to a lower leg injury, but Rodions Kurucs became eligible an hour prior to tipoff when the NBA approved the blockbuster trade involving Harden. Houston acquired Kurucs, Victor Oladipo and Dante Exum, along with several draft picks and draft swaps for the disgruntled Harden on Wednesday. Oladipo and Exum were not with the team, and the Rockets were without John Wall, Eric Gordon, Demarcus Cousins, Brown and three others due to injuries. Despite being short-handed, the Rockets had a 10-point lead in the first half. Houston built the advantage on 3-point shooting and finished 12 for 32 from long range. “The effort from the beginning of the game was not what we would have liked or what we could have hoped for, especially after the last game,” Mills said. “But lot of credit goes to them. Their intensity and ability to drive.” The Spurs were able to dominate the paint, with Jakob Poeltl finishing with 13 points and 11 rebounds. “We just focused in the fourth quarter, we really locked in and didn’t want them to get into the paint,” Poeltl said. TIP-INS Rockets: Brown was ruled out about an hour prior to game time. He had 23 points, seven rebounds and three assists in 36 minutes during Houston’s 109-103 victory on Thursday. … Wood entered the game averaging 23.1 points and 10.1 rebounds. He has had at least 20 points in nine of his past 10 games. … Kurucs’ first attempt and basket came when he broke to the rim for a layup off a behind-the-back pass from Wood with 5:41 left in the first quarter. Spurs: Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon remains out, along with reserve center Drew Eubanks, due to the league’s health and safety protocols. ... DeRozan was assessed a technical foul four minutes into the second quarter after punching the ball out of bounds after making a layup. DeRozan was upset no foul was called on Tucker, who defended him on the layup.","401267349"
"James Harden gets up shots before his first game with the Nets. (0:20) NEW YORK -- — James Harden and Kevin Durant needed a little while to remember how to play together again. Once they did, the Brooklyn Nets really got rolling — and they might still get to another gear when Kyrie Irving rejoins them. “The sooner we can be on the court together, it's going to be scary hours,” Harden said. They look pretty fearsome already. Harden delivered 32 points and a triple-double in his Brooklyn debut, Durant scored a season-high 42 points in his first game back with his former teammate, and the Nets showed off their potent potential in a 122-115 victory over the Orlando Magic on Saturday night. Harden had 14 assists and 12 rebounds after being cleared to play earlier in the afternoon after all the players in the blockbuster trade that brought him from Houston had completed their physicals. Harden also had nine turnovers and Durant had six, with some sloppiness while Harden got used to his new teammates. “Early on I felt like we all were overpassing, trying to make everybody comfortable,” Durant said, “and then he just got into his mode of being aggressive to score and that opened up the whole game for others.” Harden had no practice time with the Nets and sure didn't need it, becoming the first player in franchise history to have a triple-double in his debut. Durant made five 3-pointers in his 10th game back following an 18-month layoff after rupturing his Achilles tendon in the 2019 NBA Finals. He hiked his average to 30.7 points, which would be his highest since he scored a league-leading 32 per game and won NBA MVP honors for Oklahoma City in 2014. That was a couple years after he and Harden helped lead the Thunder to the NBA Finals and their new pairing could have similar possibilities. The Nets might still reach another level when they get back Irving, who missed his sixth straight game after leaving the team last week for personal reasons. “I think it’s going to be an adjustment for everyone, but it’s an incredible problem to have and something I think we’ll relish trying to decipher,” coach Steve Nash said. Nikola Vucevic had 34 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists for the short-handed Magic, who lost their fifth straight. They were much more competitive than the others, including a 124-97 loss in Boston on Friday, but didn't have enough answers for Durant or Harden. “I mean, they’re whatever, they're, two of the four, five best offensive players in the world,” coach Steve Clifford said. Harden didn't score until making a pair of free throws with 6.8 seconds left in the first quarter and didn't make his first basket until a layup with 10:07 remaining in the half. But his playmaking was on track from the start, pushing up the floor to find teammates rather than often dribbling down the shot clock in Houston. He got his shot going during an 11-point third quarter, capping it with a deep 3-pointer just before the buzzer to give Brooklyn an 84-83 lead. TIP-INS Magic: Clifford successfully challenged a foul called on the Magic with 8.6 seconds left and his team trailing by seven. He improved to 5 for 5 on coach's challenges this season. ... Terrence Ross scored 23 points. Rookie Cole Anthony tied his season high with 16. Nets: Durant has scored 25 or points in nine straight games, setting a new franchise record. ... Nash said F/C Nicolas Claxton, who has been out all season with a right knee injury, likely wouldn't return until later in the first half of the season, probably in February. CLOSING IN ON KYRIE? Nash said Irving was hopefully close to returning, but said no date has ben determined. He wants the point guard to have proper time to ramp up his activities accordingly following his layoff. He said Irving has been working out on is own and could do so with a group of players Sunday during a day off.","401267350"

"Jerami Grant does it all, blocking a shot on defense and then weaving through Heat defenders to score. (0:17) MIAMI -- — The Detroit Pistons had their most dominant quarter in nearly two years. And last season’s NBA Finals trip for the Miami Heat suddenly seems long ago. Jerami Grant scored 24 points, Derrick Rose had 23 off the bench and the Pistons — the team with the NBA’s worst record — came into Miami and beat the Heat 120-100 on Saturday night, sending the reigning Eastern Conference champions to a third consecutive loss. The teams meet again Monday in Miami. “I definitely think it was the most complete game we played so far,"" Grant said. Blake Griffin scored 15 for Detroit, which outscored Miami 38-19 in the third quarter. It was the biggest margin the Pistons outscored an opponent by in their last 331 quarters, going back to April 9, 2019. Bam Adebayo scored 28 points for Miami, which got 22 from Duncan Robinson, 16 from KZ Okpala and 12 from Goran Dragic. “We didn't play to ... the Miami Heat culture that we represent,"" Adebayo said. “I feel like we're letting not only us and our teammates down, but the staff, we're letting this organization down, the fans down. We're built on the culture. The culture is take a bunch of guys, counted out, overlooked, and you figure it out. Right now, we're not doing it."" Miami was without Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley (both coronavirus-related), Tyler Herro (neck spasms) and Meyers Leonard (shoulder). The Heat got six players back — including Adebayo, Okpala and Dragic — from the NBA’s health and safety protocols list after satisfying quarantines mandated after contact tracing showed they may be exposed. “These are the circumstances,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “It's not just for us. There are a lot of teams going through it."" The Pistons got a reminder of the virus-dominated world postgame. Moments after going into the locker room for what should have been a few minutes of joy, they got told to go for an extra round of testing — so they came back out, went across the court into a far corner of the arena to get those done. The Heat also were tested postgame. Those moves came after a week where the NBA postponed 12 games for virus-related reasons and put in tougher protocols with hopes of keeping players and coaches safer. “It's part of our new NBA,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “The only thing you can count on are the unusual things that happen during the day. ... It's not just about basketball. It's about lives."" The Pistons led by as many as 23, their biggest lead this season. Miami has trailed by at least 23 points in four of its first 11 games; that happened in four of 73 Heat regular-season games last season. Isaiah Stewart had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Pistons. TIP-INS Pistons: Rose returned after missing Detroit’s last two games with left knee soreness. ... Before Saturday, Detroit’s last quarter that was won by 19 or more was the fourth against Memphis in the next-to-last game of the 2018-19 season. The Pistons outscored the Grizzlies 36-14. Heat: Robinson got credited for what officially is his fifth career dunk, the first that happened at AmericanAirlines Arena. ... Okpala got his first NBA start. STRUGGLING HEAT Miami, which has used eight starting lineups in 11 games, is 4-7. Only seven of the team’s 33 seasons have started worse. MIAMI TIES The Pistons have plenty of Miami ties. They started former Heat guard Wayne Ellington, had Delon Wright — brother of Dorell Wright, a 2006 NBA champion with the Heat — come off the bench and have former Heat guard Rodney McGruder on the roster as well. Plus, rookie Saddiq Bey nearly signed with the Miami Hurricanes before choosing Villanova.","401267352"
"Ja Morant shows he's back to top form, making athletic plays throughout the game as he scores 17 points in the Grizzlies' 106-104 win over the 76ers. (1:50) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Ja Morant returned to the Memphis lineup after missing eight games with an ankle injury and scored 17 points, leading the Grizzlies to a 106-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. Morant, who sprained his left ankle Dec. 28 at Brooklyn, added six assists. Rookie Xavier Tillman added 15 points and Grayson Allen had 12 as the Grizzlies won their fourth straight game. “It felt good, starting with just being able to get back out there on the floor after being out almost three weeks,” Morant said. “I was really just itching to get back out there.” Shake Milton, who had 31 points in the Sixers win over Miami on Thursday, helped rally Philadelphia from a 13-point deficit in with a burst in the fourth quarter, scoring 15 of his 28 points in the period, while going 6 of 11 from the field in the frame. Tobias Harris added 21 points for Philadelphia, including six straight to pull the Sixers within 105-104 on a 12-footer with 1:25 left. But Harris stepped out of bounds in the closing seconds, turning the ball over. Tyrese Maxey missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer, and Memphis took the win. “It was just a very undisciplined, sloppy basketball game. Turned the ball over down the stretch the last two times,” Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said, adding: “Disappointing loss to me. Very winnable game, and just didn’t get it done.” Ben Simmons fell just short of a triple-double with 11 points, a season-high 16 rebounds and nine assists. The Grizzlies benefited from Morant’s return, while the Sixers played without center Joel Embiid, who was rested due to right knee pain. It was yet another game where Philadelphia was without one of its starters. “At the end of the day, we do need each other. … When we are together, the five starters, we complement each other,” Harris said. Neither team led by more than six points in a closely played first half. Harris led balanced scoring from Philadelphia with 10 points. Morant led Memphis with 12 points. Memphis stretched the lead to 11 points near the midway point of the third quarter and eventually held an 88-76 lead heading into the fourth. The win marked the eighth straight game Memphis has held an opponent under 110 points. “Over the last eight games, these guys have just really embraced the opportunity to get better on both sides of the ball,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said “Defensively, that’s a lot of credit to (the players).” TIP-INS 76ers: C Dwight Howard started his third game of the season in Embiid’s place. … Despite Embiid’s absence, Philadelphia had 11 blocks in the game, six in the first quarter, including three by Danny Green. Grizzlies: Have won seven straight home games in the series. Have not lost to the Sixers in Memphis since Dec. 26, 2012. … Counting the Brooklyn win when Morant was injured, the Grizzlies went 5-4 during his absence. … Brandon Clarke struggled in the first half, hitting only 1 of 9 shots. Dillon Brooks was 3 of 10 in the half. JA LOCKED IN The previous two games, the Grizzlies had hinted on Morant’s return, moving his status to questionable. But even before his return Saturday, he has stayed engaged while recovering from the ankle sprain. “He’s super locked-in on the sidelines, coaching from the sidelines,” Jenkins said. “So, we know his mind’s locked in. What he’s doing with his body to get back healthy, it’s been really impressive.” TOO MANY TURNOVERS Rivers was particularly bothered by his team’s turnovers. The 76ers committed 22 in the game. “If you play that way, you deserve to (lose),” Rivers said. “I would say of the 22 (turnovers), 15 were unforced. Just sloppy. Driving into traffic, cross-court passes, interior passes” that resulted in turnovers.","401267353"
"Damian Lillard lobs a pass from half court to Derrick Jones Jr., who finishes with a two-handed jam. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Damian Lillard scored 36 points and the Portland Trail Blazers rebounded from a first-half deficit to beat the Atlanta Hawks 112-106 on Saturday night. Enes Kanter added 12 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks for the Blazers, who have won five of their last six. Guard CJ McCollum left the game at halftime because of a left foot sprain, but coach Terry Stotts said afterward that X-Rays had ruled out more serious injury. “I think we should be proud of ourselves and the effort that we had in the second half,"" Lillard said. ”We know that first half wasn't good enough. This was a game we had to have."" Trae Young had 26 points and 11 assists, while Clint Capela added 25 points and 15 rebounds for Atlanta, which was playing the second of a back-to-back following a 116-92 loss at Utah a night earlier. Portland led 98-94 with just under six minutes left after trailing by as many as 16 points in the opening half. Gary Trent Jr.'s 3-pointer extended the lead to 101-96. After Capela's dunk, Trent hit another 3 and Lillard dished to Derrick Jones Jr. for the alley-oop to put the Blazers in front 106-98 with 3:53 left. Atlanta chipped away, getting within 106-104 on Capela's tip. After Lillard made free throws, Young's layup made it 108-106 with under a minute left. Carmelo Anthony missed a pull-up jumper from out front, but Young was called for an offensive foul on Lillard at the other end. After review, the call stood, and Lillard made free throws to close it out. “Tough loss. I thought they executed down the stretch. I thought the biggest area for us was just the fourth quarter lack of execution of our offense,"" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. ""Defensively, we did a few nice things to speed the game up and try and take the ball out of Lillard's hands, but we just struggled down the stretch.” The Blazers (8-5) were playing in their first game without big man Jusuf Nurkic, who fractured his right wrist in the third quarter of a 111-87 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Thursday. Kanter, who started in his place, said the Blazers were playing for Nurkic. “It's just sad because what he was doing was just bringing so much to our team,” Kanter said. “He was a big part of our family.” Cam Reddish did not play for Atlanta (5-7) because of a knee contusion. Pierce said before the game he was just sore and hadn't had time to recover after Friday night's game. Young had back tightness going into the game but started. The Hawks had a 14-5 run to close the opening quarter up 38-34 then extended the lead to 52-36 on Young's 3-pointer. Portland rebounded, pulling within 62-59 on Kanter's layup but the Hawks went into the break ahead 66-59. Capela led Atlanta with 19 points, while Lillard had 19 for Portland. McCollum, who had 16 points in the first half, did not return for the second. It was unclear when he was hurt but it appeared that Capela stepped on his foot following a layup in the opening quarter. Rodney Hood's 3 pointer got the Blazers with 82-79 late in the third and Portland pulled into an 82-all tie with less that a minute left. Portland took an 88-86 lead on Gary Trent Jr.'s layup and Anthony's 3-pointer made it 94-90 with 7:33 left.

"Immanuel Quickley finds a cutting Obi Toppin, who flies toward the rim for the huge dunk. (0:20) BOSTON -- — Julius Randle scored 20 points with 12 rebounds and RJ Barrett had 19 and 11 on Sunday to help the New York Knicks snap a five-game losing streak and beat the Boston Celtics 105-75. Jaylen Brown scored 25 for Boston, which had the best record in the Eastern Conference after winning five in a row but suffered its biggest blowout and lowest-scoring output of the season. “I don’t believe that’s who this team is,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “We had a clunker. You try to have as few of those as you can. ... We just looked like we were in mud today.” All-Star Kemba Walker made his season debut after missing the first 11 games with a left knee injury but left in the third quarter with a rib injury. Fellow Celtics All-Star Jayson Tatum missed his second straight game with COVID-19. The Knicks led by as many as 11 in the first quarter and made it 15 in the second before scoring the first 10 points in the third quarter to open a 58-35 lead. The Celtics never got closer than 18 after that. “They’ve played extremely well short-handed, and dealing with a lot of tough stuff with guys being out,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “Sometimes when you get guys back, there’s another adjustment you have to go through. ... Getting Kemba back, there was an adjustment for them.” KEMBA BACK OUT Walker went to the locker room after taking a shot to the ribs while getting boxed out by Nerlens Noel in the third quarter. Walker said he simply got the wind knocked out of him. He did not return, but he already had played 20 minutes, which was his limit. Walker scored nine points on 3-of-13 shooting, adding three rebounds, four assists and three steals but committing five turnovers. He was 1 for 8 from 3-point range. “It felt really good to be out there. Really good. I almost forgot how it felt,” Walker said. “Free, which I haven’t been for a very, very, very long time. It feels weird not having pain, if that makes sense.” BENCH STRENGTH The Knicks had a 38-25 edge in bench scoring, led by Immanuel Quickley's 17 points and eight assists. “It’s just his craftiness,” Thibodeau said. “He’s got every shot you can imagine.” Reigning NCAA player of the year and No. 8 overall draft pick Obi Toppin added 12 points and five rebounds in 17 minutes — his most extensive action since injuring his left calf in the opener. He missed 10 consecutive games before returning on Wednesday. “He was terrific in training camp,” Thibodeau said. “To get an injury like he had, it’s not an easy thing to deal with — particularly for a guy going through the league for the first time.” TIP-INS Knicks: Thibodeau, who was an assistant on the Celtics team that won the 2008 NBA title, celebrated his 63rd birthday. ...

Boston's previous lowest scoring game was 93 points against Detroit on New Year's Day. The biggest blowout was a 28-point loss to the Nets on Christmas. ... Tatum has not played since Jan. 8.

"Luka Doncic comes alive in the first half, scoring 30 points as the Mavericks trail the Bulls 67-52. (1:52) DALLAS -- — Lauri Markkanen had 29 points and 10 rebounds, Garrett Temple scored 15 of his season-high 21 points in the second quarter and the Chicago Bulls ended a four-game losing streak with a 117-101 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday. Dallas star Luka Doncic passed Michael Jordan on the career list with his 29th triple-double, finishing with 36 points, 16 rebounds and 15 assists, including a behind-the-back pass to Willie Cauley-Stein for a dunk. Doncic is tied with Grant Hill for 15th place. The Slovenian sensation, who had 30 points at halftime, didn't get nearly enough help with the Mavericks missing five rotation players because of COVID-19 protocols and guard Tim Hardaway Jr. with a left groin strain. “Not having Hardaway hurts us,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “But we have other guys that can fill in and do the job defensively and play a role within the system.” Doncic had his European sidekick in Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 20 points, after both missed a loss at Chicago this month. But the 7-foot-3 Latvian was 0 of 7 from 3-point range as Dallas players not named Doncic shot 10% from deep (2 of 20). Markkanen, in his second game back after missing seven games because of COVID-19 protocols, was 10 of 19 from the field while recording season highs in points and rebounds. “I was a little short on my shot and trying to get my legs back,” Markkanen said. “Conditioning-wise, I feel pretty good. There was a stretch in the third quarter when I checked in and I felt like it was 20 seconds and I was gassed. Other than that little stretch, it was pretty good.” The Bulls, who lost all four games on their skid by four points or fewer, took control with a 40-point second quarter and didn't let their lead get under nine points in the second half. Zach LaVine, who had 21 first-quarter points in the earlier win over Dallas, didn't get his first bucket until the third quarter while going 1 of 8 from the field and making all eight free throws to finish with 10 points and 10 assists. “I thought he made great decisions and he played a tremendous floor game,” coach Billy Donovan said. “He didn’t really force anything. There was a lot of things we did today where I thought there was some growth from the last game.” Dallas guard Jalen Brunson, who scored a season-high 31 points when Doncic was sidelined by a quadriceps injury in Chicago, was listed as questionable on the COVID-19 list and didn't play. Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell were out again. Carlisle said he expected Brunson to be available Monday against Toronto. TIP-INS Bulls: After setting a franchise record with consecutive games with at least seven 3-pointers, LaVine missed all five shots from long range. ... The Bulls finished with six players in double figures. The other was Wendell Carter Jr., who had 12 points, seven rebounds and five of Chicago's 14 steals. Mavericks: During warmups for the first two of two straight games on MLK Day weekend, the players wore shirts that read on the front, “Now is the time to make justice a reality for all.” The back read, “honor KING.” ... Cauley-Stein and James Johnson were the other double-figure scorers for Dallas with 10 points apiece. HELP IN THE FOURTH The Bulls kept the lead in double digits throughout the fourth quarter thanks in part to Otto Porter Jr., who had 12 of his 14 points in the final period and finished with nine rebounds. Thaddeus Young scored 15 points, with four in the fourth. GAMES PILING UP If the schedule holds, the Mavericks are headed on another three-game road trip that will put them at 11 of their first 15 games away from home. After that, it's another back-to-back with a home game against Houston on Saturday. And that will be five games in seven days. “Right now we’re entering the most difficult stretch of schedule in Mavericks history,” Carlisle said.","401267358"
"Donovan Mitchell scores the first basket for the Jazz and it's an uncontested slammer. (0:16) DENVER -- — The game had a certain intensity — not necessarily playoff intensity, Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic cautioned, but definitely a tension. They always do when these two fierce Northwest Division rivals take the court. Reserve Jordan Clarkson scored 23 points, Donovan Mitchell added 18 and the Utah Jazz beat the Nuggets 109-105 Sunday night in their first meeting since a thrilling playoff series last season that Denver captured in seven games. “That kind of game,” Jokic said. “Intense. It was good basketball.” Rudy Gobert finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds in a contest in which Mitchell struggled with his shot, going 7 of 20 from the field. But Mitchell hit a clutch fadeaway with 1:01 remaining and with Denver staging a late rally. Mitchell also had seven assists as the Jazz won their fifth straight game. Jokic had 35 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, while Jamal Murray chipped in 30 — 24 in the first half — for the Nuggets. Murray averaged 31.6 points in the first-round playoff series inside the NBA bubble to help the Nuggets overcome a 3-1 deficit to knock off the Jazz. The Jazz took the lead for good late in the third quarter when Mike Conley stole the ball from Jokic and dished it over to Clarkson, who hit a 3-pointer. But the Nuggets hung around until end. Murray drained a 3-pointer with about seven seconds remaining to bring the Nuggets to within 107-105. Gobert sealed the win with a dunk. “It’s not always going to be sunshine and rainbows where we execute the game plan 110%,” Mitchell explained. “We went out there and for us, just asserting our will. Finding ways to win the game by any means necessary.” The 2020 first-round series between the two teams inside the NBA bubble turned into the Mitchell &amp; Murray Show, with both guards turning in electric performances. Mitchell averaged 36.3 points during the series and Murray countered with a pair of 50-point games. “I really feel that first-round matchup will go down as one of the better playoff series played,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “You had all the drama going on — we got down 3-1 and we come back and win. Within that, you have two young dynamic players, Murray and Mitchell, that put on an incredible show game after game after game.” This matchup had an entirely different look. The Nuggets no longer have Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig or Mason Plumlee. The Jazz had back Bojan Bogdanovic, who missed the playoffs due to wrist surgery. He was the X-factor in this contest, hitting five 3-pointers and scoring 17. “It's still the Jazz and the Nuggets. Whether you need to reference (the series) or not, your players remember,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Given the fact that it is the first time we have played them since then, I don’t know if it’s in the front of your mind, but it is certainly something you have thought about.” The Nuggets finished 40 of 100 from the field. They took 24 more shots than Utah. “Small details win the game between us and them,” Jokic said. TIP-INS Jazz: Utah went 15 of 37 from the 3-point line. ... Conley finished with 14 points and eight assists. Nuggets: F Michael Porter Jr. missed a ninth straight game due to the league’s health and safety protocols. ... Reserve P.J. Dozier had nine points. BUFFS SHOUTOUT Malone applauded the upset win by the Colorado women’s team over top-ranked Stanford down the road in Boulder on Sunday. The Buffaloes won 77-72 in overtime for the women’s first victory over a No. 1 team in program history. “Great win,” Malone said. JOKIC VS. GOBERT Don't ask Jokic about going up against Gobert in the middle. He doesn't see it that way. “I’m playing against the Utah Jazz,” Jokic said.","401267360"
"Zion Williamson racks up 31 points on efficient 13-of-15 shooting to lead the Pelicans past the Kings. (1:52) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Zion Williamson had 31 points and six rebounds, Steven Adams made a pair of clutch free throws with 17.9 seconds remaining, and the New Orleans Pelicans overcame a 43-point performance by Sacramento’s De’Aaron Fox and beat the Kings 128-123 Sunday night. Brandon Ingram scored 22 points, Eric Bledsoe added 21 and Adams had 12 points and 15 rebounds to help the Pelicans end a five-game losing streak. “We were just making pretty good plays, forcing them into shots that we wanted them to take,” Adams said. “Fox played really well. We had a problem with him, but other than that, we were just being super aggressive.” Fox, who was limited to 14 points in a 38-point loss to the Clippers two nights earlier, had a career-high point total and 13 assists for the Kings, who have lost eight of 10. New Orleans led by 19 points in the first half before the Kings made a late run. Marvin Bagley made a 3-pointer and Fox followed with a one-handed dunk that cut the deficit to 116-115. Adams and Williamson made two free throws apiece for the Pelicans and Bledsoe scored in the paint to make it 122-115. After the Kings scored on back-to-back trips down the court, Adams made two more free throws and JJ Reddick added a pair, helping the Pelicans hang on. Williamson fell one point shy of his season-high for scoring. The Pelicans’ big man made 13 of 15 attempts and spent much of the fourth quarter on the bench in foul trouble. “He finds his way to the rim regardless of the defense and he’s a good finisher,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “He probably should shoot twice as many free throws as he does. He’s not even getting calls and he’s efficient.” Bagley finished with 26 points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento. Richaun Holmes had 16 points and seven rebounds. “I was very pleased to see us get our fight back tonight. That’s how we were playing earlier in the year and we were winning games,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “They made plays down the stretch and we missed some opportunities down the stretch.” Fox became the first player in the Kings’ Sacramento era to have 40 or more points and 10-plus assists in one game. Nate ‘Tiny’ Archibald was the last player in franchise history to accomplish that feat, doing it in 1973 when the team played in Kansas City and Omaha. “There’s more, offensively and defensively, that I’m able to do,” Fox said. “We lost on a career high (for me) so it doesn’t really matter.” DEFENSIVE UNDOING The Kings problems on defense continue. Over the last three games they allowed the Trail Blazers to match a franchise record for 3-pointers, then let the Clippers and Pelicans set season-highs for scoring. Sacramento has given up 122 points or more in eight consecutive games. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans was hit with a delay of game call coming out of halftime. … JJ Redick made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to end the first quarter. … Ingram went down hard while defending just before halftime. Ingram remained on his back for a few moments, and then got to his feet went to the locker room. He returned for the second half. … Lonzo Ball (knee) sat out a third consecutive game. Kings: Sacramento had as many assists (10) as it did rebounds in the first half. … The Kings closed the third quarter on an 18-4 run. … Buddy Hield has made at least one 3-pointer in 80 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NBA.","401267361"
"Domantas Sabonis collects an offensive rebound and flips up a reverse layup as the halftime buzzer sounds. (0:25) LOS ANGELES -- — Marcus Morris scored a season-high 20 points to lead seven players in double figures, and the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Indiana Pacers 129-96 on Sunday night for their first four-game winning streak of the season. With sharpshooter Lou Williams sidelined, Morris came off the bench to hit four 3-pointers, tying his season-high. He was coming off an 18-point performance at Sacramento on Friday. The Clippers made 19 of 39 from long-range, outdueling the Pacers, who were 11 of 38. “I was wide-open,” Morris said. “If I can't make a wide-open shot, I'm in the wrong business.” Fellow reserve Luke Kennard added season highs of 20 points and five 3-pointers. Paul George also had 20 points. Kawhi Leonard had 17 points, seven rebounds and five assists for the Clippers. “I feel like our energy is way better this season,” Morris said. “Guys are buying in and enjoying playing the game.” Doug McDermott led the Pacers with 23 points, making five 3-pointers. Domantas Sabonis added 19 points and 14 rebounds. Indiana closed within two points early in the third before the Clippers put the game away. They outscored the Pacers 37-14 the rest of the quarter to lead 100-75 going into the fourth. Los Angeles made eight 3-pointers by six different players and Leonard scored 11 points. “They started making shots,” Sabonis said. “I feel like we left guys too open. We were throwing out a lot of different defenses and they caught on to the box-and-1 and it was harder for us to catch up.” The Clippers ran off 10 straight points early in the fourth to lead 110-81. Kennard had a 3-point play and George scored seven in a row. “Excited to see how far he can take it,” Morris said of George. “Been playing very well, unselfish, under control. He’s definitely playing MVP basketball.” Indiana had won two straight, but was idle since Thursday at Portland. The team's game at Phoenix on Saturday was postponed because of COVID-19 issues. That didn't stop McDermott from bursting out of the gate. He scored 13 of the Pacers' first 21 points. The Clippers hit five 3-pointers while outscoring the Pacers 35-12 over the end of the first quarter and start of the second to build an 18-point lead. Indiana closed strongly with a 20-10 run, including 10 by Sabonis, that left the Pacers trailing 61-55 at halftime. TIP-INS Pacers: Myles Turner was out with a sore right hand. ...

"Immanuel Quickley throws the lob up to Obi Toppin who flushes it home with two hands. (0:21) NEW YORK -- — R.J. Barrett scored 22 points and had 10 rebounds, and Julius Randle added 21 points and 17 rebounds to lead the New York Knicks to a 91-84 win over the Orlando Magic on Monday. Elfrid Payton chipped in with 12 points and rookie guard Immanuel Quickley added 11 for the Knicks, who improved to 7-8 with their second straight win Nikola Vucevic had 24 points and 14 rebounds for Orlando, which lost its sixth in a row and fell to 6-8. Aaron Gordon had 18 points and 17 rebounds while Terrence Ross added 19 points for the Magic. Perhaps the early start -- it was noon tip-off -- affected both teams because New York led 47-38 after a first half in which the Knicks only made 37 percent of their shots and Orlando hit 32 percent. New York’s lead grew to 68-54 after Obi Toppin’s alley-oop jam one minute into the fourth. The Magic rallied and went ahead 81-80 when Ross’ 28-foot heave beat an expiring shot clock. The lead lasted for all of eight seconds, as Randle tied the game with a free throw. On New York’s ensuing possession, Randle hit a floater during a run in which the Knicks scored nine straight points. TIP-INS Magic: The matinee marked a homecoming of sorts for Cole Anthony, the 15th overall pick in the draft. Anthony, who grew up in New York City and is the son of former Knick and current TNT analyst Greg Anthony, played his first game as a professional at Madison Square Garden. The 20-year old entered the game averaging 10.4 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. He finished with six points, five rebounds and one assist. “I think it’s what he wants,” Orlando coach Steve Clifford said before the game. “He’s a confident young guy. He’s handling it well."" Knicks: Fourteen games is a small sample size, but New York coach Tom Thibodeau is pleased with the play of third-year forward Kevin Knox, who came into the game shooting 43 percent from the field and averaging 7.8 points per game coming off the bench. Knox, who came into the season shooting 33.7 percent from 3, is connecting at a 44.2 percent clip so far in 2020-21. “I thought when he took good shots, he made them or they were in-and-out,” was how Thibodeau assessed Knox’s improved play. “He’s allowing the game to come to him. He put a lot of time into shooting this summer. He can do more than spot up.” SUCCESS New York improved to 23-12 all-time on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.","401267363"

"Bam Adebayo denies Jerami Grant late in the fourth quarter, putting the finishing touches on the Heat win. (0:27) MIAMI -- — The Miami Heat eventually showed up to a game already behind schedule. Bam Adebayo had 28 points and 11 rebounds and the short-handed Heat got their biggest comeback win of the season, rallying from 19 down to beat the Detroit Pistons 113-107 on Monday night to snap a three-game slide. “It was not pretty. It was ugly,"" Miami guard Goran Dragic said. “But we're happy."" Dragic scored 22 points for the Heat, who got 18 apiece from Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn. Miami was again without Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley (virus protocols), Tyler Herro (neck) and Meyers Leonard (shoulder). “In some ways it feels like two wins, just because we are persevering though a lot of different things without feeling sorry for ourselves or making excuses,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I really commend the way the guys have handled all of this.” Jerami Grant had 27 points for Detroit, but his layup that could have gotten the Pistons within three was blocked by Adebayo with 31 seconds left. Wayne Ellington made seven 3-pointers and scored 24 for the Pistons, who got 21 from Derrick Rose and 15 from Mason Plumlee. Detroit's Blake Griffin was shaken up in the final seconds and limped off the court after the final buzzer. He had five points in 36 minutes. The game was supposed to start at 3 p.m. Eastern; it started at 8 p.m., delayed by the NBA to allow time for COVID-19 tests to be processed. “We found out mid-morning when we already had our walkthrough, our breakfast and testing,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “So, it just changed the time that the bus left. ... We can’t even leave the rooms anyway.” Waiting all day didn’t seem to bother Detroit early. It was 11-2 when Spoelstra called his first timeout after three minutes, and 12-2 when the timeout ended. A review of a jumper by Ellington showed it was a 3-pointer, not a 2-pointer, and just like that the Pistons were up 10. Detroit’s lead was 28-9 after 7 minutes following another 3 by Ellington. The Heat chipped away, briefly held the lead late in the half, and used a 24-10 run to take a 12-point lead early in the fourth. “We knew they were going to come out better in the second half,” Ellington said. TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit is one of two teams without consecutive wins this season. The other is Miami. ... Ellington got fouled twice on 3-pointers, making all three free throws on the first, missing after making the 3 on the second. ... Grant is the 12th Piston to score 20 points in at least 12 consecutive games. Heat: Miami has used nine starting lineups through 12 games, with Dragic starting Monday for the first time this season. Brooklyn and Cleveland have also used nine starting lineups; Utah is the only team to use only one. ... Dragic’s first assist was the 4,000th of his career. KING TRIBUTE As part of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration, a recording of the Black national anthem — “Lift Every Voice and Sing” — was played pregame, preceding “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The teams gathered at midcourt, holding a banner bearing King's words “I Have A Dream.” ROBINSON'S 100 Robinson has 326 3-pointers through his first 100 games. That's 76 more than any other player has managed in his first 100 games; Dallas' Luka Doncic had 250. SCHEDULE QUIRK The last five Heat-Pistons games have been in Miami. The last time Miami went to Detroit was exactly two years ago Monday. Miami will visit the Pistons once in the season’s second half.","401267366"
"Dejounte Murray drives to the bucket, but then kicks out to a wide-open Rudy Gay for a 3-pointer. (0:17) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — LaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points, DeMar DeRozan had 20 points and 11 assists and the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 125-104 on Monday. Rudy Gay and Patty Mills came off the bench for 21 points apiece as the Spurs reserves outscored Portland backups 59-24. Reserve center Jakob Poeltl added 11 points and seven rebounds, six of which came on the offensive glass. “Their bench hurt us,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “The shooting off the bench, the second-chance opportunities. They really hurt us. They had 10 second-chance points in the fourth quarter.” Aldridge, playing against the team he spent nine years with, got things rolling for the Spurs. “He set the tone early,” Gay said. “He got to his spots and he knocked down his shots. Him knocking down shots and pulling out the big men kind of opens things up. It opens up cracks and DeMar slips through those cracks.” Aldridge scored eight points in the first quarter. “He didn’t catch and think about it,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. “He was just determined to let it fly.” Between DeRozan and point guard Dejounte Murray, the Spurs also had two players with 11 assists apiece while the Blazers had just 20 total assists as a team. “They’re unselfish guys and they don’t really care who scores,” Popovich said of his two offensive conductors. “They just play the game the right way.” Damian Lillard led Portland with 35 points. Carmelo Anthony’s basket with 2 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter gave the Trail Blazers an 80-78 lead. The Spurs took over from there, later using an 11-0 run for a 95-82 lead early in the fourth period. Rodney Hood’s 3-pointer on the next Blazers possession after a timeout stopped that burst, but San Antonio kept pulling away. With his bench playing so well and extending the lead, Popovich elected stick with a bench-heavy unit to close out the victory. TIP-INS Spurs: The game was played on Martin Luther King Jr. Day — the NBA celebrates the holiday with a big slate of games every year. Popovich, who is often outspoken about matters outside of the game, called the civil rights leader a “modern founding father” and the “conscience” of the country. Blazers: After leaving Saturday night’s game against Atlanta with a sprained foot, guard CJ McCollum will be out at least another week, Stotts said. McCollum will be re-evaluated next week after MRIs showed the sprain. McCollum was averaging a career-high 26.7 points and five assists per game prior to the injury. Hood got the start in McCollum’s place, with Stotts citing his preference to bring Gary Trent Jr.’s scoring off the bench. Hood had a season-high 21 points in his first start since suffering a torn Achilles on Dec. 6, 2019. “The coaches and (Lillard) were telling me to be aggressive,” Hood said after the game. “I felt good about that and it did a lot for my confidence.” Lillard didn’t want to speculate too much after the game but he says he’s “not worried” about McCollum missing extended time.","401267367"
"Chris Paul shows off the handles before dishing it low to Deandre Ayton as he spins away from the defender and rattles the rim. (0:23) MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- — Ja Morant had 17 points and 10 assists and took a key charge late as the Memphis Grizzlies won their fifth straight, beating the Phoenix Suns 108-104 on Monday. Morant assisted on Grayson Allen’s 3-pointer with 1:06 left to give Memphis a 101-98 lead, then scored on a drive with 30.8 seconds remaining. On the ensuing possession, Morant took a charge against Chris Paul to help maintain the Memphis lead. “Ja has a crazy good feel for the game,” said Brandon Clarke, who matched Morant’s 17 points. “I feel like those first three quarters, he’s just kind of like watching the defense, watching us, seeing what the defense gives him. “By the fourth quarter, he’s just kind of like already figured out everything with that, and he’s able to get in the paint, get his shot off, get his teammates shots.” Allen, who finished with 16 points, converted four free throws down the stretch to preserve the win. “We didn’t get stops. We didn’t execute,” said Paul, who finished with 16 points and seven assists. “I had six turnovers. This ain’t it. This ain’t it. ... We shouldn’t be losing this many close games like that.” Deandre Ayton led the Suns with 18 points and tied a season high with 16 rebounds, while Mikal Bridges had 17 points. Devin Booker added 12 points but struggled from the field, converting only five of his 21 shots. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said the Grizzlies tried to share the load of defending Booker. “I thought Grayson, in particular, did a really, really nice job,” Jenkins said. “We had a lot of guys switching on to (Booker) throughout the game. That’s just discipline team-wise.” The game — part of Memphis’ 19th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration — marked the first time Phoenix had played in a week after having three games canceled under the league’s health and safety guidelines. Monday’s game was a matchup of pieced-together lineups as both teams were dealing with injuries and the league’s health and safety protocols. Three players didn’t travel with the Suns, including Dario Saric. The Grizzlies had Jaren Jackson Jr. and Justise Winslow out with injuries and starting center Jonas Valanciunas entered the health and safety protocols after Saturday’s win over Philadelphia. In the end, the Suns were not able to hold the advantage in the final 2:39. After taking a 98-94 lead, Phoenix was outscored 14-6. Suns coach Monty Williams called Allen’s 3-pointer “a microcosm of the whole night,” adding: “Down the stretch, we had some shots, we just missed them.” TIP-INS Suns: With the absence of Saric, Damian Jones and rookie big man Jalen Smith, that left only Ayton and Frank Kaminsky in the low post for the Suns. “I’m just grateful to have those two guys,” Williams said. ... The Suns have played in two other MLK Jr. Day games in Memphis — 2007 and 2010. ... Cameron Johnson moved into the starting lineup for Jae Crowder, who started the first 11 Phoenix games. ... Cameron Payne, who missed the previous two games with a sprained right ankle, returned to action. Grizzlies: With Valanciunas unavailable, rookie Xavier Tillman made his first NBA start. “Me and my wife (Sunday) were in the car geeked and screaming (thinking) ‘No way this is happening,’” Tillman said. “When coach told me, I was kind of ready for it, hoping it’s going to happen. So, I was kind of prepared for it.”... Memphis shot 13 of 18 in the second quarter, including missing on one of six 3-pointers. COVID CHAOS With the cancellations around the league because of health and safety protocols, every game seems up in the air until tipoff. “For us, we just kind of take it moment by moment, day by day, not trying to look too far ahead,” Jenkins said. “We always prepare that we’re playing a game until we’re not.”","401267368"
"James Harden describes how different his and Durant's chemistry is now with the Nets than it was back with the Thunder. (0:56) NEW YORK -- — James Harden missed a jumper with a chance for the lead, tracked down the rebound and fired it out to a wide-open Kevin Durant. Plays like that are why the Brooklyn Nets will be such tough opponents after reuniting the multi-time scoring champions. Even when teams stop one superstar, another might be there waiting. “This is what they do. They wake up, come to the game and they score 30,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “If you’re not aggressive and you’re not locked in against them, they’re going to score 50.” Durant made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 36 seconds left, Harden had 34 points and 12 assists, and the Nets edged the Bucks 125-123 on Monday night. They are 2-0 since last week's acquisition of Harden, who is averaging 33 points and 13 assists in his new uniform. “We’re still trying to find our way and we’ve still got room to improve, but it’s a solid start,” Durant said. Durant finished with 30 points, nine rebounds and six assists to give the Nets their fourth straight victory in a game in which two of the East's best went toe-to-toe right down to a tense finish that ended when Khris Middleton missed a potential winning 3-pointer from the corner. “It’s a huge win for us,” Harden said. “This is our second game together and we haven’t had one practice.” Antetokounmpo had 34 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for Milwaukee, which had its four-game winning streak stopped. Middleton added 25 points and Jrue Holiday had 22. Harden had 11 points at halftime following his 32-point Nets debut, when he added 14 assists and 12 rebounds. But he picked it up in the second half and contributed to the biggest play of the game. He swooped in to grab the rebound of his own 3-pointer that was off with the Nets trailing by one and passed to Durant, who nailed the shot that made it 125-123. Durant could have put it away but turned it over on the Nets' next possession, but they held on when Middleton's shot was just off from in front of his bench. Kyrie Irving missed his seventh straight game after leaving the team for personal reasons, with coach Steve Nash saying he could return Wednesday in Cleveland. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee had its eight-game winning streak in Brooklyn snapped. ... Former Nets center Brook Lopez scored 15 points. Nets: Joe Harris scored 20 points and went 5 of 7 from 3-point range, the last with 1:05 remaining. ... Nash said the Nets would do little more than watch film and walk through some plays on Tuesday, but would try to have Irving work out on the court against some teammates to improve his conditioning after his layoff, which began Jan. 7. ... Durant was chosen as Eastern Conference player of the week after averaging 34 points, 5.3 rebounds and 8.0 assists in Brooklyn’s 3-0 week. He shot 61.3% from the field and 60% from 3-point range. He won the award 26 times in the Western Conference. TOUGH TESTS Both teams are playing last season's NBA Finalists this week. The Bucks host the NBA champion Lakers on Thursday, two nights before the Nets open a two-game series at home against Miami. The Bucks played against Luka Doncic in their last game before moving on to Durant and Harden in this one and LeBron James and Anthony Davis — practically an All-NBA team minus Antetokounmpo — in the next one. Coach Mike Budenholzer said the Bucks look forward to the competition. “I think whenever you play the best teams in the league, you always learn more about yourself and I think we’re constantly in that mode,” he said. “We want to be tested, we want to test ourselves, we want to keep our high standards, our high expectations and the best teams in the league do that to you.”","401267369"
"Luka Doncic uses fancy passing to set up Kristaps Porzingis nicely for two consecutive dunks as he penetrates in the lane. (0:26) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Kyle Lowry flirted with a triple-double on Monday night and the Toronto Raptors shut down Dallas star Luka Doncic for a 116-93 victory. Lowry had 23 points, nine rebounds and seven assists and Pascal Siakam scored 15 of his 19 points in the second half as the Raptors pulled away for their third straight victory. Chris Boucher added 21 points and OG Anunoby contributed 13 points, 11 rebounds and much of the defensive work against Doncic, along with Stanley Johnson. “I think what we do best is play team defense,” Johnson said. “It's pretty easy when you go out there and guard one guy with five guys.” Doncic, who was coming off a 36-point, 16-rebound, 15-assist triple-double in Sunday's 117-101 loss to Chicago, scored 15 points on 4-for-11 shooting and added seven rebounds and nine assists. “I thought he was frustrated,” Johnson said. “When you're tearing up the league like he is and then someone does what we did, it's frustrating.” Rick Carlisle, coaching a Dallas team missing four players, was ejected in the first quarter. “This is a very difficult planning situation, to try to prepare defensively in this kind of situation,” Carlisle said. “Come Wednesday, we'll do a better job of it.” Kristaps Porzingis led Dallas with 23 points and nine rebounds. The Mavericks shot 37.8% with 23 turnovers and lost their third straight. The game was tied 47-47 after a first half in which the Raptors shot 11.8% (2 for 17) from behind the arc and 19 for 32 (59.4%) from inside it. The second half was all Raptors. “It was nice to play well pretty much the entire second half,” said coach Nick Nurse, who mixed up the defense of Doncic. “We worked hard to limit his touches somewhat,” Nurse said. “He didn't seem to have the ball all the time like he does in some games ... and he kicked it out a lot, which is what we wanted hm to do.” Siakam's short jumper midway through the third quarter broke a 59-all tie and launched a 16-2 run that put the Raptors up to stay. Boucher and Norman Powell (17 points) led an early fourth-quarter rally that put the game away. Carlisle’s ejection came with 58.4 seconds left in the first quarter, just after Powell had converted a running shot in the lane after a Dallas turnover.

Porzingis had been called for a charge. But after looking at the video, the officials charged the foul on Toronto’s Aron Baynes, determining that Baynes had been inside the half-circle when drawing the contact.","401267370"
"Victor Oladipo makes his Rockets debut against the Bulls leading the team with 32 points, but they would still fall 125-120. (2:10) CHICAGO -- — Zach LaVine scored 33 points, and the Chicago Bulls overcame a strong effort by Victor Oladipo in his Houston debut, beating the Rockets 125-120 on Monday night. LaVine led seven Bulls players in double figures and added seven assists. He scored nine points in the closing minutes of the third to help send Chicago to the final quarter with a 93-86 lead. The Bulls made enough shots down the stretch to win for the second time in as many days after losing four straight by four points or fewer. “It's gonna take some time. But I see them fighting to get better,” coach Billy Donovan said. Lauri Markkanen finished with 18 points. The 7-footer from Finland nailed a 3-pointer in the closing minute to make it a six-point game, helping Chicago squeeze out a tight win after an easy victory at Dallas. And the Bulls hit 20 of 45 from beyond the arc. Oladipo looked good in his first game for Houston, setting season highs with 32 points and nine assists. The two-time All-Star was acquired from Indiana as part of the four-team trade that sent James Harden to Brooklyn last week after he said the Rockets weren’t “good enough.” Christian Wood scored 30 and grabbed nine rebounds. Eric Gordon added 21 points after missing back-to-back games because of tightness in his lower left leg. The Rockets lost for the fourth time in five games. “Our better days are ahead of us, definitely,"" Oladipo said. “Off the fly, we kind of just went out there and winged it a little bit. Not very much time to prep. Our better days are ahead. Everyone, just stay patient, including us.” HANGING ON The Bulls led most of the game, but Houston hung in until the end. Oladipo nailed a 3 to cut it to 114-111 with 1:50 remaining. LaVine answered with a finger roll layup for Chicago. Wood made a pair of free throws for Houston with just over a minute remaining. But Markkanen hit a 3 from the wing off a feed from LaVine after a driving Coby White passed out to the perimeter, making it 119-113 with 46.9 seconds left. “I think we're just taking good shots, moving the ball really well,” LaVine said. “Guys are stepping up and hitting shots. I think we have the right personnel for it this year, as well.” TIP-INS Rockets: Coach Stephen Silas took time to discuss with his team the sacrifices Martin Luther King made. He also mentioned the struggles his father, Paul, faced breaking into the NBA with the St. Louis Hawks in 1964, unable to go into certain restaurants and hotels. “I just wanted the players to hear my story when it came to Martin Luther King Day and really let them kind of marinate on the sacrifice that he gave for all of us,” Silas said. ... The Rockets were missing guards John Wall and Sterling Brown. Wall, a five-time All-Star, sat out his third consecutive game because of a sore left knee, while Brown (sore lower right leg) missed his second in a row. Bulls: The Bulls held out rookie forwards Patrick Williams (bruised right hip) and Otto Porter Jr. (strained lower back). Williams, the No. 4 overall pick in the draft, started Chicago's first 13 games.","401267371"
"Kelly Oubre knocks down a 3-pointer and is called for a technical foul as he blows a kiss to Montrezl Harrell, who tried to contest the shot. (0:23) LOS ANGELES -- — Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors are starting to make a habit of fourth-quarter rallies against teams from Los Angeles. Curry scored 26 points on Monday night as the Warriors rallied from a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers 115-113. “We kept our composure. The second unit was amazing both halves,” Curry said. “We got some momentum in the second half to give us a chance and carry us down the stretch. It was similar to the Clippers game. We've done it twice now, but want to get leads early.” Golden State trailed the Clippers by 22 in the third quarter on Jan. 8 before storming back for a 115-105 win. On Monday, the Lakers sprinted out to a 19-point lead in the first quarter and dominated the first 42 minutes. LeBron James’ 3-pointer gave the Lakers a 97-83 advantage early in the fourth before the Warriors battled back. They trailed 106-97 with 5:52 remaining before going on a 15-2 run that gave Golden State its first lead. Oubre had tied it at 108 with a driving layup and Draymond Green’s layup with 2:40 remaining gave the Warriors their first lead of the night. James had a chance to win it at the end, but missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer as the Lakers had their five-game winning streak snapped. According to Stats LLC, it is the first time in 284 home games that James and his team took a double-digit lead into the fourth quarter and lost in regulation. “I think we just had some tough breaks, some tough calls against us in the second half that slowed our pace down,"" said James, who finished with 19 points. ""We couldn’t get back into a rhythm.” The Lakers were 6 of 19 from the field in the fourth after shooting 53% from the floor the first three quarters. Golden State was 14 of 23 over the final 12 minutes as Curry and Eric Paschall each scored eight points. “We got outplayed in the second half. We got hesitant on the offensive end, and a little casual at certain points in the game,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. Paschall came off the bench to tie his season high with 19 points and Andrew Wiggins added 18 for Golden State, which has won 10 of its last 12 when playing on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. “The first half, we stunk it up. I like our fight and we started to get after it in the second. The second unit kept us in the game and the starters finished it,” Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. Dennis Schröder led Los Angeles with 25 points, including 14 in the first quarter as the Lakers led 34-15 with 1:14 remaining in the first quarter. Anthony Davis had 17 points and 17 rebounds. The Lakers have a seven-game losing streak when playing on the holiday. FRUSTRATING HOLIDAY James won a title against Golden State, but he still hasn't beat them on MLK Day. James lost three straight holiday games to the Warriors from 2016-18 when he was with Cleveland. He was injured and didn't play in 2019 when Golden State defeated Los Angeles. He is averaging 21.8 points in the four holiday games against the Warriors to Curry's 26. TIP-INS Warriors: Curry played in his 712th regular-season game, moving into fifth in franchise history and surpassing Alvin Attles. Lakers: Montrezl Harrell was 6 of 6 from the field and finished with 17 points. ... Kyle Kuzma had his second straight double double with 15 points and 10 rebounds. ... Davis had six assists in the first quarter, which is a career high for him in a single quarter.","401267372"
"Bol Bol drives to the rack and finishes in traffic with a massive one-handed slam. (0:25) DENVER -- — Nikola Jokic was split in his opinion over which play stood out more. The candidates: Facundo Campazzo's backward, between-the-legs pass to Monte Morris for a layup, and Bol Bol turning  in a coast-to-coast dribbling clinic, punctuated by the 7-foot-2 center's slam. “Both are nice,” the Nuggets big man said. Fair answer. Oklahoma City had no answers for him. Jokic had 27 points and 12 rebounds before calling it an early night as Denver routed the Thunder 119-101 on Tuesday. Clean shaven and sporting a new buzz cut, Jokic also had six assists before taking a seat on the bench with the other starters for the fourth quarter. “He doesn't get a lot of credit as he should, maybe because he (isn't) flashy with the dunks,” said Morris, who had 15 points. “He's got a touch I've never really seen. He's definitely a future Hall of Famer.” The Thunder tried everything to stop Jokic, but he was a handful for Isaiah Roby, who was giving up four inches and 50 pounds. “Obviously, it’s a tough cover right now. But I don’t think it’s a long-term tough cover for him,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said of Roby. “This is a matchup that he should be able to handle long-term. We see him as that kind of player."" Paul Millsap had 13 points and 12 rebounds for the Nuggets, who have won six straight over the Thunder at home. Luguentz Dort kept the Thunder close early by scoring 15 of his 20 points in the first half. The Nuggets began to pull away in the second quarter and stretched it in the third before the Thunder made a little run to make things interesting. “I told our guys, ‘This is who we’ve been all season long. We get up. We build a lead. We get lackadaisical and we give the game back. Let’s not do that again,’” Nuggets coach Michael Malone recounted. They responded by building it back up to 26 and allowing Jokic and the rest of the starters to sit out the final quarter. It was a much-needed confidence boost for the struggling Nuggets (7-7), who advanced to the Western Conference finals inside the NBA bubble last season. So much so that former Nuggets coach George Karl posted on social media leading up to the game: ""It's early in the season to say this but the Nuggets game against the Thunder is a ‘must win’ for Denver.” “This definitely was a must-win,” Morris said. The Thunder played for the first time since an OT win over Chicago last Friday. Their game against Philadelphia on Sunday was postponed because the 76ers did not have the league-required eight available players to proceed because of contact tracing. TIP-INS Thunder: G Ty Jerome remains in Oklahoma City to rehab a sore ankle. ... The Thunder are 5-2 on the road this season and 1-5 at home. ... G Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 14 points and seven assists. Nuggets: F Greg Whittington had knee surgery Tuesday. He will be re-evaluated in four to six weeks. ... F Will Barton had 13 points and six assists. ... Denver outscored Oklahoma City in second-chance points 32-3. PROUD PAPA Thunder center Al Horford missed the game after he and his wife recently welcomed a new daughter, Nova. Daigneault wasn’t sure of a timetable on his return. “We’re really happy for him,” Daigneault said. FATHERLY ADVICE Malone keeps feeding the confidence of Morris. For that approach, Malone credits the sage advice once given to him by his father, longtime NBA coach Brendan Malone. “Some of the greatest advice he gave me as a young coach, the greatest gift I can give any of our players is confidence,” Malone said. “Monte knows he has my full confidence.” QUOATABLE Malone on getting Jokic to look for his shot more this season: “I locked him in my office one day, and I beat him with a pillow case filled with soda cans, and said, ‘You’ve got to score more.' ... He’s a great player. He’s playing at an MVP level.”","401267373"
"Zion Williamson scores 32 points with five rebounds, but the Pelicans fall to the Jazz 118-102. (1:59) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Donovan Mitchell had 28 points and seven rebounds, and the Utah Jazz beat the New Orleans Pelicans 118-102 on Tuesday night for their sixth straight victory. Mitchell also made four of Utah's 21 3-pointers. Jordan Clarkson added 18 points, six rebounds, and six assists, and reserve Joe Ingles scored 15 points. Rudy Gobert had 13 points, 18 rebounds, and three blocks. “The biggest thing is we’re shooting our shots,” Mitchell said. “We’re not passing up 3s.” Improved defensive play has keyed Utah’s surge on the perimeter, and it continued against New Orleans. The Jazz disrupted shots, crashed the boards, and sprinted up the court on numerous possessions to stay a step ahead of the Pelicans. “Defending creates those shots and defending keeps us in the game if they’re not going in,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. Zion Williamson scored 32 points for New Orleans, and Brandon Ingram had 17. The Pelicans trailed the entire second half after allowing the Jazz to make more than 20 3-pointers for the fourth time in six games. “We couldn’t stop them on anything,” New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “Obviously what stands out is the 21 3s. But they also didn’t have any trouble getting to the rim. So, you know, they got whatever they wanted we didn’t take anything away from them.” Williamson gave the Pelicans an early lift in the first half. He converted all five of his first-quarter field goal attempts and capped a 7-0 run with a layup that put New Orleans up 20-18. Mitchell matched his efficiency. He powered the Jazz offense in the first quarter, scoring 15 points while going 6 for 7 from the field. He converted a three-point play to punctuate an 11-2 run that gave Utah a 29-22 lead. Mitchell also had a key stretch in the second quarter. He scored and threw a one-handed wraparound pass as he was falling out of bounds out to Bojan Bogdanovic to set up another basket. The two plays bumped Utah back in front 55-49 before halftime. The Jazz carried that momentum into the third quarter. Utah made 3-pointers on four straight possessions to extend its lead to 73-55. Utah made eight total 3-pointers during the quarter. Clarkson and Ingles scored the final two on back-to-back possessions to push the Jazz lead to 91-69 heading into the fourth quarter. “They continued to put the pressure on us, breaking us down on the defensive end with their driving and kicking in,” Ingram said. “That’s usually just how they play.” TIP-INS Pelicans: Lonzo Ball returned after a three-game absence due to a knee injury. Ball finished with seven points, four assists, and three steals. … Williamson had back-to-back 30-point games for the first time in his NBA career. … New Orleans scored 22 points off 14 Jazz turnovers. Jazz: Ingles returned after a three-game absence due to Achilles tendon soreness. … Mike Conley had a team-high 10 assists. … Derrick Favors had nine points and seven rebounds in his first game against the Pelicans after spending last season in New Orleans. BUCKLING DOWN One game after giving up a season-high 23 offensive rebounds to Denver, the Jazz clamped down on the glass against New Orleans. The Pelicans had 10 offensive boards and scored 10 second-chance points. Utah finished with a 60-45 edge on total rebounds. The Jazz made rebounding a collective effort instead of simply trying to battle Williamson and Steven Adams one-on-one around the basket.","401267374"
"Kyrie Irving reflects on the first time he suited up against Kobe Bryant in the NBA. (1:51) CLEVELAND -- — Kyrie Irving needed some time. The new-look Nets will require some as well. Irving returned from his personal “pause” and scored 37 points in his first game with Kevin Durant and James Harden but Brooklyn's “Big 3” couldn't keep up with Cleveland's Collin Sexton, who scored 42 and led the Cavaliers to a 147-135 double-overtime win on Wednesday night. Sexton made four 3-pointers — most of them over Irving — and scored 15 points in the second OT. He dropped two 3s and fed Taurean Prince for another in a dizzying, 55-second span as Cleveland put it away. “He played out of his mind,” said Cavs forward Cedi Osman, who scored 25. “It was amazing.” While it was tough to lose, Irving was impressed by Sexton, who looked a lot like Irving on one of his scoring tears. '""Two overtimes for my first game back?"" said Irving, who played a career-high 48 minutes in his first game since Jan. 5. ”You gotta love NBA ball, though. I was smiling when Collin Sexton was making those shots."" Durant scored 38 points and Harden added 21 as Brooklyn's trio of superstars combined for 96 points in their first game together. But it wasn't enough to outlast Sexton, who missed Cleveland's last five games with a sprained ankle. The Cavs threw some exotic defenses at the Nets, who only got Irving back at practice on Tuesday and haven't had time to work on much. “Look, this is the first night,"" Brooklyn coach Steve Nash said. ""We seemed a little lost at times. We were a little flat and disjointed at times.” As Sexton knocked down one big shot after another in the second OT, players on Cleveland's bench tackled each other in delight. Prince, acquired in the four-team deal that brought Harden to Brooklyn, scored 17 in his Cavs debut and Larry Nance Jr. had 15. Sexton will forever be linked to Irving. He was selected by Cleveland with the draft pick the Cavs got from Boston in the trade for Irving in 2017. Like Irving, Sexton wears No. 2, and like Irving, he makes big shots. “I definitely accepted the challenge,” Sexton said. “I knew it wasn't going to be easy — because it's Kyrie.” Irving had missed Brooklyn’s last seven games, leaving on Jan. 7 to address some issues he didn’t specify while speaking with reporters Tuesday. Irving only said he needed space to work through some issues to find balance in his life. While he was away, the Nets rocked the league by pulling off the blockbuster deal for Harden, whose arrival has made Brooklyn the favorite to unseat Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference and a legit NBA title threat — maybe. Before the game, Nash admitted being “curious” about how his trio of superstars would align on the floor. “But I’m not in a hurry,” he said, stressing it may take time for Durant, Irving and Harden to figure things out. The Nets are indeed a work in progress. There were moments of sloppiness, miscommunication and even confusion as Brooklyn’s players tried to find some cohesion in just Harden’s third game. “We'll have good nights, great nights,” Irving said. “I'm excited for what's to come.” The Nets overcame a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter and tied it at 113-all on Irving's putback with 1:10 left. In the first OT, after Durant's free throws put the Nets up 127-124, Sexton hit a 3-pointer from up top over Irving with 1.2 seconds left. Durant's last chance, a contested 3-pointer at the horn, was short. The Cavs weren't intimidated by Brooklyn's firepower or flash. In the second quarter, Sexton ran back on defense and cleanly flicked the ball away from Durant as he was going in on a breakaway dunk. Irving's return to the Nets was also just his second game in Cleveland since he was traded by the Cavs after the 2017 season. Strangely, Irving had missed each of his team's previous visits to Ohio since his debut with the Boston Celtics four years ago. It was Irving's jumper late in Game 7 that helped the Cavs win the 2016 title, and the team saluted him with a video tribute in the first quarter. Many of the 2,000 fans in Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse stood and saluted Irving, who touched his chest and waved in appreciation. TIP-INS Nets: Harden added 12 assists and 10 rebounds. A prolific scorer and volume shooter, Harden didn't attempt a shot in the first quarter. ... Brooklyn made its first 10 shots, but let the Cavs scored 17 straight bridging the first and second quarters. Cavaliers: G Darius Garland remains sidelined with a sprained right shoulder. He could be back Friday. ... G/F Dylan Windler will return Friday after being sidelined since opening night, when he broke his left hand. SUPPORT TEAM While the Nets were initially caught off guard by Irving’s leave, the team is committed to helping him. Nash believes its his responsibility as Irving’s coach, and Brooklyn’s charge as his team, to do whatever it can to aid Irving “in all manners.” “It’s more important than basketball,” Nash said. “We can be a layer of protection for him.”","401267376"
"Luka Doncic slings a one-handed pass around two defenders to find Kristaps Porzingis wide open for a dunk. (0:18) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Kristaps Porzingis posted season-high totals of 27 points and 12 rebounds in leading the Dallas Mavericks to a 124-111 victory at Indiana on Wednesday night. Luka Doncic added 13 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists as Dallas snapped its first three-game losing streak in almost two years. The short-handed Pacers have lost two straight by double digits, their two most lopsided losses of the season. Malcolm Brogdon had 26 points and Domantis Sabonis finished with 25 points and 10 rebounds, giving him a franchise-record 14 in a row. Dallas took the lead for good on the final basket of the third quarter and pulled away with an 11-4 run in the fourth. The Mavericks were in control most of the night after using an early 15-3 run to take a 37-22 lead late in the first quarter. Indiana closed the deficit to 65-63 at the half, then took its first lead when Edmond Sumner's 3-pointer broke a 67-all tie early in the third. It didn't last long. Porzingis scored all of the Mavericks points in a 9-2 run and Dallas eventually extended the margin to 84-76. Again, the Pacers charged back, tying the score at 86 on Brogdon's second 3 of the game, taking an 89-88 lead on his next 3 and then making it 91-88 when Brogdon made a layup. But Dallas answered with a 13-3 run to make it 101-94 and gradually pulled away late to seal it. TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic appeared to hurt his left knee three times during the game.

HE'S BACK In their first home game since trading two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo to Houston for LeVert, the Pacers got a familiar face back on the floor — guard Jeremy Lamb. He made his season debut came with 55.8 seconds left in the first quarter. Lamb hadn't played since injuring his left knee Feb. 23, 2020. He was diagnosed with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, a torn medical collateral ligament and a fractured femur — the bone just above the knee. Lamb was perfect in the first half, going 4 of 4 from the field, including one 3 while making his only free throw. He didin't make another shot and finished with 10 points in 19 minutes. THEY'RE BACK, TOO Indiana played its first seven games with only a few dozen people sitting in the second deck of Bankers Life Fieldhouse. That's about to change. A small crowd of season-ticket holders were seated in the first and second decks. When Toronto plays in Indy on Sunday and Monday, the Pacers can have up to 1,000 fans in attendance and they could start increasing the capacity as early as next week. County health officials have said the Pacers can have up to 4,500 fans in attendance.","401267377"
"Joel Embiid scoffs at Marcus Smart's claim that he ""flails"" for calls. (1:11) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid has been the early season MVP for the Sixers. At this rate, the All-Star center could be in contention for a bigger prize. Embiid had 42 points and 10 rebounds, and Tobias Harris scored 22 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 117-109 win over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night. “It’s not sort of, it’s ‘for sure’ MVP-caliber,” Harris said of his teammate. Embiid is off to the best start of his career and topped 40 points for the second time in three games. He shot 12 of 19 from the floor (one 3-pointer) and was 17 of 21 from the free-throw line. He did it in 34 minutes and scored 20 points in a half (22 in the first) for the fifth time this season. “If they double, we’ve got way too many shooters for me to be able to kick it out,” Embiid said. “I can attack in a different style. It’s been working well.” Ben Simmons had 11 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Sixers. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 26 points and Marcus Smart had 25. Kemba Walker scored 19 points in his second game of the season after he missed the first 11 with a left knee injury. The Sixers fell short in their attempt to trade for James Harden and left Embiid to perform the heavy lifting for a franchise that needs at least one other elite scorer to make a serious run in the East. When the Celtics snapped a tie game in the third with a 9-0 run it was Embiid -- who else? -- who steadied the Sixers with a three-point play. “I’m not surprised at the level,” coach Doc Rivers said. “He’s just more talented than even I knew. I knew he was extremely talented, but he has so many more gifts.” Simmons was expected to develop into that true cornerstone star to pair with Embiid, only this season there has been more frustration than flashes of brilliance. Rivers has insisted he’s not worried about Simmons’ stats, but the Sixers need more than what he’s giving them. Simmons was whistled for two offensive fouls within 30 seconds late in the third and the Celtics ended the quarter with a 92-86 lead. Walker returned in the fourth — he played only 90 seconds in the third on a minutes restriction — and the Sixers had to run out a lineup without Embiid or Simmons early in the quarter. Shake Milton, making a case for top NBA sixth man, and Harris, whose three-point play gave the Sixers a 100-99 lead, kept it a game until Embiid and Simmons returned. Embiid checked in with 7:44 left and the Sixers holding that one-point lead. Down three, Embiid sank a fadeway to hit 38 points to pull the Sixers within one, grabbed a defensive board, drove to the hoop and was fouled. He sank both again in the clutch. “He’s going to score some, but 42 is too much,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “I thought not only did he score those points, he also handed the double (team) pretty well and on a couple of occasions, it led to 3-pointers.” Danny Green’s fourth 3-pointer of the game put the Sixers up 108-105 and they put away a Celtics team that swept them in the first-round of the playoffs last season. TIP-INS Celtics: F Jayson Tatum is out of health and safety protocol and could play Friday against the 76ers. ... C Robert Williams was cleared to play after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month. 76ers: G Furkan Korkmaz returned after missing several games with a left adductor strain. His reverse dunk in transition in the third quarter was the play of the game. ... Seth Curry and Vincent Poirier remained out for COVID-related reasons. ... F Mike Scott also sat out with swelling in his right knee. BIG FLOP Boston’s Marcus Smart said Embiid “flails and he gets the call. Meanwhile on the other end, we attack and we don’t get the whistles. It’s tough playing like that.” Embiid laughed off the accusation and said, “I’m sure he knows himself and knows his game, too. He does a lot of that.” FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES Rivers was invited to speak at a Joe Biden rally after the President used Rivers’ words in an October speech, calling for racial unity at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Rivers said he has been friends with Vice President Kamala Harris for nearly a decade and became “emotional” watching the inauguration. Rivers said he has talked and texted with Harris since the November election, but joked he’s not so sure he’ll be in her contacts in the immediate future. “I get a feeling starting today my texts may not go through anymore,” Rivers said, laughing. “I know they change phones as of today.”","401267378"
"Trae Young caps off a 38-point night with a 3-pointer in overtime as Hawks prevail over the Pistons. (0:25) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 38 points, John Collins had 31 and the Atlanta Hawks rallied to beat Jerami Grant and the Detroit Pistons 123-115 in overtime on Wednesday night. Grant had a career-high 32 points, including all of Detroit’s nine points in overtime, to continue his hot start to the season. But the Pistons fell to 3-11, the worst record in the Eastern Conference. Clint Capela had 27 points and a career-high 26 rebounds for Atlanta (7-7), the NBA’s first 25-25 game since Karl-Anthony Towns (27-27) on Jan. 12, 2019. The Hawks were short-handed. Forwards De’Andre Hunter (right knee soreness) and Cam Reddish (left knee contusion) were ruled out during pregame warmups. Reddish missed his third consecutive game. “I’m just happy we never gave up,” said Young, who had 10 assists. “We never gave up from beginning to end, no matter who was out there. We knew we were down a couple guys.” Young overcame a slow start. He had only six points in the first half after making only one of five free throws. He made 13 of 19 overall. Young scored 21 points in the third quarter, when Atlanta charged back after trailing by 14 points. After Young's three-point play cut Detroit's lead to 81-78, the Pistons scored the final 11 points of the period, including six by Grant. “We don’t come back in this game if Trae Young doesn’t turn into Trae Young down the stretch,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Grant set a scoring high despite making only six of seven free throws. “It’s not even conscionable think that he’s driving to the basket that much and not getting hit,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. After trailing 99-82, Atlanta rallied again in the final period. Capela's jam, set up by a pass from Young, tied the game at 106. Grant's last-second drive to the basket was blocked by Collins, forcing overtime. Capela's three-point play gave Atlanta a 116-113 lead it wouldn't lose. Young padded the lead with a 3-pointer. Capela posted Atlanta’s first game with at least 25 points and 25 rebounds since Dikembe Mutombo’s 27 points and 29 rebounds against Minnesota on Dec. 14, 1999.

"Bam Adebayo finds Goran Dragic in the corner, who knocks down the trey to increase Miami's lead. (0:18) TAMPA, Fla. -- — The Miami Heat were missing a lot of firepower Wednesday night. They did have Kendrick Nunn and a zone defense that the Toronto Raptors couldn't figure out Nunn scored 28 points and the injury-plagued Heat pulled away in the second half for a 111-102 win. Bam Adebayo had 14 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists for Miami, and Kelly Olynyk came off the bench with 15 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Despite missing four key players — including Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro, Avery Bradley and Meyers Leonard — the Heat (6-7) won their second straight. “I don't know what percentage of our scoring wasn't here tonight, but we have a lot of guys who can score 20 points,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “In this (injury) situation, either you put your tail between your legs or you rise to the occasion for your team.” Fred VanVleet had 24 points and nine assists for the Raptors (5-9), whose three-game winning streak ended. Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby scored 18 points each for Toronto, which shot 30.2% (13 for 43) in the second half and 39.8% (35 for 88) overall. “It seemed like we were stuck on 85 for a long stretch late in the game,” VanVleet said. “We'll have to get some better looks instead of shooting 3s all the time. When you don't make shots against a zone it has a snowball effect. They get more aggressive and it makes it harder.” After scoring Toronto's first seven points of the game, Kyle Lowry finished with eight points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Nunn, who had scored just 33 points all season before his 18-point game Monday night, came off the bench and shot 9 of 12 and grabbed eight rebounds in 35 minutes. Nunn scored on a layup and a 3-pointer to put the Heat up by 11 early in the second quarter, but Terence Davis scored twice during a 9-0 run that got the Raptors quickly back in it. Nunn hit two more 3-pointers and Olynyk scored eight points on a 21-9 Miami spurt in the third quarter, and the Heat took an 88-83 lead into the fourth quarter. Two straight 3-pointers by Goran Dragic gave Miami a double-digit lead in the closing minutes. “It's irrelevant what the (defensive) scheme is,” Spoestra said of the Heat's effective zone defense. “Our man defense was good as well. I was more looking to whether we were committed to multiple efforts and we had those tonight."" TIP-INS Heat: Herro missed a third game with neck spasms. ... Butler and Bradley missed their fifth straight games while in coronavirus protocol. Leonard sat out a fifth game with a shoulder injury. ... Adebayo entered the game as the only NBA player averaging at least 19.5 points, nine rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.2 blocks and one steal.

"Chris Paul tosses a pass up to Deandre Ayton, who finishes with a one-handed dunk. (0:21) HOUSTON -- — Deandre Ayton had season highs with 26 points and 17 rebounds and the Phoenix Suns beat the Houston Rockets 109-103 on Wednesday night to end a two-game skid. “He was a monster for us tonight,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. The Suns won for the first time since Jan. 9. Between the two losses, they had three games postponed because of health and safety protocols after playing at Washington. The Suns led by 20 points in the third quarter, but the Rockets used a couple of runs to get back in it. A jump shot by Devin Booker, who had 24 points, pushed the lead to eight with less than three minutes to go. But Houston scored the next six points, with four from Victor Oladipo, to cut it to 103-101 with 90 seconds left. Ayton made two free throws and Booker added two more to push the lead to 106-101 with 45 seconds to go. Oladipo made a pair of free throws for Houston, but a layup by Booker sealed the victory. Ayton was proud of the way the team responded after Houston cut the lead. “I did what I was supposed to tonight (and) as a whole team ... we really settled down and locked in at the end and closed the game out the way we should,"" he said. Oladipo and Eric Gordon had 22 points apiece for the Rockets. They have lost three of four since James Harden was traded to Brooklyn. Coach Stephen Silas said it's challenging to manage his roster with starters John Wall and Danuel House both out. “We’ve got to do what we can to win each game, but we’re dealing with a lot of different things,"" he said. “But mainly without those guys it’s stagger minutes and try to figure it all out."" Chris Paul had 13 points for the Suns to give him 19,004, making him the 60th player in NBA history to reach 19,000.

Ayton had two dunks and two of his career-high five blocks in that stretch. Cameron Payne raved about Ayton's work on defense. “Just to know he’s back there taking care of the dirty work for us is huge,"" he said. A dunk by Christian Wood soon after that ended a scoring drought of more than five minutes and was the start of a 9-0 run that got Houston within 101-95 with about three minutes left. The Suns used a 9-0 run to push their lead to 20 points with eight minutes left in the third. Gordon ended the run after that with a 3-pointer, which was the start of an 8-0 run by Houston that cut the deficit to 74-62. The Suns were up by 14 later in the third before the Rockets used a 10-1 spurt to get within 82-77 with about 2 ½ minutes left in the quarter. Phoenix led 89-82 after three.

Jae Crowder had 11 points off the bench. Rockets: Wall missed his fourth straight game with a sore left knee and House (back spasms and self-isolation) sat out for the ninth game in a row.

"On Jan. 21, 2019, Klay Thompson set an NBA record of hitting 10 consecutive 3-pointers as the Warriors beat the Lakers 130-111. (1:59) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors brought it on both ends in their most complete game yet. They brought it for new Vice President Kamala Harris, honoring her Oakland roots. Curry had 26 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, and the Warriors beat the San Antonio Spurs 121-99 on Wednesday night wearing their old city of Oakland across their chests. Rookie James Wiseman added 20 points and six rebounds, and Draymond Green had six of the Warriors' 31 assists. Golden State made it consecutive impressive wins after erasing a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter of a 115-113 road victory against the Lakers on Monday. “I think it was our best game. It was the best two-way basketball game we’ve played all year,” coach Steve Kerr said. “Our defense was excellent, we put a lot of pressure on them, stayed really solid, made good rotations, rebounded well. And then at the other end when you’re forcing misses, offense becomes a lot easier, so we were able to get into a flow.” The Warriors debuted their “Oakland Forever” jerseys for Inauguration Day. Oakland native Harris was gifted one signed by Curry featuring a special congratulatory message from the two-time MVP and his urging to show it off in Washington. “Historical. These uniforms are pretty self explanatory,” Kelly Oubre Jr. said. Dejounte Murray scored 22 points for the Spurs, who had won the past three meetings with the Warriors and five of six. San Antonio was coming off its biggest win of the season, beating the Trail Blazers 125-104 at Portland on Monday. Four players ages 30 or older scored 20 points, the first time it has been done since 1998 by Houston. Andrew Wiggins, who has been dealing with a sore right knee, knocked down consecutive 3-pointers in the fourth quarter on the way to 18 points for the Warriors. Curry shot 10 for 17 and made four 3-pointers. The Spurs trailed 43-36 with 5:56 remaining in the first half, then Golden State subbed Curry and Green back in and went on an 18-4 run. “I thought we had a bad start. They jumped on us in the beginning of the game for whatever reasons and we never got back,” coach Gregg Popovich said. ""But if you shoot 4 for 33 from 3, your defense better be pretty perfect and it wasn’t.” OAKLAND FOREVER In a video the Warriors showed at halftime and also posted — Kerr called it “brilliant” and shared it widely — Harris promised to display the framed jersey in her White House office. “I will proudly, proudly display this. You always bring such joy and pride to me as a daughter of Oakland,” said Harris, sworn in earlier in the day on Capitol Hill. “This is really so very special, so thank you all, and I hope to see you soon. Go Warriors!"" While Golden State did hold a morning shootaround, Kerr found time to watch some of the inauguration, which he called “beautiful. ” “It’s a great day,” Kerr said. “It’s one of the reasons we’re wearing our Oakland jerseys tonight. We’re taking great pride in the fact that Kamala Harris is from Oakland and was inaugurated today as vice president. Just a huge day, obviously, in our nation’s history and for the Bay Area as well. So it’s great to be able to honor her and her big day by wearing this uniform.” MILLS' FANS Spurs reserve guard Patty Mills struggled in his latest Bay Area homecoming, shooting 3 for 11 and missing all seven of his 3-point attempts for just six points. Randy Bennett, Mills' college coach at Saint Mary's in the East Bay suburbs, loves following his former player's success from afar. “He’s having an incredible, incredible journey.

"Kawhi Leonard Eurosteps past Tyrese Haliburton, then dunks in Richaun Holmes' grill. (0:22) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points, Paul George added 19 and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Sacramento Kings 115-96 on Wednesday night for their season-high fifth consecutive victory. The Clippers handed the Kings a 38-point loss at their place last Friday. A new week didn’t change anything. Sacramento dropped its fourth in a row and sixth in seven games. George tied his career high with 12 assists to go with a team-high six turnovers. “I got to be better and take care of the ball a lot better, but for me, it’s fun,” George said. “It’s not going to be perfect, but I thrive being on the floor and trying to make my teammates better.” De'Aaron Fox scored 17 of his 25 points in the first half for the Kings. Glenn Robinson III added 14 points off the bench. Buddy Hield had 11 of his 13 points in the first half, when the Kings led by six. “We see the mistakes and see what needs to be done. Now it’s on us to fix it,” Robinson said. “We’re still remaining positive.” Ivica Zubac had 11 points and a season-high 12 rebounds in his new role coming off the bench this season instead of starting. “We got to keep pumping Zu. Zu just doesn’t know how dominant he can be,” George said. “You forget how young he is and he’s still a baby. He's got to own being the biggest guy on the floor.” The Clippers improved to 8-1 in games in which they've owned 20-point leads. “We're still trying to get better. That’s our mindset,” Leonard said. “We want to keep it moving. It’s the first leg of the season, we got to finish it out. We’re not satisfied.” The Clippers broke the game open with 34 points in the third quarter, when they had scoring runs of 9-0 and 13-0. Leonard and Zubac had five points apiece in the second spurt that helped send Los Angeles into the fourth leading 95-75. Leonard had 10 points and George seven in the third. The Clippers repeatedly got stops on the defensive end, which helped them score in transition. They shot 52% from the field and limited the Kings to 19 points in the period. “Those guys are doing a good job coming out with a defensive mindset,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said of his team. The Kings barely outscored the Clippers 21-20 in the fourth, but they never seriously cut into their deficit. “You could see when we do play the right way and move the ball, it’s believing in that the whole game and believing in each other,” Robinson said. TIP-INS Kings: They fell to 1-4 on the road overall, and have dropped four in a row away from home. ... DaQuan Jeffries (left ankle sprain), Jahmi'us Ramsey (left groin strain) and Hassan Whiteside missed the game.

"Anthony Davis comes down harshly on himself after the Lakers' win over the Bucks, explaining his offensive struggles and what he must do to get back in the groove. (1:01) MILWAUKEE -- — LeBron James says the results of last season's NBA awards voting didn’t provide extra motivation as his Los Angeles Lakers prepared to face Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks. He had more important things on his mind. James scored a season-high 34 points in the opener of a seven-game road trip, helping the Lakers beat the Bucks 113-106 on Thursday. He  finished second to Antetokounmpo in last year's MVP balloting. “It’s never been about individual (honors),” said James, a four-time MVP. “It’s all about the team success. That’s all that matters. ... I just want to play well and help our team versus any opponent. That’s what it’s all about.” Los Angeles (12-4) bounced back after blowing a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter of a 115-113 loss to Golden State on Monday night.  The Bucks (9-6) dropped their second straight. This game pitted the reigning NBA champion Lakers against a Bucks team that posted the league’s best regular-season record each of the last two years. It was the first time the Lakers had faced the Bucks since the 2019-20 awards voting, which also had Antetokounmpo finishing just ahead of Los Angeles' Anthony Davis in the voting for defensive player of the year. “That was last season, obviously,” said Davis, who had 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists. “No one brought that up or talked about it. Our motivation was not losing two in a row tonight. We were able to get that accomplished.” The Lakers shot 19 of 37 from 3-point range, with James going 6 of 10 and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope making 7 of 10. Caldwell-Pope had 23 points. Antetokounmpo had 25 points and 12 rebounds for Milwaukee, but he also committed nine turnovers. Jrue Holiday scored 22 points for the Bucks, and Khris Middleton finished with 20. “We've got to keep working, keep playing good basketball for longer periods of time, make shots, defend better, rebound the ball better,"" Antetokounmpo said. “Ultimately we've got to get better.” The Lakers were ahead 63-57 after a first half that featured seven ties and nine lead changes. The Lakers outscored Milwaukee 20-8 over the last 5½ minutes of the second quarter, including Caldwell-Pope’s 35-footer at the buzzer. “There were stretches where we were really good on both ends of the court,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We had a bad stretch, I felt like the last four or five minutes of the second quarter, on both ends of the court we were not good. We were not sharp like you need to be for 48 minutes.” Los Angeles stayed ahead throughout the second half. After trailing 98-87 with less than 7½ minutes left, the Bucks cut the deficit to 102-100 when Middleton drove the baseline and scored with 3:05 remaining. Caldwell-Pope answered by sinking a corner 3-pointer with 2:42 left. The Lakers' lead didn't drop below four points the rest of the way. TIP-INS Lakers: This game marked a return to Milwaukee for Lakers guard Wesley Matthews, who played for the Bucks last season. Matthews’ Wisconsin ties go beyond that; he went to high school in Madison and played college basketball at Marquette. Matthews scored six points. Bucks: This game was supposed to be the first of a back-to-back for the Bucks. That changed when the NBA postponed the Bucks’ Friday night home game with Washington  to an undetermined date. NBA officials said the game was moved “due to the number of unavailable players for the Wizards, contact tracing for other players on their roster, and the length of time preceding the game during which the team was unable to practice.”","401267386"
"After arguing whether Donovan Mitchell touched the ball last, Stan Van Gundy is given his second technical foul of the game and is ejected. (0:34) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Utah Jazz got off to a tough start. Then Donovan Mitchell and company pushed their way right past the New Orleans Pelicans. Mitchell scored a season-high 36 points, and the Jazz rallied to beat the Pelicans 129-118 on Thursday night for their seventh straight win. “Every chance I got, just kept putting pressure on the defense and getting to the basket,"" Mitchell said. ""I was able to get 13 quick and they focus on me so now the guys are open. Then guys are hitting shots, now they’re not worried about me anymore — just a mind game in the sense.” Mitchell went 6 for 8 from 3-point range in another efficient performance. “He’s picking his spots and he’s taking what the defense gives him,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""Early in the game, he really attacked the rim, was able to get in the paint ... then as the game progressed the defense dropped back.” Utah shot 50% (44 for 88) from the field after it made 50.6% of its shots during a 118-102 victory over New Orleans on Tuesday night. Mike Conley scored 20 points and Jordan Clarkson had 19 for Utah, which has the longest active win streak in the NBA. “There were games earlier in the season like Minnesota where we came out flat and if teams hit us first, we didn’t have a push-back like we do now,” Mitchell said. Zion Williamson scored 27 points and Brandon Ingram had 23 but the Pelicans couldn’t sustain the momentum of an almost perfect first quarter and a half. “Our pace offensively slowed down,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We didn’t play with much pace or force on the offensive end. We quit making shots. And defensively we really weren’t good the entire game.” Still, New Orleans led for a bit early in the second half. Eric Bledsoe made a jumper to make it 78-75 Pelicans right before the Jazz took over. Joe Ingles made a fast-break layup on a feed from Mitchell, capping a 21-2 run that lifted Utah to a 96-80 lead with 4:27 to play in the third quarter. “Our ability to turn up our energy level a couple notches, especially defensively, is making the difference,"" Conley said. “We really get after guys and we try to get in passing lanes and we try to just be a little bit more aggressive.” Frustration boiled over for the Pelicans. Coach Stan Van Gundy got a technical and then lost a challenge to overturn a foul. Minutes later, Steven Adams leapt off the bench to argue a call and earned a technical, and Van Gundy kept arguing and was ejected with 2:23 remaining in the period. Williamson’s leaner got the Pelicans within 100-94 early in the fourth quarter, but the Jazz used their precision passing and shooting to rebuild a comfortable margin. Ingram made all six of his shots, including four 3s, as the Pelicans tallied 43 points in the first quarter. It was the second-highest total for the first quarter in franchise history. The Pelicans led by as many as 16 before the Jazz grabbed a 70-69 edge at halftime. Both Mitchell (21 points) and Ingram (20 points) posted season highs for a first half. TIP-INS Pelicans: Williamson made his first 3-pointer of the season in the first period as part of the team’s season-best eight 3s in a quarter. ... Both teams had 27 assists, and the Pelicans shot 49.4% (42 for 85). Jazz: C Rudy Gobert had 12 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots.

"Steve Kerr says the crew chief told him that the second technical on Draymond Green was a mistake and the other referee thought he was yelling at him. (0:59) SAN FRANCISCO -- — RJ Barrett had a career-high 28 points and the New York Knicks matched their longest winning streak of the season at three games by beating the Golden State Warriors 119-104 on Thursday night. “We come into every game feeling like we should win the game or give ourselves a chance to win the game,” Knicks forward Julius Randle said. “We’re a good team and we’re playing a good team basketball game.” Stephen Curry scored 30 points with five 3-pointers but shot just 9 of 19 as Golden State lacked the same energy it had in a lopsided win against the Spurs a night earlier. It certainly didn't help that Draymond Green got ejected late in the first half on a disputed technical when he appeared to be yelling at teammate James Wiseman. “At halftime Ben Taylor came out and told me that it was a mistake, that John Butler didn’t realize Draymond was yelling at his teammate. He thought he was yelling at him,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of his conversation with the officials. “Obviously, Draymond is one of our best and most impactful players so it hurt us, but we were playing very poorly to that point anyway. So I'm not going to talk about the officiating, I'm going to talk about our poor play.” Randle added 16 points, 17 rebounds and nine assists to help New York build some much-needed momentum during this successful stretch to reach .500 (8-8) following a five-game losing streak. Randle had chances at a triple-double but fell just short. “You always want to try to get one if you can. I’m just happy we got the win,” he said. “I’ll take this any day.” Alec Burks returned from a 12-game absence with a sprained left ankle to finish with 11 points and six rebounds for the Knicks. Burks spent 48 games with Golden State last season before a trade to the 76ers. When he entered at the 4:49 mark of the first quarter, Warriors public-address announcer Matt Pitman offered, “Welcome back to the Bay, Alec Burks!” Andrew Wiggins had 17 points and nine rebounds, and rookie Wiseman contributed 15 points and eight boards for the cold-shooting Warriors, who made just 38.8% of their shots and went 9 for 38 on 3-pointers. “We’re not the team we were yesterday. We didn’t come with the same focus, so next game we’ve just got to bring it,"" Wiggins said. New York shot 7 of 11 from the floor to start the game, making four of its initial five 3s to build a quick 20-12 lead. The game featured a combined 55 personal fouls. “Draymond, we caught a break when he got thrown out,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. GREEN FACTOR Golden State dropped to 6-5 with its current starting lineup since Green returned from a foot injury. But given that Green was tossed with 1:04 left in the first half after his second technical foul, it didn't seem like a game he played — though he had three points and eight assists. Kerr doesn't even think Green is “in his best shape yet.” “We were a mess without him. I think Draymond is realizing how important he is to this team,” Kerr said. TIP-INS Knicks: Frank Ntilikina, limited to four games so far and missing his 12th straight with a sprained right knee, is still listed as day to day by Thibodeau, who said, ""doing a little more each day, so we’ll see how it goes.” ...

"Thaddeus Young goes coast-to-coast and makes a layup as the halftime buzzer sounds vs. the Hornets. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — Zach LaVine is proving he can be an elite scorer in the NBA. But what Bulls coach Billy Donovan likes the most about the seven-year veteran is that he's raising the game of others and helping his team win. LaVine, who has established himself as Chicago's main scoring option, continued his strong and balanced play with 25 points, nine assists and six rebounds to lead the Bulls to a 123-110 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night. “I think he understands that he has to lift up the level of play of the team,” Donovan said. ""The sign of a great player is a player that makes everyone else around them better and I thought that he made some really great passes and got guys some open looks. Everybody knows he can score. Can he raise up the group around him?” LaVine, who had averaged 32.2 points over his previous five games, converted on 8 of 12 shots from the field and made all six foul shots. He repeatedly made the right plays, setting up his teammates for open looks while running the break and dishing out assists. “A little bit is me understanding that over the last three years, you cannot go by yourself,” LaVine said. “I think I took a step in the right direction in the offseason looking at how I can help my teammates get better. Trust and having guys healthy helps a lot. ... I am trying to read the game. We are creating a lot of open shots, so it has been good.” Lauri Markkanen chipped in with 23 points and Coby White added 18 points and eight assists as the Bulls won their third straight. “We all know he can score, but he's doing a good job of getting others involved,” Markkanen said of LaVine. “He's doing a really good job all around.” Gordon Hayward scored 34 points for the Hornets and Devonte Graham had a season-high 24 points, 22 of those coming in the first half. But the Hornets committed 20 turnovers, leading to 26 Bulls points, as they dropped their fourth straight. Hornets coach James Borrego said he needs more production beyond what he's getting from Hayward. “To say ‘Gordon, go save us every single night from start to finish,’ that’s not what we’re looking for,” Borrego said. “Other guys have got to step up and play better.” The Hornets trailed most of the game before cutting the lead to six with four minutes to go. But Markkanen slammed home an inside feed from Thaddeus Young and LaVine buried a 3-pointer from the left wing to push the lead back to double digits. SHARING THE BALL The Bulls finished with 33 assists. ""I think we are doing a good job of sharing the ball and taking the open looks,"" Markkanen said. ZELLER'S RETURN Hornets center Cody Zeller was back on the floor after missing the last four games with a broken bone in his left hand. Zeller didn't start, played 11 minutes and scored five points and had three rebounds. At times he looked out of sync with his teammates. “Moving forward, I’ve got to figure out rotations and what’s best for our ball club,” Borrego said. “It was good to have him back out there on the floor.” TIP INS Bulls: Shot 57% and scored 38 points in the paint in the first half. ...

Down one with 3.4 seconds remaining, the Pistons inbounded to Grant, who faked a handoff to Blake Griffin and then drove down the right side of the lane. Time clearly ran out before he laid the ball in, but he was also bumped by Houston's P.J. Tucker. Replays showed that contact also came after time expired, and after a review, the game ended with the Rockets holding on. “I tried to wait as long as I could before I fouled him,"" Tucker said. ""He got a little edge on me.” Grant scored 21 points for Detroit, which rallied from a 20-point second-quarter deficit and nearly erased a four-point gap late in the fourth. Griffin's 3-pointer with 29.9 seconds remaining made it 103-102, and the Pistons stopped Houston at the other end to set up Grant's final bid. Detroit coach Dwane Casey felt a foul could have been called earlier on the final play. Grant was pressured quickly after receiving the ball. “I thought he got fouled three times before he got to the rim,"" Casey said. Eric Gordon scored 20 points for Houston, which snapped a three-game losing streak. The Rockets were without John Wall and Christian Wood but had seven players score in double figures. “Everybody kind of played a role and did their job. It feels good,"" Houston coach Stephen Silas said. ""The crazy part is, if that foul had been point-one second earlier, then we wouldn’t feel so good, I guess.” It was an ugly first quarter for the Pistons, who turned the ball over nine times and trailed 34-21 at the end of the period. David Nwaba’s layup put Houston up 43-23 in the second. The Pistons, however, have been a bit more competitive this season than their league-worst 3-12 record suggests. They chipped away at the deficit and trailed 55-47 at halftime despite the fact that Griffin hadn’t scored yet. Grant’s 3-pointer put the Pistons ahead in the third, and they finished the quarter leading 81-77. TIP-INS Rockets: Wood, who went from Detroit to Houston in a sign-and-trade this offseason, missed the game against his former team with a sprained right ankle. Wall is dealing with left knee issues. Pistons: Wayne Ellington scored 18 points — all on 3-pointers — and was a big part of Detroit's comeback. ... Delon Wright also scored 18. ... Griffin finished with seven points and 10 rebounds. KEY SEQUENCE With Detroit down 97-95, Mason Plumlee secured a defensive rebound, but when he held the ball behind his head, Houston's Jae'Sean Tate ripped it away from him and drew a foul with 2:05 remaining. Tate made the first free throw and missed the second, but the Pistons were called for another foul on that rebound. Tucker's two free throws made it a five-point game.","401267390"
"Malcolm Brogdon drains a go-ahead 3-pointer with a few seconds left in the game. On the last possession, Evan Fournier's 3-pointer is no good, giving the Pacers a 120-118 win in overtime. (0:29) INDIANAPOLIS -- — When Malcolm Brogdon caught a pass from Doug McDermott on the right wing in the waning seconds of overtime, he didn't hesitate to launch the deep shot. “I like to take big shots,” Brogdon said. “My teammates and coaches trust me to take shots. I trust myself to take big shots. I knew where shot clock was, so I just shot the ball.” Brogdon hit the decisive 3-pointer with 2.8 seconds left in the extra period and calmly accepted his teammates' congratulations for lifting the Indiana Pacers to a 120-118 win over the Orlando Magic on Friday night. Evan Fournier’s 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer for Orlando. Brogdon led the Pacers with 23 points. Jeremy Lamb and Myles Turner each scored 22 points, and Domantas Sabonis contributed 18 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. Turner, who had missed the last two games with a right hand injury, started cramping in the fourth quarter. “It was frustrating not being out there in OT, but I think it was for the better,” Turner said. Fournier scored 26 points for the Magic. Nikola Vucevic had 24 points and 12 rebounds. “Both teams battled,” Vucevic said. “They just made one more play than we did. Evan made some big shots. His last shot went in and out.” The Magic went ahead 115-110 early in the overtime period. Brogdon appeared to tie it at 115 on a 3-pointer, but after a timeout, officials ruled he had stepped out of bounds. Indiana made the stops it needed down the stretch. Fournier missed a 3-point attempt with the Magic clinging to a one-point lead, setting up Brogdon’s big shot. Sabonis converted from in close to tie the game at 108 with 10.7 seconds left in regulation, and the Magic turned the ball over, sending it to overtime. “Our guys didn’t quit. They found themselves down in the fourth and found themselves down in overtime and kept coming back,” Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. “The game was full of highs and lows.” There were 17 lead changes and nine ties. Indiana’s 37-28 lead at the end of the first quarter was the biggest advantage for either team. Aaron Gordon said the Magic made too many key turnovers, including crucial one by him at the end of regulation. “That was rough,” Gordon said. “We had plenty of opportunities to win that game and we didn’t. We had it and we felt like we gave it away.” The Pacers scored 25 points off 14 turnovers, while Orlando scored just nine points off 10 Pacers turnovers. Gordon, who had 17 points and nine assists, sad it didn’t help that Orlando was 15 of 24 from the free-throw line. TIP-INS Magic: Michael Carter-Williams missed a ninth consecutive game with a left foot sprain. Pacers: Lamb played his second game since returning from a left ACL tear he suffered on Feb. 23, 2020.","401267391"
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Steve Nash try to diagnose what went wrong after the Nets fell to the Cavaliers for the second straight game. (0:49) CLEVELAND -- — Collin Sexton had 25 points and nine assists, Andre Drummond added 19 points and 16 rebounds and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Brooklyn Nets for the second time in three days, 125-113 on Friday night. The Nets played without superstar forward Kevin Durant, who was held out as a precautionary measure as he continues his comeback from right Achilles tendon surgery. Kyrie Irving scored 38 points and James Harden had 19 points and 11 assists for Brooklyn, which lost 147-135 in double-overtime to the Cavaliers in the debut of its high-scoring trio Wednesday. Durant scored 38 points and played 50 minutes in that game, so he was rested with another game Saturday. “I don’t want to overreact, but we need the guys to clean things up because we underperformed in two games,” Nets coach Steve Nash said. “People are excited to play against our team and will bring it every night. I feel like we need a little more and we have to take more pride in what we’re doing.” Jarrett Allen — acquired from Brooklyn in the Harden megatrade on Jan. 14 — scored 19 points and Larry Nance Jr. had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland, which has won three in a row and moved above .500 at 8-7. The Cavaliers outrebounded the Nets 50-29 and scored 70 points in the paint, maintaining a double-digit lead for the final 13 minutes. Taurean Prince, who also was dealt by Brooklyn, had 14 points off the bench. “We’re kind of learning on the fly because we haven’t had many practices, but we have to have constant effort,” Harden said. “Honestly, our problem isn’t offense. We’re not worried at all about offense. It’s our defense.” Irving scored back-to-back hoops to open the third, putting Brooklyn in front 64-61 before the Cavaliers answered with a 28-11 run to take the lead for good. Their largest advantage was 16 points late in the fourth. Cleveland point guard Darius Garland had 11 points after missing eight games with a sprained right shoulder. Sexton, who scored a career-high 42 points two nights earlier, collected 67 points and 14 assists in the sweep. “When we’re a whole, healthy team, we’re very tough to beat,” Drummond said. “These were great games for us. We have all the tools to be a great team.” Irving scored 18 points and Harden had 10 points and eight assists in the first half, but the Cavaliers held a 61-60 lead. The Nets started their 11th different lineup in 17 games, moving Jeff Green to a reserve role in favor of Bruce Brown. Brooklyn had won four in a row before arriving in Cleveland, where Irving spent his first six seasons. “This was two ugly losses,” Irving said. “I would have loved to get a win coming back to town. We have to figure it out, that’s it. No one else is going to do it for us. We just have to stay focused on making progress.” TIP-INS Nets: Harden and Irving share the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse record for points in a game with 55. Harden reached the mark with Houston on Dec. 11, 2019, while Irving did so with the Cavaliers against Portland on Jan. 28, 2015. … C Nicolas Claxton (right knee tendinitis) is expected to rejoin the team in February, while G Spencer Dinwiddie (right knee ACL tear) is out for the season after undergoing reconstructive surgery. Cavaliers: F Kevin Porter Jr., who was expected to be the sixth man, was traded to Houston for a future second-round pick. Porter was inactive for the first 14 games following a November arrest in Eastern Ohio. The second-year pro created a scene at the arena on Dec. 15 when he realized his locker had been given to newcomer Prince. “We’re moving forward with the group we’ve got,” coach J.B. Bickerstaff said.","401267392"
"Joel Embiid uses a stepback move to create space, then pulls up to knock down a 3-pointer in the face of Daniel Theis. (0:20) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid dropped a step-back 3-pointer and stated the shot was “nasty.” His game at MVP level, Embiid has avoided the flops that have dogged his career — putting up numbers as he dodged the claim he should be too big to flail. Embiid had 38 points and 11 rebounds, Tobias Harris scored 23 points and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Boston Celtics 122-110 on Friday night. “We've got a great group of guys and we're still learning how to play with each other,"" Embiid said. “We're only going to get better.” Seth Curry returned to the Sixers’ starting lineup following a seven-game absence because of a positive COVID-19 test and scored 15 points. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 42 points and nine rebounds and Marcus Smart had 20 points. Back at full health, the 76ers again played like a force in the East Embiid followed a 42-point outing in a win over Boston on Wednesday with another fantastic effort. Embiid, who said he had a sore back following a hard fall on his tailbone, made 14 of 15 from the free-throw line -- a familiar home after some mild criticism from Smart. Smart said Embiid “flails and gets the calls” after the All-Star center went to the line 21 times in his 42-point game. The Celtics shot just 20 free throws in that loss and none in the fourth quarter. Embiid laughed off the criticism and said Smart was just as theatrical when it came to trying to draw a foul. “Great actors know great actors,” 76ers coach Doc Rivers quipped before the game. Smart earned an A in histrionics early in the game when Embiid turned to throw an outlet pass after he saved the ball from going out of bounds. Smart hit the hardwood like a wrestler as Embiid’s elbow breezed by his face. Embiid patted Smart’s chest and they had a brief conversation as they walked off the court together headed into a timeout. The Sixers defense had waned as COVID-related absences wrecked the lineup over the past 10 days. The Sixers turned the ball over late in the second, forcing Rivers to pull down his mask and yell “wake up!” The Celtics took a 52-49 lead into the break. The Sixers woke up. Embiid scored 11 points in the third -- on the strength of 6 of 6 from the line -- and the Sixers outscored the Celtics 42-28 and grabbed the lead. The 42 points were the most in the Sixers scored in the third in almost two years. “He realizes he’s got guys that can help him be great,” 76ers guard Ben Simmons said of Embiid. “He’s talking a lot more. His leadership his grown.” Simmons converted a three-point play late in the fourth that snuffed a short Boston run, then picked off a pass and dunked for a 108-100 lead. Harris followed with a 3 and the two-game sweep was on. Simmons had 15 points and 11 assists. “I caught them falling asleep a few times and tried to make plays for my teammates,” Simmons said. The Celtics had no answers in the fourth as the Sixers improved to 8-0 with their regular starting lineup. “I’m disappointed in the way that we played in multiple big possessions in the fourth quarter,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “We have to be more detail-oriented. Everything has to be crisper. Everything has to be tighter. Everything has to be done to perfection when the other team is locked in.” TIP-INS: Celtics: Payton Pritchard, who had emerged as the first guard off the bench, suffered a sprained right knee and was helped off the court.

"OG Anunoby turns a steal into a dunk and then sinks a three as the Raptors pull away in the fourth quarter. (0:20) TAMPA , Fla. -- — Norman Powell scored 23 points, OG Anunoby added 21 and the Toronto Raptors recovered in the second half after blowing a 21-point lead to beat the Miami Heat 101-81 on Friday night. Pascal Siakam had 15 points, 14 rebounds and five assists for the Raptors, who never trailed on their way to avenging a 111-102 loss to the Heat on Wednesday night. “This was pretty much night and day,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said of his team's defensive effort. “We were definitely flying around on D. It's a good two-game scenario in that we learned a lesson. In the NBA, if you come out and you don't play, you're going to get beat.” Kendrick Nunn led the Heat (6-8) with 20 points, but the injury-riddled defending Eastern Conference champions made just seven of 31 3-point shots (22.7%) in losing for the fourth time in six games. Bam Adebayo had 14 points and eight rebounds. The Raptors (6-9) led 34-13 when Powell's layup completed an 18-2 run with 2:52 left in the first quarter. They were 8 of 11 on 3-point shots in the period. “I thought we did a good job of not getting stagnant. We kept moving, cutting, and we were able to make plays off that movement,” Powell said. Powell, starting in place of the injured Kyle Lowry, scored 19 points in the first half, and the Raptors survived another dose of Miami's confusing zone defense. “We would have had a really good offensive night, too, without all those turnovers,” said Nurse. Toronto shot 46% overall with 22 turnovers. Goran Dragic had two layups and a baseline jumper and Gabe Vincent added three layups in a 19-5 Miami run that opened the second half and tied it at 61. But Powell answered with a layup, launching a 12-0 Toronto run, and the Heat never recovered. TIP-INS Heat: Played again without F Jimmy Butler and G Avery Bradley (coronavirus protocol), G Tyler Herro (neck spams) and C Meyers Leonard (left shoulder strain). Raptors: Lowry did not play because of a toe infection. He tried to play through the injury Wednesday night and is hopeful of playing Sunday, Nurse said. ... Siakam played with a sore groin after a bad fall on Wednesday night. ... Powell averages 17.8 points and is shooting 55% in his four starts this season. RAPTORS ALMOST CENTERLESS Tuesday’s release of Alex Len left the Raptors with two centers. Chris Boucher is listed as a forward/center and starting center Aron Baynes, listed as a center-forward, played only 15.6 minutes per game before logging 23 minutes Friday night. “We didn’t see a need for a third center with Chris emerging,” said Nurse. “We’ve got a (roster) spot here and we’ll try to upgrade it with a biggerish-type player.” HEAT GOING THROUGH TOUGH STRETCH Miami coach Erik Spoelstra is trying to make the most of the many injury hits taken by his roster in the first 14 games of the season. Spoelstra stressed the minutes gained by younger players who would otherwise be watching. “We put this roster together based on (a next-man-up) identity,” Spoelstra said. “Because of all the missing parts this season ... this is good for all of our guys.”","401267394"
"Trae Young scores 24 of his 43 points on 3-pointers as the Hawks defeat the Timberwolves 116-98. (1:27) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Trae Young scored a season-high 43 points, Clint Capela had 13 points, 19 rebounds and 10 blocks, and the Atlanta Hawks topped the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-98 on Friday night. Young scored 25 points in the first half as the Hawks took a 19-point lead at halftime. He reached 40 points late in the third quarter with a step-back 3-pointer that put the Hawks up 84-59. ""I'm never going to be surprised when Trae's scoring 40 or 30 or 12 assists or whatever the number is,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. “He's learning. He's having fun with it.” Capela had six blocks in the first half as Atlanta held Minnesota to 43 points on 16-of-35 shooting. Hawks players on the bench stood and cheered when Capela picked up his 10th block in the fourth quarter, swatting away a shot by a driving Jordan McLaughin. Capela became the third player in Hawks history with 10 blocks in a game, joining Dikembe Mutombo and Josh Smith. “I've never seen 10 blocks in person,"" Young said. “What he did tonight was unbelievable. He's been doing this consistently for us. You've got to give credit where it's due. He's playing really well for us."" Second-year forward Cam Reddish returned after missing three games with a knee injury and added 15 points off the bench for the Hawks, who moved to 8-7. Malik Beasley was one of the few bright spots for Minnesota with 17 points. Naz Reid added 13 points, eight rebounds and four blocks. “There are some effort mistakes, too,"" Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. “Those are ones we can’t have.” Minnesota has lost four straight and 11 of its last 12 after starting the season 2-0. The same two teams faced earlier this week when the Hawks beat the Timberwolves 108-97 in Atlanta despite a season-high 24 turnovers. Each team played a game in between meetings, with Minnesota dropping a home game to Orlando and Atlanta beating the Pistons at home. TIP-INS Hawks: Capela recorded his sixth straight double-double and his ninth overall this season. … It was the 13th 40-point game of Young’s career and first this season. Timberwolves: PG Ricky Rubio returned to action Friday after missing two games due to the league’s health and safety protocols. Rubio was the first player off the bench for Minnesota. … Jake Layman was the only player on the active roster who did not play in the first half Friday. REMEMBERING HANK AARON Pierce spoke extensively before Friday’s game about Hank Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player who died earlier Friday. Aaron, who spent 21 of his 23 years playing for the Atlanta Braves, spoke to the Hawks at a practice during Pierce’s first season as coach during the 2018-19 season. Before Aaron addressed the team, Pierce had a chance to speak 1-on-1 for a few minutes with Aaron. That conversation sticks with him to this day. “For me, as an adult, I met a hero, I met an idol, I met a star. It’s still an awe moment for me,” Pierce said. “I was mostly impressed with his humility, him feeling like it was an opportunity for him. Really it was an opportunity for us to listen to him, to listen to his stories, for him to explain in his own words what he went through leading up to breaking the (home run) record.”","401267396"
"Luka Doncic goes for 36 points, 11 assists and 9 rebounds in the Mavericks' 122-117 win vs. the Spurs. (2:10) SAN ANTONIO -- — Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks are learning to keep their cool when the game gets heated, and that proved meaningful against the San Antonio Spurs. Doncic had 36 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds and the Mavericks withstood a late rally to beat the Spurs 122-117 on Friday night. The Mavericks believe losing several games in the final minutes last season has helped their poise to start this season. “We’ve gotten a year older a year wiser,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “We spent more time working on it. Understating that’s a big part of where we want to go. The biggest thing is we kept our cool.” The Mavericks won their second straight after a three-game losing streak. The Spurs are 2-5 at home. San Antonio lost starting point guard Dejounte Murray in the opening minute. The severity of the injury is unknown, but Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said, “I think he is going to be fine,” following the game. DeMar DeRozan had 29 points for San Antonio, LaMarcus Aldridge added 26, and Keldon Johnson had 17 points and 14 rebounds. After trailing by as many as 18 points, the Spurs pulled to 113-107 with four minutes remaining on a turnaround left-handed hook by Aldridge. Two minutes later, DeRozan cut the advantage to 113-111 with a pair of free throws. “They were creating some confusion with switching and things like that,” Carlisle said. DeRozan made one of two free throws to pull the Spurs within 113-112. Doncic then made an 11-footer and then drove on the ensuing possession and assisted on Jalen Brunson’s 3-pointer. “I think the biggest thing is making better decisions,” Doncic said. “Give up good shots for better shots. I think that’s the key to the end of our games.” Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 21 points each for the Mavericks. Murray injured his left ankle on Porzingis’ 14-foot jumper 59 seconds into the game, appearing to get his feet entangled with the Mavericks’ center. Murray remained on the court briefly before quickly rising and limping directly to the locker room. Murray’s absence had a big impact on San Antonio’s perimeter defense in the first half. The Mavericks were 14 for 39 on 3-pointers, including 10 for 21 in the first half. Dallas entered the game averaging 12.6 3-pointers on 37.6 attempts. “Everybody fought,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said of the late rally. “If everybody had not fought being down by 18, we would have lost by 25 or 30. So everybody deserves credit for hanging in and continuing to compete and not get down.” TIP-INS Mavericks: Doncic fell a rebound shy of his sixth triple-double of the season. In just his third season with the Mavericks, Doncic is the franchise leader in triple-doubles with 30. … Dorian Finney-Smith, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell and Josh Richardson were because of health and safety protocols.

They have lost each of those games. ... San Antonio made seven 3-pointers in the first quarter tonight, which is one shy of its franchise record for a single quarter. … Tre Jones entered the game in the first quarter for the earliest action of his rookie season.

"Nikola Jokic passes the ball so quick you need to see the replay. (0:21) PHOENIX -- — Denver coach Michael Malone is a little exasperated with his players after 15 games. Sometimes the Nuggets look like one of the NBA's best teams. Sometimes they've looked awful. He's just thankful the good version showed up in time on Friday night. Nikola Jokic scored 31 points, Gary Harris added 19 and the Nuggets rallied to force overtime before beating the Phoenix Suns 130-126. The win pushed Denver above .500 for the first time this season at 8-7. “We’ve shown we can do it,” Malone said. “The challenge is to do it more consistently and as close to 48 minutes as possible.” Will Barton pushed the Nuggets ahead 124-123 with 1:37 left in overtime on a driving layup and Jamal Murray's 13-foot jumper put them up three points with 28.5 seconds left. Denver held on from that point, winning for the third time in four games to improve to 8-7 this season. Devin Booker led the Suns with 31 points but took a hard fall late in overtime and didn't play the final few possessions. Phoenix's offense looked discombobulated without its leading scorer on the floor and didn't score a field goal until the final seconds when it was too late. Suns coach Monty Williams said that Booker hurt his left hamstring and likely wouldn't play on Saturday night in the rematch between the two teams. Suns forward Deandre Ayton had 27 points and 13 rebounds, shooting 11 of 13 from the field. Mikal Bridges added 24 points and 10 rebounds and was 6 of 8 from 3-point range. Denver shot nearly 52% from the field and six players scored in double figures. Jokic added 10 rebounds and eight assists and was a big part of the reason the Nuggets poured in 80 points in the paint. “I didn’t do what I was supposed to do,” Ayton said. “They had 80 points in the paint tonight and that is on me. I have to be more of an anchor be more of a presence down low just to shut it down early.” The Suns had a 14-point lead at halftime but Denver sliced that deficit to 95-91 by the end of the third quarter. The Nuggets took their first lead since the opening minute when PJ Dozier made a driving layup with 8:33 left that made it 98-97. “They have been together for a while so they have been in a lot more game like that, (playoff-type) games like that,” Bridges said. “Credit to them but if we limit the turnovers, we have a chance to win it.” Jokic made a lay-up in the lane to tie the game at 114 with about a 1:07 left in regulation. Both teams had a couple chances to push ahead in the final minute but shots wouldn't fall. The Suns jumped out to a 68-54 lead at halftime. Booker had 19 points and Bridges added 17 after hitting all five of his 3-pointers. Chris Paul had 14 assists, which tied a franchise record for the most in a half. Jokic led the Nuggets with 16 points. TIP-INS Nuggets: F Michael Porter Jr. played for the first time since Dec. 29 after missing 10 games while in the league's COVID-19 health and safety protocols.

He had some great moves, great finishes around the basket as always,” teammate Mike Muscala said of Gilgeous-Alexander. “He makes the game easier for everybody on the court.” The Thunder were in catch-up mode most of the way before dropping their second straight and fourth in five games. They were just 14 of 42 from 3-point range and only got to the free throw line 13 times. “We had a bad start,” Dort said. “We had to talk to each other, pick it up, and play harder.” The Clippers grabbed control in the first half, scoring 36 points in the first quarter and 34 in the second on 63% shooting. They had scoring runs of 21-2 and 11-4 in the first.

But Leonard quickly put the Clippers ahead 91-75, running off six in a row. Muscala hit another 3-pointer that left the Thunder trailing by 13 going into the fourth. “Teams are going to make runs, regardless of it’s a top team or a young team,” George said. “You got to learn how to win in adversity and learn how to weather the storm.

(0:27) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- — Harrison Barnes had 21 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, and the Sacramento Kings overcame a cold shooting spell late in the fourth quarter to hold off the New York Knicks 103-94 on Friday night and end a four-game losing streak. The Kings made only three shots over the final six minutes but made up for it by going 7 of 8 on free throws down the stretch. “I felt like they kind of pushed us around a little bit in the first half and we were able to respond in the second,” Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. “That’s one of the top defensive teams in the league. A good game to get a win and get one in that fashion where we had to fight, fight, fight the whole game.” De’Aaron Fox added 22 points and seven assists for Sacramento, which had lost nine of its previous 11. Richaun Holmes had 10 points, 14 rebounds and matched his career high of six blocks. The Kings ended their skid by getting steady play across the board offensively and an improved effort on the defensive end. Sacramento also matched New York’s physicality, which helped swing the momentum in the second half. “What we have to understand is nobody’s coming to save us,” said Kings rookie Tyrese Haliburton, who had 16 points and four blocks. “We have to put pressure on the opposing team and match the physicality and show that we’re not going to shy away.” Julius Randle had 26 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. RJ Barrett added 21 points and seven rebounds. “This was a weird, weird game for us,” Randle said. “We started off slow, worked our way out of it and was up at the half. The third and fourth quarter was a little bit of a funk. I don’t even know what happened. The ball stuck a little bit.” New York’s offense also iced up late in the fourth quarter. The Knicks missed six of their final nine attempts over the last five minutes. “Obviously we didn’t finish well,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “I did like the fight in the fourth quarter to come back, but we didn’t close it out. It’s hard to win on the road if you’re not doing all the little things. The games keep coming. We have to improve.” TIP-INS Knicks: Alec Burks had nine points and five rebounds in 27 minutes in his second game back from an ankle injury that sidelined him for three weeks. … Thibodeau won a challenge in the third quarter to overturn a defensive foul call against guard Elfrid Payton. … New York went into the night averaging 96 points over its previous seven games. Kings: Sacramento set a season high with 14 blocks. … The Kings held a 15-0 advantage in fast-break points. … Marvin Bagley III fouled out with 55 seconds left to play. HELP WANTED Thibodeau noted that part of the problem came when the Kings double-teamed Randle in the post and he had trouble finding an open teammate to pass to. Randle agreed. “In the post they were coming right away,” he said. “It was a hard aggressive trap.” SHOT CLOCK SNAFU The game was delayed six minutes due to a shot clock malfunction immediately following Fox’s jumper 28 seconds into the first quarter. Players from both teams milled about the court during the delay, while Sacramento’s Buddy Hield chatted with the referees near the scorers table. TRIBUTE TO HAMMERIN’ HANK A video tribute to baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron played during a timeout in the first half. Aaron, the former home run king, died earlier in the day at the age of 86.","401267401"
"Reggie Miller surprises Steph Curry to congratulate him for moving into second place on the NBA's all-time 3-pointer list. (2:14) SALT LAKE CITY -- — Donovan Mitchell had 23 points, seven rebounds and six assists as the Utah Jazz routed the Golden State Warriors 127-108 on Saturday night for their eighth straight victory. Stephen Curry made five 3-pointers for the Warriors to give him 2,562 in his career — passing Reggie Miller for second place in NBA history. Ray Allen is first with 2,973. “That’s pretty dope,” Curry said. “We got our head beat tonight, but I was trying to still enjoy it. After I made the third one, I knew that was a big one, and then to make that fourth one in the third quarter was pretty special. Something I’ve been looking forward to for a very long time.” Mike Conley scored 17 points and hit five 3s for the Jazz, who led by 30 at halftime and opened a 40-point bulge early in the fourth quarter. Bojan Bogdanovic had 14 points, seven rebounds and a career-high eight assists. Rudy Gobert added 11 points and 14 boards as six Utah players scored in double figures. Curry finished with 24 points, seven rebounds and seven assists to lead Golden State. Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman each scored 13. Utah shot 52% from the field in the first half. The Jazz had 18 assists on 28 baskets before halftime while committing only four turnovers. They finished with 28 assists. “It’s something we really love doing,” Mitchell said. “That’s what's special about this team. We love to make the extra pass.” The Jazz scored baskets on each of their first five possessions to sprint out to a 14-0 lead and made eight 3-pointers in the first quarter. Conley and Royce O’Neale each drained a trio of 3s in the period. “Utah came out on fire,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “They executed their offense beautifully.” Golden State trailed from start to finish. “Our first four possessions we got some decent looks and missed them,” Curry said. “Then they came down, 3-3-3-3, and the rest is history after that. Our identity has to be getting stops — at least making them take difficult shots and trying to get some momentum that then flows into the offensive end.” Golden State found some footing behind Curry, after missing nine of its first 10 shots. Curry scored four baskets and assisted on five others to help the Warriors cut the Jazz lead to 36-28. Overall, the Warriors made 12 of their final 15 shots in the quarter. Golden State could not build on that momentum during the second period, though. The Warriors simply could not figure out how to slow down the Jazz as they closed the first half on a 24-8 run. Conley and Mitchell punctuated the decisive spurt with consecutive 3s, giving the Jazz a 77-47 halftime lead. The Warriors made just six baskets in the second quarter. “We want to defend collectively,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “I think our guys are seeing it collectively. It’s not one guy’s job. Every guy has to do the job.” Utah went up 115-75 on a 3-pointer from Jordan Clarkson with 10:05 left. DROPPING IN Miller and his son, Ryker, joined the Warriors’ postgame Zoom call to congratulate Curry. Miller praised Curry for putting in countless hours to become such a sensational outside shooter. Curry revealed how he’s tried to emulate Miller with how he shoots and moves off the ball. He also said growing up around the game as the son of an NBA player helped him develop the right habits to become an effective shooter. “I have a certain style of playing the game that I love and … I love to put the work in,” Curry said. “And that’s something that I hope people understand.” TIP-INS Warriors: Curry passed Miller, who had 2,560 3-pointers, with his first basket of the third quarter. ... Kevon Looney made his second 3 of the season in the third. … Golden State had 30 assists on 42 baskets. Jazz: Bogdanovic matched his previous career high of seven assists, set in 2016, by halftime. He had a season high of three assists coming into the game. … Mitchell has shot 50% or better from the field seven times in the last eight games. … Utah outrebounded Golden State 69-41, and eight players made a 3-pointer. “When we’re going on both ends, we’re a tough team to play against,” guard Joe Ingles said.","401267402"
"Joel Embiid tallies 33 points and adds 14 rebounds as Philadelphia edges Detroit 114-110. (1:53) DETROIT -- — Joel Embiid had 33 points and 14 rebounds, and his two free throws with 7.2 seconds left helped the Philadelphia 76ers seal a 114-110 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. Ben Simmons added 20 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for the 76ers, and he made a couple big free throws of his own in the final minute. Philadelphia is atop the Eastern Conference but didn't push its lead over the last-place Pistons into double figures until early in the fourth quarter. That was when Dwight Howard's dunk put the 76ers up 99-88. Detroit trailed 110-108 after Jerami Grant made a 3-pointer with 28.5 seconds left, but Simmons calmly made two free throws to push the lead to four. “I have the confidence to step up and knock it down,” Simmons said. “Especially late game.” Delon Wright's layup made it 112-110, but Embiid closed the game out with his free throws and finished 12 of 17 from the line. Wayne Ellington scored 17 points for the Pistons, who led 63-61 at halftime and kept the game competitive despite being without Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose. “I loved the effort, I loved the togetherness guys played with,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""We continue to do that, good things are going to happen.” Embiid scored 80 points in his previous two games, both wins over Boston. He said he had a sore back following a hard fall on his tailbone in Friday's game against the Celtics, but he was able to play, and the Pistons had all sorts of trouble stopping him. Embiid scored 21 points in the first half, keeping the 76ers within two even though Detroit outscored Philadelphia 27-6 from beyond the arc through two quarters. TIP-INS 76ers: Howard received a technical foul in the second quarter, evidently for complaining to officials after his shorts appeared to be torn. Pistons: Ellington went 4 of 6 from 3-point range and is 24 of 41 from long distance in the past five games. ... Griffin sat out to manage a left knee injury, and Rose was out with left knee soreness. SOLID NIGHT Simmons hasn't been great from the line in his career. Last season, he shot 62%, and the previous two seasons were worse than that. He was 10 of 12 on Saturday, however. “Just having that confidence to knock those free throws down in a close game is big right now,"" teammate Tobias Harris said. Philadelphia went 30 of 38 as a team.","401267403"
"Kyrie Irving and Bam Adebayo attempt to swap jerseys after the game, but a member of the Heat security team pulls Adebayo away. (0:25) NEW YORK -- — Brooklyn's three superstars were just enough to overcome Bam Adebayo's brilliant individual effort. Kevin Durant scored 31 points, Kyrie Irving took over late and had 28 and the Nets overcame Adebayo's career-high 41 points to beat the Miami Heat 128-124 on Saturday night. James Harden finished with 12 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds as the Nets won for the first time with their Big Three playing together. They lost consecutive games with dismal defensive efforts in Cleveland and barely got enough stops to hold off a short-handed Heat team that had been limited to 81 points by Toronto a night earlier. “It’s not every day you see this collection of guys playing together in NBA history, so we want to take full advantage of that,” Irving said. Irving helped pull the Nets through with 12 points in the final 5:48 after the Heat had erased nearly all of an 18-point deficit. Joe Harris added 23 points and seven 3-pointers for Brooklyn, but the Nets needed Irving's 18 points in the final quarter of a game they had largely controlled. “All three of those guys, they’re just so damn skilled. Off the dribble, their shooting ability, their ability to see open players, and that’s why they're three of the best in this business,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “And those are shots that only great players can manufacture.” Goran Dragic scored 19 points and Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson each had 18 for the Heat, who remain without Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro. Adebayo also had nine assists while blowing past his previous best scoring night of 30 points. “I wish we’d gotten the W; 40 don’t mean nothing unless you got the W, for real,” Adebayo said. Durant was 5 for 5 and scored 13 points in the third quarter, with the last of his three 3-pointers in the period making it 96-80. Adebayo beat the buzzer with a jumper, than Miami opened the fourth with a 13-0 run to get within 96-95. “We were up 20 points throughout, 16, 14 going to the fourth quarter, so we were in good shape. But we’ve got to put together four quarters of great basketball,” Durant said. Irving, Harden and Durant quickly combined for eight straight points but Adebayo kept coming, and the Nets needed a couple of clutch baskets from Irving and late free throws to pull it out. Harris had four 3-pointers and 12 points in the first quarter. The Nets were ahead 60-42 with a little more than two minutes left in the half, but Miami trimmed it to 66-56 on Adebayo's 3-pointer just before the buzzer. Harden didn't make a basket until the fourth, threatening to go without one in a game for the first time since he left Oklahoma City. He finally attempted his first shot with 0.7 seconds left in the first quarter and was fouled behind the arc, making all three free throws for a 36-25 lead. TIP-INS Heat: Moe Harkless started at forward but exited in the second quarter with a bruised left thigh after banging legs with a Nets player along the baseline. He hadn't even played in the series opener against Toronto and got only six minutes Friday. Nets: Jeff Green scored 11 points. ... The Nets came in averaging an NBA-best 121.5 points at home. THE SHIRT OFF HIS BACK Irving and Adebayo have been friends for years but that means little during the coronavirus pandemic. Irving was trying to get Adebayo’s pink-and-blue Heat jersey after the game before security intervened, as new NBA initiatives try to keep opposing players separated to stop the spread of the virus. “Oh, he definitely wants it,” Adebayo said. “I’m going to send him one on my own time.” Irving was fined $50,000 recently for not wearing a mask during an indoor gathering and said he was trying to stay out of trouble. “I just want to follow NBA protocols,” he said. LINE THEM UP Miami used its 11th different starting lineup in its 15th game, while coach Steve Nash sent out a different first five for the 12th time in Brooklyn's 18 games. Part of that is because of player absences and part because he is still experimenting following the Harden trade, which he may still need to do before settling on his preferred starters. “I'm not sure we’re there yet,"" Nash said. ""It might be ideal to be there but I don’t know that we are, so I don’t want to commit to that yet.”","401267404"
"Anthony Davis emerges from his offensive slump against the Bulls, producing 26 points on 10-of-12 shooting from the field and 2-of-2 from 3-point range in the first half. (1:58) CHICAGO -- — Anthony Davis missed seeing his family members in the stands. They would have witnessed quite a performance had they been allowed in the arena. Davis dominated with a season-high 37 points against his hometown team, LeBron James added 17 points and 11 rebounds and the Lakers beat the Chicago Bulls 101-90 on Saturday. The defending NBA champions improved to 9-0 on the road and a league-best 13-4 overall. And this one never was in doubt. Davis scored 26 points in the highest scoring half by a Laker this season as Los Angeles grabbed a 63-33 lead. The seven-time All-Star shot 14 of 21, nailing two 3-pointers, and grabbed six rebounds. “It's tough. Usually, when I come home I get to see my family,” he said. “They come to the games and support me. Being in the Western Conference my entire career so far, I only come home once during the season. I miss seeing them in the stands and coming out and cheering me on, supporting me. That was different.” James, coming off a season-high 34-point outing in a win at Milwaukee two nights earlier, had six assists and six turnovers. And the Lakers won their eighth in a row against Chicago. The Bulls had won three in a row and matched a franchise record by scoring 115 or more in seven straight games. But against stingy Los Angeles, they struggled, particularly in the early going. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 21 points and 10 rebounds. Coby White added 14 points and seven rebounds. “The first half, we just did not play to our identity like we had been trying to play to,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I thought we penetrated and we charged too much. We didn't find open people when they were there. They were really coming in and protecting the paint. We had some turnovers, gave up some offensive rebounds. The first half, it wasn't who we've been.” DOMINANT START The Lakers held off the Bulls 117-115 in Los Angeles two weeks earlier with Davis and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missing the game because of injuries. Los Angeles wasted no time taking control in this one. Davis came in averaging 21.1 points — down five from last season. But he set the tone as the Lakers raced out to a 20-6 lead. He scored 13 of Los Angeles' first 16 points, with three dunks in that stretch. “We want to make sure we're playing through him as much as possible,” coach Frank Vogel said. “We have a lot of new guys on this team, so there's been times early in the season where myself and even AD has been trying to get other guys comfortable. We knew this week, the beginning of this trip, was a time to really start having him be more assertive.” Davis also made two 3-pointers late in the half, including one in the closing minute to make it 61-31. And after Chicago's Coby White hit a pull-up jumper, Dennis Schroder drove for a layup to bump the lead back to 30. The Bulls went on a 14-2 run late in the third quarter to pull within 79-66. But back-to-back baskets by Davis made it a 17-point game heading to the fourth. TIP-INS Lakers: Davis' previous season high was 34 points against San Antonio on Jan. 1. He scored a career-high 59 for New Orleans at Detroit on Feb. 21, 2016. ... The Lakers were 4 for 19 on 3-pointers after tying a season-high by making 19 of 37 against Milwaukee. ... F Jared Dudley (sore right calf) remains a “game or two” away from returning from an injury that has kept him out the past seven, Vogel said. Bulls: Chicago shot 39 about percent from the field and made 8 of 25 3-pointers. ... Coach Billy Donovan said C Wendell Carter Jr. (quad) is improving, though he's not sure if he'll be available Monday against Boston after missing the past two games. “He's made progress. He is feeling better,” Donovan said. ... The Bulls also held out Otto Porter Jr. after he played the previous night at Charlotte.","401267405"
"Josh Okogie slips a pass behind his back to Jarred Vanderbilt for a two-handed jam. (0:18) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Naz Reid scored 20 points to lead a balanced offensive effort and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the New Orleans Pelicans 120-110 on Saturday night. Anthony Edwards scored 18 points and Jared Vanderbilt set career highs with 16 points and 11 rebounds for Minnesota, which snapped a four-game skid. Jarrett Culver and Malik Beasley each scored 16 points, and Jordan McLaughlin added 11. Brandon Ingram led New Orleans with 30 points. Eric Bledsoe added 28 and Zion Williamson finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Pelicans, who have lost three straight and eight of their last nine. Minnesota center Karl-Anthony Towns missed his fourth straight game after testing positive for the coronavirus on Jan. 15. The Timberwolves are 2-9 without Towns in the lineup this season. “We have a lot of good players, talented players,” guard Ricky Rubio said, “but it’s a team sport. You can have a guy or two have huge nights, but you need everyone playing the game the right way to win.” After trailing by a point at halftime, Minnesota used a 16-3 run to pull ahead. Reid and Vanderbilt each scored four points, and the Pelicans called a timeout after Beasley went coast to coast with for a layup that gave the Timberwolves a 75-69 lead. Vanderbilt capped the run by tipping in a missed shot to put Minnesota head by 10. Bledsoe finally broke through for New Orleans when he put back his own miss, but Culver countered with a 3-pointer and an 82-71 Timberwolves lead. The Pelicans went 4 1/2 minutes without a field goal over that stretch, missing 11 straight shots from the floor. Even after hitting its final two shots of the quarter, New Orleans shot 5 for 24 and missed all four of its 3-pointers in the third. The Pelicans also committed 21 turnovers, which the Timberwolves converted into 20 points. That left New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy questioning his team’s effort. “I certainly will take my share of the blame, but we talked after the game, some guys are going to have to take some personable responsibility,” Van Gundy said. “You can’t have the guy you’re guarding playing harder than you on a regular basis.” The Timberwolves pushed their lead to 18 midway through the fourth and kept New Orleans at arm’s length the rest of the way. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans wrapped up a six-game road swing with at 1-5 record. The Pelicans have played the sixth-toughest schedule in the NBA. Timberwolves: Reid’s 20 points matched his career high. ... The Wolves just missed having eight players in double figures. Rubio scored 9 points and added 7 assists, while Josh Okogie also had 9 points to go with 5 steals. PANDEMIC PROBLEMS In addition to Towns, Minnesota forward Juancho Hernangomez was sidelined after a positive coronavirus test. Meanwhile, guard D’Angelo Russell (rest) also sat out, leaving the Wolves without their top two scorers (Towns and Russell) and top two rebounders (Towns and Hernangomez). QUOTABLE “The formula we talk about is defend, rebound and take care of the ball, and tonight the answers to that were no, no, and none,"" Van Gundy said.","401267406"
"DeMarcus Cousins backs down his defender and shakes the rim on the one-handed slam. (0:16) DALLAS -- — Eric Gordon scored a season-high 33 points, DeMarcus Cousins had his best game for Houston with 28 points and 17 rebounds and the Rockets beat the Dallas Mavericks 133-108 on Saturday night. John Wall had seven points and eight assists after missing five straight games with right knee soreness. It was the first game for Wall since the James Harden trade. The Rockets were without a key piece of that deal as Victor Oladipo rested a sore right quadriceps. Luka Doncic scored 26 points while sitting the entire fourth quarter with the game out of reach. The Slovenian star was again without European sidekick Kristaps Porzingis, who rested his surgically repaired right knee as the Mavericks finished five games in seven days by completing their second back-to-back in that stretch. The Rockets were also playing on a second consecutive night for the first time this season and won both to improve to 3-3 since the Harden trade. “It was a very complete game for us on both ends of the floor, especially on a back to back,” coach Stephen Silas said a night after a 103-102 victory at Detroit. “Really good trip for us.” Houston never trailed as Cousins opened the scoring with a three-point play and scored eight points in the first three minutes. Cousins matched his most points since a torn Achilles tendon ended his final season with New Orleans in 2017-18. Gordon was 6 of 9 from 3-point range as the Rockets shot 43% (16 of 37) from beyond the arc. Cousins, who came in shooting 26% overall and 24% from long range, was 9 of 15, including 4 of 8 from 3. “My thing is the shot quality,” Silas said about Cousins. “He works conscientiously on his 3-point shot. I knew it would come around. We just had to make sure he was getting good, quality shots. He did that tonight.” The Rockets led 70-59 after the highest-scoring half against Dallas this season. The Mavericks pulled within 74-71 early in the third quarter before Houston finished the quarter on a 30-12 run. “We don’t have any excuses,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. “The energy was a factor. We were able to get it up in spurts, but weren’t able to sustain it. They had more juice.” TIP-INS Rockets: Wall played 21 minutes when coach Stephen Silas said he would watch his minutes closely and make sure he didn't play long stretches. ... David Mwaba scored a season-high 18 points, and Mason Jones had 16. Mavericks: Tim Hardaway Jr., who was 0 of 12 from the field in the most recent Dallas loss against Toronto, missed all five shots in the first half before going 4 of 8 after halftime and finishing with 15 points. ... Doncic had eight assists and five rebounds. ... Boban Marjanovic matched Hardaway with 15 points, and Trey Burke had 13. SITTING PORZINGIS Carlisle said the Mavericks figured they would rest Porzingis given it was their seventh game in 11 days since the 7-foot-3 Latvian made his debut after the offseason surgery. Carlisle left little doubt Dallas was upbeat about Porzingis’ progress. “He’s doing exceptionally well,” Carlisle said. “It was a decision we talked about a lot, and that was one reason he didn’t get downgraded until later in the day. Things are in a really good place.” HOMECOMING, SORT OF Silas was back in Dallas after the first-year Rockets coach spent the past two seasons as an assistant with the Mavericks. But it wasn’t much of a homecoming. First of all, Silas’ family made the move from Dallas to Houston the day before the game, “so we missed each other.” Even if his family had still been in town, Silas wouldn’t have been able to see them because of COVID-19 protocols. “Obviously, being here, a place that’s so close to my heart but no fans and you’re not allowed to even shake their hands or hug,” Silas said. “Yeah, we’re going to Dallas, but it’s on a back-to-back and there’s no fans and I can’t even take a walk on the Katy Trail (near the Mavericks’ arena). It's a downer.”","401267407"
"Off the rebound, JaMychal Green throws up a shot in wild fashion and the Nuggets' bench loves it. (0:25) PHOENIX -- — There was extra basketball played in Phoenix for a second straight night and it was all Jamal Murray's fault. The fifth-year Nuggets guard has done some of the finest work in his NBA career against the Suns and the good times lasted deep into Saturday evening largely because of his clutch shooting. Murray's difficult, off-balance 3-pointer at the end of regulation forced overtime  and Denver outlasted Phoenix 120-112 in two overtimes. Nikola Jokic scored 29 points and grabbed 22 rebounds while Murray added 26 points. “This felt like a playoff game,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “Playing the same team, starters playing in double OT, you ask a lot of your starters and they deliver.” It was the second straight impressive win for the Nuggets, who have won eight of their past 11 games. Denver won 130-126 in a single overtime Friday after rallying from a 14-point halftime deficit. Saturday's game was even more entertaining with the two teams trading last-second, game-tying 3s. Murray hit his while falling out of bounds with Deandre Ayton in his face as time expired in regulation. Phoenix's Jae Crowder responded with a 3-pointer with 0.7 seconds left in the first overtime to send the game deeper into the night. By comparison, the final minutes were boring. The Nuggets scored the first five points of the second overtime and never trailed. The Suns played without All-Star guard Devin Booker for the first time this season. Averaging a team-high 22.9 points, he hurt his left hamstring Friday. Jokic scored 12 of his 29 points during the two overtimes. Michael Porter Jr. came off the bench to score 14 points and grab 11 rebounds. “I was feeling good,” Jokic said. “When you’re playing, you’re feeling good ... It’s after the game when you feel it.” Chris Paul hit a 15-foot jumper with 12 seconds left in regulation to put the Suns ahead 98-95 but Murray responded with his clutch 3-pointer. The 6-foot-11 Ayton had a hand right in his face, but the ball splashed through the next anyway. Murray came into the game averaging 20.8 points against the Suns in his career, which is his most against any team. The first overtime was just as tight as the fourth quarter. Jokic made a smooth move in the post to get past Frank Kaminsky, making a layup while being fouled with 28 seconds left. He made the free throw to put the Nuggets up 104-102. The Suns had a chance to take the lead when Abdel Nader was fouled on a 3-pointer from the corner, but he missed two of three free throws. Jokic's two free throws put Denver ahead 106-103 before Crowder responded with a 3 with 0.7 seconds left to tie it and force even more basketball. It was Crowder's sixth 3-pointer of the night. Crowder and Paul led the Suns with 21 points each. Paul also had 13 assists. Cam Johnson scored 19 points but didn't play in the final minutes because of muscle cramps. “We did play very hard, put it out there,” Johnson said. “It is frustrating, very frustrating.” Suns coach Monty Williams said it was hard to be mad about his team's effort. He added that he felt his team — playing without Booker — got tired in the final minutes and couldn't quite finish. “I was just unbelievably proud of how they competed tonight,” Williams said. “We could have mailed it in coming off a tough one.” The Nuggets got a big boost from their bench, which added 52 points. Ayton had 15 points and eight rebounds in the first half as the Suns pushed to a 61-58 halftime lead. Paul had 12 assists before the break, one day after tying a franchise record with 14 assists in the first half.

"Fred VanVleet takes the contact and somehow gets the shot to fall from mid-range. (0:20) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Toronto coach Nick Nurse knew needed somebody to replace the scoring void left by two missing All-Stars. OG Anunoby delivered with jab after jab Sunday. He scored a season-high 30 points, grabbed eight rebounds, defended well and made three of four free throws in the final minute to give the surging Raptors a 107-102 victory over the Indiana Pacers. “I think it comes with opportunity, really,” coach Nick Nurse said. “We had a couple of guys (Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam) who are a good percentage of our offense out, so it’s going to shift somewhere. Tonight it shifted to OG.” Thanks largely to Anunoby’s strong game and a solid supporting cast, the Raptors have won two straight and five of their last six. Plus, they maintained their dominance over the Pacers, who have lost six straight season series to Toronto. Anunoby, the former Indiana University star, was the key. He went 9 of 16 from the field, 4 of 6 on 3-pointers and 8 of 10 from the free-throw line and he excelled defensively, too, helping to hold Domantas Sabonis, Indiana's All-Star forward, scoreless in the second half. “They played good individual defense and played really well in the gaps,” said Myles Turner, who led Indiana with 25 points and six blocks. “I would say he (Anunoby) was aggressive, chose his spots well, got downhill and got to the free-throw line. He had a good night.” The Pacers played catch-up most of the game after falling behind midway through the second quarter. Toronto, with the help of Anunoby, extended the lead to 58-47 at the half. Indiana finally regained the lead briefly in the fourth quarter, twice. But the Raptors broke an 82-all tie with an 8-0 run and when Indiana tied the score again with 1:07 to play, Anunoby made three of four free throws. Toronto scored the final five points to hand Indiana its third loss in four games. “They played hard, that’s for sure,"" Nurse said. “I've really got to compliment the whole group there."" TIP-INS Raptors: Anunoby extended his streak of double-figure scoring games to eight. He also made four 3s, giving him 27 in the last eight games. ... Fred VanVleet scored 21 points and has made at least one 3-pointer in a franchise-record 48 consecutive games. ... Toronto forced 13 turnovers and went 10 of 18 on 3s in the first half. ... Norman Powell added 20 points. Pacers: Sabonis had 10 points and 10 rebounds in the first half alone for his 16th consecutive double-double to open the season. It's the longest streak of his career and the longest in Indiana's NBA era. He finished with 19 rebounds and five assists. ... Justin Holiday had 16 points and 10 rebounds. ...

Team officials announced previously they would cap attendance at 1,000. After Monday night, they will consider increasing the capacity.

"Jaylen Brown goes for 33 points in 19 minutes as the Celtics cruise past the Cavaliers 141-103. (2:09) BOSTON -- — Jaylen Brown scored 20 of his 33 points in the third quarter and the Boston Celtics snapped their three-game losing streak Sunday night by cruising to a 141-103 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Kemba Walker added 21 points, Daniel Theis scored 17, Carsen Edwards had 15 and Marcus Smart had 12 for Boston, which posted a season high in points in a half, taking a 73-51 edge into intermission. Brown played just 19 minutes. “We needed a win,” Brown said. “We lost three in a row. Being back on our floor, we wanted to make sure we came out with great intensity and we did.” Collin Sexton led Cleveland with 13 points, far below his team-leading average of 26.8 per game, as the Cavaliers' three-game winning streak ended. Coming off impressive back-to-back victories over the Brooklyn Nets in which they scored 147 and 125 points, respectively, the Cavaliers were simply never in this one. Boston pushed the ball out on the fast break, getting several easy looks that it converted while the Cavaliers missed 10 of their initial 13 shots. “I thought our defensive intensity was good for most of the game and I thought our offense fed off of it,” Boston coach Brad Stevens said. Brown made it look easy in his limited playing time. He's scored 25 or more in four straight games, the longest stretch of his career. “He’s in a great rhythm scoring,” Stevens said. Behind Smart’s 10 points and Brown’s nine, the Celtics shot 60% and pulled to a 38-21 lead after the opening quarter. They pushed it to 41-21 on Walker’s 3-pointer on the first possession of the second quarter. “We can't get complacent. We won three games in a row,"" said Cleveland guard Jarrett Allen, who scored 12 points. “We came out flat, almost like we expected to win. We have to come out hungry.” The Celtics used a 15-0 spree to pull ahead 96-59 on Walker’s 3-pointer from the left wing that sailed through the net as he was falling to the floor with 6 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. It came a possession after Brown nailed a 3 from directly in front of Cleveland’s bench. From there, both coaches gave ample playing time to their reserves. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Sexton had scored 20 or more points in 15 straight games. ... Andre Drummond had 11 points and five rebounds, his second time this season falling short of a double-double. ... F Kevin Love missed his 13th straight with a strained calf. Celtics: Rookie guard Payton Pritchard was sidelined with a Grade 1 right MCL sprain he sustained in the last game. ... No starter played more than 27 minutes. ... Like they did before the previous two games, the players huddled with their arms around each other during the national anthem. ... Stevens had a one-word answer after when asked if Walker would play Monday in consecutive games: “No.” Walker has been working his way back from a left knee injury that delayed his start to the season. TATUM'S RETURN Jayson Tatum has been cleared to play Monday night against the Chicago Bulls, Stevens said. Tatum missed his fifth straight game Sunday due to COVID-19 protocols. HE LOOKS FAMILIAR Boston C Tristan Thompson spent his first nine seasons with Cleveland before signing as a free agent with the Celtics during the offseason.

"Kawhi Leonard caps a 34-point performance with a two-handed jam to put the game away. (0:41) LOS ANGELES -- — Kawhi Leonard scored 34 points and the Los Angeles Clippers beat Oklahoma City 108-101 on Sunday for their seventh consecutive victory and second straight over the Thunder. Serge Ibaka added 17 points. At 13-4, the Clippers are tied with the Lakers for the best record in the NBA. Leonard's total was one off his season high to go with nine rebounds and eight assists. He had 31 points in LA's 14-point win over the Thunder on Friday night. “On a night when we weren’t making shots, it was a good, tough, grind-out win for us,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “Kawhi had it going so we played through him a lot, especially in the second half. We had to ride him pretty hard just so we could continue to keep the lead.” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 23 points against his former team, and George Hill added 22 points. Oklahoma City has lost three in a row and five of six. “It was a huge improvement from the first game,” forward Isaiah Roby said. “We came out with a lot more fight this game.” Hill hit three straight 3-pointers for the Thunder after they trailed by 17 in the fourth. Reggie Jackson turned the ball over and Luguentz Dort fed Gilgeous-Alexander for a dunk that capped 11 consecutive points and cut their deficit to 102-96. Leonard dunked to stop the Thunder's run. Gilgeous-Alexander dribbled inside and scored, getting the Thunder back within six. Oklahoma City was forced to foul in the closing seconds and Jackson made 4 of 6 free throws to close it out. “He did a great job of just getting us the lead,” Jackson said of Leonard. “They were loading up on Kawhi and Paul. They did a great job of attacking.” The Thunder hung around in the third, cutting their deficit to 72-67. But Leonard hit a 3-pointer and another basket, quickly restoring the Clippers' lead to double digits. They were bolstered by Jackson's 10 points, including eight in a row, after he started the second half. “We’re playing team basketball and sharing the ball,” Leonard said. “We're having some breakdowns defensively, but we’re staying positive.” The Thunder fell behind by 17 points in the first half and rallied to close within eight three times in the second quarter. Leonard hit a 3-pointer that sent the Clippers into halftime leading 56-45. TIP-INS Thunder: For the first time in 16 games — all starts — Dort failed to make at least one 3-pointer, missing six attempts. He still leads the team with 34. Mike Muscala extended his own such streak, making 1 of 9, and is second on the team with 27 3s. ... Oklahoma City finished 7 of 35 from long-range and dropped to 1-7 against the West. Clippers: Paul George, who finished with 11 points, sat out the final five minutes because of hamstring tightness. ... Patrick Beverley was limited to 13 minutes because of right knee soreness. ... The bench was 11 of 33 in the game, with Lou Williams missing 8 of 9 shots. ... Marcus Morris sat out because of illness.","401267411"
"The Hornets turn defense into offense as a steal on one end leads to a flush by P.J. Washington. (0:16) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — With the game on the line, the Charlotte Hornets got the ball right where they had worked on in practice a day earlier. Gordon Hayward delivered — just as he did most of Sunday night. Hayward broke a tie by converting a layup with 0.7 seconds left and scored 39 points in Charlotte’s 107-104 comeback victory over the Orlando Magic. Hayward beat Evan Fournier off the dribble and made the left-handed layup after Orlando’s Terrence Ross tied the game at 104 with a 3-pointer with 8.7 seconds to play. “We put him at the top of the floor with 8 seconds to go and he made a play,” Charlotte coach James Borrego said about Hayward, who made 15 of 25 shots and 5 of 8 3-pointers for his fourth 30-point game of the season. “That’s what great players do. He’s been in that situation before, he knew what he was trying to get to and he executed. These are scenarios that we worked on all this week.” Charlotte ended a four-game losing streak, overcoming a 14-point deficit. Down the entire second and third quarters, the Hornets opened the fourth with a 25-4 run — making nine of their first 14 shots. Orlando missed 12 of its first 13 shots in the period. “It’s a resilient win and this is a resilient group,” Borrego said. Miles Bridges added 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting. “When Gordon is firing I guess everybody is firing,” Bridges said. “If he’s going then that gets everybody else into it. And he finds his open teammates, too.” Once 6-2, the Magic lost for an eighth time in the past nine games. Orlando and Charlotte will play again on Monday night. Nikola Vucevic topped 10,000 career points early in the night and scored 22 points in the game. He added 13 rebounds for his 12th double-double of the season. Evan Fournier had 21 points and six assists, while rookie point guard Cole Anthony added 14 points and six assists. “Obviously we have to play the same brand of basketball that we did during the first three quarters and not mess up easy things,” Fournier said. The Magic were without forward Aaron Gordon because of hip and back soreness. Gordon, who had averaged 16 points, 11.7 rebounds and 8.7 assists in his previous three games and had taken on some of the team’s playmaking following the season-ending injury to Markelle Fultz, is the latest blow to a Magic team that has already lost 83 player games to injury. Orlando led by as much as 13 in the first half and by as much as 14 late in the third period, but it had trouble pulling away because of how well Hayward played offensively. Hayward made eight of his first 12 shots, including three 3s, and scored 19 first-half points. “I’m just trying to help us win basketball games,” Hayward said. “I have good teammates who are putting me in position to be successful. It’s been fun playing with this team, I’m excited and happy to be here in Charlotte.” TIP INS Hornets: Not only do Charlotte and Orlando know each other well from playing four times a season, but there is also plenty of crossover on the coaching staffs. Charlotte coach James Borrego was a Magic assistant from 2012-15 and he was 10-20 as the franchise’s interim coach at the end of the 2014-15 NBA season. Magic head coach Steve Clifford and most of his staff led the Hornets from 2013-18 prior to arriving in Orlando. Magic: Magic coach Steve Clifford is six-for-six in Coach’s Challenge instances this season. … Orlando tied a season high with 17 3-pointers.

"Rudy Gay flies in for the tip-in, but many Wizards call for basket interference, including Russell Westbrook. (1:01) SAN ANTONIO -- — Washington struggled offensively and suffered some communication breakdowns defensively in crucial situations, but Wizards coach Scott Brooks could forgive those lapses. After being unable to play for two weeks, Brooks and the Wizards were simply happy to be back on the court. Patty Mills scored 21 points, Lonnie Walker IV added 16 and the San Antonio Spurs used their depth to beat Washington 121-101 on Sunday night in the Wizards’ first game since Jan. 11. “This whole season for us has been weird,” Brooks said. “Definitely, I don’t think I will ever go through anything like this again. It all happened after one game after another. We can’t keep dwelling on it, we have to put it behind us. We got the first game in. I’m glad we did that.” The Wizards had their previous six games postponed because they did not have enough eligible players due to the league’s COVID-19 protocols. Washington was playing for the first time since beating the visiting Phoenix Suns 128-107. Brooks said the Wizards only began practicing within the last three days and had to use video monitors on the bench to show their offensive sets to recently signed players like Alex Len. The Wizards still had six players ineligible against the Spurs, including Rui Hachimura. Washington faded down the stretch as Brooks primarily used an eight-man rotation. “It’s not normal,” said Bradley Beal, who led Washington with 31 points. “I just got done getting tested after the game, so it’s not normal. We are doing a lot of things on the fly. It’s just the next-man-up mentality.” The Spurs used a balanced attack to take advantage of the Wizards’ lack of activity. San Antonio had 27 assists and finished with a 20-3 advantage in fast-break points. “Sharing the ball, competing, following the game plan and trying to take advantage,” Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray said. Murray, who missed the second half of Friday’s loss to the Dallas Mavericks with a sprained left ankle, had 11 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his second career triple-double. LaMarcus Aldridge added 15 points, Devin Vassell had 14 points and Keldon Johnson 13 for San Antonio. Jerome Robinson scored 16 points for Washington. Russell Westbrook had nine points, eight rebounds and six assists in 25 minutes. “I think all of our guys are going to have to get back in NBA rhythm,” Brooks said. “It’s been totally taken away from us.” TIP-INS Wizards: Hachimura, Deni Avdija, Davis Bertans, Troy Brown Jr., Ish Smith and Moe Wagner all missed the game due to the league’s health and safety protocols. ... Choosing not to reveal any names, Brooks said several players have begun working out and should return soon. “They probably will not come on this road trip, but will be back soon,” he said. ... Point guard Cassius Winston was still wearing his medical mask upon entering the game for Westbrook in the first quarter. Someone from the bench yelled at Winston, who apparently forgot he had his mask on. He quickly took it off and tossed it toward the bench. Spurs: Vassell is the first Spurs rookie with four or more 3-pointers in a game since Gary Neal in 2011. Vassell is also the sixth Spurs player with at least four 3-pointers in a game this season. Mills heads the list with four such games, followed by Walker with two. Vassell, Johnson, Aldridge and Rudy Gay each have one. ... Murray collected his 1,000th career rebound in 202 games with the Spurs. He has 21 games with 10-plus rebounds in four seasons.","401267413"
"De'Andre Hunter winds up for a dunk, but Giannis Antetokounmpo sends it flying. (0:18) MILWAUKEE -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 14 rebounds and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Atlanta Hawks 129-115 on Sunday night to snap a two-game losing streak. Antetokounmpo had eight assists, finishing two shy of a triple-double. Bobby Portis added 21 points, and Khris Middleton had 19 for Milwaukee. De'Andre Hunter led Atlanta with a career-high 33 points. John Collins had 30 points, but the short-handed Hawks saw their three-game winning streak end. The Hawks were without two key starters, leading scorer Trae Young (back spasms) and center Clint Capela (sore right hand). Rajon Rondo replaced Young in the starting lineup. Rookie center Onyeka Okongwu made his first career start. Atlanta's lineup changes, announced during pregame warmups, were jolting for both teams. “We actually did our walkthrough for Atlanta yesterday,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We spent a lot of time on Trae Young. He’s one of the elite young players in the league, but you have to adjust.” Hunter and Collins attempted to fill the scoring void left by Young's absence. Collins sank six of nine 3-pointers. Hunter made 13 of 21 shots from the field. “He was just trying to get us going,” Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said about Hunter. “You see the ball go in and you get the feel a little bit and we needed every bit of it.” The Hawks missed Capela's defense and rebounds. The Bucks outscored the Hawks in the paint 60-30 and had a 51-38 advantage in rebounds. Pierce called a timeout after Milwaukee took a 9-2 lead. The substitution of Solomon Hill for Okongwu didn't help as the Bucks quickly extended the lead to 10 points at 16-6. Milwaukee's lead was 24 points at 58-36 in the second quarter. The Hawks narrowed the deficit in the third period. Okongwu's block of a shot by Bobby Portis set up Hunter's apparent 46-foot 3-pointer as the buzzer sounded to end the third period. Following a lengthy review, officials ruled the shot came after time expired, leaving the Bucks with a 94-83 lead entering the fourth quarter. “I think in the third our intensity was pretty low,” said Jrue Holiday, who had 15 points. “I feel like if we had come out in the third and just threw a haymaker at them, the game would have been different and we could have been up by 30.” TIP-INS Hawks: Danilo Gallinari had 17 points. ... Young had a heating pad strapped to his back as he watched from the Hawks bench. ... Okongwu had four points in his starting debut, which came after only three appearances as a reserve. ... Rondo had seven points and six assists. ... Capela was coming off his first career triple-double, including a career-high 10 blocks, Friday night in a victory over Minnesota. Bucks: Budenholzer wasn’t happy to see the Bucks allow the Hawks to top 30 points in each of the final three periods. “We need to be a lot better defensively,” Budenholzer said. BACK ON TRACK Milwaukee rebounded following consecutive losses to the Nets and Lakers. “It was good to get that feel back, that feel of winning,” Holiday said. “We had a tough couple of games.” CRAIG RETURNS Bucks forward Torrey Craig wore a clear facemask in his return after missing nine games with a fractured nose suffered on Dec. 27 at the New York Knicks. He had four points in 13 minutes. “It was just good for him to get some minutes ... just start to find his way in a game setting,” Budenholzer said. “Certainly he’s somebody that we really value.”","401267414"
"Damian Lillard shows off his dribbling skills and sinks a 3-pointer for the Trail Blazers vs. the Knicks. (0:18) PORTLAND, Ore. -- — Damian Lillard had 39 points, including six 3-pointers, and the rested Portland Trail Blazers jumped out early against the New York Knicks on the way to a 116-113 victory on Sunday night. Anfernee Simons added 16 points off the bench for the Blazers, who led by as many as 25 points before seeing their advantage slip away in the final quarter. Rookie Immanuel Quickley scored 31 points off the bench and Julius Randle added 25 for the Knicks. Quickley's 3 pointer got the Knicks within 96-91 with 7:13 left. But Robert Covington's layup and Lillard's 3-pointer put Portland up 101-91. Randle's layup narrowed it to 106-98 with 2:39 to go. Quickley hit three free throws to make it 106-102 with 1:33 left. After Mitchell Robinson's dunk with 19 seconds left, former Knick Carmelo Anthony made a pair of free throws to extend Portland's lead to 112-106. Quickley dished to Robinson for an alley-oop dunk to narrow New York's deficit to 114-111 with 10 seconds left, but in the end, the Knicks couldn't catch up. “If you watch the games around the league, it happens every night,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said about watching the lead dwindle. “There are teams every night that are up 20 points, 15 points and the lead evaporates in some way. As a coach you don't want it to happen, obviously, but the biggest thing is managing it when it does happen.” The Blazers (9-6) were still adjusting to the loss of guard CJ McCollum with a hairline fracture in his left foot. Rodney Hood started in McCollum's place for the second game. Portland was also without big man Jusuf Nurkic because of a right wrist fracture. Despite being short-handed, the Blazers were well-rested after a pair of scheduled games last week against Memphis were postponed because of coronavirus protocol and contact tracing among the Grizzlies. “It was the kind of game we needed to play, especially with CJ and Nurk being out,” Lillard said. “That second group, they came out and they were sharp, they were making shots, the ball was moving. We were active in our zone. It was the way we needed to play.” Portland's last game was a 125-104 loss to the San Antonio Spurs last Monday. The Knicks (8-10) were without Reggie Bullock because of a sore neck. Frank Ntilikina, who has been out since Dec. 29 because of a sprained right knee, was available but did not play. Austin Rivers returned after missing two games with a sore right Achilles. Lillard was hot at the start, scoring 10 points as the Blazers built an early 19-11 lead. Portland was up 37-24 after the opening quarter. Portland led by as many as 22 points in the first half, going into the break with a 70-50 advantage. Lillard led all scorers with 18 points and was 3 for 3 from 3-point range — passing Chauncy Billups for 16th on the all-time list for made 3s. The Knicks rallied in the third quarter, pulling within 82-69 on RJ Barrett's layup. They outscored Portland 27-19 and went into the final period trailing 89-77. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said Lillard was a challenge. “He's seen just about every type of defense and he doesn't stop moving. If you get it out of his hands he'll fly back to it,” Thibodeau said. “He's a terrific player.” TIP INS Knicks: It was the third of a four-game trip. ... The Knicks went into the game with the league's second-best defensive rating. ... New York was coming off a 103-94 loss at Sacramento on Friday. ... Randle fouled out with 16.6 seconds left. Trail Blazers: Lillard was 11-for-11 from the free thrown line. He has broken his own franchise record (64) for consecutive free throws made. He now has 66. DADDY DAME: Lillard announced on Instagram that he and his fiancee welcomed twins on Thursday. He wrote “Just call me Daddy Dame from now on.” The couple already has a toddler, Damian Jr. “Obviously I've had Dame Jr. almost three years now, and I think, well I don't think, I know that the thing I enjoy the most is being his dad and going home to him every night and being around him every day. That's something that I think has allowed me to be a better player, because I don't take wins and losses home.”","401267416"
"After being T'd up for a foul on Ben Simmons, Josh Jackson throws the ball to the ref in frustration and is ejected as he's assessed another technical foul. (1:37) DETROIT -- — Delon Wright scored a career-high 28 points and Wayne Ellington had another impressive shooting night for Detroit, leading the Pistons to a 119-104 victory over the Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia 76ers on Monday. Jerami Grant scored 25 points for the Pistons (4-13), who still have the NBA's worst record but took advantage of Joel Embiid's absence. The Philadelphia star was out with back tightness. Detroit acquitted itself well in this two-game mini-series with the 76ers. Philadelphia needed a big game from Embiid to prevail 114-110 on Saturday night. The Pistons never trailed in the rematch. Ellington scored 20 points, shooting 6 of 9 from 3-point range. It was his fifth straight game with at least four 3s, tying a team record set by Joe Dumars in 1998-99. “I had Ray Allen and Dirk Nowitzki and some guys like that,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""He’s right in that class as far as a shooter’s concerned.” Ellington is 30 of 50 from beyond the arc in his last six games. “We’re going to keep giving him the ball,"" Wright said. ""He’s a great shooter. He helps our offense flow.” Tobias Harris led Philadelphia with 25 points, but the 76ers (12-6) never made much of a run after the Pistons controlled the early going. Detroit's Josh Jackson was ejected in the fourth quarter, but Philadelphia couldn't take advantage. Sixers coach Doc Rivers wasn't panicking about the loss. “We didn't play well tonight. This was a very winnable game in my opinion, we just didn't win the game,” Rivers said. “I'm not going to overdo it right now. Way too early. ... I like our team. I like how we're playing overall."" There were five technical fouls in the game. Detroit took an early 17-4 lead and was still ahead 64-50 at halftime. The third quarter came and went without the lead getting any tighter than seven, and it was never closer than nine in the fourth. ""We want to make this our normal thing,"" Wright said. ""We don’t want to celebrate a win. We want to continue to get wins and build on it.” TIP-INS 76ers: Rivers and C Dwight Howard received technical fouls in the second quarter. Pistons: Derrick Rose (left knee) missed the game. ... Detroit came in averaging a league-high 44.1 bench points per game. The Pistons had only 29 on Monday. MISSED CHANCE Jackson and the Philadelphia bench were both called for technicals with 8:06 remaining in the fourth — the 76ers' technical was announced at the arena as being on Mike Scott, who wasn't even active for the game. Then, 33 seconds later, Jackson was called for an offensive foul and a second technical, meaning he was ejected. The foul was ruled a flagrant, so after all that, Philadelphia had three free throws and the ball. Ben Simmons missed two of the free throws and Harris missed the other, leaving the 76ers still down 99-85.","401267417"
"Late in the fourth quarter, Myles Turner blocks Norman Powell's shot.  A little later on, he gets the ball and finishes with a dunk. (0:26) INDIANAPOLIS -- — Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon spent Sunday night searching for answers. By Monday night, he had found them. A little more than 24 hours after playing his poorest game of the season, Brogdon scored a career-high 36 points, flirted with a triple-double and accounted for the final seven points as the Pacers pulled away from Toronto 129-114. ”I was on the phone with coach (Nate Bjorkgren) late last night, trying to figure out how to make adjustments. I was really angry after last night's game,” Brogdon said. “I was incredibly locked in today. We both love the game, we both think about the game all the time and we both hate losing. It drove me crazy until we were able to get back on the court tonight."" The difference showed. Brogdon didn't just score, he found open teammates, played defense and helped spur the decisive fourth-quarter flurry. He finished with nine assists and seven rebounds, Jeremy Lamb matched his season high with 22 points and Myles Turner scored 11 of his 21 points over the final 8 1/2 minutes when the Pacers finally put it away. And they did all that despite missing All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis for the final three quarters. He left with a bruised knee in the first half. Sabonis didn’t return. But with Brogdon leading the charge, Sabonis' absence didn't matter. “I thought he came out with a focus,"" Bjorkgren said. “He was in attack mode the entire evening.” Toronto was led by Fred VanVleet's 25 points and six rebounds. Norman Powell scored 24 points as the Raptors rallied from a 70-60 halftime deficit to finally reclaim a 102-100 lead on Kyle Lowry's go-ahead dunk with 9:46 left in the game. It didn't last long. Goga Bitadze tied the score, Turner broke the tie by making 1 of 2 free throws and then fueled the decisive 12-4 run with his late scoring flurry. Indiana went 14 of 17 from the free-throw line in the fourth quarter and wound up with its highest free-throw attempt total (45) in nearly a decade. “It was hard to play anything (defensively),"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “All we did was a parade to the free-throw line. You can’t play defense when every time they touch the ball it’s a foul."" TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry scored 12 points. He needs two more to join DeMar DeRozan and Chris Bosh as the only players in franchise history to score 10,000. ... VanVleet made three more 3-pointers to extend his franchise-record to 49 consecutive games with a 3. .... OG Anunoby had 10 points and reached double figures for a career-best ninth consecutive game. ... All-Star Pascal Siakam missed his second straight game with swelling in his left knee. Nurse said he would be examined when the team returns home Tuesday. Pacers: Turner also had 10 rebounds and three blocks despite playing with a fractured right hand. ... Bitadze and Aaron Holiday each scored 10 points. ... Lamb added seven rebounds. ... Bjorkgren, who spent the previous two years on Nurse's staff, got his first NBA win against his former mentor. Bjorkgren's head-to-head record against Nurse is 4-5 including seven matchups in the G League. DOUBLE TROUBLE Sabonis' franchise-record streak of 16 consecutive double-doubles to open the season ended unceremoniously after he had 11 points, three rebounds and two assists in the first 11 minutes. The All-Star is one of just six players since the ABA-NBA merger to start the season with 15 straight double-doubles. Bjorkgren said the injury occurred when Sabonis and Lowry banged knees and that Sabonis would be examined again Tuesday. QUICK EXIT When Lowry was called for a technical foul and subsequently ejected with 47 seconds left to play, he didn't stick around long. Lowry continued to talk to the refs as he strolled toward the opposite end of the court, then took his jersey off as he walked through the tunnel to the locker room.","401267418"
"Aaron Gordon drives by his defender and rocks the rim with a two-handed jam. (0:27) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Orlando Magic rookie point guard Cole Anthony is getting more comfortable the more he plays in the NBA. Anthony’s comfort level showed Monday night when he posted a career-best scoring performance and outplayed fellow rookie guard LaMelo Ball. Anthony scored a career-best 21 points and got plenty of help from center Nikola Vucevic’s 13th double-double of the season as the Magic defeated the Charlotte Hornets 117-108 to snap a two-game slide. “We keep playing like that we can be a pretty good team,” said Anthony, who made 8 of 12 shots and 4 of 5 3-pointers. “Every single time I step out there, I feel like I’m getting more comfortable playing with every dude on the team. … I’m just going to keep getting more comfortable, but I’ve got a long way to go.” Orlando wasted a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter a night earlier in a loss to the Hornets. On Monday, Orlando led by as many as 20 points in the third quarter and took an 11-point lead into the fourth before Charlotte made a charge and got within seven — but no closer. Vucevic scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. “Our shotmaking was great tonight and we made a bunch of 3s, which always helps,” said Vucevic, who made 4 of 7 3-point shots. “We were able to hold on at the end."" Orlando made a season-best 19 3-pointers, including seven in the third quarter. Evan Fournier hit five 3's and scored 19 points. Aaron Gordon, who missed Sunday’s loss with hip and back soreness, returned Monday and finished with 12 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. Anthony, the No. 15 pick in the November NBA draft, scored 10 points and made two 3-pointers in a third period that saw Orlando surge ahead by as many as 20. Ball, the No. 3 pick, finished the game with nine points and four assists, but missed all five of his 3-point shots. Gordon Hayward, the hero of Charlotte’s 107-104 win a night earlier with his 39 points and a game-winning layup, finished with 24 points, as did Terry Rozier. Devonte Graham had 21 for Charlotte, which lost to the Magic for the fifth time in six meetings. The Hornets made just 11 of 38 3-point shots and were outscored 68-46 in the middle two quarters. “We had good momentum going into halftime and for whatever reason we came out flat in the third quarter,” Charlotte coach James Borrego said. HISTORY MADE For the first time in NBA history, two female officials — Natalie Sago and Jenna Schroeder — worked the same game. Schroeder and Sago worked with veteran official Sean Wright on Monday. The only controversy of the night involving the referees came with 1:46 to play when Anthony was called for a blocking foul and Magic coach Steve Clifford challenged the call. The challenge was unsuccessful — a first in seven tries this season by Clifford. TIP-INS Hornets: Borrego said he will continue to evaluate his center rotation now that Cody Zeller is back after missing four games with a broken bone in his hand. Bismack Biyombo started his 16th game on Monday, while Zeller made one start. … Hayward’s last-second layup a night earlier was the sixth game-winner of his career in the final five seconds. Magic: Clifford admitted that he is worried about the extended minutes his players are seeing because of injuries and the compacted schedule, stressing, “We’re in unchartered waters. This is Year 21 (in the NBA) for me and I’ve never been involved in a schedule like this. Their bodies can only take so much sometimes.” … The Magic unveiled plans for the AdventHealth Training Center, a 130,000-square-foot facility that will include two practice courts, training and recovery facilities, physical therapy and hydrotherapy capability, sports science and nutrition facilities, as well as state-of-the-art audio-video and imaging technology.","401267419"
"After being denied the opportunity in their previous matchup, Kyrie Irving and Bam Adebayo take full advantage of the opportunity to do a quick jersey exchange after the end of their game. (0:18) NEW YORK -- — Kevin Durant wasn’t making shots. James Harden was barely taking them. That sent the Brooklyn Nets into a defensive struggle, and the NBA’s highest-scoring team handled it well until their superstars showed up. Harden and Durant each scored 20 points despite three relatively quiet quarters, and the Nets broke away with a big run in the fourth to beat the Miami Heat 98-85 on Monday night. Kyrie Irving added 16 points for the Nets, who completed a sweep of the Heat in two games that couldn't have been more different. Brooklyn won 128-124 on Saturday, then took the rematch despite barely topping its lowest-scoring game of the season. “I think our defense held tight the whole game,” Durant said. “Once we were able to start making some shots there in the fourth, we were able to pull away. But our defense won us this game for sure.” Harden had only 10 points and five shots through three, then scored 10 more in the 18-2 spurt that turned a tie game into a 96-80 lead. The NBA's assists leader finished with eight, but struggled to search for his own shot until changing his mentality in the fourth. “Just being aggressive,” he said. “I think I wasn’t very aggressive throughout the course of the game.” Durant shot just 4 for 17 through three, then hit two 3-pointers in the fourth, the latter snapping a 78-all tie and igniting the big run. Bam Adebayo had 26 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a strong follow-up to his career-high 41 points Saturday. But outside of Goran Dragic's 21 points, there was little else for a short-handed Heat team that is without Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley because of health and safety protocols. Tyler Herro, Meyers Leonard and Maurice Harkless are injured. But it looked for a while as though they could pull it out anyway, shutting down a team that came in averaging 120.3 points per game until midway through the final period. “Their talent just took over at the end,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I love the way our guys competed.” The Nets were 4 for 21 (19%) in the first quarter, missing all 10 3-pointers in their lowest-scoring period of the season, which ended with Miami leading 21-15. The second quarter was slightly easier on the eyes — and rims. Miami took a 45-41 edge into halftime, going just 4 for 19 on 3s but doubling the Nets' makes after they went 2 for 17. TIP-INS Heat: Adebayo beat the buzzer to end the third quarter with a 3-pointer that gave Miami a 71-70 lead. He also made a 3 as time expired to end the first half Saturday, followed by a long jumper in the final second of the third quarter. ... Duncan Robinson was 1 for 10, all from 3-point range. Nets: Durant missed his first six 3-point attempts before sinking one in the third quarter. He finished 3 for 12 behind the arc and has scored 20 points in every game this season. ... The Nets have won five straight at home. KYRIE AND KOBE Irving arrived at the arena wearing a No. 8 Kobe Bryant Lakers jersey. In a video posted by the Nets, he pulled his jacket open for a full view of the jersey, saying: “You know who I was rocking tonight. Come on, it’s obvious.” The Nets were scheduled to play at the Knicks last Jan. 26, hours after the helicopter crash that killed Bryant. Irving left the arena, too distraught to play following the death of his friend. HARDEN'S ADJUSTMENTS Harden had just two baskets, both in the fourth quarter, during Saturday's game. He then took only two shots in the first half Monday in another passive performance. But coach Steve Nash said before the game he wasn't worried about the three-time scoring champion as he adjusts to his new team. “Would I like James to be more aggressive? Yes. Will he be more aggressive in time? I think so,” Nash said. “I think once he gets more comfortable with his teammates, when he gets in better shape, when he’s adapted to this whole new environment, we’ll see an improved James scoring the ball.""","401267420"
"LeBron James responds to whomever it was chirping at him after a missed shot at the end of third quarter. (0:43) CLEVELAND -- — Back home, LeBron James kept the Lakers perfect on the road. James went on a scoring tear in the fourth quarter, getting 21 of his 46 points with a variety of dazzling shots and plays only he seems to make, leading Los Angeles to a 115-108 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. James' first game in Ohio in more than two years couldn't have gone much better. “Home cooking,” said James, who got a meal made by his mom, Gloria. “It felt good to be back in my haven.” Anthony Davis added 17 points as the defending NBA champions improved to 10-0 away from home. The win for Los Angeles came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant's tragic death in a helicopter crash. James' outburst in the fourth was reminiscent of something Bryant might do as well, and it was fueled by him wanting to shut up a member of Cleveland's front office group sitting in the socially-distanced front row across from the Cavs' bench. When James was short with a 3-pointer at the end of the third quarter, the unidentified Cavs executive celebrated. “I felt he was a little too excited about seeing me miss,” James said playfully. “I knew I had another quarter and the fourth quarter is my favorite. It's a good thing for him I only come here once.” Over the final 12 minutes, James made 9 of 10 shots, posing to hold his form after draining a 34-foot 3-pointer just before the 24-second clock expired to put the Lakers ahead 103-98. James followed that with a step-back 3 and then drained a fadeaway turn-around jumper in the corner before shaking his head at Cleveland' bench. “When he's playing like that, it's fun to watch,” Davis said. “When he had what 19, 17 in the first? It’s over. ... He wasn't missing. He was everywhere on the floor.” Andre Drummond scored 25 and added 17 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who were blown out by 38 on Sunday in Boston. Cedi Osman added 20 points and Collin Sexton 17 for the Cavs. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said before the game that he wanted his team to “scrap” and that's exactly what the Cavs did — until James took over the way he did in Cleveland for 11 seasons. “When a guy is doing what he did, he's hard to deal with,” Bickerstaff said. “We've all seen that.” While still a homecoming for James, this one felt very different. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, there were only 2,000 fans inside 18,000-plus-seat Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, which was known as Quicken Loans Arena when James led the Cavs to the 2016 NBA championship and ended a 52-year title drought in Cleveland. The sparse crowd welcomed him warmly and the building was dotted with plenty of fans wearing James' purple-and-gold LA jersey. It was only James' second trip back to Cleveland since he left the Cavs for the second time as a free agent after the 2018 season. Last year's game was cancelled by the pandemic. After dusting off his pregame chalk toss, a ritual he started with the Cavs and only breaks out these days for special occasions, James dropped four 3-pointers and scored 17 in the first quarter. HONORING KOBE On Tuesday, the Lakers' family will have painful memories awakened by the loss of Bryant, whose passing shook their organization, the NBA and sports world. The 41-year-old Bryant died while traveling with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, from one of her basketball games. Knowing that Bryant's anniversary will be emotional for everyone, Lakers coach Frank Vogel is giving his players the day off to allow them to better manage their grief and honor their late teammate Bryant “how they see fit.” “It's not a day remembrance like his birthday,” Vogel said. “It's more of a somber-tone-type-of-day.” The Lakers are spending the night in Cleveland before flying to Philadelphia — Bryant's hometown — on Tuesday. They play the 76ers on Wednesday. OLD FRIEND Bickerstaff first met Bryant at a summer camp while they were in high school. When Bickerstaff walked onto the court, he noticed none of his teammates had matched up defensively against Bryant, so he said, “I’ll take him.” Bickerstaff claimed he held his own that day and his admiration for Bryant grew in the years to come. “He changed the game for the next generation,” Bickerstaff said. “His will to win was second to none. His commitment to his craft was second to none.” TIP-INS Lakers: C Marc Gasol picked up three fouls in the first 3:02. ... James will one day have his No. 23 jersey retired in Cleveland — and Miami and Los Angeles. He's the Cavs' career leader in games played, points, rebounds, assists, steals, 3-pointers made, free throws and more. Cavaliers: The Cavs were missing forward Larry Nance Jr., who sprained his right wrist against the Celtics. Nance leads the league with 2.3 steals per game. ... F Kevin Love (calf) and G Matthew Dellavedova (concussion) are the only players left on Cleveland's roster from the '16 title team with James and both missed the game with injuries.","401267421"
"After missing five games due to the NBA's health and safety protocols, Jayson Tatum returns and drops 24 points in the Celtics' win over the Bulls. (1:40) CHICAGO -- — The toughest part of having COVID-19 for Jayson Tatum wasn't the headache, the high temperature and chills he experienced. Those symptoms went away after the first night. Most difficult was the mental toll. “It was tough, especially your initial reaction once you find out,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s panic. But you definitely worry because of everything you read about it and hear, how many people it’s affected and how many people didn’t make it."" Tatum scored 24 points after missing five games, Jaylen Brown had 26 and the Boston Celtics beat the Chicago Bulls 119-103 on Monday night. “The first four days or so, for lack of a better word, it bothered me,"" Tatum said. “It was on my mind. I was thinking, do I feel OK, do I not feel OK? Can I smell this? Does my chest hurt? Or am I just overthinking?” Tatum said he felt a bit tired in the first half. But he got a second wind. He made three 3-pointers and had five assists over 31 minutes in his first appearance since Jan. 8. Brown had another solid game following his 33-point outing in Sunday’s romp over Cleveland. Daniel Theis scored 19 points and Marcus Smart added 13 while tying a career high with 11 assists as the Celtics won their second straight. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 30 points and shot 6 of 10 on 3s. But he also committed six turnovers, giving him 13 in the past two games. Lauri Markkanen scored 18. Thaddeus Young just missed a triple-double with 16 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, but the Bulls dropped their second in a row after three consecutive wins. “They're all going to need to learn how to win,"" coach Billy Donovan said. “I wish I could snap my finger or pour something on it to make it just happen. But it doesn't work that way. Unfortunately, before you win, there's generally a lot of suffering.” TAKING CONTROL Smart scored 13 and Brown and Tatum added 11 points each as the Celtics grabbed a 60-50 halftime lead. Theis' alley-oop dunk and layup in the final 30 seconds sent Boston to the locker room up by 10 and set off an 18-2 run. Brown scored seven as the Celtics reeled off the first 11 points in the third quarter. Tatum answered a hook shot by Young with a 3-pointer to make it 74-52, and the Celtics withstood a few pushes by Chicago to come away with the win. TIP-INS Celtics: G Kemba Walker was held out.

"Steph Curry's 3-point attempt bounces off the rim, but James Wiseman rises up for the putback dunk. (0:22) SAN FRANCISCO -- — Sure, Andrew Wiggins had a little extra juice for this one. Stephen Curry scored 36 points with seven 3-pointers, Wiggins took it to his old Timberwolves team for 23 points, and the Golden State Warriors beat Minnesota 130-108 on Monday night after coach Steve Kerr shook up his starting five. Facing the Timberwolves for the first time since his trade last February, Wiggins showed a steadiness that was missing at times when he played in Minneapolis. He drove the lane for pull-up jumpers, dunked, hit from long range, made three steals, blocked three shots and grabbed all six of his rebounds on the offensive glass. “It's all good playing against my former team. They still have some guys left, so it was good to see them, catch up and compete,"" Wiggins said. “It's all love for those guys. It's part of the business.” Curry shot 11 for 21 overall and 7 of 12 from deep as the Warriors avoided their first three-game losing streak of the season. “Thankfully we made some timely shots to open up the game and built up momentum,” Curry said. Malik Beasley scored 30 points with four 3s to lead Minnesota, which fell behind early with poor shooting and failed to gain any momentum from snapping a four-game losing streak Saturday. Curry has 2,569 career 3-pointers after he passed Reggie Miller for second place in NBA history in Saturday's road loss to the Jazz. Ray Allen is first with 2,973. Miller offered a congratulatory message on the big screen Monday during a first-quarter timeout. Golden State delivered a far better start after falling behind 14-0 to the Jazz and trailing by as many as 40 in the 127-108 defeat at Utah. “They played like a team that had just come off a tough loss,” Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said. “That’s a team with a championship pedigree and championship standards. You know they were going to have that. They really forced us into a couple tough stretches, early in the game and late in the game.” D'Angelo Russell was held out in what would have been his first matchup against his former Warriors team because of a bruised right quadriceps muscle. Russell played 33 games for Golden State last season before the trade that brought Wiggins to the Bay Area. “Well, last year was a complete mess for our team and our organization with all the injuries. We were fortunate to be able to sign D'Angelo,"" Kerr said. “D'Angelo was a really productive player for us. He shot the lights out, had some big games."" NEW LINEUP Kerr mixed it up by starting Kevon Looney at center instead of rookie James Wiseman to improve the defense with a more veteran unit. “We got off to a really good start and that’s what I was hoping for,” Kerr said. Kerr spoke to Wiseman earlier in the day, and the No. 2 overall draft pick handled it well. He will slide into Looney's role coming in midway through the first and third quarters. “He understands it’s not a demotion by any means, it’s simply a part of his development,"" Kerr said. Wiseman dunked on a putback off a missed 3 by Curry midway through the third. “I look at it as a learning experience,” Wiseman said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Jarred Vanderbilt took a hit to the eye when fouled by Draymond Green at the 5:34 mark of the third, then Green got hit with a technical. ... Minnesota hasn't won on the Warriors' home floor since a 124-117 overtime victory on April 5, 2016. ... Ricky Rubio shot just 1 for 8 but dished out 11 assists. ...

The Timberwolves are 2-10 without Towns in the lineup this season — one of those wins a 120-110 home victory Saturday night against the Pelicans. Warriors: Golden State totaled 45 bench points, with everybody but rookie Nico Mannion scoring. The plan is for second-round pick Mannion to go to Orlando for the G League bubble along with Jordan Poole and Alen Smailagic, who is getting close to being able to practice as he works back from surgery for a meniscus tear in his right knee. “It's something I think could be very productive for all of them,” Kerr said.","401267426"
"The Thunder withstand the scoring of Damian Lillard and the Trail Blazers to pull out a 125-122 win on the road. (2:14) PORTLAND Ore. -- — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points, Mike Muscala added 23, and the Oklahoma City Thunder snapped a three-game losing streak with a 125-122 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. Damian Lillard, who had scored 30 or more points in his last three games, had 26 points and 10 assists for the Blazers. Anfernee Simons had 26 points off the bench and Enes Kanter added 13 points and 22 rebounds. After Portland pulled close in the third quarter, Hamidou Diallo's floater from out front put the Thunder up 105-98 with just over eight minutes left in the game. Diallo's layup extended Oklahoma City's lead to 111-100. Carmelo Anthony's 3-pointer got Portland within 117-111 with 3:25 left, but Darius Bazley answered with a 3 for the Thunder. Lillard hit a 3-pointer with 5.5 seconds left to get Portland within 123-120, then made another 3 to narrow it to 124-122 with 1.5 seconds left, but the rally fell short. “I think for most of the game we brought good energy, everybody. And we stuck to it,” said Muscala, who finished with a career-high six 3-pointers. “I think in the third quarter we came out a little bit flat but we did show that we really played together on both sides of the ball.” Both teams were playing the second of back-to-backs. The Thunder fell 108-100 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday, while the Trail Blazers downed the New York Knicks 116-113. The Thunder continue to miss Al Horford, who has been out since the birth of his daughter on Jan. 15. The team was also without George Hill, who sprained his right thumb and is day-to-day. Theo Maledon started in Hill's place. Portland was without Robert Covington because of a concussion. The Blazers were already missing starters CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic because of injuries. “Top to bottom I thought our energy, our competitiveness, our pace and the thrust we played with was sustained throughout the game,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “Everyone who touched the court tonight brought that type of edge.” Luguentz Dort's driving layup put the Thunder up 32-15 in the opening quarter. The Blazers responded with a 17-2 run to pull within 34-32 after Simons' floater. Muscala's 3-pointer stretched Oklahoma City's lead to 55-43 midway through the second quarter. Trent made a 3-pointer at the buzzer to pull Portland within 69-60 at the break. Lillard opened the second half with a 3-pointer before Trent's 3 tied the game at 72, but the Blazers could not pull in front. The Thunder led 94-91 going into the final quarter. Anthony's jumper briefly gave the Blazers a 95-94 lead, but it was short-lived. “Our attention to detail was poor,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “Our first-half defense was pathetic, there's no excuse for that.” TIP INS Thunder: It was the fourth of a five-game trip. .... It was the first of three games between the Thunder and the Blazers. Last season, the teams split 2-2. ... Muscala's 3-pointer early in the game was the 300th of his career.

Lillard hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer that won the game and clinched the series over Oklahoma City in five games. Photos of the new shoe — which features Thunder colors — were revealed on social media ahead on Monday night's game. Lillard hinted he wasn't trolling Oklahoma City and that Adidas was creating shoes to recognize all its players that have 50-point games. “I think I’ve had other games to choose from,” he said. “I’m ready to let that moment go, so that’s why I think I would have liked it to be a different game, because I don’t want it to come off as I’m just living in the moment from two years ago.

(0:23) ATLANTA -- — Trae Young scored 38 points and the Atlanta Hawks beat the depleted Los Angeles Clippers 108-99 on Tuesday night, ending the Clippers’ seven-game winning streak. The Clippers were without three starters. Leading scorers Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were ruled out due to health and safety protocols. Guard Patrick Beverley missed the game with right knee soreness. “It’s tough. It’s just how this year is going to go,” said Los Angeles center Ivica Zubac, who noted the Clippers had not been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic before this week. “We were lucky to have everyone so far, but it is what it is,"" Zubac said. ""We’ve got to adjust. It’s going to be this type of season for everyone and we’re not the exception.” Reggie Jackson led the Clippers with 20 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. Serge Ibaka had 15 points. De’Andre Hunter had 22 points for Atlanta. Clint Capela collected 13 points and 19 rebounds. Three free throws by Young gave the Hawks a 95-85 lead. Jackson’s three-point play trimmed the advantage to 101-96, but Kevin Huerter answered with his third 3-pointer of the fourth period. Ibaka had 13 first-half points to help the Clippers to a 48-43 lead at the break. Young’s 14 points in the third quarter sparked the Hawks’ second-half surge. “I think we just upped our intensity and just played a little bit harder,” Young said. “For us, coming into the game we weren’t necessarily locked in from the beginning. ... We just need to do a better job of attacking the first half the same way we do the second.” Teams are not allowed to reveal if players in the health and safety protocol have tested positive for COVID-19. Contact tracing and inconclusive test results also could place players in the protocol.

"John Wall and Russell Westbrook give their sides as to what happened when they were issued a double technical foul in their game Tuesday. (0:56) HOUSTON -- — On a minutes restriction because of a sore knee, Houston's John Wall had to wait until the seven-minute mark of the fourth quarter to re-enter Tuesday night's game against his former team. When he finally checked in, it didn't take long for him to put a punctuation mark on a solid performance by the Rockets. Wall scored 24 points to help Houston to a 107-88 victory over Russell Westbrook and the Washington Wizards. Wall had 15 points and four assists by halftime, including a left-handed layup that came after a nifty behind the back move and put Houston up 53-45 in the second quarter. He cooled off in the third, but got going again in the fourth to secure the win in his second game back after missing five with a sore left knee. Houston was leading by six when Wall re-entered the game. He scored five quick points before finding Victor Oladipo in the corner near the Washington bench for a 3-pointer to make it 93-79. “I was itching to get back in in the fourth quarter,"" he said. “I wanted to play, especially against my old team. And we kind of separated ourselves right there."" Wall was selected by Washington with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 draft and spent his entire career with the Wizards before he was traded to Houston in December for Westbrook and a future first-round pick. He insisted he didn't think he had anything to prove against the Wizards. But he did admit that he's having a great time with his new team after a rocky ending to his tenure in Washington. “I haven’t played in two years so this is fun,"" he said. “To be somewhere where you’re wanted, that’s the most important thing. I never want to be anywhere where I’m not wanted and I feel like this organization wanted me here and they’ve shown nothing but love and trust for me since Day One."" Washington coach Scott Brooks was impressed by Wall’s performance after watching him work his way back from injury over the past two seasons. “I’m happy for him,” Brooks said. “I’m not happy that he won tonight, but I’m happy that he’s back. He fought hard ... to come back and I hope he has a healthy year.” Wall said Tuesday's game wasn't too emotional but that he expects to feel more when he returns to Washington later this season. He added that he's tired of talking about his former team and doesn't want to discuss the Wizards again until that game on Feb. 15. The Wizards called a timeout after Houston's 8-0 run, and Wall yelled and jumped as he looked at the opposing bench before bounding back to the Houston side. Wall and Westbrook were both given technical fouls soon after that when they jawed at each other as Westbrook prepared to shoot free throws after being fouled by DeMarcus Cousins. Bradley Beal made a 3-pointer with about 3½ minutes left to trim Houston's lead to 10, but Wall hit a 3 seconds later and Cousins, who had 19 points and 11 rebounds, added two free throws to make it 99-84. “We made some critical mistakes and didn’t make some shots (to) close out the game,"" Brooks said. Oladipo and Eric Gordon added 20 points apiece to help the Rockets to their third straight win. Beal scored 33 points to give him at least 25 in each of his 12 games this season, extending a franchise record. Westbrook, who spent one season in Houston, had 19 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds. TIP-INS Wizards: Were missing six players because of health and safety protocols. ... Robin Lopez had 10 points. Rockets: Christian Wood missed his third straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... Danuel House had two points and a rebound in his return after missing four games with back spasms and seven because of health and safety protocols. STARTING TO MESH Tuesday was the first game that Wall and Oladipo played together after Oladipo, who came to Houston in the James Harden trade, sat out for rest on Saturday night. Coach Stephen Silas said the offense was a bit disjointed for much of the game while the two adjusted to playing together, but he thought they began to mesh in the fourth quarter. “The fourth quarter was good,"" Silas said. “They were figuring out how they can make each other better and play to each other’s strengths. ... It’s a work in progress for sure.""","401267429"
"Jordan Clarkson rainbows a pass high to Rudy Gobert, who finishes with a two-handed reverse dunk. (0:21) SALT LAKE CITY -- — The Utah Jazz leaned on their tough defense to keep their win streak alive. Rudy Gobert had 18 points, 19 rebounds and four blocked shots, and the Jazz beat the New York Knicks 108-94 on Tuesday night for their ninth consecutive victory. “We did a lot of good things that didn’t show up on the scoreboard,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “People talk about winning ugly and tonight ugly was pretty.” Royce O’Neale scored a career-high 20 points, helping Utah overcome a quiet night for Donovan Mitchell. Mike Conley had 19 points, seven rebounds, and five assists. Mitchell finished with nine points on 3-for-15 shooting. Austin Rivers scored 25 points for New York — all in the first half. Julius Randle had 18 points and 10 rebounds, and R.J. Barrett scored 17 in the Knicks’ third straight loss. New York made just 12 total baskets in the second half on the heels of shooting 55.8% from the field before halftime. The Jazz made numerous hustle plays and forced the Knicks to settle for one tough shot after another. By the fourth quarter, New York’s offense was thoroughly bottled up. The Knicks scored only 13 points over the final 12 minutes. “We knew right from the start, Utah’s playing as well as anyone in the league,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “And so I thought our aggressiveness to start the game was very good. And then we didn’t sustain it for 48 minutes. And that’s something we’re still working toward.” The Jazz trailed by as many 15 points in the first half, but grabbed the lead for good when they opened the fourth quarter with a 20-3 run. O’Neale punctuated the key stretch with three straight baskets, giving Utah a 100-84 lead with 5:19 remaining. “We kept our focus on the defensive end,” Gobert said. “We didn’t worry about the missed shots. All of the sudden, we got stops and the shots started falling. Utah endured a cold spell on offense during the first quarter. The Jazz missed 12 of their first 14 shots and shot 2 of 13 from the perimeter during the period. They made only six baskets in the first 12 minutes. Rivers scored 18 of New York’s first 21 points in the second quarter. His flurry of baskets stopped a Jazz rally. After Utah cut the deficit to 36-32 on back-to-back layups from Joe Ingles and Gobert, Rivers made three 3-pointers to fuel a 12-2 run that extended the Knicks’ lead to 48-34 midway through the quarter. Rivers went 10 of 10 from the field during the first half, including five 3-pointers. He had a limited impact after halftime once Utah made a point of taking him out of the offense. “In the second half, they became more physical, they took the fight to us,” Rivers said. “And it just kind of fell apart. They just kept their foot on the pedal, and we weren’t able to get it back. This was the toughest loss of the trip.” Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic rallied the Jazz, combining for 22 points during the third quarter. Conley made four baskets, assisted on a pair, and hit four free throws during the quarter. Bogdanovic hit a pair of 3-pointers. TIP-INS Knicks: Alec Burks made his second start of the season and his Knicks career. He finished with nine points and seven rebounds. ... Rivers went 0 of 4 from the field after halftime. ... New York held Utah to two fast-break points. Jazz: Mitchell, Conley, and Bogdanovic combined to go 1 of 19 from the field in the first half. … Utah finished with just six turnovers. … Mitchell finished with a season-high eight rebounds. CAREER NIGHT In his fourth season, O’Neale is averaging a career-best 7.9 points while shooting 45.7% from the field. His burgeoning offensive game is no surprise to teammates who have witnessed the time he has put in to make a greater impact on that end. “This is the Royce we all know,” Mitchell said. “He’s a dog. He’s going to go out there and work.”","401267430"
"Domantas Sabonis gets the ball and finishes with a left-handed dunk for the Pacers. (0:16) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — When his MRI came back negative after taking a shot to the knee earlier this week, Domantas Sabonis told Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren there was no way he was going to rest and let his teammates down. “I don't like sitting out,"" Sabonis said. ""I woke up today and I felt good. I did my shooting time and I was like, ‘I can play.’ I would have felt worse if I didn't play.” Sabonis powered through with a bruised knee, getting 22 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to lead Indiana past the Charlotte Hornets 116-106 on Wednesday night. He came into the game listed as questionable but finished 9 of 10 from the field. “The toughness that he showed to step foot in that game after taking that knee-to-knee (on Monday), that toughness goes a long way,” Bjorkgren said. Doug McDermott scored a season-high 28 points — three shy of his career-high — Malcom Brogdon had 25 points and Justin Holiday chipped in with 19 points for the Pacers, who have won three of four. Terry Rozier had 20 points for the Hornets, who have dropped six of seven. Sabonis bruised his knee during a collision with Toronto’s Kyle Lowry on Monday night and had an MRI on Tuesday that showed no damage. He was on his game from the start, continuously making the right plays and finding teammates like McDermott on cuts to the basket and making the most of his shot selection in and out of the paint. Indiana had 34 assisted baskets. “He’s a willing passer. When the ball is in his hands, he's going to make the right play,” Bjorkgren said of Sabonis. “He took 10 shots and had double-digit assists. He will continuously make the right play.” Said Brogdon: “Along with Joker (Nikola Jokic), he's one of the best passing bigs in the league.” The Pacers led by 36-19 after the first quarter. “We’re trying different lineups now,” Hornets coach James Borrego said. “That was a new group out there tonight. It was a poor first quarter. It wasn’t just the first group, it was the second group as well.” TIP INS Pacers: Outscored Charlotte 50-42 in the paint. ... Holiday fouled out with 48 seconds left. Hornets: Cody Zeller returned to the starting lineup and had 10 points and 14 rebounds. Zeller missed four weeks with a broken hand and had come off the bench the last three games. ... This opens a stretch with 12 of 14 games at home. ... With the Hornets struggling to win there is growing pressure for Borrego to start rookie LaMelo Ball, who had eight points and five assists in 22 minutes. SLOWING DOWN HAYWARD Indiana limited the red-hot Gordon Hayward to 16 points on 6-of-14 shooting from the floor. The Pacers (11-7) pushed their coverage to Hayward, who came in averaging 30.5 points over his past four contests and having made 58.1% of his shots from the floor, including 61.5% from 3-point range. “The way he’s playing, teams are going to tilt their defense toward him,"" Borrego said. ""We know that. He knows that, too. He’s been in this league for a while. He’s seen different coverages. I’ll continue to look for ways to free him up.”","401267431"
"Andre Drummond throws down a vicious lefty jam over Mason Plumlee to put an exclamation mark on the Cavaliers' win over the Pistons. (0:22) CLEVELAND -- — Collin Sexton scored 29 points and Andre Drummond had 23 points, 16 rebounds and five steals against his former team, powering the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 122-107 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. Taurean Prince added 16 points and rookie Isaac Okoro had 10 points and a season-high six assists to help the Cavaliers snap their two-game losing streak and move back to .500. Cleveland forced 22 turnovers, turning them into 30 points. “Our main goal is to beat up a team and wear them down,” said Drummond, who spent his first 7 1/2 seasons with the Pistons. “We did a great job of that tonight. We just tried to play aggressive the whole game and force them to make mistakes. “We got stops and just played our game. That’s really what happened.” Jerami Grant scored 26 points and Mason Plumlee had 15 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high eight turnovers for Detroit. The Pistons have the worst road record in the Eastern Conference at 1-7. Drummond made a bank shot midway through the fourth quarter to give Cleveland its largest lead of the night at 108-89. The Cavaliers went ahead for good at 72-69 on a Darius Garland 3-pointer in the third. “The 22 turnovers are a bad recipe and I take responsibility for that,” Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. “Against Philly (a 119-104 win Monday), we played beautiful basketball, but tonight I didn’t think our focus or understanding of passing was there.” Cleveland, which had seven players score in double figures, shot 54% from the field and made 11 of 21 3-pointers. Garland had 14 points, and Cedi Osman and Jarrett Allen scored 10 apiece. “The second half was a clear vision of what we want on the floor,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “We shared the ball and we made plays to make each other better on both ends of the court.” Detroit guard Derrick Rose returned after missing two games with a sore left knee, scoring 13 points in 19 minutes off the bench. Wayne Ellington had 17 points and Delon Wright scored 11 points and dished out seven assists. The Pistons have committed 46 turnovers in two games against the Cavaliers, both losses. They made a season-high 24 in a 128-119 double-overtime defeat on Dec. 26. “I don’t think they were necessarily forced,” said Grant, who made 10 of 10 free throws. “I think, more or less, it was us trying to do too much with the basketball.” “It's hard to stop (Cleveland) when they get going,” Rose said. “We've got to play smarter. That's all it is.” Cavaliers power forward Larry Nance Jr. was unavailable for the second straight game after spraining his right wrist at Boston on Sunday. SIMILAR STRATEGY Casey is encouraged by Cleveland’s development, specifically mentioning Sexton and Garland. The Cavaliers are seventh in the East after finishing with the second-worst record in the NBA last season. “A couple of years ago, Cleveland was where we are now,” Casey said. “They’re an exciting up-and-coming team, like we want to be.” TIP-INS Pistons: F Blake Griffin (left knee) and G Killian Hayes (right hip) were inactive. Griffin is not playing in back-to-back games for precautionary reasons. … Rookie G Saben Lee was assigned to the G-League in a procedural move. “Saben would have been inactive with Derrick (Rose) back, so this will save days on his two-way contract,” Casey said. Cavaliers: Garland made his first start since returning from a sprained right shoulder on Jan. 22. The second-year pro missed eight games, but Bickerstaff said he is no longer on a minutes restriction. … F Kevin Love (right calf strain), G Matthew Dellavedova (concussion) and rookie F Lamar Stevens (abdominal strain) were inactive.","401267432"
"Richaun Holmes absorbs contact and finishes a tough layup down low for the Kings vs. the Magic. (0:22) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Sacramento Kings guard Buddy Hield mixed up his game beautifully on Wednesday night, calmly hitting spot-up 3-pointers, sinking midrange jumpers and dishing the ball when the Orlando Magic blitzed him with double teams. Kings’ coach Luke Walton insisted that it was just the kind performance from Hield that Sacramento needs to see more of going forward. Hield scored a season-best 29 points by making 10 of 17 shots and 7 of 12 3-pointers as the well-rested Kings beat the Magic 121-107. “I thought it was his most consistent game this year, for sure, and maybe since I’ve been (with the Kings),” Walton said. “Both sides of the ball, he was making good decisions, knocking down shots when we needed shots made and getting off the ball when they were blitzing him. We need that because it’s a tough league to win in. To get that type of play from him will give us a much better chance.” Sacramento was playing for the first time since Friday after two games were canceled because of COVID-19 protocols with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Kings proved themselves to be rested and ready in taking apart the Magic for their second road victory of the season. The Kings led by 11 in the first period, by 17 before halftime and by as much as 22 in the second half of the wire-to-wire victory. The Magic never got closer than 10 in the second half in dropping to 4-5 at home this season. “We didn’t have great energy, I’d say, at either end of the floor,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. “We have a good enough team to have a good season, but we need everybody every night. There’s not a lot of room for error and we can’t have five guys play well and four guys not or six and three. That’s not easy, but that’s the way it is.” Harrison Barnes scored 21 points and made 3 3s for Sacramento, which shot 48.9% from the floor and made 14 of 33 3-pointers. Sacramento center Richaun Holmes had 20 points and 12 rebounds for his third double-double of the season, while Marvin Bagley III recorded his sixth double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds. De’Aaron Fox added 16 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. Hield’s dynamic shooting performance was the third time this season that he’s made at least six 3-pointers in a game. His 29 points points topped the 26 he had on Jan. 13 in Portland — a game where he made eight 3s. He was 7 for 12 from behind the arc on Wednesday. “Buddy is an important part of our team and when he gets it going like he had it tonight, we’re very, very difficult to guard,” Holmes said. “He does a lot for our team. To see him get rolling like that and come away with the win, it was great.” Magic center Nikola Vucevic made 11 of 18 shots and scored 26 points — his 14th game of the season with at least 20 points. Evan Fournier added 25 points, while Terrence Ross chipped in 16 points off the bench. Aaron Gordon struggled through the night with three points in 26 minutes. He missed eight of his nine field goal attempts. Rookie guard Cole Anthony, who scored a career-best 21 points in Monday’s defeat of Charlotte, made just 2 of 9 shots and scored seven points on Wednesday. TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento’s streak of consecutive quarters without allowing 30 points ended at seven when the Magic reached 30 in Wednesday’s fourth quarter. … Walton said the team’s first trip East brought up some new challenges for his team. Walton: “The road trips we’re pretty used to, but it’s the protocols that have taken some getting used to. The players had to have their first (COVID-19) testing done by 8:30 AM. So, as you’re trying to adjust to time zones, you still have to get up and do that so that the players can get the tests back before the game. Things like that are what we’re getting used to.” Magic: Orlando came into Wednesday as the NBA’s hottest shooting team from 3-point range over the previous three games — 17.7 makes a night on 47% shooting — but it made only 10 of 26 attempts on Wednesday.","401267433"
"Kyrie Irving goes up-and-under before spinning in a layup high off the glass. (0:29) ATLANTA -- — Kevin Durant scored 32 points and James Harden had 31 to lead a productive effort for Brooklyn's big three scorers, and the Nets beat the Atlanta Hawks 132-128 in overtime on Wednesday night. Harden added 15 assists and eight rebounds. Kyrie Irving scored 26 points for Brooklyn. Harden, acquired from Houston on Jan. 14, started slowly before scoring 16 points in the second period. It was an indication he is finding his place in the Nets' offense after not scoring more than 21 points in any of his previous four games. “That’s who he is,” Irving said. “We just want him to come into this group and not think so much about fitting in, but just be who he is.” Trae Young had 28 points and 14 assists for Atlanta. Cam Reddish scored a season-high 24 points while John Collins and De'Andre Hunter each had 21 points. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce described the game as “playoff basketball.” “That’s a good test for our guys against a really good team, a team that’s going to be there at the end at some point,” Pierce said. “I thought we were there. We had a couple miscues that we can learn from.” Durant's dunk gave the Nets a 127-121 lead in the extra period. After Young made one of two free throws to trim Brooklyn's lead to 129-126, Durant's turnover with 40 seconds remaining gave Atlanta an opening. Hunter missed a long jumper that would have tied the game. Harden stretched the lead by sinking two free throws with 4.6 seconds remaining. “Tonight was a great win,” Harden said. “We stuck with it in four quarters and overtime.” After scoring only two points in the opening period, Harden passed up a scoring opportunity on the Nets' first possession of the second quarter. He then looked toward the Nets bench, gestured in a shooting motion and then nodded as if to confirm he should have taken the shot. Harden made a 3-pointer to spark his scoring spree. The Hawks called a timeout about three minutes into the period after Harden's step-back 3 over Kevin Huerter. TIP-INS Nets: Coach Steve Nash is looking forward to more practice time with the start of a three-game road trip. The game at Atlanta opened a stretch of 10 of 13 games on the road. “It’s a great opportunity for us to keep rolling,"" Nash said. “We’ve played so many games in a short period of time. We have a stretch now where we have a little bit of breathing room between games."" Hawks: Clint Capela had 11 rebounds, his 14th consecutive game with at least 10. ...

He also has missed games with a recent bruised knee and has struggled with inconsistent production before emerging with a strong performance against the Nets despite the difficult assignment of defending Durant. “Cam was great,” Pierce said. “We needed what he brought tonight, a downhill attacking mentality. ... He didn’t force anything.”","401267434"
"Bol Bol entertains the Nuggets with an unreal, one-handed jam a day before they take on the Heat. (0:20) MIAMI -- — The Denver Nuggets might not want this road trip to end. The Miami Heat cannot get Jimmy Butler back quickly enough. Nikola Jokic had 21 points and 11 rebounds and the Nuggets won their fifth straight, building a 25-point halftime lead and beating the Heat 109-82 on Wednesday night. Michael Porter Jr. scored 17 points, JaMychal Green added 15 and Jamal Murray had 14 for Denver, which improved to 4-0 on its five-game road trip — the first four-win trip for the Nuggets since December 2013. A win Friday in San Antonio would give Denver its first 5-0 trip since January 2012, and the Nuggets have won 10 of 13 since since a 1-4 start. “When we were 1-4, there was no panic,"" Murray said. “It's five games in. ... Turned things around pretty quick."" Butler watched from the Miami bench, significant since Wednesday’s game was the first in more than two weeks where he could be with his team. He's now missed the last nine Heat games because of virus-related protocols. The Heat are 2-7 in this stretch without him and have dropped four straight. Herro (neck spasms) missed a seventh consecutive game, Dragic was out with a groin strain, and Kendrick Nunn led Miami with 17 points. The Heat got Avery Bradley back for the first time in nine games; he, like Butler, was out in accordance with the NBA’s virus protocols. “It was great to see the guys, everybody, even though everybody wasn’t available,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Bradley had eight points in 18 minutes. “Even though we came up short tonight, felt great to be back out there,” Bradley said. Denver led 58-33 at the half, the Nuggets’ biggest halftime lead this season and biggest in a road arena since holding a 31-point lead at the break in Chicago on March 21, 2018. The Heat missed 15 3-pointers in the first quarter — an NBA record for an opening period, and a team record for any quarter. Denver’s lead was down to seven early in the fourth, but back-to-back 3s by Porter and Green got the Nuggets’ edge back to 13 and another 3 by Jokic made it 94-74 with 5:35 left. “That team was missing Jimmy Butler, Goran Dragic, Tyler Herro, a lot of their top players,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “I don’t know if we’re as good as we played tonight and I know they’re a hell of a lot better than they played.” Bam Adebayo scored 15 for Miami. TIP-INS Nuggets: Guard P.J. Dozier (right hamstring strain) missed the game and the Nuggets are bracing for it to be a multi-game absence. ... The 33 points allowed by Denver in the first half was not only a season best, but it was nearly 24 points below the Nuggets’ average through the first 17 games. Heat: Wednesday was the start of a six-game homestand for Miami. After that, the Heat play eight of their next nine on the road. ... Duncan Robinson’s first 3-pointer was the 400th of his career, including playoffs. He’s the 12th Heat player to make that many. TRIBUTES The Heat held a pregame moment of silence to commemorate Tuesday being the one-year anniversary of Kobe Bryant’s death and last week’s death of Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron.

"After Anthony Davis puts the Lakers ahead with 11 seconds to play, Tobias Harris answers with the game-winner as the 76ers prevail. (1:16) PHILADELPHIA -- — Joel Embiid tried to dunk on LeBron James and instead his back slammed on the court. James’ push of the 76ers big man got him hit with a flagrant 1 and Embiid cried foul. He wanted the King tossed. “That’s a very dangerous play,” Embiid said. “I guarantee if that was me I would have probably been ejected from the game.” James stuck around -- long enough to watch Tobias Harris stick it to the Lakers. Harris swished a jumper with 3 seconds left, ending the Lakers’ 13-0 run and sending Philadelphia to a 107-106 victory over Los Angeles on Wednesday night. The James-Embiid flagrant took center stage in a game between teams that entered with the best records in their conferences. The 76ers lead the East at 13-6 and the Lakers are 14-5 in the West. “Some people think we haven’t played anybody,” Harris said. “For us, we wanted to go against the champs. We wanted to see where we’re at.” Philly was nearly on the losing end. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit a 3-pointer with 1:05 left that pulled the Lakers to 105-104. James hit Anthony Davis for the go-ahead basket with 11.2 seconds to go for a 106-105 lead and cap that run. Harris -- who campaigned for an All-Star nod -- saved the Sixers on a shot over Alex Caruso. Harris scored 24 points. Embiid had 28 and Ben Simmons had 17 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. James scored 34 points and Davis had 23. “It didn’t go our way but I loved our fight,” James said. Embiid, the All-Star center off to the best start of his career, drove down the baseline for an attempted right-handed dunk when James pushed him in flight. Embiid crashed hard on his tailbone, immediately grabbed his back and writhed on the court in pain as James simply looked down and walked past him. After a short video review, James was hit with a flagrant 1 -- “unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent” -- and Embiid sank both free throws. Embiid was quickly hit with his own flagrant when his elbow connected with Davis’ face on a drive to bucket. Embiid has a history of back issues and sat out Monday’s loss at Detroit with back tightness. He sat alone on a cool-down seat behind the basket for nearly the first 5 minutes of the fourth quarter. Embiid returned and threw his hands in the air in celebration when he buried a shot that gave the Sixers a 10-point lead. Embiid said James’ foul should have been a flagrant 2 -- an automatic ejection. “Clearly, he wasn’t the same after that as far as his movement,” coach Doc Rivers said. The Lakers suffered their first road loss of the season in 11 games. TIP-INS Lakers: Coach Frank Vogel was a diehard 76ers fan growing up in New Jersey and eventually spent one season as an assistant coach in the 2004-05 season. His trips to Philly are usually a big homecoming but the pandemic sidelined those plans. Vogel said he hasn’t seen his parents since he had dinner with them during the Lakers’ last visit to Philly. He said the 76ers’ 1983 NBA championship and the Charles Barkley-Allen Iverson years “were a big part of my upbringing.” 76ers: Simmons moved into 13th on the NBA’s career triple-double list with 31. REMEMBER KOBE The Lakers played in Philadelphia for the first time since Jan. 25, 2020, when James passed Kobe Bryant for third place on the NBA’s career scoring list. Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people were killed the next morning in a helicopter crash. A year and a day after Bryant’s death, the Lakers played for the first time since the grim anniversary and bowed their heads during a brief video tribute and a moment of silence for Bryant. Embiid was a teen in Africa when he first got hooked on basketball watching Bryant and wore sneakers Wednesday emblazoned with photos of Kobe and Gianna on one side and the 2, 8, 24 uniform numbers on the other. YOU AGAIN Green and backup center Dwight Howard played key roles in the Lakers’ championship last season. Green landed in Philly through a trade and Howard signed a one-year deal. “I miss those guys,” Vogel said. “They were two guys that really starred in their roles. It’s so necessary in a championship run. We don’t win a championship without those guys.”","401267436"
"Donte DiVincenzo throws down a monstrous poster dunk late in the fourth quarter of the Bucks' win. (0:32) TAMPA, Fla. -- — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists, and Donte DiVincenzo sparked a five-point sequence in the fourth quarter that helped the Milwaukee Bucks pull away for a 115-108 win over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night. The Bucks (11-6) were leading by just three points after a dunk by DiVincenzo, who followed with a steal and then drew a flagrant foul on Kyle Lowry while driving to score again. DiVincenzo paid the price for his big play. “That’s significant contact to Donte’s head,” said Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer, who thought a Flagrant 2 should have been called. “He was able to play through it, but we’ll see how serious it is.” Nobody appreciated DiVincenzo’s play more than Antetokounmpo. “It was huge,” he said. “He had the dunk, he had the steal and they hit him in the face. But he was playing the right way. He really helped us tonight.” After DiVincenzo made the two free throws, the Bucks took the ball out of bounds and Bryn Forbes nailed a 3-pointer to put the Bucks up 92-84 with 9:54 left. That helped the Bucks hold off the Raptors (7-11) down the stretch despite a 14-point scoring burst by Lowry and a two-minute stretch in which Antetokounmpo sat out after getting hit in the face. Norman Powell led the Raptors with 26 points, the fourth straight 20-plus game for Powell in his seventh start of the season. “It looks like he’s found a groove,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said, “and it’s translating to both ends of the floor.” Fred VanVleet, the Raptors’ leading scorer, had 10 points and 10 assists after a scoreless first half. Khris Middleton, who finished with 24 points and 10 rebounds, closed the first half with a 3-pointer to put the Bucks up 63-54, the largest lead for either team until 3-pointers by D.J. Augustin and Bobby Portis stretched Milwaukee’s lead to 11 midway through the third quarter. Toronto scored the final nine points of the third and took an 84-83 lead on Yuta Watanabe’s lane runner early in the fourth. The Bucks came in as the NBA’s No. 1 shooting team at 49%, and made 10 of their first 14 shots before Antetokounmpo went to the bench with 4:33 left in the first quarter. They shot 43% for the game.

Pascal Siakam started after missing two games with a swollen left knee and had 11 points and nine rebounds in 35 minutes. 10,000 POINTS FOR LOWRY With a 3-pointer in the first minute, Lowry joined DeMar DeRozan (13,296) and Chris Bosh (10,275) as the only players to score 10,000 points as a member of the Raptors. Lowry scored another 3,732 points in stints with Houston and Memphis. The only other active NBA players to score 10,000 with their current team are Golden State’s Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, Portland’s Damian Lillard, Washington’s Bradley Beal, and Antetokounmpo, who exceeded the 11,000-point mark on Sunday. Lowry finished with 21 points and six rebounds. He has scored 10,019 points for Toronto. FAIR WEATHER TEAMS? Since facing each other in the Eastern Conference finals 20 months ago, the Bucks have met four times -- in Toronto, Milwaukee, Walt Disney World and Tampa. “That’s weird,” noted Budenholzer. “They’re such a great team and organization, and their fan base and city are so unique. To play them here in Tampa, obviously the warm weather is good, but yeah, weird is a good word.”","401267437"
"When asked if he's frustrated after the Wizards' loss to the Pelicans, Bradley Beal says, ""Is the sky blue?"" (0:40) NEW ORLEANS -- — With Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram each having their highest-scoring games of the season, there was only so much Washington's Bradley Beal could do in response. Ingram and Williamson each scored 32 points and New Orleans beat the depleted Wizards 124-106 on Wednesday night. “Brandon and Zion were both very unselfish,” Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said with a nod to Ingram's eight assists and Williamson's willingness to pass instead of forcing shots when the defense collapsed on him. “That’s something that those guys want to do,"" Van Gundy said. ""They helped their teammates win and they still put up big numbers.” Beal, the NBA's leading scorer, almost single-handedly kept the reeling Wizards in striking distance with 47 points. “I try to come out and play with energy every night. Whatever it looks like at the end, it looks like,” Beal said. ""I don’t come out and say I want to score 50 tonight. ... That doesn’t happen. A lot of the (stuff) I’m doing, I’m in awe of it half the time, too.” Washington got as close as eight points in the middle of the fourth quarter before the Pelicans pulled away in the final five minutes, highlighted by Williamson's soaring dunk of Ingram's lob from behind the 3-point line. Ingram finished with a season-high seven 3-pointers on 12 attempts, making all five he attempted in the second half. “I got a little rhythm and I just took the shots they gave me,” Ingram said. Williamson did most of his scoring in the paint and added eight free throws to help New Orleans win for just the second time in 10 games. “We both know we're great players,” Williamson said of himself and Ingram. “But if we're going to take it to that next level, we've got to start running off some wins."" Eric Bledsoe scored 18 points and Steven Adams grabbed a season-high 18 rebounds for New Orleans, which never trailed and made 17 3-pointers. “My teammates taking all those 3s really opened up the game for me and it just really worked out,"" Williamson said. Garrison Mathews scored 15 points and Robin Lopez had 14 for Washington, which played without guard Russell Westbrook and lost for the sixth time in seven games. New Orleans led by as many as 26 when Ingram's 15-foot pull-up made it 74-48. But Beal willed Washington back into the game. Beal's 24 points in the third quarter — during which he made four of five 3-point shots — helped the Wizards cut it to 94-80 by the end of the period. “The winning spirit that he has is critical to our future success,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. “To go through it now and still not give in is huge. It’s huge for me. It’s huge for our staff and it’s huge for our team going forward. We know that we’re going to be healthy and everything’s going to be much better when we have our entire group.” TIP-INS Wizards: Westbrook, the Wizards' second-leading scorer, was scratched for rest after playing a night earlier in Houston. However, Brooks did not rule out playing Westbrook on back-to-back nights later this season. ... Washington also was missing six players because of health and safety protocols. ... Brooks elected to give 6-foot-8, 216-pound Jordan Bell his first start of the season in an effort to match up better with the size of New Orleans' frontcourt. Bell had 11 rebounds and four points. Pelicans: Adams has now had at least 16 rebounds in a game twice this season. ... Guard Lonzo Ball did not return to the game after checking out late in the second quarter. The club said he had a sprained ankle. ... Reserve guard Josh Hart had eight rebounds, his ninth time this season with at least that many. HARD FOUL The Wizards' Alex Len was called for a flagrant foul early in the fourth quarter when he grabbed Williamson by the shoulder with his left hand and right bicep with his right hand and pulled the Pelicans star to the floor as he tried to drive toward the hoop. Williamson was briefly in a prone position before getting up with a smile. Len wound up fouling out with 5:38 left.","401267439"
"Kemba Walker tries to drive as Dejounte Murray comes up with a steal and dunk at the other end. (0:25) SAN ANTONIO -- — DeMar DeRozan scored 21 points, Keldon Johnson had 18 points and 10 rebounds, and the San Antonio Spurs held on to beat the Boston Celtics 110-106 on Wednesday night. LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 points, Dejounte Murray had 11 points and 11 rebounds and San Antonio won its second straight home game. “It just shows what we’re capable of as a team,” Johnson said. The Celtics’ projected starting five of Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Daniel Theis played together for the first time this season. Tatum had 25 points, Brown added 24, and Smart and Walker had 14 apiece. Their balanced output was not enough as Boston had its two-game winning streak end. “It’s been an interesting season,” Brown said. “We’ve had guys out, guys hurt. We are just trying to put everything together. Tonight wasn’t our best night.” The Spurs have defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, Clippers and now the Celtics, but have struggled with allowing big leads early and also with giving away leads late. Both happened Wednesday against the Celtics. “We held on,” DeRozan said. “They made a run. We weren’t scared by it.” After DeRozan hit a pair of free throws to give the Spurs a 103-101 lead, Theis’ dunk tied the game with 40 seconds remaining. After San Antonio regained the lead on DeRozan’s eight-foot jumper, Murray had a breakaway dunk off a steal to give the Spurs a 107-103 lead. “Big-time players make big-time plays,” Johnson said. “DeRozan made a clutch shot and DJ made a clutch play and dunk.” The Spurs rallied after giving up a double-digit lead in the second half. San Antonio made 14 of its last 15 shots in the first half during a 29-6 run. Lonnie Walker IV had nine points in the run and closed with 14 points. A pair of 3-pointers by Aldridge tied the game and gave the Spurs their first lead at 46-43 since the opening seconds of the game. Three days after setting a season high for points in the third quarter against Cleveland, Boston came within four points of matching the mark in outscoring San Antonio 37-21 to open the second half. Tatum and Brown combined for 22 points in the quarter. “The zone kind of threw us out of our rhythm,” DeRozan said. San Antonio had a season-high 20 turnovers, including five during Boston’s 13-1 run to close the third. “It hasn’t been our problem this year, but tonight it was,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. TIP-INS Celtics: Boston played its second game against the West and first since beating Memphis 126-107 on Dec. 30. … Boston is 5-3 when using a starting lineup of Tatum, Brown, Smart, Theis and Tristan Thompson. … Boston is 0-3 this season when it trails entering the second half. Spurs: Popovich said starting guard Derrick White will return this weekend after missing 13 straight games. White fractured his left second toe in his season debut after sitting out the preseason and the team’s first four games following surgery on the same toe for a different injury. “He had contact again today. We’re just being conservative, I guess,” Popovich said. “He probably could go out there tonight. He wants to go out there tonight. We opted to wait until the weekend. You’ll see him this weekend.” … Aldridge joined Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki as the only players in league history with 19,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, 1,000 blocks and 200 3-pointers.","401267440"
"Darius Bazley grabs a rebound and drives downcourt and to the basket for a dunk. (0:19) PHOENIX -- — Chris Paul reminded the Oklahoma City Thunder what they were missing after trading him during the offseason. Then the Thunder turned around and reminded the Phoenix Suns and Paul why they're a team that appears on the rise. Al Horford had 21 points and 11 rebounds, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander also scored 21 points and Oklahoma City rallied to beat Phoenix 102-97 on Wednesday night. Paul scored a season-high 32 points in his first game against Oklahoma City since the trade. The 10-time All-Star played well during his only season with the Thunder, averaging 17.6 points and 6.7 assists. He had one of his best games this season at Oklahoma City’s expense on Wednesday. The point guard shot 12 of 21 from the field and scored 13 points during a seven-minute stretch in the fourth that accounted for a big chunk of the team’s offense. But the young and improving Thunder hung close throughout the fourth and rallied in the final minutes. Lu Dort made a 3-pointer with 2 minutes left that put Oklahoma City up 96-95 and the Thunder didn’t trail again. “Defensively, our mental focus was very good,” Horford said. “I was really happy with how into it we all were. We continued to get stops down the stretch and get rebounds.” It was a see-saw game that featured Phoenix blowing a 17-point lead in the first half and Oklahoma City coughing up a 13-point lead in the second half before the Thunder locked down with defense in the final possessions. Gilgeous-Alexander added eight assists and seven rebounds. “It was a 48-minute game,” Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. “We didn’t start great. They had a rough second quarter and then we just stayed the course.” Paul had a chance to tie the game with about 10 seconds left on a 3-pointer, but missed badly for an airball. “We are just not playing well enough right now,” Paul said. “I am not saying we are not good enough. We are just not playing well enough right now.” Phoenix played without All-Star guard Devin Booker, who missed his second straight game with a sore hamstring. The Suns have lost three straight. Jae Crowder added 17 points for Phoenix, which shot just 38% from the field. “Until this team understands consistency for four quarters we are going to feel like this a lot,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “We can try to get everybody to feel sorry for us. It ain't going to work. We've got to be consistent. This is on us, period.” Oklahoma City took advantage of some cold shooting from Phoenix — which missed 16 straight 3-pointers during a stretch — and took a 59-46 lead early in the third quarter. The Suns eventually shook loose from the slump and pulled within 73-71 heading into the fourth. The Suns jumped out to a 32-17 lead in the first quarter after getting 17 points from their bench. But the offense collapsed in the second and they scored just 10 points while missing all 11 3-point attempts. That helped the Thunder grab a 45-42 halftime lead. TIP-INS Thunder: Horford was back in the lineup after missing six straight games because of personal reasons. ... Veteran guard George Hill didn't play because of a sprained thumb. Suns: Backup guard Cameron Payne missed didn't play because of a sore foot. ... Forwards Dario Saric and Damian Jones both missed the game because of the league's health and safety protocols but were on the bench. WILLIAMS RETURNS Williams was on the bench for the Suns after missing the past two days of practice because of personal reasons. “I don’t like missing days,” Williams said pregame. “It’s not part of my career over my time in the league. I haven’t missed days. So that’s always hard for me, but there’s just certain things in my life that I have to attend to. I may have to do it a few more times going forward, but I certainly appreciate the level of concern and respect for my privacy. At the right time, I’ll let everyone know what’s going on, but for now it’s a private matter.”","401267441"
"SALT LAKE CITY -- — Playing without leading scorer Donovan Mitchell didn't slow down the Utah Jazz. Utah never trailed in a 116-104 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night. The Jazz overwhelmed the Mavericks on both ends of the court on their way to their 10th straight victory and the NBA overall lead. Rudy Gobert led the way with his best all-around performance of the season. He finished with 29 points and 20 rebounds – both season highs – and had three blocks and three steals. Gobert’s dominance around the basket took Dallas out of it early and the Mavericks could never get back on track. His effort ultimately helped Utah pass the Lakers — losers in Philadelphia on Wednesday – for the NBA’s best record at 14-4. “It’s probably the first time since I’ve been here that I’ve seen that much focus from everyone in this locker room,” Gobert said. “I really feel like we’re playing for something bigger and we’re on a mission.” Jordan Clarkson added a season-high 31 points off the bench. Joe Ingles chipped in a season-high 21 points — on seven 3-pointers — and eight assists for Utah. He matched his career high with the seven 3s, falling one shy of tying the franchise record. Mitchell was sidelined for the first time this season after he entered the NBA concussion protocol. Ingles made his first start of the season in Mitchell’s place. The Jazz shot 53.7% from the floor and made 14 3-pointers through the first three quarters. “It’s just a really fun group to play with,” Ingles said. “We play for each other. There’s no egos involved. It’s not as unsalvagable as people think.” Luka Doncic scored 30 points for the Mavericks. Tim Hardaway, Jr. added 19 points and Kristaps Porzingis 18. Dallas lost its third straight game. “We’re just not ourselves right now,” Doncic said. “We’re gonna have to pick it up and be way better than this.” Dorian Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson returned to the Mavericks’ starting lineup after both players missed nine games apiece due to COVID-19 healthy and safety protocols. Dwight Powell also returned after an eight-game absence. Utah got an early boost on offense from Ingles and Gobert. Ingles made a pair of 3-pointers and assisted on two other baskets to help the Jazz stake out a 23-12 lead. Both assists were on baskets from Gobert, who had 10 points in the first quarter. The Jazz expanded their lead to 32-17 late in the first quarter following three straight baskets from Clarkson that capped a 9-0 run. Then, Clarkson scored 13 of Utah’s first 16 points in the second quarter. His final basket in that stretch put the Jazz up 48-27. “The first half was the was the killer,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. “We didn’t come out with enough force, enough disposition, enough energy. They were great and we did not play well.” Utah led by as many as 25 points in the third quarter, going up 98-73 on a step-back 3-pointer from Clarkson. The Jazz never let the Mavericks draw closer than 12 points the rest of the way. Utah coach Quin Snyder credited the team’s success to playing with energy and communicating well on both ends of the court from the opening tip. “We want to be unselfish, help each other on both ends of the floor,” Snyder said. “The game can be simple if you let it be.” The teams will complete a two-game set in Utah on Friday night. TIP INS Mavericks: Hardaway needs to make two 3-pointers to reach 1,000 career made 3-pointers. He made four 3s against the Jazz. … James Johnson had a season-high four blocked shots. … Dallas went 0 of 6 from 3-point range in the first quarter. Jazz: Derrick Favors sat out with lower back soreness. … Seven of Ingles’ eight assists were on Gobert’s baskets. … Gobert scored his most points in an NBA game since getting 35 points in a 108-101 victory over New York in March 2017. FINISHING STRONG During their 10-game winning streak, the Jazz have trailed for a total of 57 seconds in the fourth quarter. New York held a one-point lead to start the fourth in its 108-94 loss on Tuesday before Clarkson helped Utah take the lead for good with his first basket of the quarter. QUOTABLE “It’s just a crazy feeling and crazy vibe that we have and that we preach here. The ball doesn’t stick. We’re all just playing off energy and synergy.” – Clarkson on what has driven Utah’s rise to the top of the Western Conference after a 4-4 start.","401267442"
"Steph Curry goes 1-on-1 with Jaden McDaniels and drains the unreal jumpshot. (0:34) SAN FRANCISCO -- — James Wiseman hardly felt he had to prove something to the team that didn't draft him. The rookie center came off Golden State's bench to score a career-high 25 points, dazzling opposite No. 1 pick Anthony Edwards in a matchup of last year's top two draft selections, and the Warriors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 123-111 on Wednesday night. Edwards, who like Wiseman is just 19, also scored 25 points for his second-highest NBA total. Wiseman, however, said he wasn't looking to show anything to the Minnesota brass who chose Edwards instead. “I really wasn’t motivated by that factor,” Wiseman said. The big man dunked, knocked down all three of his 3-point tries and shot 9 for 14. He also blocked two shots, not fouling four times while going straight up to utilize his 7-foot frame. ""That was one of my best games defensively,"" Wiseman said. His maturity and impressive learning curve continues to amaze coach Steve Kerr. “I’ve tried to picture myself at 19 putting up with everything that he’s had to put up with. It’s remarkable,” Kerr said. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 20 points while playing through foul trouble for Golden State. Stephen Curry added 16 points, eight assists and six rebounds as the Warriors won their ninth straight at home against Minnesota to sweep a two-game series. Andrew Wiggins delivered a big game Monday against his old Timberwolves team and scored another 19 points on 8-for-13 shooting Wednesday. Curry struggled with his shot and finished 6 for 17 from the floor and 4 of 11 on 3-pointers after scoring 36 points in Monday night's 130-108 rout of Minnesota. The Timberwolves worked to get Curry out of sync but couldn't do it consistently. “You can’t just do it sometimes. We’ve got to be an every-possession team,” coach Ryan Saunders said. For a second straight game, Kerr stuck with his new-look starting lineup featuring veteran big man Kevon Looney — and Wiseman in a reserve role. Looney grabbed a season-best 10 rebounds. Damion Lee scored a season-best 17 points and hit four 3s to go with three steals. Edwards had his second game with 20 or more points, shooting 9 for 19 with a season-high five 3-pointers. Malik Beasley also scored 25. Naz Reid added 19 points for Minnesota but went down hard midway through the fourth quarter after blocking a shot by Oubre before returning late. D'Angelo Russell missed both games against his former team because of a bruised right quadriceps muscle. Russell played 33 games for Golden State last season before the trade last February that brought Wiggins to the Bay Area. OFFICIAL INJURED The game was down to two referees after Scott Twardoski got hurt, the Warriors said. SMITH REMEMBERED A photo of Sekou Smith and tribute to him was shown on the big screen.

"The Pistons put on a balanced team attack as they take down the Lakers 107-92, making this Los Angeles' first two-game losing streak of the season. (2:20) DETROIT -- — LeBron James made his first seven shots from the field and looked plenty capable of leading the Lakers to a victory with Anthony Davis sidelined. Then James tried to become more of a facilitator — and he never really regained that scoring groove. James scored just two points after halftime, and the Detroit Pistons handed Los Angeles its second straight loss, 107-92 on Thursday night. Davis sat out because of a right quad contusion. “I think early on I got it going, and then I still at the end of the day, still got to get my teammates involved,” James said. “I definitely missed some shots that I know I’m accustomed to making."" Blake Griffin scored 23 points for the Pistons, who are having a strange week that has included wins over the 76ers and Lakers but a loss to Cleveland in between. “I thought we were really good,” Griffin said. “I was proud of the way everybody played.” James had 22 points and 10 assists. The Lakers lost by a point at Philadelphia on Wednesday night, and now the defending champions are on their first losing streak of any length since before last year's playoffs. Detroit led by one before Griffin's 3-pointer with 6:54 remaining started a 16-0 run. The Lakers went nearly seven minutes without scoring. “I don’t know if we ran out of gas,"" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. ""We just didn’t have a great rhythm that second half in any way.” Wayne Ellington added 20 points for the Pistons. James was questionable because of a left ankle sprain, but he looked fine at the outset, scoring 14 points in the first quarter. James made four 3-pointers in the first half, but so did Ellington, and the Pistons only trailed 58-56 at the break. TIP-INS Lakers: Kyle Kuzma scored 22 points and Talen Horton-Tucker contributed 13. ... James went 1 of 12 from the field after making his first seven shots. Pistons: Detroit made all 13 of its free throws. ... Mason Plumlee had 17 points and 10 rebounds. UPS AND DOWNS The last three Detroit games — a win over Philadelphia on Monday, a loss to Cleveland on Wednesday and the game against the Lakers on Thursday — were decided by exactly 15 points. The Pistons caught a break when Joel Embiid of the 76ers was out Monday, and again when they missed having to face Davis, but this rebuilding team can use some reasons for optimism. Besides, the Lakers are still tough as long as James is in the lineup. “They’re experienced, they know how to play,"" Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. ""But it’s good for us to get that confidence and to reinforce what you’re preaching.” TORRID STRETCH Ellington finished 6 of 9 from 3-point range and is 40 of 67 from long distance in his last eight games. Ellington became the eighth player in NBA history to have at least seven straight games with four or more 3s. “He just single-handedly spaced our floor on offense, when you have to give that much attention to somebody,"" Plumlee said. ""Coach always draws up a good first play to get him off, he hits it and then it’s like the rest of the night that team is worried about him coming off pin-downs. Then now, he is getting some cutting baskets because they are so worried about him coming off the screen. It just changes the dynamics of your offense.”","401267444"

Nicolas Batum scored 18 points and the Clippers used a 20-2 run in the third quarter to help fuel what became a 109-105 victory over the short-handed and reeling Heat on Thursday night. Lou Williams had 17 points for the Clippers, who were again without Kawhi Leonard and Paul George because of the league’s virus protocols and Patrick Beverley with right knee soreness. “Big win for us tonight,"" Batum said. The Clippers won despite trailing by 18 early, the franchise’s biggest comeback win since rallying from 31 down to beat Golden State in a playoff game on April 15, 2019. “We just continue to keep playing, kept fighting, kept competing, just trying to play the right way,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. Tyler Herro returned after missing seven games with neck spasms and scored 19 points for Miami, which dropped its fifth straight and is 6-12 after going to the NBA Finals last season. The Heat welcomed back about 1,500 fans, all of whom had to get past virus-sniffing dogs or pass a rapid coronavirus test, for the first time since last season was suspended on March 11 as the pandemic was beginning. “This group is good in this locker room,"" Herro said. “And we're going to figure it out soon."" Miami got 30 points from its two-way contract players, Gabe Vincent (18) and Max Strus (12). Bam Adebayo finished with 16 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists for Miami.

"Frank Kaminsky passes inside to a cutting Mikal Bridges for the layup. (0:16) PHOENIX -- — The Frank Kaminsky-Abdel Nader connection isn't the first thing — or the second or third thing — that opposing teams are usually concerned about when facing the Phoenix Suns. But for one night, the two backups were unstoppable in the fourth quarter and helped the Suns snap a frustrating three-game losing streak. Nader scored 16 points, Kaminsky nearly had a triple double with 12 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists and Phoenix pulled away in the second half to beat the Golden State Warriors 114-93 on Thursday night. Suns coach Monty Williams was particularly pleased with the way the backups played, which was a big reason the team had 34 assists on 41 made baskets. “That’s the kind of basketball we want to play,” Williams said. “That’s the level I’m going to hold the guys to. 34 assists, the ball movement, the player movement, that’s who we are. The balance was much better tonight.” Phoenix turned a five-point halftime advantage into an 85-71 lead by the end of the third. The Suns have struggled to hold leads over the past few weeks but didn’t have a problem Thursday, pulling ahead 100-81 after Nader hit back-to-back 3s on passes from Kaminsky. “Frank’s been amazing, making the job way easier for guys like myself,” Nader said. “A big man with his head up and making those passes is huge.” The Suns did some of their best work when the bench was in the game but the starters were solid too. All five of them scored in double figures and Mikal Bridges led the team with 20. Deandre Ayton added 12 points and 13 rebounds in 23 minutes. The Suns moved back above .500 at 9-8. The Warriors fell to 10-9. Stephen Curry led the Warriors with 27 points on 10-of-20 shooting, including 5 of 10 from 3-point range. Andrew Wiggins had 16 points, and Eric Paschall 12. Golden State shot just 38% from the field, going 29% from 3-point range. “We are still looking for consistency at both ends,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “Our defense is up and down and our offense is up and down. Hence the season is up and down.” Phoenix built a 14-point lead by late in the first quarter but Golden State pulled to 52-47 by halftime. “I thought we had every opportunity to have it,” Kerr said. “We hung in there the first half. Shots weren’t going in but we battled and we were right in the game at halftime. It just slipped away from us. I thought Phoenix executed better than we did.” NO TRIPLE DOUBLE FOR FRANK With a big lead in the final minutes, the Suns were mostly concentrating on getting Kaminsky his first career triple double. It didn't work out, but Kaminsky was still proud of the way the bench played. “Energy is contagious,” Kaminsky said. “It starts with our bench and you try to play as hard as you can, bring energy and tonight it worked.” TIP-INS Warriors: Kelly Oubre Jr. had four points and four rebounds in his first game against his former team.

"Christian Wood pulls off a Eurostep on his way to the poster dunk late in the first half. (0:24) HOUSTON -- — Victor Oladipo scored 25 points and the Houston Rockets shook off a terrible first quarter and held on late to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 104-101 on Thursday night. The Rockets were down by 20 points in the first quarter before using a big second to take the lead and hold on down the stretch for their fourth straight victory. “The guys have grit and they’re determined,"" coach Stephen Silas said. “The adversity part is something that we’ve been talking a lot about. I think earlier in the season adversity would hit and we would succumb to that adversity. But tonight... we put forth the right energy to overcome it."" A driving layup by Oladipo extended the lead to 101-98 with 26.2 seconds to go and Gary Trent Jr. missed a layup on the other end. Christian Wood made one of two free throws about 10 seconds later, before Anfernee Simons cut the lead to one with a 3-pointer with 3.1 seconds remaining. Eric Gordon made two free throws with 2.1 seconds to go and Simons missed a shot at the buzzer to give Houston the win. Wood finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds in his return after missing three games with a sprained right ankle. John Wall had 20. Wall said things are much better in Houston now the drama surrounding James Harden's desire to be traded is over. Harden was traded to Brooklyn on Jan. 13. “It was kind of hard to play through that and find a chemistry,"" Wall said. “And once we made the trades happen and we got the team that we wanted and the guys that wanted to be here and once we all committed to what we wanted to do, we were going to be a good team.

"LaMelo Ball throws the inbounds pass off of Domantas Sabonis' back to run out the clock as the Hornets escape with a 108-105 win vs. the Pacers. (0:20) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- — P.J. Washington knows he is going to have to have a bigger impact if the Charlotte Hornets hope to make a run at the postseason. The Hornets forward stepped up his game Friday night with 19 points and nine rebounds as Charlotte avenged an earlier loss to Indiana with a 108-105 win over the Pacers. Terry Rozier scored 19 points and Devonte Graham added 14 points and 10 assists as the Hornets bounced back from a 116-106 loss to the Pacers two nights earlier. “He's definitely the X-factor,"" Graham said of Washington, who plays the five-spot for the Hornets when they go to a smaller lineup. ""Coach (James) Borrego has been on him non-stop just about being aggressive and coming out with that hunger.” Washington, who came in averaging 12.6 points, was apparently listening to Borrego. He was aggressive early, hitting his first seven shots, including three 3-pointers. That helped spread the Pacers' defense and open up the passing lanes for the Hornets, who finished with a season-high 35 assists and shot 50.6% from the field. “We are a real unselfish team and we like playing together,” Graham said. Domantas Sabonis led the Pacers with 22 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, nearly duplicating the triple-double he had on Wednesday night. Malcolm Brogdon scored 21 points and Myles Turner had 20 points. The Hornets led by nine in the fourth quarter before the Pacers battled back and took the lead with three minutes remaining on a one-handed turnaround jumper from the baseline by Turner, who beat the shot clock. The lead changed hands a few times before Rozier knocked down a 3-pointer from the left wing and Graham buried a transition 3 to put Charlotte up by five. Brodgon cut the lead to three on a driving layup. After a Charlotte turnover, the Pacers had a chance to tie, but Brodgon's 3-point try bounced off the back of the rim with 6 seconds left and the Pacers couldn't get the rebound. “We didn’t really establish our defense,” Turner said. ""It seemed like every time we missed a rebound, they would convert a 3. It was the multitude of rebounds and stops that we missed” TIP INS Pacers: Doug McDermott had 11 points in 17 minutes after scoring 28 against the Hornets on Wednesday night. Hornets: Ball had the highlight of the game in the third quarter when he leaped to grab a missed layup by Graham and dunked hard over Sabonis. ... The Hornets shot a season-best 61% in the first half to build a 64-60 lead at break. ... Charlotte held Indiana to 45 points in the second half. BALL'S EFFORT Rookie LaMelo Ball, who has been struggling, came alive with 16 points, seven assists and six rebounds as the Hornets won for the second time in eight games. Ball was 0 for 6 from 3-point range and had five turnovers, but still managed to make an impact in other ways, including a highlight reel dunk over Sabonis on an offensive rebound. “I thought he came in, he gave us great minutes with his pace and energy,"" Borrego said. ""Our pace picked up when he came in.” SPLITTING TIME This is the third time the Pacers have played the same team in back-to-back games this season as part of the NBA's new COVID-impacted schedule — and every time they have split the series. “I was just fine with the scheduling the way it was and our players are continuing to stay safe and following the NBA protocols and the rules and they’re very determined,"" Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren said. ""They don’t make any excuses about anything – about not being able to leave the hotel or being around people. They’re following the rules. They’re doing a good job of that. We were together here for a few days out on the road, it’s a lot of time to bond together as a team. We fought tonight. We just got beat.”","401267448"
"Paul George discusses being placed with Kawhi Leonard in the NBA's health and safety protocols for four days due to contact tracing. (0:21) ORLANDO, Fla. -- — Curious how sharp Kawhi Leonard and Paul George would be in their first games back following five-day layoffs, the Los Angeles Clippers didn’t have to wait long for answers Friday night. The superstar forwards combined for 35 first-quarter points and both delivered thunderous dunks over Orlando players later in the first half in the Clippers’ 116-90 victory over the Magic. George had 26 points, nine rebounds and five assists, and Leonard added 24 points after they missed two games because of NBA contact tracing protocols. George attacked the rim and soared high over center Nikola Vucevic for a dynamic dunk in the first quarter. Leonard beat Aaron Gordon off the dribble in the second period and jammed to bring his teammates on the nearby bench to their feet in the second quarter. Clearly, both superstars were back for a Clippers team that beat Orlando for a 14th consecutive time — a winning streak that dates to Nov. 6, 2013. “Both … it was a tie. We both a great one,” George said when asked which dunk was better between him and Leonard. “I’m just going at the rim with force, using my athleticism until my athleticism is gone. I’ve still got a little left in the tank.” Leonard and George both played 28 minutes and were rested early in the fourth quarter after the lead ballooned to as much as 27 points. Leonard made 8 of 15 shots, had a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first half and passed to Reggie Jackson for another buzzer-beater at the end of the third quarter. George made 10 of 19 shots and 3 of 9 3-pointers. The Clippers were a plus-27 with George on the floor and a plus-23 with Leonard. “I was super relieved that we were both healthy, first and foremost,” George said. “We had been playing so well that it was unfortunate that we had to take the hiatus, but safety is first.” Serge Ibaka added 13 points and nine rebounds for a Clippers team that is 13-2 this season when leading at halftime. Orlando scored the first 11 points of the second half to get within three, but the Clippers outscored the Magic 28-11 the rest of the third period to take a 90-71 edge into the final period. “On a night where guys were a little tired, just having their presence was huge and that was big for us,” Clippers coach Ty Lue said of the firepower provided by George and Leonard following Orlando’s brief third-period run. “They were just making plays for everybody else and making the game easy.” Once 6-2, Orlando lost for a 10th time in the past 12 games. The Magic’s frustrations showed in the third period when Vucevic and coach Steve Clifford were hit with technical fouls just seconds apart for arguing with referee Aaron Smith over a non-call. Terrence Ross led the Magic with 24 points off the bench. Vucevic, Orlando’s most consistent player all season, finished with just 10 after hitting only four of 13 shots. Orlando shot 36 percent from the floor. “(The Clippers) are terrific and they played well,” Clifford aid. “Their superstars are two of the, whatever, 8-to-10 best players in the league and they played like it. That makes it hard.” TIP INS Clippers: The start was moved to 8 p.m. by the NBA to allow for more time for players’ COVID-19 tests to be finalized and evaluated. The NBA has already had to postpone 22 games thus far — 21 of them coming since Jan. 10. ... Patrick Beverley missed his third straight game with a sore knee. Magic: Vucevic has potentially put himself in position to be an All-Star again by greatly improving his 3-point shooting. After making just seven 3s in his first five NBA seasons, Vucevic has steadily made more 3-pointers each of the past five years. He came into Friday having hit 52 of 117 3s — easily the most among NBA centers. ... Michael Carter-Williams, who hoped to play Friday, re-injured his sprained left foot in practice Thursday.","401267449"
"Wizards coach Scott Brooks describes Washington's difficult season thus far and how the team can get back on track. (1:17) WASHINGTON -- — The jawing and the chippiness kept accumulating in a game Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce called “messy” and “wild.” So did the technical fouls — nine total — and ejections — three in all, including for Russell Westbrook and Rajon Rondo, as Atlanta held NBA scoring leader Bradley Beal to a season low in points, and Trae Young’s 41 helped the Hawks top the Washington Wizards 116-100 Friday night. “Just need to stay focused,” Atlanta's Danilo Gallinari said. “Personally I don’t have all that energy to spend on technicals and talking to refs and stuff.” Westbrook, who matched Beal with 26 points and repeatedly traded words with Rondo, blamed himself for getting tossed in the fourth quarter. Rondo waved goodbye as Westbrook left. “I can't allow myself to stoop down to anybody’s level. It's not my character,” the past NBA MVP said. “I take full responsibility with all of that. I don’t agree with the second tech, but that’s neither here nor there.” Wizards coach Scott Brooks also thought Westbrook should have been called for a personal foul there, saying that if “you’re going to call that, you might as well call them early in the game.” But referee Mark Ayotte said a technical was warranted because Westbrook pushed Rondo, calling it physical taunt. Young scored 18 in the fourth quarter to hold off a comeback by Washington, which trailed by as many as 23 in the third but got within 10 in the final period. ""He just gives us multi-layered, multi-level, attack mentality,"" Pierce said. The subject of trade speculation, Beal came in averaging 35.4 points for a last-place Wizards team that has been short-handed because of COVID-19 issues, recently had a half-dozen games in a row postponed and is now 3-12. But with Cam Reddish playing tough defense, Beal missed all eight attempts from 3-point range Friday and entered the fourth quarter with just 13 points. “I just didn’t have it going,” Beal said. “I told the guys I gave them nothing. I’ve got to be a lot better."" He drew one of the six techs whistled on Washington, which lost center Robin Lopez in the second half after he got two back-to-back. “Just too many techs — on both sides,” Beal said. The Wizards are 0-4 since returning from a series of postponements that left them without a game for 13 days. Six players tested positive for COVID-19, and another three were sidelined after contact tracing. Rui Hachimura, Davis Bertans and Moe Wagner returned Friday. Brooks expects Deni Avdija, Troy Brown Jr. and Ish Smith to be back for Washington's next game. “We understand that nobody’s going to feel sorry for us,” Beal said. “We’ve got to dig ourselves out of this hole.” TIP-INS Hawks: De'Andre Hunter left in the first half with an injured right knee. ... Clint Capela's 14 rebounds gave him 14 straight games with at least 10. Wizards: Westbrook's four assists raised his total to 7,394 and moved him past Maurice Cheeks (7,392) for 13th on the NBA career list. T 'EM UP! Westbrook and Rondo were separated by an official and both assessed technical fouls with a minute left in the first half. Beal got a tech in the third quarter, upset after no foul was called when he took a hard fall at the offensive end. Soon after, he was jawing back-and-forth with Rondo, who was on the Atlanta sideline and not in the game at the time. ... Lopez was out of the game in the third quarter when Beal was called for a delay of game before attempting a free throw. A medical mask pulled down below his nose and mouth, Lopez said something to an official that prompted his one-after-the-other techs.","401267450"
"Immanuel Quickley connects on a trio of 3-pointers and celebrates by swimming on the court. (0:46) NEW YORK -- — Rookie guard Immanuel Quickley scored 25 points off the bench, leading the New York Knicks to a 102-81 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night. Quickley was one of five players to score in double figures for New York, which snapped a three-game losing streak. R.J. Barrett scored 24 points, Julius Randle finished with 16 and Austin Rivers 13. While New York appeared to get back on track, Cleveland lost for the third time in four games. Darius Garland scored 24 points, Collin Sexton added 17 and Jarrett Allen 15. “We just didn't bring it tonight,” Garland said. New York’s defense proved troublesome for Cleveland, which was held to a season low in points. After a sluggish opening 12 minutes, the Knicks went into the half with a 47-33 lead. New York outscored the Cavaliers 28-16 in the second quarter and limited Cleveland to 6-of-19 shooting from the field. For the game, New York held the Cavaliers to 34.9% shooting. “We harp on being one of the top defensive teams in the league,” Quickley said, later adding the Knicks are “trying to get in the playoffs this year.” The last time New York qualified for the playoffs was in 2012-13. While Cleveland was misfiring, the Knicks built on their advantage. New York ended the third quarter on a 12-1 run, highlighted by Quickley’s 3-pointer with 0.5 seconds left that extended the lead to 72-55. Quickley’s alley-oop to Nerlens Noel for a one-handed slam with 8:29 left in the fourth allowed New York to stretch the lead to 19 at 84-65. “He's always been good,” Barrett said of Quickley. “He's playing hard. He's making plays.” TIP-INS: Cavaliers: Entering Friday's game, the Cavaliers ranked second in the NBA with a 1.21 points per possession in transition, and their 59.1% field goal accuracy in transition leads the league. Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff pointed to his small unit as a reason for his team’s success in transition. “They’re fast,” Bickerstaff said before the game. “That gives us an opportunity to play in transition in the broken floor. They can space the floor. We have guys who can shoot it. And then especially when you put guys who can attack the rim like our bigs can in pick-and-roll, and you give them more space that’s beneficial for us.” Knicks: Prior to the game, New York head coach Tom Thibodeau paid homage to John Chaney, the legendary Temple University coach who died Friday. Thibodeau was an assistant with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1994-95 and 1995-96 and grew to admire Chaney. “I got to know him a little bit,” Thibodeau said. “He was just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” ... Thibodeau said Frank Ntilikina is “getting there,” as the third-year guard recuperates from a sprained right knee. Ntilikina, who suffered the injury in the Knicks’ 95-86 win over the Cavaliers in Cleveland on Dec. 29, is averaging 4.5 points in four games this season, and is scheduled to become a restricted free agent at the end of the season. “He’s moving well in practice,” Thibodeau said. ... The Knicks held a moment of silence for Harthorne Wingo, who passed away on Jan. 20 but whose death became known Tuesday. He was 73. Wingo played for New York from 1972-76, and was a member of the franchise’s last championship-winning team in 1972-73.","401267451"
"Kyle Lowry is tossed from the game to the surprise of Kyle Lowry and several other members of the Raptors. (0:51) TAMPA, Fla. -- — The Sacramento Kings are starting to feel things going their way. “Things are turning in the right direction,” Harrison Barnes said after scoring 26 points Friday night in Sacramento's 126-124 victory over the Toronto Raptors, the Kings' third straight win. “There's some joy in being in these games and winning, but there's no time to sit back and relax. We have to keep that edge and keep hustling.” De'Aaron Fox added 24 for the Kings, who haven't lost since Jan. 20. Their scheduled six-game Eastern swing has been reduced to four games by a couple of postponements, and they have won twice in Florida. Buddy Hield had 22 points and Hassan Whiteside came off the bench with 16 points and nine rebounds for the Kings (8-10) in his second game back after missing four games with a hip injury. “That was huge,” Barnes said of Whiteside's 20-minute contribution. “He's still getting his legs underneath him but he gives us a different look, puts pressure on the defense.” Sacramento shot 55% overall to offset nine fourth-quarter turnovers. Pascal Siakam scored 32 points for the Raptors (7-12). Fred VanVleet had 26 points and six assists. “We didn't play well enough in the first half, and you don't do that in this league,” said Siakam, whose drives got most of the Sacramento frontcourt in foul trouble and got him 14 free throws. “We did a pretty good coming back but you can't get behind like that.” Barnes scored 13 points in the first quarter, nine during a 17-2 run that carried into the second quarter and left Sacramento with a 17-point lead. The Kings led 68-58 after a first half in which they shot 54.8%. Sacramento led by 18 at one point and by double digits throughout the second half until Yuta Watanabe's 3-pointer brought the Raptors within seven with 6:02 remaining. A layup by Watanabe got the Raptors within one with 1:08 left, but Tyrese Haliburton answered with a 3-pointer for Sacramento, putting Toronto into a fouling mode in the final 44 seconds.

"The Pelicans offense was firing on all cylinders as they controlled the entire game against the Bucks en route to a 131-126 win. (2:10) NEW ORLEANS -- — With the mercurial Lonzo Ball looking more engaged, aggressive and accurate from the perimeter, the New Orleans Pelicans looked as capable against elite competition as they have all season. Ball highlighted a season-best 27-point performance with seven 3-pointers and the Pelicans held off a furious Milwaukee rally to beat the Bucks 131-126 on Friday night. “It’s just about staying aggressive and staying true to the work I put in,” said Ball, who also had eight assists. “I knew it was going to turn around sooner or later.” Now the question is whether the Pelicans can sustain it. “It's just a lot more fluid, a lot more guys in rhythm and we get better quality shots,” Ball said. “So, we got to kind of use tonight as a blueprint.” Brandon Ingram scored 28 points, and Zion Williamson had 21 points, nine rebounds and a career-best seven assists to help New Orleans prevent the Bucks from erasing a 28-point deficit during the game's final 17 minutes. “I never felt like the win was in doubt,"" Williamson said. “We responded well. ... When everybody is playing with high confidence, it’s great for the team and it gives us multiple scoring threats.” Eric Bledsoe also hit seven 3s and scored 25 for the Pelicans, who combined to make 21 from deep. Steven Adams grabbed a season-high 20 rebounds. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 38 points and 11 rebounds, and former Pelican Jrue Holiday scored 22 for Milwaukee, which trailed nearly the entire game, usually by double-digits. “Hats off to them. They were hitting everything and from 3,” Holiday said. “Contested shots, open shots, just were making shots. They came to play.” The Pelicans appeared firmly in control when Ball's jumper made it 93-65 with 4:35 left in the third quarter. “I do think the first 30 minutes of the game showed the possibilities at least of what we can be,"" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. “Granted, we were making a lot of shots. But for 30 minutes, we even guarded pretty well. Then we didn’t guard at all in the last 18 minutes.” Khris Middleton's turnaround jumper began a head-spinning 20-3 Milwaukee run during a span of 3:08 late in the third period. Antetokounmpo hit a 3 and capped the surge with a spinning dribble for a layup while he was fouled. “I kind of like the way we came out in the second half,” Antetokounmpo said. “We were hungry and it’s a thing that we've got to do for a longer period of the game.” Milwaukee's deficit was down to single digits when Pat Connaughton's layup made it 98-89, but the Pelicans scored the last five points of the quarter, including Nicolo Melli's 3 as the period ended, to stem the tide. After that, the Pelicans kept their lead around 10 points until less than two minutes remained. The Pelicans, who came in having won just two of their last 10 games, shot 57.1% in the first 24 minutes, including 12 of 21 from 3-point range. They led 47-28 after Nickeil Alexander-Walker made a layup over Brook Lopez and high off the glass, then intercepted Antetokounmpo's pass and drove straight back in for a dunk. Bledsoe, who came to New Orleans as part of a multiple-team trade sending Holiday to Milwaukee, hit five of his first six 3-point shots and had 17 points before halftime. Pelicans reserve guard Josh Hart made all four of his shots in the second quarter, three from deep. The Bucks struggled just to make open shots in the first half, hitting 37%, while also turning the ball over eight times. TIP-INS Bucks: Middleton finished with 16 points, as did Lopez, while Donte DiVincenzo had 10 points. ...

HONORING HOLIDAY The approximately 1,400 fans in attendance bellowed a familiar, elongated “Jruuuuue,” when Holiday was introduced as a Milwaukee starter. It was the same way fans in New Orleans greeted Holiday during the previous seven seasons. During an early timeout, a tribute was shown on the video board honoring Holiday's play and community service while he was in New Orleans. He and his wife, former international soccer star Lauren Holiday, notably donated more than $5 million to support Black-owned businesses seeking help during the pandemic. The video drew enthusiastic applause. “If there’s one thing I know about New Orleans, it’s that they love the players that embrace the city and try to make this home for them,” Holiday said. ""That’s what I tried to do. I love the city.” QUOTABLE “If you miss as many shots as I do, you better bloody do something else,"" Adams said about his game-high rebounding, which came two days after his 18 rebounds in a win over Washington.

"Tobias Harris shows no mercy as he puts Jaden McDaniels on a poster late in the fourth quarter. (0:20) MINNEAPOLIS -- — Joel Embiid racked up 37 points and 11 rebounds in 27 minutes, leading the Philadelphia 76ers to a 118-94 victory over the depleted Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. Tobias Harris added 17 points and 11 rebounds for the 76ers (14-6), as the Eastern Conference leaders cruised away after a five-point halftime lead on the worst team in the Western Conference. Embiid went 16 for 18 from the free throw line, as a Timberwolves team missing centers Karl-Anthony Towns and Naz Reid was no match. Coming off a win on Wednesday over the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, when Harris hit the go-ahead jumper with 3 seconds left, the Sixers avoided the type of letdown that has dogged them in the past. “I thought Joel posted deeper in the second half. We were waiting for them to trap, and they didn’t, so we just kept going to him,” Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers said. Embiid was a game-time decision due to back tightness, but the smooth-moving 7-footer sure didn't show much sluggishness as the 76ers beat the Wolves (4-14) for the seventh straight time. “You’ve got to keep pushing, I want us to build momentum,"" Embiid said. ""We've got to keep winning these games, every single one of them, and nights like tonight can help in the long run where I don't have to play 30 minutes or more.” The 76ers could use more production from Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Danny Green, who shot a combined 4 for 13 from the floor in the first half, but that wasn’t necessary on this night. The three-time All-Star Embiid, who entered the evening fourth in the NBA in scoring, had his ninth 20-point half of the season, tied for the most in the league. He finished 10 for 19 from the floor. “It’s just dominance on his part. I think he’s figured it out, and he’s done such a good job of creating plays for other guys out of the post,” Harris said, later adding: “It's a pleasure to be out there on the floor with him.” With Towns out for the seventh straight game due to COVID-19 protocols and Reid sidelined for the first time by a wrist injury, Ed Davis took the big man spot for Minnesota with a four-guard lineup featuring rookie Anthony Edwards (15 points) in his first career start. This was the 10th different starting lineup used by coach Ryan Saunders in 18 games. “We knew what we were up against, how physical they are even when you’re at a full roster,” Saunders said. Malik Beasley led the Timberwolves with 22 points, and D'Angelo Russell added 14 points on just 3-for-11 shooting after a three-game absence due to a quadriceps injury. Davis did his best, and the Wolves scrapped their way through the first half to keep the score close until Embiid took over in the third quarter, but playing this short-handed they were never going to keep up with 18 turnovers. “We don’t play in our system enough. I think we kind of get away from it when things start going bad,” Russell said. TIP-INS 76ers: Harris had his second double-double of the season. ... Mike Scott missed his seventh straight game with knee swelling. Timberwolves: The last time Minnesota beat Philadelphia was here on Nov. 17, 2016, the only win over Embiid. ... Jarrett Culver missed his second straight game with a sprained ankle, and Juancho Hernangómez was sidelined for the eighth consecutive game due to COVID-19 protocols. That left the Wolves without three of their top six scorers and four of their nine most-used players. AT THE LINE Embiid leads the NBA in free throw attempts and makes, and this was his fifth game of the season with 16 or more tries. “A lot of people I guess call it flopping and all that stuff, but the way I see it is just about being smarter than your opponent,” Embiid said.","401267454"

We were laughing, playing hard, joking around. We were loose. We had fun. Everybody got in, so that was cool.” Harden finished with a triple-double — he also had 11 assists and 10 rebounds. It was his third triple-double since joining the Nets two weeks ago. He said the process of working with Irving is coming along. “We’ve just got to find that balance of when to be aggressive and when to make plays,"" he said. ""I think even with our aggressiveness, we’re still playmakers. I think throughout the course of the game, we did a really good job of getting our guys involved, but then being aggressive and scoring the ball as well. Nothing really changes, even when KD is in the lineup as well.” Theo Maledon, a 19-year-old rookie, scored 24 points and was perfect on six shots from 3-point range for the Thunder. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points and Hamidou Diallo added 18 for Oklahoma City. The Nets led by nine at the end of the first quarter, then scored the first 10 points of the second to take a 46-27 lead and forced the Thunder to call a timeout. The Nets kept it going after the interruption, scoring five more points before the Thunder got on the board in the quarter. It took the Thunder nearly 3½ minutes to score in the period. “We were active on both ends of the floor,” Harden said. ""Coaches drew up a beautiful game plan and we executed on both ends of the ball. We like to see carryover and these last few games, we’ve been carrying over. We’ve been playing well.” The Nets led 76-59 at halftime -- their season high point total for a first half and the most the Thunder have allowed in any half this season. Harden had 17 points on 6-for-8 shooting before the break. Brooklyn made 15 of 23 shots in the third to take a 115-94 lead into the fourth quarter. “It was tough to defend them,” Oklahoma City's Al Horford said. “We were never able to make up the lead they built.” TIP-INS Nets: Shot exactly 15 for 26 from the field in both the first and second quarters. ...

"DeMar DeRozan hits a 3-pointer then gets an and-1 layup to go down on the next Spurs' possession. (0:29) SAN ANTONIO -- — Gregg Popovich likes what he sees from San Antonio’s youthful roster and that’s a huge compliment from a coach who rarely gives any to his team. DeMar DeRozan had 30 points and 10 assists, Dejounte Murray scored 26 points and the Spurs beat Denver 119-109 on Friday night to snap the Nuggets’ five-game winning streak. “Of course, I liked it. They did a good job,” Popovich said. “Denver is one of the toughest teams to guard. They have such great movement. They are so well coached. They are consistent night after night in what they do, and we were able to show some pretty darn good grunt and aggressiveness, good activity. ""After the first quarter we did a good job on the boards, so it’s a good step for us."" San Antonio held Denver to 23 points in the final quarter for its third straight victory, all at home. The Spurs and the Nuggets are both 11-8, but San Antonio is fourth in the Western Conference. While two-thirds of the season remain, it’s progress for a franchise that missed the playoffs last season for the first time in 22 years. “The biggest thing for Pop is to be patient and to trust for us to be professionals,” guard Patty Mills said. Mills had 17 points and Keldon Johnson added 18 points for San Antonio. Nikola Jokic had 35 points and 10 rebounds, and Jamal Murray added 20 points for Denver. The Nuggets had not lost since falling 109-105 to the Utah Jazz on Jan. 17. “Overall, hell of a road trip,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “(Finishing the road trip at) 4-1, going home. The schedule is unforgiving.” Dejounte Murray poked the ball away from Jamal Murray and scored a contested layup over Jokic to give the Spurs a 113-103 lead with 3:08 remaining. It marked the second straight game Murray had a late steal against the opposing point guard. “That has been his constant through his time here in San Antonio and in the NBA,” Mills said. “His ability to junk things up defensively with his length.” San Antonio built a 10-point lead midway through the second quarter and regained it two minutes into the third. The Spurs used mid-range jumpers and drives to establish both leads, finishing with 54 points in the paint. Denver responded each time behind its stars, Jokic and Murray. After taking just two free throws compared to 17 from the Spurs in the first half, the Nuggets had 18 free throws in the second half. TIP-INS Nuggets: Malone said he expects Murray to play Sunday despite Denver’s point guard injuring his right hip after crashing into a stanchion near the Nuggets’ bench with 8:49 left in the fourth quarter. Murray tumbled after charging at and fouling Mills on a 3-point attempt. Murray exited the game shortly after and spent several minutes stretching and jogging to test the hip in the team’s tunnel before returning to the game with 5:29 remaining. … Denver had won three straight against San Antonio. … The Nuggets were a franchise-best 7-2 on the road through nine games entering Friday. … JaMychal Green had three points and seven rebounds after collecting 15 points and 10 rebounds against Miami on Wednesday. Spurs: Popovich, who turned 72 on Thursday, recently received and did a PSA for the COVID-19 vaccination. “If we can do our part in any way, in making people feel comfortable that getting this shot is wise both for them and everybody else around them, I think we need to do it,” Popovich said. … Murray and reserves Mills, Devin Vassell, Rudy Gay and Jakob Poeltl lead all NBA lineups in defensive efficiency and in plus-minus rating per possession this season.","401267456"
"Luka Doncic calls the Mavericks' performance vs. the Jazz terrible and says it looks like the team doesn't care. (1:05) SALT LAKE CITY -- — With different players taking turns leading the offense, the Utah Jazz aren’t just winning — they are winning big. This time it was Bojan Bogdanovic’s time to shine. Emerging from a shooting slump, Bogdanovic scored 17 of his season-high 32 points in the third quarter and the Jazz completed a sweep of the Dallas Mavericks with a 120-101 victory on Friday night to run their NBA-best winning streak to 11. “Just this morning coaches said they want me to shoot more, to be aggressive, but it’s sometimes it’s hard when you’re struggling and you don’t see the ball getting through the net,” Bogdanovic said. “I’m trying to be myself trying and be aggressive no matter what percentage I’m shooting.” Even without Donovan Mitchell, who missed his second game in the concussion protocol, the Jazz (15-4) had little resistance from the Mavericks as they posted their 10th win by double digits in their streak. “This is a very special group. It starts with our stars, Rudy (Gobert) and Don, two of the most unselfish stars you’re going to find in the league, and that kind of just trickles down to every player on our roster. We just sacrifice for each other,” said Mike Conley, who scored 22 points. Luka Doncic scored 25 points and Jalen Brunson had 13 for the Mavericks (8-11), who have lost four in a row. “Terrible … I would say right now it’s looking like we don’t care, honestly, if we win games or not. We just got to have more energy and more effort,” Doncic said. Joe Ingles hit back-to-back 3-pointers in the first quarter from nearly the same spot to pass Hall of Famer John Stockton, who had 845, and become the franchise leader in 3-point field goals made. The Jazz ran out to a 37-11 lead late in the period. “They’re playing together,” coach Quin Snyder said. “We obviously all realize the whole can be greater than the sum of the parts. Everybody wins when the guys are elevating one another.” Bogdanovic, who is shooting less than 37% beyond the arc after three straight seasons above 40, is finding his groove after offseason wrist surgery. He made a season-best seven 3-pointers on 11 attempts. “It makes us a lot better when he’s aggressive like that,” Conley said. Jordan Clarkson had 18 and Gobert added 17 points and 12 rebounds for his eighth consecutive double-double. Seldom-used Juwan Morgan had career highs of 12 points, seven rebounds and three steals. Morgan even made a pair of 3s as Utah’s long-range shooting comes from just about everyone but Gobert. The Jazz have made 319 3-pointers this season -- more than any team in NBA history through 19 games. The victory marked the fifth time Utah has made 20 3-pointers in a game. Weakened by multiple injuries and virus absences this season, the Mavs acknowledged a lack of chemistry after Wednesday’s loss to Utah but also said they just aren’t playing hard enough. Again, the Mavericks were a step slower to loose balls and rebounds through the game. “I thought we played harder. We just didn’t play well at the beginning. Look, the offensive rebounds they got -- that was a big, big problem. And that is attention to detail. That was not good,” Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. The Jazz held the Mavericks to 3-of-19 shooting and a season-low 12 points in the first quarter. In one stretch, the Jazz stole the ball on three straight Dallas possessions. By halftime, the Mavericks cut the lead to 61-45 on the strength of Doncic’s 17 first-half points. TIP-INS Mavericks: The Mavericks held a lead for 19 seconds in this game after not leading at all in Wednesday’s game. … Kristaps Porzingis picked up his fifth foul early in the third quarter. … Dallas was outrebounded 56-40. Jazz: Mitchell was announced as the recipient of the offseason NBA Cares Community Assist Award in recognition of his continued efforts to advance social justice and champion education. … Favors missed his second game with lower back soreness. … Gobert, who is barely making half his free throw attempts this season, made seven straight.","401267457"
