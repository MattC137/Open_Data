"CLEVELAND --  Gordon Hayward's face was etched in pain and shock. Of all the juicy subplots for this hyped homecoming and a season opener between heated rivals, a serious injury to Hayward wasn't on the list. Boston's season changed in a gruesome instant Tuesday night. Hayward, one of the new Celtics who was going to help them close the gap on Cleveland, broke his left ankle just five minutes into his debut, and Boston was beaten 102-99 on Tuesday night by LeBron James and the Cavaliers. Hayward's horrific injury overshadowed Kyrie Irving's return to Cleveland and re-directed Boston's immediate future and potential. After the 27-year-old was wheeled from Quicken Loans Arena on a stretcher , offering a thumbs-up on his way to the ambulance, the Celtics rallied but came up short. The outcome, though, hardly mattered. ""You hurt for him,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of Hayward, his former star at Butler. ""It's a tough, tough deal, but I guess that's part of the risk of injury. I really feel for him."" James scored 29 points -- 13 in the fourth quarter -- in his most extensive action in three weeks because of a sprained left ankle. The superstar also fed Kevin Love for a critical 3-pointer with 46.3 seconds left to put the Cavs up 102-98. Irving, who asked to be traded this summer after six seasons in Cleveland, had a chance to tie it with a 3-pointer at the horn but his shot was short. As the crowd exhaled, Irving shared a warm handshake and embrace with James, his teammate for three seasons and the one he wanted to get away from by demanding a trade this summer. Jaylen Brown scored 25 and Irving 22 and 10 assists for the Celtics, who overcame an 18-point deficit in the third and led with 2:04 left. Hayward, who signed a four-year, $128 million free agent contract with the Celtics this summer, was bumped by James while trying to catch an alley-oop pass with 6:45 left in the first quarter. The forward's leg got twisted underneath him as he came back to the floor and snapped his ankle grotesquely, his foot pointing awkwardly to one side. The 27-year-old sat up, looked at his foot and yelled while some players covered their mouths and others turned their heads. James said seeing Hayward get hurt reminded him of grisly injuries to Paul George, Shaun Livingston and Louisville's Kevin Ware. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to Gordon's family. Hope for a speedy recovery, a healthy recovery,"" James said. ""Those are the injuries that you never see coming, you never want to happen, no matter who it is, no matter what the stature, no matter how much competitive nature that you have. It's just very unfortunate."" Hayward's injury changed the tenor of the highly anticipated matchup, and will alter the direction of Boston's season. Hayward will require surgery and need months to recover. Stevens said Hayward will be taken directly to the hospital in Boston once the Celtics' plane lands The Celtics were understandably shaken at halftime, and went to the locker room down 16. However, they battled back and were still leading 98-97 when James, who only played in one exhibition after spraining his ankle on Sept. 27, spun in the lane and made a layup to put Cleveland up by one. On Boston's next possession, James cut off Marcus Smart and deflected the ball off the guard's leg and out of bounds. James then made a crosscourt pass to a wide-open Love, who drained his 3 to give the Cavs a four-point cushion. ""I just found a familiar face and Kevin was in the right place at the right time,"" James said. Irving's free throw made it 102-99, and the Celtics had two late chances but both Brown and Irving missed late 3s. Love had 15 and Derrick Rose 14 in his debut for the Cavs, who are trying to blend new faces and big egos quickly. ""We've got some things we need to figure out,"" James said. ""It's a work in progress, for sure."" After the final horn, James and Irving, who spent part of the summer making subtle jabs at each other following the blockbuster trade, completed their signature handshake and the All-Star point guard greeted several former teammates. He may still have a ways to go with Cleveland's crowd, which booed him every time he touched the ball. Irving heard it from the moment he took the floor as Cleveland fans got their first chance to voice their displeasure toward him for demanding to be traded this summer despite three consecutive trips to the NBA Finals and one title. ""It's a really hard game for a guy to play, especially the first game of the season with all the emotion you have to go through,"" Stevens said. ""How he can play at that level is beyond me."" PEP TALK At halftime, Stevens tried to calm his players. ""I don't have any magic words for that,"" he said. ""We're all feeling for him. I'm not going to try to take the human element out of it."" NEW GUYS In his Cleveland debut, Dwyane Wade scored eight points on 3 of 10 shooting in 28 minutes. Boston rookie Jayson Tatum had 14 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens has been impressed with Irving's basketball acumen and how quickly he has picked up Boston's system. ""He's spent a lot of time watching film, a lot of extra time talking about it. He has good insights,"" Stevens said. ""Guys like that can fit in anywhere. It's about how do we all put our strengths together."" ... Marcus Morris (sore right knee) took part in pregame drills but is out for a week or more. Cavaliers: James (28,816) passed numerous Hall of Famers while jumping to No. 7 on the career scoring list last season. He came in nearly 1,500 points behind Dirk Nowitzki at No. 6. ... Although it may take some time for the Cavs to find their on-court chemistry, coach Tyronn Lue said that doesn't change his early expectations. ""We still expect to win,"" he said. ""We still expect to play hard and play the right way.""","400974437"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Confetti began to fall and the Golden State Warriors thought they had pulled off a wild opening-night win. The Houston Rockets emphatically signaled otherwise -- insisting that Kevin Durant's baseline jumper had swished through the net after the buzzer. After one official got hurt, two remaining referees reviewed the play and ruled the Rockets had escaped with a 122-121 victory Tuesday on the night the Warriors received their championship rings. ""I thought it had a chance but I knew it was a little late. I knew I was cutting it close,"" Durant said. ""Tough loss. First game of 82, we've definitely got to move on. We've got to get better."" The Warriors got the ball for one final chance with 10.6 seconds left and Durant came up with the ball after Stephen Curry had missed. ""I didn't think it counted,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""When I saw it, it looked to me like it was a little late. Didn't surprise me it was overturned."" Trevor Ariza's 3-pointer with 2:09 remaining pulled Houston within 119-118 then Patrick McCaw hit a baseline jumper immediately after Golden State's timeout. James Harden made a layup and PJ Tucker hit two free throws with 44.1 to make it 122-121. Nick Young came off the bench to hit six 3-pointers and score 23 points in a brilliant Warriors debut, Curry scored 22 points and Durant had 20 after a slow start. Klay Thompson added 16 points. Chris Paul had four points on 2-for-9 shooting in his Rockets debut, while Harden scored 27 points, Eric Gordon 24 and Tucker 20 for the Rockets. Houston opened the fourth with a 9-0 run to get back in it. ""It's very encouraging to be able to beat a great team like that on a huge night for them,"" Anderson said. The Warriors found their rhythm early but couldn't close it out after an abbreviated preseason in terms of practice time given their recent trip to China for a pair of games against Minnesota. Draymond Green exited in the second half with a strained left knee after he contributed nine points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds. ""When we're lacking conditioning like we are right now you have to have your high-energy guys,"" Kerr said. ""It doesn't matter what it's because of, we just have to get in better shape."" Still, this opener was a far cry for the forgettable 129-100 defeat at home to San Antonio in Durant's Warriors debut a year ago when Golden State came off a record 73-win season and runner-up finish to Cleveland in the 2016 Finals. ""I just remember the last game of the season we played,"" Durant said of the Game 5 Finals clincher in June. Young found his stroke right away, hitting his first four 3s and five shots overall. It's exactly what the Warriors want him to do: shoot every time he has a good look. His six 3-pointers set a franchise record for anyone in their Warriors debut and also in a season opener. Durant had one spectacular sequence in the third when he blocked Anderson's shot on one end then converted a three-point play moments later on the other, slapping hands with a lucky boy fan on the baseline. Houston acquired Paul from the Clippers to give them a 1-2 backcourt punch to try to gain ground on Golden State in the Western Conference. ""They came out and threw their best punch and it took us a while to adjust,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""The last quarter we held them to 20. We're not going to do much better than that."" RING CEREMONY Kerr planned to pay extra attention as veterans Durant, Zaza Pachulia and David West each received a championship ring for the first time in their careers. ""Basketball accomplishments to me now are just what they are,"" Durant said after morning shootaround. ""I can kind of separate the two now. I feel like it's more so just cool as hell more than anything. It's like getting a prize possession that you're just really excited about versus getting something that's going to change your life. ... I'll be more so just really giddy and happy more so than emotional. I won't be a mess."" BEAT-UP DUBS Key backup and 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala missed the game with a back strain, while Omri Casspi -- who had been questionable with a mild right ankle sprain -- appeared in his 500th career game making his debut with the Warriors. He then tweaked the ankle again. Iguodala is expected to return for the upcoming road trip. INJURED OFFICIAL Referee Tre Maddox, accompanied by medical personnel, left midway through the fourth quarter after a collision with David West and hard hit. The NBA said after the game Maddox sustained an abdominal wall strain. TIP-INS Rockets: Tucker earned a flagrant 1 foul for his hard hit on Durant in the second. ... D'Antoni joked ""We're going to go to the In-N-Out burger"" during the pregame festivities, opting to keep his team in the locker room. ""They deserve it,"" he said. ""They won it, we didn't."" ... The Rockets hit 22 3-pointers in three preseason games and didn't allow more than 106 points, holding opponents to 93.8. ... Houston also opened the season vs. the Warriors in 2009 and `10. ... Warriors: The Warriors are auctioning signed shooting shirts worn for the pregame festivities to benefit fire relief efforts in the North Bay. ... Thompson has hit a 3 in 55 straight games, second-longest active streak.","400974438"
"WASHINGTON --  Bradley Beal threw the best lob of his life to John Wall, and the Washington star finished the alley-oop that the longtime teammates are accustomed to making. The experienced Wizards made the plays to beat the young Philadelphia 76ers 120-115 on Wednesday night in the season opener for each team. The NBA debuts of Sixers top picks Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz took a back seat to Wall and Beal getting the job done despite not having their best shooting performances. Wall scored 28 points on 10-of-28 shooting and had eight assists, and his 15-second stretch in the fourth quarter with a layup, block and pass to Marcin Gortat for a dunk showed what he could do in crucial moments. ""When John was making some of those dunks, I was telling our coaches, `I cannot believe he just did that,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""Those are things that point guards don't do, and he just does it so easy."" This wasn't an easy victory for the Wizards, who survived in the final minute when Philadelphia turned the ball over twice and J.J. Redick missed a 3-pointer. And although Brooks and his players were happy to win, the Sixers earned plenty of respect from a team that was one victory away from the Eastern Conference final. ""No matter if they're a young team or not, those are games you kind of want to take away from them and don't give them any confidence, but they gave us a great test,"" Wall said. Sixers forward Robert Covington had 29 points. Simmons, the 2016 No. 1 pick who missed all last season with a foot injury, had 18 points and 10 rebounds. Fultz, the 2017 No. 1 pick, came off the bench to score 10 points. Sixers coach Brett Brown called Simmons' first regular-seasn game ""really, really exceptional"" and was impressed with how Fultz played after shoulder and knee injuries limited him in the preseason. Losing close to the Wizards was a welcome to the NBA moment for the rookies. ""To make that effort against this team -- probably one of the top three teams in the conference -- it's tough,"" said Fultz, who is from nearby Upper Marlboro, Maryland. ""I thought we did well in our first game, and we have to learn from it."" TIP-INS 76ers: Jerryd Bayless started in place of Fultz and had 13 points. ... Fans chanted ""Trust the Process"" several times during the game, drawing the ire of the home crowd. Wizards: Beal finished with 25 points. ... Jason Smith, starting at power forward with Markieff Morris out roughly the first month after sports hernia surgery, played just 7:04 before leaving with a sprained right shoulder. Brooks expects to know more Thursday. ... Kelly Oubre Jr. had 14 points in replacing Smith. ... Opened at home for the first time since 2011 and for the first time in an 82-game season since 2008. WHAT MINUTES RESTRICTION? So much for the idea that Sixers center Joel Embiid was on a strict minutes restriction. After Brown said Embiid would play somewhere in the 15 to 20-minute range, his final total was 26:57 with 18 points and 13 rebounds. Embiid was surprised he played that much. ""We got to stop calling that `minute restrictions,"" Embiid said. ""I think the plan is to just get out there, play, see how I feel. There's going to be some games I'm going to be sore and I'm going to be tired."" GORTAT'S DEDICATION Gortat, who scored 10 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed 17 rebounds, wore ""AW"" on his shoes to honor late Polish basketball player Alex Wojcik, who died of leukemia at age 47 over the summer. RED-HOT COVINGTON Taking advantage of some matchup problems presented by injuries and smaller lineups, Covington shot 7 of 11 from 3 to finish one point off his career high. ""My teammates found me in the open position and I was able to knock them down,"" Covington said.","400974439"
"SAN ANTONIO --  LaMarcus Aldridge was unhappy with the Spurs the past two seasons and Gregg Popovich understood why. Their heart-to-heart talk has made basketball life much easier for Aldridge, and his comfort was apparent in the season opener. Aldridge had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and San Antonio held on for a 107-99 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night while playing without leading scorer Kawhi Leonard. ""He just didn't feel comfortable and it's 98.75 percent on me,"" Popovich said of Aldridge's struggles. ""I tried to change him, I tried to make him a different player and I think that really affected his ability to feel comfortable and confident on the court. And we took care of that, basically by me letting him know that we're going to do it differently."" San Antonio needs Aldridge to feel at ease with the team missing Leonard and Tony Parker to injuries. Even without them, the Spurs had enough to hold off the revamped Timberwolves. Minnesota bolstered its young lineup with the addition of veterans Jimmy Butler, Jamal Crawford, Taj Gibson and Jeff Teague. The quartet helped the Wolves rally from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to take a 92-91 lead with 5:02 remaining on an 18-foot jumper by Butler. Butler, acquired in offseason trade with Chicago, knew the lead was precarious at best. ""Because we were just outscoring them at the time,"" Butler said. ""Yeah, we got some stops, but we've got to rely on defense a lot more."" San Antonio responded defensively, holding Minnesota to two field goals after Butler's basket. Butler finished with 12 points and Crawford had 10. Andrew Wiggins led Minnesota with 26 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 18. Aldridge had one of his most complete games with the Spurs, two days after signing a three-year, $72 million extension. He shot 9 for 21 from the field and had four assists. He was limited to five attempts in the first quarter as the Spurs did not go out of their way to get the ball to their 6-foot-11 forward, but instead let him ease into the contest. ""I'm just going to play and whatever happens, happens,"" Aldridge said. ""I'm more comfortable for sure. Playing more confident. Hopefully that translates to us being better out there."" Aldridge's running dunk on a bounce pass from Manu Ginobili gave the Spurs a 100-92 lead with 1:42 remaining. ""They deserved a lot of credit for executing down the stretch against a very talented, well-coached team,"" Popovich said. Ginobili finished nine points and four assists, including a 3-pointer within a minute of entering the game midway through the first quarter. Ginobili received a huge ovation similar to the one he got in the team's final game last season when fans were not sure if he would return. Danny Green added 17 points while shooting 3 for 7 on 3-pointers. Green had two 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, both off assists from new teammate Rudy Gay. Gay, who signed with the Spurs after four seasons in Sacramento, had 14 points and five rebounds. Dejounte Murray had 16 points, five rebounds and two assists while starting in place of Parker. TIP-INS Wolves: Minnesota's last victory over San Antonio came April 8, 2014, in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves have lost 12 straight to the Spurs and eight straight in San Antonio. ... After being one of the league's youngest teams the past few seasons, Minnesota has only one rookie on its roster this season, 7-foot center Justin Patton. Patton missed the season opener while recovering from surgery on his left foot. Spurs: Popovich said there is no timetable for Leonard's return from right quadriceps tendinopathy. ... Parker plans on returning in mid-November from a left quadriceps tendon surgery. ... San Antonio swept all four games against Minnesota last season, winning by an average of 9.0 points. WELCOME BACK Gay, who had not played since tearing his Achilles tendon in January, was glad to be back on the court. ""Man, it felt good,"" Gay said. ""I kind of got emotional in the game just because I've been through so much these last couple of months. I've been getting so many text messages that motivate me to keep going. It just reminds me of what I've been through these last couple of months."" Gay's opening basket was an emphatic dunk with a minute remaining in the first quarter. MURRAY MOVING ALONG Murray, in his second year out of Washington, had two assists and two turnovers while shooting 7 for 8 from the field in 25 minutes. ""He's playing with much better composure, much more control of the game and directing the team,"" Spurs center Pau Gasol said. ""But he's also taking advantage of his athleticism and opportunities."" NO EXCUSES Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau refused to blame a brief preseason schedule for his team's troubles in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves played three preseason games while trying to incorporate a roster that is almost half-filled with new players. ""There is going to be an excuse every night if that's the road you go down,"" Thibodeau said. ""But that's not what we want to do. We have to look at film, try to learn from it and be better the next time.""","400974440"
"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Much has changed about the Thunder. One thing hasn't -- Russell Westbrook still gets triple-doubles. The reigning MVP had 21 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds, and Oklahoma City beat the New York Knicks 105-84 on Thursday night in their first regular-season game with All-Star additions Paul George and Carmelo Anthony. Anthony liked watching Westbrook's dynamic play from a new perspective. ""You guys are used to it,"" Anthony said. ""I'm used to watching it. I'm used to going up against it. Now, to be on the other side of that on the same team as him, and to reap those benefits of what he can bring to the game -- I'm excited about what we started out tonight, what we created tonight and where we're headed."" George, who was acquired in an offseason trade with the Indiana Pacers, led the Thunder with 28 points. He said he wasn't used to getting so many open looks, but Westbrook took pressure off of him. ""It's great,"" George said. ""The game comes so easy. I know I'm going to get those easy opportunities like I did tonight. It's only going to make me better."" Anthony, who was traded from the Knicks to the Thunder right before training camp began, had 22 points against his former team. ""That chapter's closed,"" Anthony said. ""No more Knicks talk. Just focus in on the Thunder moving forward and what we have to do."" Kristaps Porzingis had 31 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks. Enes Kanter, who joined the Knicks in the deal that sent Anthony to the Thunder, finished with 10 points and seven rebounds. No other New York players scored in double figures. Anthony was impressed with Porzingis' performance and willingness to take charge. ""Just to see that he's ready to take on that role -- he looked aggressive tonight,"" Anthony said. ""He looked comfortable, felt comfortable tonight. I was happy to see that."" George broke away for a dunk as time expired in the first half to give the Thunder a 53-42 lead. Porzingis scored 19 points before the break to keep the Knicks in it. Kanter made three buckets early in the third quarter to keep the Knicks in it, but Westbrook found Steven Adams and Andre Roberson for back-to-back alley-oop dunks to give the Thunder a 69-52 lead. After that, it was time for the Westbrook triple-double watch. He reached double digits in assists midway through the third quarter, then grabbed his 10th rebound with about four minutes remaining in the game. --- TIP-INS Knicks: Kanter and F Doug McDermott, the other player the Thunder sent to the Knicks in the Anthony deal, both got a standing ovation during pregame warmups. ... McDermott scored four points on 2-for-5 shooting. ... The Knicks shot 55.6 percent in the first quarter and still trailed 27-24, in part, because of 11 turnovers. They finished with 26 turnovers. Thunder: The game marked the start of the 10th season for the Thunder in Oklahoma City. ... Thunder C Dakari Johnson scored four points in his NBA debut. He was a G League All-Star last season. ... F Jerami Grant's fadeaway at the third-quarter buzzer gave Oklahoma City a 79-59 lead. `STACHE BROTHERS Kanter and Adams are best friends who were known as the `Stache Brothers when they played together with the Thunder. ""It felt weird because he knows my moves and everything,"" Kanter said. ""It definitely was good to see him and come back and play against those guys."" DEFENSE STEPS UP The Thunder allowed the Knicks to shoot 55.6 percent in the first quarter, then held them to 36 percent shooting the rest of the game. It allowed the Thunder to get away with shooting poorly early. ""I thought in the first half we had really good looks,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""We didn't shoot the ball well. The thing with us was our defense. I was really pleased with that."" STAT LINES Adams had a strong all-around game. He scored 12 points on 5-for-5 shooting, and grabbed five rebounds. He had five steals -- one short of his career high -- and added three blocks.","400974441"
"LOS ANGELES -- Patrick Beverley crowded chest-to-chest with Lonzo Ball before an inbounds pass in the first quarter while they were 94 feet from the basket. Moments later at midcourt, Beverley emphatically fouled the Lakers' rookie point guard and watched him fall. Ball still might turn out to be Los Angeles' basketball star of the future, even after his awfully quiet NBA debut. The present in this town still belongs to the Clippers, even without Chris Paul. Blake Griffin scored 29 points and DeAndre Jordan added 14 points and 24 rebounds in the Clippers' 108-92 rout of the Lakers on Thursday night. Lou Williams added 12 points in the Clippers' first game since Paul spurned the perennial playoff team after six years and forced an offseason trade to Houston. The Clippers will have a new look this season after adding Beverley's tenacity and several new scorers, but they were still miles ahead of their Staples Center co-tenants in both teams' season openers. Beverley and the Clippers got little trouble from Ball, who had three points, four assists and nine rebounds in 29 minutes during the first game for the No. 2 overall pick from UCLA. He had about 40 friends and family members in the stands, including his voluble father, LaVar. ""We got blown out, so I didn't play too well,"" Ball said. ""It was great to start out, but all I care about is winning, and we lost today. We've got to regroup."" Ball is expected to revitalize his hometown team this season, but the rookie started out with all the nerves and mistakes that might be expected from any 19-year-old with the weight of a 16-time NBA champion franchise on his slender shoulders. Beverley, who joined the Clippers in Paul's trade to the Rockets, had 10 points while introducing Ball to high-level NBA defense. ""I just had to set the tone,"" Beverley said. ""I told him after the game, due to all the riff-raff his dad brings, he's going to get a lot of people coming at him. He has to be ready for that, and I let him know after the game. But what a better way to start him off. I was 94 feet guarding him tonight. Welcome his little young ass to the NBA."" Along with a handful of good-looking passes and a 3-pointer late in the first half, Ball went 1 for 6 from the field and committed two turnovers. ""He's going to be a great talent, but he has to go through the tough times,"" Beverley said. ""He'll appreciate this when he looks back on it."" Brook Lopez scored 20 points in his debut for the Lakers, and Jordan Clarkson added 18. ""I wasn't happy with what we gave our fans tonight,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""Obviously I heard the (boos), and we deserved it at those times."" TIP-INS Clippers: Danilo Gallinari had 11 points in his LA debut. ... Coach Doc Rivers answered back at Paul, who said he didn't like the Clippers' team culture in a documentary that will be released this week by ESPN. ""Listen, when you leave, you should just leave,"" Rivers said. ""I don't think you have to try to burn the house down or justify why you left. That's what I would say to it. I like our culture. Lakers: New G Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed this game while beginning a two-game suspension for getting arrested in March and later pleading guilty to operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. ... Kyle Kuzma, the Lakers' other first-round pick, had eight points in his NBA debut. ... Andrew Bogut, the former Golden State center, had three fouls and three turnovers in his Lakers debut. NEW BACKCOURT Even with several new contributors, the Clippers already resemble a hard-nosed, tough-minded veteran team led by Beverley. Milos Teodosic, the other starting guard in Rivers' revamped lineup, hit two 3-pointers in the 30-year-old Serbian rookie's NBA debut. MAGIC BALL It was a busy night for Lakers executive Magic Johnson, also a co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Magic watched from the tunnel while Staples Center showed Game 5 of the NL Championship Series on the scoreboard during pregame warmups, and he celebrated behind the scenes when the Dodgers clinched their first World Series berth since 1988 during the first half. ""I'm just happy for all the players and all the Dodger fans across the world,"" Johnson said. ""This is a moment that I'll never forget. I was torn, because I wanted to be here for Lonzo Ball's first game as a Laker, but my heart is in Chicago. ... I'm so happy with Clayton Kershaw, that he can finally pitch in the World Series. He deserves this moment, and all our players deserve this moment, too."" Staples Center erupted in cheers when the Dodgers recorded the final out in Chicago, and again when the final out appeared on the video board.","400974442"
"MVP contender Giannis Antetokounmpo took it to LeBron James and the Cavs Friday, but is wasn't enough as the Bucks fell 116-97. (0:56) MILWAUKEE --  LeBron James and Kevin Love took care of the paint. Once Kyle Korver got going from 3-point range, the Cleveland Cavaliers became nearly unstoppable. James had 24 points and eight assists, Korver hit three straight 3s during a decisive third-quarter run and the Cavaliers beat the Bucks 116-97 on Friday night to spoil Milwaukee's home opener Love added 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavs. Their 15-5 spurt over the final 4:25 of the third quarter, sparked by Korver's long-range shooting, opened a 13-point lead. They led by double digits most of the rest the way. ""Kyle, he came out and he really gave us a spark shooting the basketball,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""With his movement and him running around, he kind of throws defenses off."" And the Cavs handed Milwaukee its first loss of the season. The defending Eastern Conference champions opened with a second straight victory over an East contender after beating Boston in their home opener. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo had 34 points on 15-of-22 shooting, along with eight rebounds and eight assists. Malcolm Brogdon was the only other Buck in double digits with 16 points. Antetokounmpo, as usual, wheeled his 6-foot-11 frame into the lane for an array of athletic buckets. But the Cavs limited nearly everyone else after doing a better job of closing out on 3-point shooters. ""We executed the defensive plan that our coaches gave us. The results were us getting a big win on the road,"" James said. The Cavs were 2 of 10 from 3-point range in the first half, but powered their way to a 55-49 halftime lead by attacking the basket. They were nearly unstoppable once they found their shot from long range. ""Against good teams, you have to give up something, and the 2s weren't what hurt us. The 3s did,"" coach Jason Kidd said. At one point, James hesitated for a couple seconds after being left alone at the top of the 3-point arc. Antetokounmpo then took a couple steps out from near the bucket before James hit the open look for a 101-86 lead with 6:19 left. ""It's a lot tougher, we gave them a lot of open looks,"" Antetokounmpo said about defending the Cavs once they start hitting from 3. ""You're chasing guys to the 3-point line and the paint gets wide open so you get easy layups and it's hard to defend, it's harder to rebound."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Six Cavs scored in double figures. ... After hitting at least 10 3s in all four meetings last season with Milwaukee, the Cavaliers finished 11 of 26 from behind the arc. They were 9 of 16 in the second half. ...  Cleveland missed its first eight 3-pointers before Korver hit two in a row in late in the second quarter. ... Love had an active first half with 13 points and six rebounds. Bucks: Brogdon and Tony Snell (nine points) combined to start 3 of 5 from 3-point range in the first quarter, converting on open looks after defenders converged on driving teammates in the lane. The Bucks cooled off and went 3 of 16 the rest of the first half from behind the arc. ... The team signed F Joel Bolomboy to a two-way contract. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 1.8 points and 1.4 rebounds as a rookie last season for Utah. FIGURING IT OUT Lue is still figuring out the rotation with three new starters. Korver was one of the biggest beneficiaries after not taking a shot in 7 minutes in the opener against Boston. Korver finished with 17 points and was 5 of 6 from 3-point territory.
