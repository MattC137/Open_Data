"CLEVELAND --  Gordon Hayward's face was etched in pain and shock. Of all the juicy subplots for this hyped homecoming and a season opener between heated rivals, a serious injury to Hayward wasn't on the list. Boston's season changed in a gruesome instant Tuesday night. Hayward, one of the new Celtics who was going to help them close the gap on Cleveland, broke his left ankle just five minutes into his debut, and Boston was beaten 102-99 on Tuesday night by LeBron James and the Cavaliers. Hayward's horrific injury overshadowed Kyrie Irving's return to Cleveland and re-directed Boston's immediate future and potential. After the 27-year-old was wheeled from Quicken Loans Arena on a stretcher , offering a thumbs-up on his way to the ambulance, the Celtics rallied but came up short. The outcome, though, hardly mattered. ""You hurt for him,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of Hayward, his former star at Butler. ""It's a tough, tough deal, but I guess that's part of the risk of injury. I really feel for him."" James scored 29 points -- 13 in the fourth quarter -- in his most extensive action in three weeks because of a sprained left ankle. The superstar also fed Kevin Love for a critical 3-pointer with 46.3 seconds left to put the Cavs up 102-98. Irving, who asked to be traded this summer after six seasons in Cleveland, had a chance to tie it with a 3-pointer at the horn but his shot was short. As the crowd exhaled, Irving shared a warm handshake and embrace with James, his teammate for three seasons and the one he wanted to get away from by demanding a trade this summer. Jaylen Brown scored 25 and Irving 22 and 10 assists for the Celtics, who overcame an 18-point deficit in the third and led with 2:04 left. Hayward, who signed a four-year, $128 million free agent contract with the Celtics this summer, was bumped by James while trying to catch an alley-oop pass with 6:45 left in the first quarter. The forward's leg got twisted underneath him as he came back to the floor and snapped his ankle grotesquely, his foot pointing awkwardly to one side. The 27-year-old sat up, looked at his foot and yelled while some players covered their mouths and others turned their heads. James said seeing Hayward get hurt reminded him of grisly injuries to Paul George, Shaun Livingston and Louisville's Kevin Ware. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to Gordon's family. Hope for a speedy recovery, a healthy recovery,"" James said. ""Those are the injuries that you never see coming, you never want to happen, no matter who it is, no matter what the stature, no matter how much competitive nature that you have. It's just very unfortunate."" Hayward's injury changed the tenor of the highly anticipated matchup, and will alter the direction of Boston's season. Hayward will require surgery and need months to recover. Stevens said Hayward will be taken directly to the hospital in Boston once the Celtics' plane lands The Celtics were understandably shaken at halftime, and went to the locker room down 16. However, they battled back and were still leading 98-97 when James, who only played in one exhibition after spraining his ankle on Sept. 27, spun in the lane and made a layup to put Cleveland up by one. On Boston's next possession, James cut off Marcus Smart and deflected the ball off the guard's leg and out of bounds. James then made a crosscourt pass to a wide-open Love, who drained his 3 to give the Cavs a four-point cushion. ""I just found a familiar face and Kevin was in the right place at the right time,"" James said. Irving's free throw made it 102-99, and the Celtics had two late chances but both Brown and Irving missed late 3s. Love had 15 and Derrick Rose 14 in his debut for the Cavs, who are trying to blend new faces and big egos quickly. ""We've got some things we need to figure out,"" James said. ""It's a work in progress, for sure."" After the final horn, James and Irving, who spent part of the summer making subtle jabs at each other following the blockbuster trade, completed their signature handshake and the All-Star point guard greeted several former teammates. He may still have a ways to go with Cleveland's crowd, which booed him every time he touched the ball. Irving heard it from the moment he took the floor as Cleveland fans got their first chance to voice their displeasure toward him for demanding to be traded this summer despite three consecutive trips to the NBA Finals and one title. ""It's a really hard game for a guy to play, especially the first game of the season with all the emotion you have to go through,"" Stevens said. ""How he can play at that level is beyond me."" PEP TALK At halftime, Stevens tried to calm his players. ""I don't have any magic words for that,"" he said. ""We're all feeling for him. I'm not going to try to take the human element out of it."" NEW GUYS In his Cleveland debut, Dwyane Wade scored eight points on 3 of 10 shooting in 28 minutes. Boston rookie Jayson Tatum had 14 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Celtics: Stevens has been impressed with Irving's basketball acumen and how quickly he has picked up Boston's system. ""He's spent a lot of time watching film, a lot of extra time talking about it. He has good insights,"" Stevens said. ""Guys like that can fit in anywhere. It's about how do we all put our strengths together."" ... Marcus Morris (sore right knee) took part in pregame drills but is out for a week or more. Cavaliers: James (28,816) passed numerous Hall of Famers while jumping to No. 7 on the career scoring list last season. He came in nearly 1,500 points behind Dirk Nowitzki at No. 6. ... Although it may take some time for the Cavs to find their on-court chemistry, coach Tyronn Lue said that doesn't change his early expectations. ""We still expect to win,"" he said. ""We still expect to play hard and play the right way.""","400974437"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Confetti began to fall and the Golden State Warriors thought they had pulled off a wild opening-night win. The Houston Rockets emphatically signaled otherwise -- insisting that Kevin Durant's baseline jumper had swished through the net after the buzzer. After one official got hurt, two remaining referees reviewed the play and ruled the Rockets had escaped with a 122-121 victory Tuesday on the night the Warriors received their championship rings. ""I thought it had a chance but I knew it was a little late. I knew I was cutting it close,"" Durant said. ""Tough loss. First game of 82, we've definitely got to move on. We've got to get better."" The Warriors got the ball for one final chance with 10.6 seconds left and Durant came up with the ball after Stephen Curry had missed. ""I didn't think it counted,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""When I saw it, it looked to me like it was a little late. Didn't surprise me it was overturned."" Trevor Ariza's 3-pointer with 2:09 remaining pulled Houston within 119-118 then Patrick McCaw hit a baseline jumper immediately after Golden State's timeout. James Harden made a layup and PJ Tucker hit two free throws with 44.1 to make it 122-121. Nick Young came off the bench to hit six 3-pointers and score 23 points in a brilliant Warriors debut, Curry scored 22 points and Durant had 20 after a slow start. Klay Thompson added 16 points. Chris Paul had four points on 2-for-9 shooting in his Rockets debut, while Harden scored 27 points, Eric Gordon 24 and Tucker 20 for the Rockets. Houston opened the fourth with a 9-0 run to get back in it. ""It's very encouraging to be able to beat a great team like that on a huge night for them,"" Anderson said. The Warriors found their rhythm early but couldn't close it out after an abbreviated preseason in terms of practice time given their recent trip to China for a pair of games against Minnesota. Draymond Green exited in the second half with a strained left knee after he contributed nine points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds. ""When we're lacking conditioning like we are right now you have to have your high-energy guys,"" Kerr said. ""It doesn't matter what it's because of, we just have to get in better shape."" Still, this opener was a far cry for the forgettable 129-100 defeat at home to San Antonio in Durant's Warriors debut a year ago when Golden State came off a record 73-win season and runner-up finish to Cleveland in the 2016 Finals. ""I just remember the last game of the season we played,"" Durant said of the Game 5 Finals clincher in June. Young found his stroke right away, hitting his first four 3s and five shots overall. It's exactly what the Warriors want him to do: shoot every time he has a good look. His six 3-pointers set a franchise record for anyone in their Warriors debut and also in a season opener. Durant had one spectacular sequence in the third when he blocked Anderson's shot on one end then converted a three-point play moments later on the other, slapping hands with a lucky boy fan on the baseline. Houston acquired Paul from the Clippers to give them a 1-2 backcourt punch to try to gain ground on Golden State in the Western Conference. ""They came out and threw their best punch and it took us a while to adjust,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""The last quarter we held them to 20. We're not going to do much better than that."" RING CEREMONY Kerr planned to pay extra attention as veterans Durant, Zaza Pachulia and David West each received a championship ring for the first time in their careers. ""Basketball accomplishments to me now are just what they are,"" Durant said after morning shootaround. ""I can kind of separate the two now. I feel like it's more so just cool as hell more than anything. It's like getting a prize possession that you're just really excited about versus getting something that's going to change your life. ... I'll be more so just really giddy and happy more so than emotional. I won't be a mess."" BEAT-UP DUBS Key backup and 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala missed the game with a back strain, while Omri Casspi -- who had been questionable with a mild right ankle sprain -- appeared in his 500th career game making his debut with the Warriors. He then tweaked the ankle again. Iguodala is expected to return for the upcoming road trip. INJURED OFFICIAL Referee Tre Maddox, accompanied by medical personnel, left midway through the fourth quarter after a collision with David West and hard hit. The NBA said after the game Maddox sustained an abdominal wall strain. TIP-INS Rockets: Tucker earned a flagrant 1 foul for his hard hit on Durant in the second. ... D'Antoni joked ""We're going to go to the In-N-Out burger"" during the pregame festivities, opting to keep his team in the locker room. ""They deserve it,"" he said. ""They won it, we didn't."" ... The Rockets hit 22 3-pointers in three preseason games and didn't allow more than 106 points, holding opponents to 93.8. ... Houston also opened the season vs. the Warriors in 2009 and `10. ... Warriors: The Warriors are auctioning signed shooting shirts worn for the pregame festivities to benefit fire relief efforts in the North Bay. ... Thompson has hit a 3 in 55 straight games, second-longest active streak.","400974438"
"WASHINGTON --  Bradley Beal threw the best lob of his life to John Wall, and the Washington star finished the alley-oop that the longtime teammates are accustomed to making. The experienced Wizards made the plays to beat the young Philadelphia 76ers 120-115 on Wednesday night in the season opener for each team. The NBA debuts of Sixers top picks Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz took a back seat to Wall and Beal getting the job done despite not having their best shooting performances. Wall scored 28 points on 10-of-28 shooting and had eight assists, and his 15-second stretch in the fourth quarter with a layup, block and pass to Marcin Gortat for a dunk showed what he could do in crucial moments. ""When John was making some of those dunks, I was telling our coaches, `I cannot believe he just did that,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""Those are things that point guards don't do, and he just does it so easy."" This wasn't an easy victory for the Wizards, who survived in the final minute when Philadelphia turned the ball over twice and J.J. Redick missed a 3-pointer. And although Brooks and his players were happy to win, the Sixers earned plenty of respect from a team that was one victory away from the Eastern Conference final. ""No matter if they're a young team or not, those are games you kind of want to take away from them and don't give them any confidence, but they gave us a great test,"" Wall said. Sixers forward Robert Covington had 29 points. Simmons, the 2016 No. 1 pick who missed all last season with a foot injury, had 18 points and 10 rebounds. Fultz, the 2017 No. 1 pick, came off the bench to score 10 points. Sixers coach Brett Brown called Simmons' first regular-seasn game ""really, really exceptional"" and was impressed with how Fultz played after shoulder and knee injuries limited him in the preseason. Losing close to the Wizards was a welcome to the NBA moment for the rookies. ""To make that effort against this team -- probably one of the top three teams in the conference -- it's tough,"" said Fultz, who is from nearby Upper Marlboro, Maryland. ""I thought we did well in our first game, and we have to learn from it."" TIP-INS 76ers: Jerryd Bayless started in place of Fultz and had 13 points. ... Fans chanted ""Trust the Process"" several times during the game, drawing the ire of the home crowd. Wizards: Beal finished with 25 points. ... Jason Smith, starting at power forward with Markieff Morris out roughly the first month after sports hernia surgery, played just 7:04 before leaving with a sprained right shoulder. Brooks expects to know more Thursday. ... Kelly Oubre Jr. had 14 points in replacing Smith. ... Opened at home for the first time since 2011 and for the first time in an 82-game season since 2008. WHAT MINUTES RESTRICTION? So much for the idea that Sixers center Joel Embiid was on a strict minutes restriction. After Brown said Embiid would play somewhere in the 15 to 20-minute range, his final total was 26:57 with 18 points and 13 rebounds. Embiid was surprised he played that much. ""We got to stop calling that `minute restrictions,"" Embiid said. ""I think the plan is to just get out there, play, see how I feel. There's going to be some games I'm going to be sore and I'm going to be tired."" GORTAT'S DEDICATION Gortat, who scored 10 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed 17 rebounds, wore ""AW"" on his shoes to honor late Polish basketball player Alex Wojcik, who died of leukemia at age 47 over the summer. RED-HOT COVINGTON Taking advantage of some matchup problems presented by injuries and smaller lineups, Covington shot 7 of 11 from 3 to finish one point off his career high. ""My teammates found me in the open position and I was able to knock them down,"" Covington said.","400974439"
"SAN ANTONIO --  LaMarcus Aldridge was unhappy with the Spurs the past two seasons and Gregg Popovich understood why. Their heart-to-heart talk has made basketball life much easier for Aldridge, and his comfort was apparent in the season opener. Aldridge had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and San Antonio held on for a 107-99 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night while playing without leading scorer Kawhi Leonard. ""He just didn't feel comfortable and it's 98.75 percent on me,"" Popovich said of Aldridge's struggles. ""I tried to change him, I tried to make him a different player and I think that really affected his ability to feel comfortable and confident on the court. And we took care of that, basically by me letting him know that we're going to do it differently."" San Antonio needs Aldridge to feel at ease with the team missing Leonard and Tony Parker to injuries. Even without them, the Spurs had enough to hold off the revamped Timberwolves. Minnesota bolstered its young lineup with the addition of veterans Jimmy Butler, Jamal Crawford, Taj Gibson and Jeff Teague. The quartet helped the Wolves rally from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to take a 92-91 lead with 5:02 remaining on an 18-foot jumper by Butler. Butler, acquired in offseason trade with Chicago, knew the lead was precarious at best. ""Because we were just outscoring them at the time,"" Butler said. ""Yeah, we got some stops, but we've got to rely on defense a lot more."" San Antonio responded defensively, holding Minnesota to two field goals after Butler's basket. Butler finished with 12 points and Crawford had 10. Andrew Wiggins led Minnesota with 26 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 18. Aldridge had one of his most complete games with the Spurs, two days after signing a three-year, $72 million extension. He shot 9 for 21 from the field and had four assists. He was limited to five attempts in the first quarter as the Spurs did not go out of their way to get the ball to their 6-foot-11 forward, but instead let him ease into the contest. ""I'm just going to play and whatever happens, happens,"" Aldridge said. ""I'm more comfortable for sure. Playing more confident. Hopefully that translates to us being better out there."" Aldridge's running dunk on a bounce pass from Manu Ginobili gave the Spurs a 100-92 lead with 1:42 remaining. ""They deserved a lot of credit for executing down the stretch against a very talented, well-coached team,"" Popovich said. Ginobili finished nine points and four assists, including a 3-pointer within a minute of entering the game midway through the first quarter. Ginobili received a huge ovation similar to the one he got in the team's final game last season when fans were not sure if he would return. Danny Green added 17 points while shooting 3 for 7 on 3-pointers. Green had two 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, both off assists from new teammate Rudy Gay. Gay, who signed with the Spurs after four seasons in Sacramento, had 14 points and five rebounds. Dejounte Murray had 16 points, five rebounds and two assists while starting in place of Parker. TIP-INS Wolves: Minnesota's last victory over San Antonio came April 8, 2014, in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves have lost 12 straight to the Spurs and eight straight in San Antonio. ... After being one of the league's youngest teams the past few seasons, Minnesota has only one rookie on its roster this season, 7-foot center Justin Patton. Patton missed the season opener while recovering from surgery on his left foot. Spurs: Popovich said there is no timetable for Leonard's return from right quadriceps tendinopathy. ... Parker plans on returning in mid-November from a left quadriceps tendon surgery. ... San Antonio swept all four games against Minnesota last season, winning by an average of 9.0 points. WELCOME BACK Gay, who had not played since tearing his Achilles tendon in January, was glad to be back on the court. ""Man, it felt good,"" Gay said. ""I kind of got emotional in the game just because I've been through so much these last couple of months. I've been getting so many text messages that motivate me to keep going. It just reminds me of what I've been through these last couple of months."" Gay's opening basket was an emphatic dunk with a minute remaining in the first quarter. MURRAY MOVING ALONG Murray, in his second year out of Washington, had two assists and two turnovers while shooting 7 for 8 from the field in 25 minutes. ""He's playing with much better composure, much more control of the game and directing the team,"" Spurs center Pau Gasol said. ""But he's also taking advantage of his athleticism and opportunities."" NO EXCUSES Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau refused to blame a brief preseason schedule for his team's troubles in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves played three preseason games while trying to incorporate a roster that is almost half-filled with new players. ""There is going to be an excuse every night if that's the road you go down,"" Thibodeau said. ""But that's not what we want to do. We have to look at film, try to learn from it and be better the next time.""","400974440"
"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Much has changed about the Thunder. One thing hasn't -- Russell Westbrook still gets triple-doubles. The reigning MVP had 21 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds, and Oklahoma City beat the New York Knicks 105-84 on Thursday night in their first regular-season game with All-Star additions Paul George and Carmelo Anthony. Anthony liked watching Westbrook's dynamic play from a new perspective. ""You guys are used to it,"" Anthony said. ""I'm used to watching it. I'm used to going up against it. Now, to be on the other side of that on the same team as him, and to reap those benefits of what he can bring to the game -- I'm excited about what we started out tonight, what we created tonight and where we're headed."" George, who was acquired in an offseason trade with the Indiana Pacers, led the Thunder with 28 points. He said he wasn't used to getting so many open looks, but Westbrook took pressure off of him. ""It's great,"" George said. ""The game comes so easy. I know I'm going to get those easy opportunities like I did tonight. It's only going to make me better."" Anthony, who was traded from the Knicks to the Thunder right before training camp began, had 22 points against his former team. ""That chapter's closed,"" Anthony said. ""No more Knicks talk. Just focus in on the Thunder moving forward and what we have to do."" Kristaps Porzingis had 31 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks. Enes Kanter, who joined the Knicks in the deal that sent Anthony to the Thunder, finished with 10 points and seven rebounds. No other New York players scored in double figures. Anthony was impressed with Porzingis' performance and willingness to take charge. ""Just to see that he's ready to take on that role -- he looked aggressive tonight,"" Anthony said. ""He looked comfortable, felt comfortable tonight. I was happy to see that."" George broke away for a dunk as time expired in the first half to give the Thunder a 53-42 lead. Porzingis scored 19 points before the break to keep the Knicks in it. Kanter made three buckets early in the third quarter to keep the Knicks in it, but Westbrook found Steven Adams and Andre Roberson for back-to-back alley-oop dunks to give the Thunder a 69-52 lead. After that, it was time for the Westbrook triple-double watch. He reached double digits in assists midway through the third quarter, then grabbed his 10th rebound with about four minutes remaining in the game. --- TIP-INS Knicks: Kanter and F Doug McDermott, the other player the Thunder sent to the Knicks in the Anthony deal, both got a standing ovation during pregame warmups. ... McDermott scored four points on 2-for-5 shooting. ... The Knicks shot 55.6 percent in the first quarter and still trailed 27-24, in part, because of 11 turnovers. They finished with 26 turnovers. Thunder: The game marked the start of the 10th season for the Thunder in Oklahoma City. ... Thunder C Dakari Johnson scored four points in his NBA debut. He was a G League All-Star last season. ... F Jerami Grant's fadeaway at the third-quarter buzzer gave Oklahoma City a 79-59 lead. `STACHE BROTHERS Kanter and Adams are best friends who were known as the `Stache Brothers when they played together with the Thunder. ""It felt weird because he knows my moves and everything,"" Kanter said. ""It definitely was good to see him and come back and play against those guys."" DEFENSE STEPS UP The Thunder allowed the Knicks to shoot 55.6 percent in the first quarter, then held them to 36 percent shooting the rest of the game. It allowed the Thunder to get away with shooting poorly early. ""I thought in the first half we had really good looks,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""We didn't shoot the ball well. The thing with us was our defense. I was really pleased with that."" STAT LINES Adams had a strong all-around game. He scored 12 points on 5-for-5 shooting, and grabbed five rebounds. He had five steals -- one short of his career high -- and added three blocks.","400974441"
"LOS ANGELES -- Patrick Beverley crowded chest-to-chest with Lonzo Ball before an inbounds pass in the first quarter while they were 94 feet from the basket. Moments later at midcourt, Beverley emphatically fouled the Lakers' rookie point guard and watched him fall. Ball still might turn out to be Los Angeles' basketball star of the future, even after his awfully quiet NBA debut. The present in this town still belongs to the Clippers, even without Chris Paul. Blake Griffin scored 29 points and DeAndre Jordan added 14 points and 24 rebounds in the Clippers' 108-92 rout of the Lakers on Thursday night. Lou Williams added 12 points in the Clippers' first game since Paul spurned the perennial playoff team after six years and forced an offseason trade to Houston. The Clippers will have a new look this season after adding Beverley's tenacity and several new scorers, but they were still miles ahead of their Staples Center co-tenants in both teams' season openers. Beverley and the Clippers got little trouble from Ball, who had three points, four assists and nine rebounds in 29 minutes during the first game for the No. 2 overall pick from UCLA. He had about 40 friends and family members in the stands, including his voluble father, LaVar. ""We got blown out, so I didn't play too well,"" Ball said. ""It was great to start out, but all I care about is winning, and we lost today. We've got to regroup."" Ball is expected to revitalize his hometown team this season, but the rookie started out with all the nerves and mistakes that might be expected from any 19-year-old with the weight of a 16-time NBA champion franchise on his slender shoulders. Beverley, who joined the Clippers in Paul's trade to the Rockets, had 10 points while introducing Ball to high-level NBA defense. ""I just had to set the tone,"" Beverley said. ""I told him after the game, due to all the riff-raff his dad brings, he's going to get a lot of people coming at him. He has to be ready for that, and I let him know after the game. But what a better way to start him off. I was 94 feet guarding him tonight. Welcome his little young ass to the NBA."" Along with a handful of good-looking passes and a 3-pointer late in the first half, Ball went 1 for 6 from the field and committed two turnovers. ""He's going to be a great talent, but he has to go through the tough times,"" Beverley said. ""He'll appreciate this when he looks back on it."" Brook Lopez scored 20 points in his debut for the Lakers, and Jordan Clarkson added 18. ""I wasn't happy with what we gave our fans tonight,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""Obviously I heard the (boos), and we deserved it at those times."" TIP-INS Clippers: Danilo Gallinari had 11 points in his LA debut. ... Coach Doc Rivers answered back at Paul, who said he didn't like the Clippers' team culture in a documentary that will be released this week by ESPN. ""Listen, when you leave, you should just leave,"" Rivers said. ""I don't think you have to try to burn the house down or justify why you left. That's what I would say to it. I like our culture. Lakers: New G Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed this game while beginning a two-game suspension for getting arrested in March and later pleading guilty to operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. ... Kyle Kuzma, the Lakers' other first-round pick, had eight points in his NBA debut. ... Andrew Bogut, the former Golden State center, had three fouls and three turnovers in his Lakers debut. NEW BACKCOURT Even with several new contributors, the Clippers already resemble a hard-nosed, tough-minded veteran team led by Beverley. Milos Teodosic, the other starting guard in Rivers' revamped lineup, hit two 3-pointers in the 30-year-old Serbian rookie's NBA debut. MAGIC BALL It was a busy night for Lakers executive Magic Johnson, also a co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Magic watched from the tunnel while Staples Center showed Game 5 of the NL Championship Series on the scoreboard during pregame warmups, and he celebrated behind the scenes when the Dodgers clinched their first World Series berth since 1988 during the first half. ""I'm just happy for all the players and all the Dodger fans across the world,"" Johnson said. ""This is a moment that I'll never forget. I was torn, because I wanted to be here for Lonzo Ball's first game as a Laker, but my heart is in Chicago. ... I'm so happy with Clayton Kershaw, that he can finally pitch in the World Series. He deserves this moment, and all our players deserve this moment, too."" Staples Center erupted in cheers when the Dodgers recorded the final out in Chicago, and again when the final out appeared on the video board.","400974442"
"MVP contender Giannis Antetokounmpo took it to LeBron James and the Cavs Friday, but is wasn't enough as the Bucks fell 116-97. (0:56) MILWAUKEE --  LeBron James and Kevin Love took care of the paint. Once Kyle Korver got going from 3-point range, the Cleveland Cavaliers became nearly unstoppable. James had 24 points and eight assists, Korver hit three straight 3s during a decisive third-quarter run and the Cavaliers beat the Bucks 116-97 on Friday night to spoil Milwaukee's home opener Love added 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavs. Their 15-5 spurt over the final 4:25 of the third quarter, sparked by Korver's long-range shooting, opened a 13-point lead. They led by double digits most of the rest the way. ""Kyle, he came out and he really gave us a spark shooting the basketball,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""With his movement and him running around, he kind of throws defenses off."" And the Cavs handed Milwaukee its first loss of the season. The defending Eastern Conference champions opened with a second straight victory over an East contender after beating Boston in their home opener. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo had 34 points on 15-of-22 shooting, along with eight rebounds and eight assists. Malcolm Brogdon was the only other Buck in double digits with 16 points. Antetokounmpo, as usual, wheeled his 6-foot-11 frame into the lane for an array of athletic buckets. But the Cavs limited nearly everyone else after doing a better job of closing out on 3-point shooters. ""We executed the defensive plan that our coaches gave us. The results were us getting a big win on the road,"" James said. The Cavs were 2 of 10 from 3-point range in the first half, but powered their way to a 55-49 halftime lead by attacking the basket. They were nearly unstoppable once they found their shot from long range. ""Against good teams, you have to give up something, and the 2s weren't what hurt us. The 3s did,"" coach Jason Kidd said. At one point, James hesitated for a couple seconds after being left alone at the top of the 3-point arc. Antetokounmpo then took a couple steps out from near the bucket before James hit the open look for a 101-86 lead with 6:19 left. ""It's a lot tougher, we gave them a lot of open looks,"" Antetokounmpo said about defending the Cavs once they start hitting from 3. ""You're chasing guys to the 3-point line and the paint gets wide open so you get easy layups and it's hard to defend, it's harder to rebound."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Six Cavs scored in double figures. ... After hitting at least 10 3s in all four meetings last season with Milwaukee, the Cavaliers finished 11 of 26 from behind the arc. They were 9 of 16 in the second half. ...  Cleveland missed its first eight 3-pointers before Korver hit two in a row in late in the second quarter. ... Love had an active first half with 13 points and six rebounds. Bucks: Brogdon and Tony Snell (nine points) combined to start 3 of 5 from 3-point range in the first quarter, converting on open looks after defenders converged on driving teammates in the lane. The Bucks cooled off and went 3 of 16 the rest of the first half from behind the arc. ... The team signed F Joel Bolomboy to a two-way contract. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 1.8 points and 1.4 rebounds as a rookie last season for Utah. FIGURING IT OUT Lue is still figuring out the rotation with three new starters. Korver was one of the biggest beneficiaries after not taking a shot in 7 minutes in the opener against Boston. Korver finished with 17 points and was 5 of 6 from 3-point territory. ""I hadn't had a shot yet. The season's got to start at some point, right?"" Korver asked rhetorically. ""Why not right now?"" INJURY REPORT Cavs G Derrick Rose (12 points) had a sore ankle during a play in which he was fouled under the bucket by Bucks C Greg Monroe. Lue said that backup Jose Calderon would likely start on Saturday against Orlando. FOR STARTERS The game marked the final opener in the Bucks' 30th season playing at the Bradley Center. A new arena on an adjacent lot is scheduled to open for next season.","400974443"
"NEW ORLEANS --  As quickly as Golden State's Klay Thompson pulled up for his seventh 3-pointer of the night, the Pelicans' packed, home-opening crowd stopped chanting, ""Defense,"" and started looking for the nearest exits. Thompson scored 31 points, Stephen Curry added 28 and the Golden State Warriors easily erased a 15-point first-half deficit en route to a 128-120 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. ""I felt like I was in the zone,"" Thompson said. ""If I went out there and shot some more jumpers, I'd probably make some more. I was just getting great looks tonight."" Kevin Durant added 22 points and a career-high seven blocked shots for the Warriors, who won for the first time this young season after dropping their opener to Houston. New Orleans is still looking for its first victory after two games, shooting well early in both contests before fading in the second half. Anthony Davis had 35 points and 17 rebounds for the Pelicans, while fellow big man DeMarcus Cousins had 35 points and 14 rebounds. Despite the loss, coach Alvin Gentry and several Pelicans players felt their play improved against the defending champion Warriors and left optimistic about an upcoming West Coast trip. ""We took another huge step tonight,"" Cousins said. ""I'm proud of the way we battled, looking forward to the next matchup. I think we are in a good place."" The teams combined for 34 3-pointers, with the Warriors hitting 18. Thompson, his quick-release perimeter shooting on full display, was 7 of 12 from deep. The Pelicans, who wound up trailing by double digits much of the fourth quarter, pulled as close as five points on Cousins' 3 with about three minutes to go. But Thompson responded immediately with a 3, after which Golden State remained comfortably in control. ""We were better today than we were the last game (at Memphis). That's important,"" Gentry said. ""We have to continue to try to figure it out."" TIP INS Warriors: Curry reached 3,927 assists, passing Tim Hardaway for second place on the franchise's assists list. ... David West, who was New Orleans' first-round draft choice in 2003 and spent his first eight NBA seasons with the franchise, received polite applause after scoring his first points on a mid-range jumper. He followed that up with a 3-pointer shortly after and finished with 11 points. Pelicans: G Ian Clark had 14 points, while Jrue Holiday and Jordan Crawford each added 13 from the back court. ... Gentry was assessed a technical foul by official Ed Malloy in the second quarter. ... The Pelicans announced that C Alexis Ajinca would miss four to six weeks following successful bilateral knee injections to treat patellar tendinitis. ... New Orleans shot 50 percent from 3-point range in the first half, hitting 11 of 22, but made just five of 14 from deep in the second half. MOMENTUM SHIFT New Orleans stormed in front early, thanks to eight 3-pointers in the first quarter. The period closed with a long 3 by each team. Draymond Green hit from 31 feet as the shot clock ran down, then Davis beat the horn from 30 feet, turning after the shot to face the crowd and pound the palm of his right hand into his chest. Davis' shot put the Pelicans up 39-26, and New Orleans led by as many as 15 when Cousins' free throw made it 57-42 half way through the second quarter. Golden State closed out the half with a 19-7 flourish, capped by Durant's 3 that made it 64-61 at halftime. That turned out to be part of a 26-7 run that gave the Warriors their first lead in the third quarter. ""We're just not ready to put together a complete game. We're basically still in training camp in my mind,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.  ""We're still working on everything and that's pretty obvious."" SHOELESS DURANT Durant scored two points and blocked two shots by Tony Allen during a short stretch in which he played with only one shoe after the other had fallen off right before he hit a layup. Durant and Curry grinned as they watched a replay of the sequence in the locker room. Meanwhile, Green said Durant will ""never"" get the credit he deserves for his defensive play because ""his offense is too pretty."" HEAD GAMES Green, who scored 10 points, was assessed a technical foul after shoving Cousins in the second quarter. ""I was just trying to get in Cous' head. That's it. He was playing well,"" Green explained. ""He put his armpit in my face and he flopped a little bit on the push."" But Green stressed that Cousins is ""my guy"" when they're not competing. ""We won a gold medal together so that's a relationship that will be there for a lifetime,"" Green said.","400974444"
"NEW YORK --  Joel Embiid has endured too much misery in the NBA to miss one of the fun days on the schedule. So as soon as he knew his back felt up to it, he couldn't wait to get on the court for his first Christmas Day game. Embiid had 25 points and 16 rebounds, JJ Redick scored 24 points, and the Philadelphia 76ers snapped a five-game losing streak with a 105-98 victory over the New York Knicks on Monday. ""Especially after what we've been through the past four years, I was so excited to play tonight because we've been through so much losing,"" Embiid said. ""And to be able to be one of the few teams in our league that can play on this day, it just shows you how much we've improved."" Neither Embiid nor Redick was cleared to play until going through pregame warmups, and their presence gave the 76ers just enough to win their first Christmas Day appearance since 2001. Embiid, who has been battling a bad back, powered through a big-man duel with Enes Kanter, who had a season-high 31 points and tied a career best with 22 rebounds. He joined Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Bob Lanier as the only players with a 30-20 game on Christmas, according to research provided to the Knicks by Elias. ""I respect the guy a lot because that guy didn't play three, four years and coming back (at the) level he's playing right now,"" Kanter said of Embiid. ""So it's cool to play against, go against a guy like that."" Redick, who missed the last game with right hamstring tightness, helped the 76ers pull away from an 89-all tie midway through the fourth quarter. He's played in Christmas games before -- and made clear again he's not a fan of them -- and he thought his young teammates responded well to their first opportunity. ""There's a tendency to try to put on a show instead of just going out and competing, and I think we did a great job of just going out and competing,"" Redick said. Kristaps Porzingis scored 22 points for the Knicks, who fell to 22-30 on Christmas with their fifth straight loss on the holiday. Backup point guard T.J. McConnell had Philadelphia's final eight points of the third quarter, and the 76ers pushed the lead to nine with about 9 minutes left in the game. The Knicks battled back to tied it 89 on Porzingis' three-point play with 5:20 left, but Philadelphia promptly scored the next seven to go up 96-89 on Redick's 3-pointer with 3:34 to play. Philadelphia's young stars kept the Knicks from getting much closer, with Embiid making a 3-pointer and Ben Simmons stealing Porzingis' pass and dunking it, both times hiking the lead back to eight. TIP-INS 76ers: Coach Brett Brown called Embiid a ""borrowed stud"" who they get to ""inherit"" when he is able to play. ""He doesn't practice and he comes in and plays games and we're trying to grow him into a situation where he is a normal part of a team,"" Brown said. ... The Sixers franchise is 17-13 on Christmas. Knicks: Hall of Famer Bernard King, who set the Christmas record when he scored 60 points for the Knicks against the Nets in 1984, was at the game. ... New York had won seven straight at home over Philadelphia. FULTZ UPDATE No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz, who has missed two months with right shoulder soreness, is on the trip with the 76ers. Brown said the purpose of having the guard from Washington with the team was ""to make sure that he understands completely he is a significant part of our future and that we are with him unconditionally."" ""We will help move him forward in a timeline that's responsible and I just like having him with his extended family, his teammates, with me, with us,"" Brown added. ""Those types of things."" WHAT COULD'VE BEEN Porzingis could've been playing for the 76ers instead of against them Monday. The Knicks took him with the No. 4 pick in 2015, one spot after Philadelphia went with Jahlil Okafor, who eventually fell out of the rotation entirely and was dealt earlier this month to Brooklyn. But Brown declined to look back, saying ""next question"" when asked if he ever wondered ""what if?"" when it came to Porzingis.","400974445"
"Draymond Green may have picked up a technical foul, but he also had a triple-double, his first of the season, to lead the Warriors to a Christmas victory. (0:59) OAKLAND, Calif. --  LeBron James drove to the basket in the waning seconds and Kevin Durant swatted away any chance Cleveland had at a Christmas Day comeback. Durant pumped his fist again and again, emphatically shook his head and pounded his chest in delight. It looked a lot like the dominant Durant from the NBA Finals six months ago. Klay Thompson hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:33 left, Durant delivered on both ends of the floor, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Cavaliers 99-92 on Monday in a festive holiday rematch of the past three Finals. ""There's just so much joy in the arena today because it's Christmas and we all feed off of that,"" Durant said. Durant's block against a driving James with 24.5 seconds left went out of bounds off James, who said he thought he was fouled on the play. Durant finished with 25 points, seven rebounds and five blocked shots. ""He's one of the leaders in shot blocks a game and obviously he had five tonight, so he's been doing a heck of a job of first of all taking the individual matchup and protecting the rim, too,"" James said. Kevin Love had 31 points and a season-best 18 rebounds, while James contributed 20 points, six rebounds and six assists in a rivalry missing one key piece: Warriors star Stephen Curry, who missed his eighth straight game with a sprained right ankle. Thompson scored 24 points and Draymond Green had a triple-double with 12 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists. It was Golden State's 12th win in 13 games after its 11-game winning streak was snapped by Denver on Saturday night. Warriors rookie Jordan Bell traveled with 2:13 left and James tied it. Bell made up for that mistake with a key offensive rebound and pass to Thompson for his fourth 3. James' 3-pointer with 10:39 left pulled Cleveland within one, but Green answered with a 3 and Andre Iguodala scored two of his nine points the next time down. In another key sequence, Durant blocked Tristan Thompson's shot with 6:23 to go and dunked moments later. No surprise, the up-tempo, running rivals provided high entertainment once again. The Warriors last June captured a second championship in three years against James and the Cavaliers. ""I forgot all about it,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said with a chuckle. The teams will see each other again soon, playing Jan. 15 in Cleveland. KD requested James for his defensive assignment, to which he explained simply, ""I just like guarding my position."" The Cavs, having won six of seven and playing for the first time since Thursday, had their run of scoring at least 100 points end at 26 games. The Warriors were at nearly full strength again aside from Curry, who could return this week once he goes through some scrimmages at practice. Center Zaza Pachulia was available but didn't play after sitting out seven consecutive games, while Shaun Livingston came back after missing four games with a sore right knee. Bell -- who addressed the sellout crowd at midcourt moments before tipoff -- started at center and had eight points and six rebounds. SHOOTING WOES The Cavs' 31.8-percent shooting was the lowest by a Warriors opponent in nearly four years, since Charlotte shot 31.2 percent from the field on Feb. 4, 2014. ""We just didn't make shots,"" Lue said. A REAL RIVALRY Sure, this one felt a little strange without Curry or Kyrie Irving, now in Boston. ""Golden State-Cavaliers, that's a big game, no matter who's playing, who's out,"" Lue said. ""It will be weird, without Steph, without Ky, especially the battles we've had over the last three years. So both teams look different."" Warriors coach Steve Kerr knows just the uniforms are enough to get everybody going -- and this marked the third straight Christmas matchup between the franchises, alternating home floors based on who won the title. ""It's always great to play the Cavs, they're an awesome team,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is so amazing and it's so fun to feel the energy in the building when the two teams get together. Neither team will look the same as we will even a month from now because Steph and Isaiah Thomas both should be back, hopefully they'll both be back. ... But it doesn't even matter sometimes, just the two uniforms in the same building gets people going."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Lue isn't yet ready to guess when Thomas will return following his right hip injury. ""He is progressing very well,"" Lue said. ""The most important thing is that he is getting to practice and playing 5-on-5 and having a chance to experience feeling well after it and not having soreness."" ... Cleveland is 19-3 since Nov. 11, including 8-3 on the road. Warriors: Durant averaged 32 points over his seven previous Christmas Day games. ... Golden State played its fifth consecutive Christmas game and seventh in eight. ... The Warriors were 10 of 37 on 3s after they went a dismal 3 for 27 from 3-point range in losing to the Nuggets. ... Kerr began his pregame session by thanking all of the arena staff and Golden State employees for their service and for working on the holiday. ... Thompson's holiday sneakers might have stood out most: neon green on the left foot, neon pink on the right.","400974446"
"BOSTON --  Washington's talented guards made themselves at home at Boston's Christmas party. Bradley Beal scored 25 points, John Wall had 21 points and 14 assists, and the Wizards beat Boston 111-103 on Monday in the Celtics' first Christmas Day home game in franchise history. ""For us to get a win, that was big time,"" Wall said. ""Playing against a great team, one of the hottest teams in the league. They've been in a slump lately, but it's a team that we know we might have to battle later on, and to get a win it was great."" Otto Porter Jr. added 20 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. finished with 16, helping Washington take the first meeting between the teams since Boston's Game 7 victory at home in the second round of the playoffs last spring. ""I felt a little nostalgic out there,"" Oubre said. ""It brought me back to the playoffs and all the good memories that we have in here. The fans chanting crazy stuff, it just brought me back to a place where you know it got me locked in man, like it was the playoffs, so it was a great atmosphere out there."" Boston lost for the third time in four games. Kyrie Irving and Jayson Tatum each scored 20 points for the Celtics, and Terry Rozier had 16. The Celtics are 11-8 since opening the season 16-2. ""It hasn't been one of the best stretches for us, but we have a resilient group,"" Irving said. ""That right there is enough for us to go on and make progress in the right direction."" Boston forward Al Horford thinks it's just a normal course of a season. ""You go through ups and downs in a season,"" he said. ""Tonight, I felt good about our chances. We put ourselves in position to win the game and we weren't able to do it."" Boston opened a 95-90 lead on Irving's 3-pointer with 6:18 left, but the Wizards responded with a 12-0 run. Beal capped the spurt with a three-point play and a breakaway dunk off a turnover. Wall added a layup and two free throws down the stretch to help Washington hold on Last season, the teams had a testy rivalry with lots of trash-talking and a few games filled with hard fouls. It was more civil on Monday, just a tight defensive game with numerous contested shots and a few hard screens. The Wizards led by two at halftime and opened the third quarter by scoring 13 of the first 17 points, pulling ahead 65-54 on Marcin Gortat's three-point play. Gortat had 11 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Wizards: It was Gortat's ninth double-double this season. ... Wall was scoreless in the opening quarter. Celtics: F Marcus Morris returned after missing 10 of the last 11 games with a sore left knee. ... Reserve F Semi Ojeleye missed the game with a sore back after he tested it during pregame warmups. . Jaylen Brown left the arena with one crutch and appeared to favoring his left leg. FIRST NOEL The Celtics played for the 31st time on Christmas, with 28 of the previous games on the road and the other two at neutral sites before Monday. ""As much fun as it is to be with family, this is what our family does,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""We've been in gyms for most Christmases of our lives, so it's really fun to get a chance to compete on Christmas Day."" GRONK SIGHTING Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski was seated courtside wearing a Santa hat. He got a huge ovation when he was shown on the videoboard. FAMILY TIME Morris brothers Marcus (Boston) and Markieff (Wizards) were matched up against each other a few times. At one point, it looked as if they were both smiling when Marcus missed a jumper over his brother. WARM WELCOMING Injured forward Gordon Hayward walked out to center court before the game and wished the fans a merry Christmas and happy holidays on behalf of the Celtics' organization.","400974447"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Oklahoma City is starting to have the look of a contender. Russell Westbrook had 31 points and 11 assists to help the Thunder stay hot with a 112-107 win over the Houston Rockets on Monday night. Paul George scored 24 points and Carmelo Anthony added 20 for the Thunder, who won their fifth straight game and their 11th in their past 14. Oklahoma City shot 54.4 percent from the field against the Rockets, who entered the day with the best record in the Western Conference. The Thunder started 4-7 after acquiring George and Anthony in the offseason, but they've charged back to the center of the West's playoff picture as they've figured out how to distribute the ball among their stars. ""Every night, teams guard us differently,"" Westbrook said. ""Once we figure that out and see how teams are guarding us -- find ways to make the game easier for (George and Anthony), and that's my job."" James Harden led the Rockets with 29 points, but he made just 7 of 18 field goals. The league's leading scorer was coming off back-to-back 51-point games. ""Give them credit,"" Harden said. ""They made big-time shots. We had our chances, though. We had several chances, we just couldn't convert and we couldn't get stops when we needed to."" Trevor Ariza and Eric Gordon each scored 20 points and Clint Capela added 19 points and 10 rebounds for Houston, which lost its third straight. Houston point guard Chris Paul sat out with a groin strain. The Rockets are 15-1 when he plays and 10-6 when he doesn't. The Thunder held the Rockets below their league-best average of 115.4 points per game. The Rockets made just 12 of 37 3-pointers. ""I thought tonight we made multiple efforts, which we knew we was going to have to do against a fast-paced team like that, a team that likes to move the ball, play fast, put up a lot of shots, put up a lot of 3s,"" Anthony said. ""We knew that we was going to have to scramble tonight, and I thought we did a great job tonight of not getting frustrated when they did make some tough shots, make some 3s."" Westbrook shot 4 for 14 in the first half but made his last two before the break to help the Thunder lead 58-57 at halftime. Harden had 11 points in the first half but made just 1 of 8 shots. Westbrook broke away for a fast-break dunk to give the Thunder a 65-59 lead early in the third quarter. The Rockets rallied, and the score was tied at 88 heading into the fourth. Houston had the ball down by three in the final minute. Harden missed a wild 3-pointer while trying but failing to draw a foul, and the Thunder got control in a scramble. Westbrook found Andre Roberson for a layup with 21 seconds left to put the Thunder up 112-107. Westbrook scored 11 points in just under nine minutes in the fourth quarter. ""I'm coming,"" he said. ""That's what I bring to the table. Once I hit the floor, it's nonstop."" TIP-INS Rockets: Capela returned to the starting lineup. He had missed the previous two games with a left heel contusion. ... Houston committed just one turnover in the first quarter and 14 overall. Thunder: Roberson left in the first quarter but returned later in the period with fingers taped together on his left hand. ... C Steven Adams had 12 points and six rebounds in the first quarter and finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds ... George and Anthony had three fouls in the first half. George finished with five and Anthony with four. QUOTABLE Anthony played without his shooter arm sleeves early in the game and didn't feel like himself without them.

"LOS ANGELES --  The Minnesota Timberwolves got their first-ever Christmas victory, and with the way things are coming together, it could be the first of many showcase wins. Jimmy Butler scored 23 points, Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 10 rebounds and the Timberwolves beat the Los Angeles Lakers 121-104 on Monday night. ""I'm happy to be part of history for the franchise, but this won't be the first and the only one that we ever win,"" Towns said. ""We'll have a lot more opportunities I'm banking on to do this again and again and again."" Former Southern California standout Taj Gibson had 23 points and nine rebounds for the Timberwolves, who have won four straight. Jamal Crawford added 19 points off the bench. Lakers rookie Kyle Kuzma scored 31 points, joining LeBron James in 2003 as the only first-year players to score at least 30 points on Christmas Day in the last 30 seasons. Jordan Clarkson had 17 points, seven assists and six rebounds, and Julius Randle had 16 points and seven rebounds for the Lakers, who have lost three in a row and six of seven. Minnesota pulled away when Towns and Crawford combined to score all 16 points during a 16-1 run after Randle put Los Angeles up 84-83 with 11:14 to play. The Lakers cut the deficit to 105-99 with 4:30 remaining, but Gibson knocked down a hook shot and 3-pointer on consecutive possessions to restore a double-digit lead. ""He just has a knack of coming up with big plays when you need it the most,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""What he has brought to the team and what Jimmy has brought to the team has really changed everything for us."" While the Timberwolves have been able to jumpstart their development with the addition of Butler, Gibson and Crawford, the Lakers showed their potential, even without Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball. Ball sprained his left shoulder against Portland on Saturday, and Ingram missed his second straight game with quad injuries. Kuzma scored 10 of the Lakers' first 14 points, and kept a short-handed bunch in the mix. The Timberwolves led by 10 with 7:42 left in the second quarter, but the Lakers closed the half on a 22-13 run. Kuzma hit a 3 with 1:07 left to give Los Angeles its first lead before Butler hit a spinning layup to put Minnesota in front 53-52 at the break. ""I like what he's about, how he likes to compete,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said of Kuzma, who is averaging 30 points during his last five games. ""For us and the way we want to play, we want it to come organically to him, so we're not just running plays for him every time."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns had 18 points in the second half. ... F Nemanja Bjelica had one point and two rebounds in six minutes after missing 15 games with a sprained left foot. Lakers: Los Angeles missed out on a chance to break a tie with the New York Knicks for most wins on Christmas Day, dropping to 22-22. The Lakers played on Christmas Day for the 19th consecutive season. LOOK INTO THE FUTURE? Even without Ingram and Ball, the Lakers' youth invited comparisons to where the Timberwolves were last season. Thibodeau understands why the parallels are being made and expects Los Angeles to be even more of a pest as the season goes on. ""I've watched their Warrior games, they're all hard-fought games,"" Thibodeau said. ""I think the future is bright, and when you have young guys it takes a little bit of time. A big part of learning is the trial and error of going through games."" SPEED IT UP Despite barbs from analyst Charles Barkley and the TNT crew about their methodical tempo on offense, the Timberwolves scored 38 points in the fourth quarter. ""We pushed the pace. They were really pushing their pace on us early on and we weren't playing with the energy that we needed,"" Towns said.","400974449"
"DETROIT --  Eminem, Kid Rock and Big Sean welcomed the Detroit Pistons back downtown. And the Motor City's NBA team gave their fans a reason to cheer. Tobias Harris scored 17 of his 27 points in the first quarter and grabbed 10 rebounds, helping Detroit celebrate its return to the city with a 102-90 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night. The Pistons and Charlotte opened the season in Little Caesars Arena, a new facility that drew them downtown for the first time in nearly four decades. Eminem made a surprise appearance, grabbing the microphone to fire up the crowd just before tipoff. ""I don't think any of us knew that was coming,"" Harris said. ""That was really dope."" Eminem slipped away from the arena floor, and was later introduced to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver by former Pistons star Grant Hill. Kid Rock and Big Sean , a couple other Motor City musical artists, sat in baseline seats at the opposite ends of the court during the game. Dwight Howard had 10 points, 15 rebounds and two blocks in his debut with the Hornets. ""This is a long season, so we can't panic after one game,"" Howard said. ""The champs lost (Tuesday night), so anything can happen. We just have to learn from tonight and be better for Friday. We'll do that. Charlotte's Kemba Walker scored 24 points, and Jeremy Lamb had 15. Reserve Langston Galloway scored 16 points, Avery Bradley had 15, and Henry Ellenson added 13 points for Detroit in their first game with the franchise. Reggie Jackson had 13 points and eight assists. Detroit's point guard spent the final seconds of the game hugging teammate Andre Drummond at midcourt, soaking up the feel-good moment after a disappointing season. ""We were just talking about how we have to lead each and every night and be our best selves,"" Jackson said. ""If we want to do something special, we have to do it on a day to day basis."" The Pistons outscored Charlotte 27-18 in the second quarter, building an 11-point lead they didn't have much trouble keeping. TIP-INS Hornets: Howard, Lamb, Walker, Marvin Williams and rookie Dwayne Bacon started the game, but coach Steve Clifford said that may not be the team's regular lineup. ""I just don't think we have that kind of team,"" Clifford said. ... Cody Zeller had eight points and nine rebounds for an offensively challenged team that made fewer than 40 percent of its shots. Pistons:  Pistons owner Tom Gores said he has talked to Silver about Detroit hosting an All-Star game and believes it will happen. ""It's just a matter of when,"" Gore said. ... Stanley Johnson was 0 for 13 from the field and made two free throws. KEY STAT Detroit scored 26 points off Charlotte's 17 turnovers while the Hornets had just six points off the Pistons' nine turnovers. ""Most games, you have to look at the film to figure out the difference in the game, but that's not the case,"" Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. ""It was obviously the turnovers."" HOMECOMING The Pistons moved back downtown to share an arena with the Red Wings after playing in the suburbs at the Palace of Auburn Hills and the Pontiac Silverdome. The team left Detroit in 1978 after playing in Cobo Arena and Olympia Stadium in the city. The Pistons' welcomed back former starts including Hill, Dave Bing and Bob Lanier for their Little Caesars Arena debut. ""My friends in the `burbs and the city are excited about this,"" Lanier said. ""I think this will bring the energy back for the Pistons from the streets to the suites."" ENOUGH SAID Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy credited Gores and Silver for including Eminem, who recently released a profane lyrical tirade against President Donald Trump, in the pregame presentation. ""Without making any statement, they were able to make a statement by involving Eminem,"" Van Gundy said.","400974700"
"INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indiana Pacers kept promising this revamped team would look completely different. They only needed one game to prove it. Eight Pacers scored in double figures, three finished with double-doubles and Indiana produced its highest point total in nearly seven years in a 140-131 season-opening victory Wednesday night over the Brooklyn Nets, who lost Jeremy Lin to an apparent knee injury midway through the fourth quarter. ""It was a great first night and hopefully Pacers fans got a chance to see what we're capable of and what type of basketball team we are,"" Victor Oladipo said after finishing with 22 points, five rebounds, four steals and four assists in his Indiana debut. Just two years ago, this was a team that relied on defense and a grind-it-out offense. Not anymore. With Paul George and Jeff Teague landing in new places, the Pacers used a balanced offense and a nice blend of old and new faces to get the job done. Darren Collison wound up with 21 points and 11 assists in his return to Indiana. Newly elected team captain Myles Turner had 21 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks, and former Nets player Thaddeus Young added 17 points and 11 rebounds. From an offensive standpoint, things couldn't have gone much better. The Pacers scored 140 points for the first time since putting up 144 against Denver on Nov. 9, 2010, and only the third time since 2000. ""I'm very, very happy and excited we got this win,"" Young said. ""It gives us something to piggyback off and we have to go into that film room tomorrow and work on that defense because we gave up way too many points."" D'Angelo Russell had 30 points and five assists in his Brooklyn debut, but Lin limped to the back after a hard landing on a drive to basket. Trevor Booker added 20 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. But it wasn't enough to avoid a franchise-record fifth consecutive opening-night loss. ""It's not a good night for the Nets,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We're going to have to piece it together and figure out how we can improve and get ready for the Orlando game."" Both teams had chances to take control but neither really did -- even after the Pacers used a 10-0 third quarter run to break a 65-65 tie. Brooklyn never led again, though it charged back in the closing minutes by trimming a 10-point deficit to 130-126 before the Pacers finally closed it out. TIP-INS Nets: Have lost all six road openers since moving to Brooklyn. ... The Nets are 3-3 all-time against Indiana in season openers. ... Brooklyn used Timofey Mozgov and Lin in the starting lineup, marking the first time in franchise history more than one undrafted player started a season opener. ... Brooklyn was 29 of 32 from the free-throw line. ... Lin had 18 points, and Caris LeVert scored 12. Pacers: Extended their winning streak over Brooklyn to four. ... Indiana has won six of its last seven season openers and seven of its last eight home openers. ... Lance Stephenson scored 16 points off the bench. ... Bojan Bogdanovic scored 14 points against his former team. ... The Pacers blocked nine shots and outrebounded Brooklyn 47-43. WHERE'S THE D? Neither Atkinson nor Indiana coach Nate McMillan could quibble with the offensive showcase, but both were clearly concerned about the defensive play. Indiana shot 52 percent from the field. The Nets kept it close by going 12 of 30 on 3-pointers. The teams combined for 50 fouls, leading to 64 free throws, too. Against rebuilding teams, that may be good enough to be competitive. Against the rest of the league, both coaches know they must be better. ""I thought we completely broke down defensively,"" Atkinson said. ""I wish I could sit here and say there was one area, but it was a multitude of things."" THE NEW FACES Each team had plenty of new faces Wednesday and most had a big hand in what happened. Allen Crabbe and DeMarre Carroll, acquired in summer trades, finished with 12 and 10 points for Brooklyn. Indiana also got 16 points and seven rebounds from Domantas Sabonis, the second acquisition in the George trade, and 11 points from former Toronto Raptors guard Cory Joseph.","400974701"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic were about to squander a 17-point fourth-quarter lead, giving their season opener a familiar feel. Then Evan Fournier helped get 2017-18 off on a different foot. Fournier made three clutch shots to slow the hard-charging Miami Heat, and the Magic held on for a 116-109 win on Wednesday night -- its first season-opening victory since 2012. Last year, Orlando often lost confidence and poise in late, tight situations. But when Miami pulled within two points with 2:39 remaining, Fournier went to work, scoring seven of his team-high 23 points in the final 2:27. ""Obviously I was still confident, but I think two or three years ago that's a game we would have lost,"" Fournier said. ""It shows growth from us players."" Prior to Fournier's surge, the Magic were reeling. Orlando went more than three minutes without a point after Jonathon Simmons' two free throws with 5:39 remaining. In between, Miami staged an 11-0 run and moved within 105-103 on Goran Dragic's two free throws with 2:39 left. Then Fournier hit his 3, cutting off Miami's rally. ""That's good but I wish we would have killed the game when we were up 17,"" Fournier said. ""It's hard to tell right now what happened, maybe we were too confident. But when you are up 17, you have to kill the game."" Second-year Magic coach Frank Vogel was pleased Fournier stepped up. James Johnson, Dion Waiters and Dragic had been pushing Miami hard while Orlando missed shots during the 11-0 stretch. ""The best way to stop a run is to score the ball,"" Vogel said. ""Evan kept us in the game and sealed the game for us by continuing to play good offensive basketball. You need a guy like that to carry the load. He was terrific tonight."" Orlando center Nikola Vucevic had 19 points, 13 rebounds and two blocks. Miami was led by Hassan Whiteside, who dominated the paint in the second half. Whiteside finished with 26 points and 22 rebounds. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was disappointed his team couldn't find a way to complete the comeback. ""If we want to get where we want to get with this group, we're going to really have to commit to those tough things, those physical things,"" Spoelstra said. ""All of those these things we're capable of, and we've shown flashes of it."" TIP-INS Heat: All five of Miami's starters scored in double figures. Kelly Olynyk had 10 points in his first game with the Heat and Waiters had 15. ... Whiteside had 10 rebounds in the first half. Magic: Rookie Jonathan Isaac, the No. 6 overall pick in June's NBA Draft, converted his first NBA attempt on a put-back late in the first quarter. ... Gordon took a hard hit from Whiteside on a baseline drive late in the second quarter. Gordon remained on the floor momentarily before getting up. The play was reviewed and ruled a common foul. ROOKIE MISTAKE Isaac said he was so nervous Wednesday that he forgot to put his jersey on under his warmups prior to the game. He said it was about five minutes into the game before he finally got his jersey. He didn't go in until 3:10 remained in the first quarter.","400974702"
"BOSTON -- Giannis Antetokounmpo dribbled into the paint, spun to his left and found his path to the basket blocked by Celtics rookie Jayson Tatum. Instead, the Greek Freak fed the ball to Matthew Dellavedova beyond the arc for the 3-pointer that helped seal Milwaukee's 108-100 victory over the Boston Celtics in the Bucks' season opener on Wednesday night. ""I passed the ball to Delly,"" said Antetokounmpo, who had 16 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter- and the biggest assist of the game, as well. ""And that's what Delly does."" One night after a gruesome broken ankle just six minutes into the season cost Boston top free agent Gordon Hayward -- perhaps for the entire year -- the Celtics fell to 0-2 by giving up an 11-1 run that left Milwaukee with a 97-90 lead and under three minutes to play. Antetokounmpo added 13 rebounds, Rookie of the Year Malcolm Brogdon scored 19 points and Khris Middleton had 15 points and nine rebounds for the Bucks. Dellavedova scored 15 points, including the 3-pointer with 45 seconds left after the Celtics cut the lead to two points. ""I thought Giannis made a great play at the end, trusting his teammate,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""Just to trust his teammate down at the end to make a play ... he got off the ball and Delly made a big shot."" Kyrie Irving scored 17 points on 7-for-25 shooting in his Boston debut, and Jaylen Brown had 18 in a subdued home opener for the Celtics, who underwent a near-complete overhaul over the summer even after earning the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference last season. Although Irving and No. 3 draft pick Jayson Tatum appeared in a Celtics home uniform for the first time, Hayward was left to wish them well in a pregame video in his hospital gown from his hospital bed. After cheering Hayward during his scoreboard appearance, the Celtics fans broke into a chant of his name during the first half. ""Like he told us before the game, we got that message -- before the whole arena got the message -- he's fine,"" Celtics guard Terry Rozier said. ""Personally, it was tough seeing, but I think we'll be fine. We've just got to adjust."" But the team was unable to make up for the absence of the player who was expected to be their key offseason acquisition when he signed a four-year, $128 million contract to rejoin Brad Stevens, his college coach, in Boston. The Celtics trailed by seven heading into the third quarter before scoring 14 of the next 16 points, taking a 69-64 lead on Irving's 3-pointer from the top of the key. But the Bucks regained the lead with six minutes to play, holding Boston without a basket for about five minutes. FIGHTING WORDS Boston's Marcus Smart and Dellavedova traded hard fouls early in the second quarter, leading to some shoving and a technical foul for the Celtics guard. First, Smart went to the floor with a bit of a hip check. Later, Smart seemed to embellish his fall when Dellavedova ran into his screen. Smart came up and put his chest into the Bucks guard, and Milwaukee's John Henson reached in to try to restrain him. Dellavedova was called for a common foul and Smart was given a technical. TIP-INS Bucks: Returned to the road for their season opener. Before opening at home the past two seasons, the Bucks had tipped off on the road for 30 years in a row. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Mike Conley is expected to be a scoring leader for Memphis. Seems like he might get some help from rookie Dillon Brooks. Conley scored 27 points, Brooks added 19 and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the New Orleans Pelicans 103-91 in their season opener on Wednesday night. Brooks, a second-round pick in last summer's draft, scored 10 points in the second half to help Memphis stretch the lead to 14 in the fourth quarter. ""Man, somebody made a mistake not drafting (Brooks earlier),"" Conley said. ""It was really fun,"" Brooks said. ""Especially with these guys. They made it feel like home, and they never got at me for a shot I took."" Marc Gasol had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Memphis won its opener for the second straight year, a first in franchise history. ""We were not perfect by any means,"" Gasol said. ""But we were consistent with our effort and very unselfish. That to me is the most important thing."" The Pelicans relied on 33 points and 18 rebounds from Anthony Davis, while DeMarcus Cousins finished with 28 points and 10 boards. But the frontcourt pair got little help as the Pelicans shot 38 percent. Starting guards Jrue Holiday and E'Twaun Moore were a combined 7 of 22 from the field, including missing all five of their shots outside the arc. ""It's got to be a combination of both,"" Davis said. ""When the guards are playing well and making shots, it makes it easy on me and DeMarcus down low."" Memphis, which trailed early, carried a 54-52 lead into halftime and extended the advantage to 79-70 entering the fourth. The Pelicans only got the deficit to single digits once in the fourth. ""We got real stagnant, and we started forcing the issue,"" Cousins said. ""We didn't make the defense work. We started to settle for the initial drive. They are very fixable issues."" TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans had eight blocks in the first quarter, a franchise record for blocks in a period. ... Davis is dealing with strep throat. ... Davis had seven offensive rebounds. ... After making 6 of 9 from outside the arc in the first quarter, New Orleans missed 15 of 16 the rest of the way. Grizzlies: Andrew Harrison, who won a preseason battle with Wade Baldwin IV for one of the last roster spots, started alongside Conley at guard. ... Brooks started 3 of 4 from the field and finished 7 of 13. ... Memphis is now 5-18 in season openers but has won three of four. ...

LOVE FOR THE GRINDFATHER Pelicans guard Tony Allen, who played seven years for Memphis and coined the team's Grit and Grind catchphrase, was featured in a video tribute between the first and second quarters. ""I looked at the thing and didn't realize I was that old,"" he said, adding: ""It was all special. A special moment."" The crowd, many wearing Allen's Grizzlies jersey, gave Allen a long standing ovation when he entered the game in the first quarter. The team recently announced it would retire Allen's No. 9. Earlier in the day, Allen wrote a thank you letter to the city on the Players' Tribune website.

"DALLAS --  Dennis Schroder's first game as the front man for the Atlanta Hawks just happened to be the night that countryman Dirk Nowitzki joined Kobe Bryant as the only players to reach 20 seasons with the same team. The young guard showed Germany's aging icon that maybe he can be the face of a franchise as well. Schroder scored 28 points, fellow Euro standout Marco Belinelli added 20 in his first game for Atlanta and the rebuilding Hawks spoiled rookie Dennis Smith Jr.'s solid Dallas debut, beating the Mavericks 117-111 in the opener Wednesday. ""He is about to retire,"" Schroder said of the 39-year-old Nowitzki. ""And to have a battle against him and compete against him is always a good feeling."" Belinelli, a familiar face for the Mavericks as a former rival with San Antonio, was 4 of 6 from 3-point range to help the Hawks in their first game after letting Paul Millsap leave in free agency and dumping Dwight Howard. ""I've seen him in Europe doing his thing for Italy, and he did it tonight,"" said Schroder, who led the Hawks with seven assists. ""I was excited when I heard he's here. It's just great to have somebody like that coming off the bench and looking for his shots."" Smith, the first Dallas rookie to start an opener since 34-year-old teammate Devin Harris in 2004, scored his first NBA points on an alley-oop dunk to open the Dallas scoring and finished with 16 points and a game-high 10 assists. Nowitzki scored 10 points on 4-of-14 shooting, and the surest sign yet that he's putting the franchise in younger hands came late. The 7-footer who led the Mavericks to their only championship in 2011 sat during the back-and-forth final minutes. Dewayne Dedmon followed a miss by Schroder for a layup to put Atlanta up 113-111 with 58 seconds left. Taurean Prince rebounded a missed 3 from Belinelli with the shot clock off and made both free throws for a four-point lead. ""I think it was just a couple of blown coverages,"" Smith said of the Mavs getting outscored 6-0 in the final minute. ""Stuff that shouldn't have happened but it did unfortunately. It's stuff that we can fix."" Schroder was 13 of 26 from the field, with all but three of his shots coming inside the 3-point line as the 24-year-old in his fifth season attacked the basket repeatedly. ""He's kind of our engine,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""When he's aggressive, that's when he's at his best and we're at our best."" Nerlens Noel matched Smith with 16 points, his most since coming to Dallas at the trading deadline last season, and had 11 rebounds. Wesley Matthews scored all of his 15 points in the second half. Harrison Barnes scored 14 but was 3 of 13 from the field. TIP-INS Hawks: Won their eighth straight against the Mavericks, a streak that goes back to Oct. 30, 2013. ... Prince, a former Baylor standout playing 100 miles up the road from his college home, had 10 points and 10 rebounds.

Noel had two double-doubles in 22 games with Dallas last season. `OTHER' FIRST-ROUNDER The 19-year-old Smith, the ninth overall pick and Dallas' most important draft choice since Nowitzki 19 years ago, wasn't the only first-round rookie to play well. Atlanta's John Collins, the 19th pick, scored 14 points . BRIEF BREAK Smith asked out of the game and limped through the tunnel in the second quarter after landing awkwardly on his left leg when he was fouled on a dunk. He returned later in the quarter, and said after the game it was just a ""quick breather"" after a hard collision.","400974705"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Alec Burks showed glimpses during the preseason, and on opening night delivered more proof that the athletic player that used to score points in droves is back. Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 10 rebounds, Burks had 16 and the Utah Jazz beat the Denver Nuggets 106-96 on Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. The new-look Jazz -- without Gordon Hayward and George Hill -- trailed most of the night before Burks took over with a spectacular fourth quarter. The versatile seventh-year wing has missed most of the last three seasons due to a litany of injuries, 146 games to be exact, but showed no lingering effects. ""It's surreal,"" Burks said. ""I've been through a lot, injury-wise. It's just great to be out there healthy. ... I had a bad year last year because I wasn't healthy. ""I was aggressive and things happened to open up. Teams start relaxing. Things happen."" Burks scored 12 points during a 25-4 run that spanned the third and fourth quarters. The Jazz trailed 83-78 going into the fourth quarter. Burks threw down a dunk, hit a pair 3-pointers and then gave the Jazz a 94-85 lead off a reverse layup. ""You feel him over the period of a couple years and he's not just hungry,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""The adversity has tightened his game up a little bit. He played good defense. ""He's taken a lot of pride in how he's defended, too. It's become important to him. ... Happy for Alec and his teammates are happy for him."" Utah picked up the defense in the final period, which helped extend the run to 31-5 and put away Denver. Snyder credited the second unit and said the team stayed persistent defensively against an explosive Denver offense. ""Three pretty good quarters and in the fourth quarter we just imploded,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""That's not really fun to see, especially with the season-opening game."" Derrick Favors added 14 and Ricky Rubio had 10 assists in his first game with the Jazz. Will Barton led the Nuggets with 23 points and Paul Millsap added 19. The Nuggets took a 58-49 lead into halftime, sparked by a 17-4 first-quarter run. Denver was 9 for 16 from 3-point range in the first half. ""They turned it up, we didn't,"" Millsap said. ""I thought for three quarters we did an amazing job on both ends of the court. Offensively and defensively, we did what we wanted to do. I think toward the end of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, we just fell apart. ""It's a learning experience for us. We'll watch film tomorrow and get better from it.""

Nikola Jokic finished with seven points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. Jazz: Rodney Hood was pulled out of the starting lineup at the last second due to gastric distress. Rookie Donovan Mitchell made his first career start in his place. Hood entered later in the first quarter and played 18 minutes. ... Dante Exum (left shoulder) and Raul Neto (right hamstring) were both out. YOUNG DUO Malone downplayed the significance of which of his young point guards started the game. Denver fans are eager to see how the two early draft picks play together and how the minutes are distributed. Mudiay was the No. 7 overall pick in 2015 and Murray was No. 7 in 2016. ""It's going to be a great challenge for them,"" Malone said. ""We feel confident in both Jamal and Emanuel. They're both going to get great opportunities to play regardless of who's starting. ""When they're struggling, the great about our team is we're not solely relying on those guys to carry our team.

"PHOENIX -- If the Suns were a Broadway show, they'd close for good after opening night. The Suns weren't just bad in their 124-76 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers in their season opener on Wednesday night. They were historically awful. It was the most one-sided season-opening loss by any team in NBA history and the worst defeat by the Suns in any game in their 49 years. Suns coach Earl Watson said he was ""embarrassed"" by what happened. ""Portland came in here and basically kicked our butts as bad as they could,"" Watson said. ""They didn't have no sympathy."" Damian Lillard scored 27 points, and Pat Connaughton added a career-high 24 points, making 4 of 6 3-pointers for Portland. The Trail Blazers outshot, outrebounded and outhustled the Suns from the opening tip. Portland tied the second-largest margin of victory in franchise history. Only a 50-point win against the Cleveland Cavaliers (129-79) on Nov. 21, 1982, was larger. ""The obvious statement is we played really well,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. The 48-point rout exceeded the Denver Nuggets' 46-point victory (139-93) over the Los Angeles Clippers on opening day in 1987. The blowout also topped Phoenix's 44-point loss to the Seattle SuperSonics (151-107) on April 2, 1988. ""It's going to be hard for me to sleep tonight,"" the Suns' Devin Booker said. The Blazers dominated, even though they were without one of their best players, guard CJ McCollum, who was suspended one game for leaving the bench area during a tussle involving the Suns' Alex Len and Caleb Swanigan in a preseason game a week ago. ""That was a great way to start the season,"" Stotts said. ""I was really pleased with our defense through the whole night. Offense got off to a slow start but picked up."" Portland led 60-35 at the half and outscored the Suns 64-41 in the second half. The Blazers led by as many as 58, for a time flirting with the most one-sided game in NBA history, a 68-point blowout of the Miami Heat by the Cavaliers on Dec. 17, 1991. The Suns shot 31.5 percent to Portland's 49 percent, made 7 of 27 3-pointers to the Blazers' 14-of-24 and were outrebounded 57-33. Phoenix had the league's second-worst record last season at 24-58 and looked at least that bad throughout the opener. The Suns have not made the playoffs in seven seasons, the longest drought in franchise history. They are trying to rebuild with youth. That takes time and some painful moments, such as the one Wednesday night. Eric Bledsoe scored 15 points on 5 of 18 shooting. Booker added 12 on 6-of-17 shooting. Bledsoe was 1-for-6 on 3s, and Booker was 0-for-3. Portland's bench outscored Phoenix's 61-26. After Booker's 13-footer tied it at 17, Lillard sank a layup, and the Blazers bolted away from there. Bledsoe's three-point play cut the lead to 45-35 with 4:38 left in the third quarter, but Portland scored the final 15 points of the half 60-35 at the break. The Suns shot 29 percent in the first half (14-of-49) to Portland's 44 percent (22-of-50). Phoenix was 1-for-11 from 3-point range in the first two quarters to the Blazers' 7-of-13. Most tellingly, the Portland bench outscored its Phoenix counterparts 24-0. It only got worse (or better from Portland's perspective) after that. The Blazers led a numbing 98-55 entering the final quarter. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: The one-game suspension, for taking a few steps off the bench in a preseason game, cost McCollum $165,000. ... Connaughton, a fourth-round draft pick of the Baltimore Orioles, had a previous career high of 15 points. ... Portland had six players in double figures. ... Blazers have won four consecutive season openers. ... Trail Blazers don't play their home opener until Tuesday against New Orleans. Suns: Len sat out the game with a sprained left ankle. He was injured in Saturday's practice. ... Rookie Josh Jackson started and made a 3-pointer with his first shot, but was 3 for 9 the rest of the way with only two rebounds. ... Marquese Chriss made 1 of 5 shots and had one rebound and five fouls in 12:05 minutes.","400974767"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Just imagine what these Houston Rockets might look like months from now, when James Harden has a healthy Chris Paul alongside him in the backcourt and Mike D'Antoni's rotations become more consistent. Beginning the season with a tough back-to-back in Northern California hardly made for an easy start, and Houston is an impressive 2-0. Harden had 27 points and nine assists, and the Rockets made it a perfect two-game road trip despite playing this one without Paul, beating the Sacramento Kings 105-100 on Wednesday night to spoil another home team's opener. ""Obviously this road trip was going to be tough, but we did a really good job, especially tonight, of not letting up and just playing four quarters,"" Harden said. ""We say it all the time: We might not knock you out in the first, second or third quarter, but fourth quarter if we keep playing the way we need to play we've always got a chance."" While he didn't shoot especially well, Harden hit a trio of dagger 3-pointers with 8:13, 6:00 and 5:13 left -- the second of which put Houston ahead 89-79. He also had a key left-handed layup late and finished 8 for 21 and 4 of 14 from 3-point range. Sacramento forced the Rockets into a shot clock violation and the Kings got the ball back with just less than a minute remaining and down 96-92. Willie Cauley-Stein made one of two free throws with 41 seconds left and Harden found Clint Capela for an alley-oop dunk moments later. After the Kings stole the inbounds pass from Eric Gordon with 25 seconds left and down 98-95, it was initially ruled Sacramento ball but the play went to replay review and a foul was issued to George Hill instead. Gordon converted two free throws. Capela had 22 points and matched his career high with 17 rebounds. Paul sat out with a bruised left knee that limited him during Houston's stunning comeback 122-121 win at Golden State on Tuesday after the Warriors held their championship ring ceremony. Gordon started for Paul and scored 25 points with four 3-pointers, a night after missing all six of his tries from long range but still winding up with 24 points in 29 minutes. Buddy Hield scored 10 of his 19 points in the third quarter for Sacramento and tied the game at 68 on a 3-pointer with 3:33 left in the period. Cauley-Stein had 21 points on 10-for-15 shooting, 10 rebounds and three blocked shots. The Rockets looked sluggish at times in the second game of a season-opening back-to-back. Yet Houston had enough to win its sixth straight in the series after winning all four games last season. ""To validate yesterday we had to win today or we wouldn't validate yesterday,"" D'Antoni said. ""They had that in mind. At the same time, a back-to-back on the opening two nights, especially it's so emotional, that takes more out of you."" Zach Randolph missed making his Kings debut a day after undergoing oral surgery, but Vince Carter and Hill provided a veteran presence for the new-look Kings as they move forward beginning the season without DeMarcus Cousins after he was traded to New Orleans last February. Hill scored 16 points and Carter six in 14 minutes. ""We saw a lot of things we were proud about,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""The No. 1 thing is if we compete that hard we are going to give ourselves a chance in games."" AILING PAUL D'Antoni isn't counting on Paul being back Saturday for the home opener against Dallas. ""It's not a concern, it's just nagging,"" D'Antoni said. ""We'll sit him until the training staff thinks he's ready to go and try to get over it totally."" Paul had four points and shot 2 for 9 at Golden State but was limited by soreness in the knee. He led the Rockets with 11 assists and also grabbed eight rebounds, while playing 33 minutes in his regular-season debut with Houston after being traded by the Clippers during the offseason. TIP-INS Rockets: The Rockets were 13-3 in the second game of back-to-backs last season. The have 14 such sets, 13 remaining. ... Trevor Ariza was held to two points on free throws, shooting 0 for 6 and missing all five of his 3s. ... Houston's schedule includes seven of its first 10 games on the road. ... P.J. Tucker had just six points while dealing with foul trouble after scoring 20 points in his Rockets debut at Golden State.

"TORONTO -- Newcomer C.J. Miles got Toronto's bid to become a better 3-point shooting team off to a successful start. Jonas Valanciunas had 23 points and 15 rebounds, Miles scored 22 points in his Toronto debut and the Raptors beat the short-handed Chicago Bulls 117-101 on Thursday night in the season opener for both teams. Norman Powell added 15 points, Delon Wright had 13, and Kyle Lowry 12. Miles went 6 for 9 from 3-point range and had five rebounds. Half of the former Indiana Pacers player's points came in the second quarter during a 22-2 run by Toronto's second unit. ""I want to be able to be that spark,"" Miles said, ""come in and communicate, bring energy."" DeMar DeRozan found a lot to like in his first game with Miles as a teammate. ""It's great to have him on our team doing it with us instead of against us,"" DeRozan said. The Raptors, who intend to boost their 3-point shooting and move the ball more this season, were 13 of 29 from long range and had 26 assists on 39 baskets. Lowry had nine assists, and DeRozan and Wright each had five. ""I loved the way the ball moved,"" coach Dwane Casey. ""We've got to play that way."" Playmaking proved an effective avenue for DeRozan on a night when he made just two of nine field goals and did not attempt a 3-pointer. DeRozan finished with 11 points, going 7 for 8 at the free throw line, and had six rebounds. Chicago center Robin Lopez scored 18 points, rookie Lauri Markkanen had 17 points and eight rebounds in his NBA debut, and Justin Holiday scored 15. ""I thought Lauri was really good,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""For his first performance, coming out here on the road in a hostile environment, to go out and put up 17 and eight in his first NBA game is pretty impressive."" Hoiberg said forward Nikola Mirotic is doing OK but is still sore two days after suffering facial fractures and a concussion in a practice fight with teammate Bobby Portis. Chicago suspended Portis for eight games following the altercation. Mirotic is expected to be out from four to six weeks. With the Raptors up 25-23 after one quarter, Miles went 3 for 3 from 3-point range in Toronto's decisive second-quarter spurt. ""That was the key stretch of the game,"" Hoiberg said.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Dwight Howard couldn't suppress a wide smile when asked if he gained any personal satisfaction from his performance Friday night against his former Atlanta teammates. ""Uh, yeah,"" Howard said with a laugh. ""I just wanted to go out there and dominate -- and that has to be my mentality every night."" Kemba Walker scored 26 points, Howard was a major force inside with 20 points and 15 rebounds in his first home game with Charlotte, and the Hornets rallied to beat the Hawks 109-91. The Hornets trailed by as many as 20 in the first half, but used a 24-0 run in the third quarter to blow the game open. ""It was something special tonight and I'm glad we stepped up in the second half and got a good win,"" Howard said. Howard, who played last season for his hometown Hawks before being traded away one year after signing a three-year, $71 million contract, was unstoppable on the block. The 6-foot-11 eight-time All-Star used his strength to get great position down low and had his pick of shots close to the basket. The Hawks had nobody who could guard him consistently. Howard punctuated the win by grabbing an offensive rebound with an outstretched hand and then elevating for a powerful two-handed dunk that brought the crowd to its feet with 4 minutes left. Howard left to a rousing ovation with 2:10 remaining in the game. Walker, who excelled in the pick and roll with Howard all night, said he loved the way the big man played. ""He was extremely dominant tonight and it's a really good feeling to have him,"" Walker said. ""I'm glad he's playing well and hopefully we can continue to have him dominate games like that because we're gonna need it all year."" Charlotte turned the ball over 15 times in a sloppy first half and trailed 56-49 at the break. But the game changed with 6:32 left in the third quarter. Down 9, the Hornets held the Hawks scoreless for nearly 6 minutes while rattling off 24 straight points. They never trailed again. Some of the damage was self-inflicted by the Hawks, who missed easy shots, including an alley-oop dunk attempt by Dewayne Dedmon. ""We probably missed some open shots,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""On some plays our execution was good, and probably on others we need to improve."" TIP-INS: Hawks: Dennis Schroder had 25 points to lead Atlanta. ... Dedmon knocked down his first two 3-point field goal attempts early in the first quarter, the first 3's of the center's career. Hornets: Charlotte was without three starters from last year's team: Nicolas Batum (elbow), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (personal reasons) and Cody Zeller (knee bruise). Free agent pickup Michael Carter-Williams (knee) also sat out. ... Howard recorded his 668th career double-double, the most among active players. ... Bacon had 11 rebounds for Charlotte. ... Frank Kaminsky had 21 points. AND THE KISS: Howard was so happy with the performance that instead of arguing his fifth foul late in the game, he walked over and kissed official Eric Lewis on top of the head. ""In the old days I probably would have got a technical foul,"" Howard said with a laugh. ""That was an act of gratitude for not fouling me out tonight. So I gave him a little kiss on the head."" Asked about Lewis' reaction, Howard said Lewis told him, ""I'm gonna get you."" BEMBRY'S INJURY: Hawks guard/forward DeAndre' Bembry has a fracture in his right wrist. He will meet with team physicians from Emory Orthopaedics &amp; Spine Center on Monday. His status will then be updated, according to the team. NOTHING FREE: The Hawks didn't attempt a free throw in the second half, and some of that was because of Howard's defense in the paint. ""They were just five guys that collapsed and took away the paint and they make you shoot a lot of shots,"" Budenholzer said. ""I thought we had a lot of open 3-pointers and a lot of open looks. You have to make those against a team that is really going to crowd the paint.""","400974770"
"INDIANAPOLIS -- If the first two games are any indication of the type of team the Portland Trail Blazers will be in 2017-18, they've put the rest of the NBA on notice. Starting its season on the road, Portland has blown out its first two opponents by a combined 68 points, including Friday night's easy win over the Indiana Pacers. CJ McCollum scored 28 points on 12-of-18 shooting to lead the Blazers past the Pacers 114-96. With Indiana starting center Myles Turner out with a concussion, McCollum teamed with backcourt mate Damian Lillard to take advantage of an inexperienced Pacers interior defense. Lillard did most of his damage in the paint in the first half. McCollum picked it up in the second half, scoring Portland's final 12 points of the third quarter and giving the Blazers a 91-73 lead. ""Once I see it go in a few times,"" McCollum said, ""that basket gets a little bit bigger for me."" The Portland pair made it look easy at times as they drove to the basket against rookie T.J. Leaf and second-year player Domantas Sabonis. Lillard scored 11 of his 18 points in the first quarter, and the Blazers led 62-52 at halftime. Evan Turner scored 17 points off the bench, and his run of eight straight points in the second quarter helped the Blazers stay ahead with Lillard resting. Turner led a 15-3 run that allowed Portland to gain control. Lillard was especially pleased with Portland's defensive effort. ""We knew (the Pacers) had 140 on opening night,"" he said. ""But it's opening night, you're excited, it's the first game, you're on your home court and a lot of shots go in. But it's hard to do that twice -- score 140 points back-to-back in the NBA. We came in here ready to guard."" The Pacers hit seven of their first nine shots but finished the first quarter by making two of their final 12. Leaf and Victor Oladipo scored 17 points apiece for the Pacers. Darren Collison added 14 points. Oladipo said not having Turner was a key to Indiana's repeated defensive breakdowns. ""It was a little different today, just because Myles didn't play,"" Oladipo said. ""It is what it is. We'll learn from it and move on."" BIGGIE'S HOMECOMING Former Purdue standout Caleb ""Biggie"" Swanigan, Portland's first-round pick (26th overall), returned to Indiana in an NBA uniform for the first time. Last season's Big Ten Player of the Year was introduced to cheers and scored two points. He had eight points in Portland's season-opening win. NOT JUST A THROW-IN Sabonis, acquired in the trade that sent Paul George to Oklahoma City, earned his first start of the season. The second-year player had three points and eight rebounds in 29 minutes. He scored 16 points off the bench in the Pacers' season-opening win over Brooklyn. TIP-INS Blazers: Portland has won eight of its last 10 games against Indiana. ... McCollum saw his first action after serving a one-game suspension for leaving the bench during the Blazers' final preseason game. Pacers: After attempting 34 3-pointers in their season opener, the Pacers had 18 tries from beyond the arc on Friday, connecting on just four. ... The Pacers haven't started 2-0 since the 2013-14 season.","400974771"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Boston had an opening week it would love to do over: Gordon Hayward, its prized free-agent signing, was lost to a gruesome injury, and the Celtics lost their first two games. On the ropes against a 76ers team looking to prove ""The Process"" is more than a catchphrase, Kyrie Irving gave a glimpse why he may be the man in Boston that he so longed to be in Cleveland. Irving scored 21 points, Al Horford had 17 and the Celtics won for the first time since losing Hayward, 102-92 over Philadelphia on Friday night. The Celtics lost to Cleveland in their opener when Hayward went down with a mangled ankle that may cost him the season, and then lost to Milwaukee. Horford and Irving took over down the stretch to quiet a raucous 76ers' crowd in the home opener. Irving made the shots he needed to make in the fourth. ""C'mon, man. That's winning time, man,"" Irving said. Jayson Tatum scored 15 points and had Terry Rozier III had 14 to keep the Celtics afloat with a makeshift lineup. Boston snapped a tie game with an 11-4 run late in the fourth that steadied a franchise still reeling from Hayward's injury. Joel Embiid knows the feeling of missing an entire season. The Sixers center missed his first two NBA seasons with foot injuries and was limited to 31 games last year. Healthy and ready to play, Embiid had one of his worst offensive games as a pro, with 11 points on 4-for-11 shooting. He strayed from the low post and missed all six 3s in 28 minutes. ""They didn't do anything. I was open,"" Embiid said. ""All the 3s I took, I was wide open."" Moments after he checked in late in the third, Embiid drove past Horford for his first basket of the game and a 65-56 lead. Embiid missed his first eight shots -- he spent more time exhorting the fans to chant ""Trust the Process,"" -- before he gave the fans a real reason to cheer. He did grab 14 rebounds. Already playing short-handed, the Celtics wasted points with a 15-of-25 effort from the line through the third quarter. Aron Baynes slipped in for a tip-in at the horn when Embiid failed to box out that cut Philly's lead to 72-69. ""We're figuring out a lot of newness,"" Irving said. ""It's not always going to be perfect."" J.J. Redick led the Sixers with 19 points. Years of some of the worst basketball in NBA history have at last yielded a Game 7 enthusiasm for the Sixers. The Wells Fargo Center was sold out and fans tailgated in the parking lot hours before tipoff, giving it a Philadelphia Eagles feel. A few Eagles even showed up to ring the ceremonial Liberty Bell during pregame intros and fans whipped their giveaway T-shirts into makeshift rally towels as the arena rocked much like it did in the Allen Iverson era. ""This is gonna be fun tonight, but on behalf of the whole organization, my teammates and myself, we just want to thank you for all the support,"" Embiid told the crowd. ""I mean, it's gonna be a great season, so trust the process!"" Embiid, still looking to get his legs after seven months of inactivity, lumbered in an 0 for 5 first half. The 2017 No. 1 overall pick Markelle Fultz -- with a hitch in his free-throw shooting -- earned a rousing ovation simply for making shots from the line. Redick kept the Sixers in the game with three 3s that showed why the Sixers gave him a $23 million contract. Embiid's final shot of the half was a wild airball that was snared by Dario Saric and put back for the bucket and a 50-46 lead at halftime. ""We let one go,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. TIP-INS Celtics: Coach Brad Stevens said Hayward was released from the hospital. Hayward suffered a broken left tibia and dislocated ankle on opening night in Cleveland. ... G Marcus Smart sat out with an ankle injury. Baynes got the start. 76ers: Embiid said he has not been cleared to play back-to-back games and does not expect to be in the lineup Saturday at Toronto. ""I just want to feel like an NBA player,"" Embiid said. ""I feel like I'm not an NBA player because I can't play back-to-back."" HO-HUM HORFORD Horford missed 11 of 16 shots but hit three 3s and teamed with Irving to turn the tide for the Celtics. ""Already having Gordon out and then Marcus, who I believe is the soul of our team also being out, it put pressure on other guys to step up, and guys were able to answer,"" he said. ""For us, this was important."" A LIST Actor Samuel L. Jackson and director M. Night Shyamalan were at the game. Rapper Meek Mill also was at the game.","400974772"
"WASHINGTON --  Frustrated with their defensive effort for much of Friday night, the Washington Wizards made the key stops late. Otto Porter had a crucial strip of Avery Bradley, John Wall blocked Reggie Jackson's potential tying runner, and the Wizards emerged with a 115-111 victory over the Detroit Pistons. ""We showed glimpses of when we were good, but if we don't pick up defensively on the road, we won't win any games,"" Wall said. ""We got to figure out a way to get back to playing defense consistently."" Wall scored 19 of his 26 points in the second half and contributed 10 assists as the Wizards won despite giving back a 15-point fourth-quarter lead. Porter scored 20 of his 28 points in the first half to keep his team alive after it allowed 65 points before the break. ""We can't come out and get down 10, 11 points the way we did and have to fight and claw back,"" said Washington's Bradley Beal, who added 25 points. ""But it is a good sign that we're able to turn it around when coach jumps on our butt a little bit."" Jackson scored 21 points for Detroit, which gave back its own 12-point lead across the second and third quarters. Bradley added 18 as part of seven Pistons in double figures on a night both teams shot above 49 percent from the floor. The Pistons lost the turnover battle 18-15, and shot only 20 free throws to the Wizards' 35. ""Turnovers and fouls, that was the game,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""If they're going to shoot that many more free throws than we are and we are going to turn the ball over that many times, it's going to be hard to win anywhere, but especially on the road."" The Pistons stormed back to tie it at 102, and it was 106-106 before the Wizards pulled away. Beal drove the lane and converted a three-point play with 2:06 left, and then followed with a pull-up jumper to make it 113-108. Bradley answered with a 3 from atop the arc, but then was stripped by Porter in the lane when he looked to have a clear path to a tying layup. BLOCKING GUARD The Pistons had yet another chance denied when Wall soared to reject Jackson's runner. It was the All-Star point guard's second block of the game and the 326th of his career. ""It's just me playing defense,"" Wall explained. ""I think I'm the best shot-blocking point guard in NBA history, so I'm trying to set records. Just trying to make a play."" SPEAKING OUT Van Gundy used his team's trip to Washington to again voice his support for athletes who kneel during the national anthem and his opposition to President Donald Trump. ""I don't know what good can come out of anything the president has said,"" Van Gundy said. ""As far as the athletes' protest, I hope people would pay attention to the issues that caused the protest in the first place and realize that we have problem disproportionately with police brutality towards men of color.""

"NEW YORK --  Jeremy Lin was in the hospital Friday, rather than joining his teammates for their home opener. The Brooklyn Nets are going to miss him, but they showed they still have plenty of firepower without him. D'Angelo Russell, Trevor Booker and DeMarre Carroll all scored 17 points, and the Nets beat the Orlando Magic 126-121. Brooklyn had six players in double figures, three more with nine points and got 64 points from its reserves to bounce back after yielding 140 points Wednesday night in a season-opening loss to Indiana. Lin ruptured the patella tendon in his right knee late in that game and had season-ending surgery Friday morning. ""Honestly, that's our brother, so we don't want to forget that. You don't want to forget about him,"" Russell said. ""But going out there I feel like guys knew they had to step up and they did."" Coach Kenny Atkinson was frustrated with the Nets' play on both ends, though understood there would an adjustment as players got used to new rotations without their starting guard. ""But still, I think we can do a better job than we did tonight,"" he said. Booker added 11 rebounds and made the clinching free throws with 0.9 seconds left after Orlando's Evan Fournier missed a tying 3-point attempt. Nikola Vucevic scored a career-high 41 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for the Magic, who beat Miami in their opener. Fournier finished with 22 points and nine rebounds, and said he should have made his shot with about 2 seconds left. ""But we should have never been in that situation anyway,"" he said. ""We did too many mistakes defensively. We didn't get any stops down the stretch."" It was tied at 106 before Brooklyn's Joe Harris had consecutive baskets midway through the fourth quarter. The Nets stayed ahead from there, with Russell banking in a jumper while being fouled with 1:23 left after the Magic had closed within one. Allen Crabbe started for Lin and had nine points. Spencer Dinwiddie came off the bench and scored 16, while Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 15. TIP-INS Magic: Starting guard Elfrid Payton did not play in the second half because of a strained left hamstring. Forward Aaron Gordon missed the game with a sore left ankle. ""They had maybe their best player out, too. So we can't use the fact that we had two injuries,"" Vucevic said. ""Obviously missed those guys, but the next guy's got to step up. ... Vucevic's previous career high was 37 points, set on April 13, 2015, at Minnesota. Nets: The Nets said rookie Jarrett Allen was the second-youngest player to play for them at 19 years, 182 days. Derrick Favors, now with the Utah Jazz, was 19 years, 104 days when he debuted on Oct. 27, 2010. ... The game was the first of just 39 at Barclays Center this season.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Jamal Crawford couldn't even see the basket when he let the game-winning shot fly. Eighteen years in the league told him exactly where it was going. Crawford scored all 17 of his points in the fourth quarter and hit a 3-pointer with 27.5 seconds to go that helped the Minnesota Timberwolves hold off the Utah Jazz 100-97 in their home opener on Friday night. Andrew Wiggins had 21 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 20 points and 10 boards for the Timberwolves in their first victory of the season. The Wolves led by 10 with five minutes to go before former point guard Ricky Rubio rallied the Jazz. But Crawford buried a 3 from the corner, his third in the period from beyond the arc, to clinch the win. ""I've shot it so many times that I kind of knew,"" Crawford said. ""I just looked at the net when I was on the ground."" Rubio had 19 points, 10 assists and five rebounds in his first game back in Minnesota. Rodney Hood scored 20 points before leaving with a left calf injury, Derrick Favors scored 16 points and Rudy Gobert had 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Jazz. Rubio spent his first six seasons in Minnesota before being traded to Utah in July. He received a standing ovation from the crowd upon introductions before the game. He badly outplayed Jeff Teague, the point guard Minnesota jettisoned Rubio for, scoring 10 straight points for the Jazz in the final three minutes, including a free throw that put them up 96-95 with 55.6 seconds to play. ""Ricky's kind of stoic and shows a lot of poise and calm, but it's burning inside him and if you're around him you can feel that,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""I've seen that even before tonight."" Jimmy Butler hit a pair of free throws after Crawford's 3. Joe Johnson missed a desperation heave at the buzzer for the Jazz. For a Timberwolves team that led the league in blown leads last season, being able to outlast the Jazz was a welcome change of pace. ""We showed a lot tonight,"" Towns said, ""especially to ourselves."" TIP-INS Jazz: Hood left the game after an awkward step through traffic and could put no weight on his left foot. He will be evaluated when the team returns to Salt Lake City. ... F Ekpe Udoh had another strong performance with three points, four rebounds and three blocks in 15 minutes. ...

The building was closed for the summer as work was completed on a $140 million project that installed a new court, a gleaming new lobby and doubled the size of the home team locker room, which for years had been the smallest in the league. ""It doesn't even look like the same arena,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. TEMPERS FLARE Rubio got into it with Butler midway through the fourth when the two collided while heading up the court. Butler gave Rubio a little shove and then jawed at the Spaniard. Both were charged with technical fouls on the play, and a smiling Butler waved to the crowd to get them on their feet.

"DALLAS --  Buddy Hield's teammates often make fun of his rebounding tenacity during warmups. The second-year guard is always hustling to track down loose balls and working his hardest to make sure he gets as many shots as possible before the game. That's exactly what he did prior to the Sacramento Kings' 93-88 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. ""We always tell Buddy, stop being so hungry for the ball to get some shots up during warmups,"" Kings guard George Hill said. ""Let somebody else get some shots, so I guess today for him chasing down those loose balls in shoot-around and all that stuff in warmup lines paid off."" With 30.1 seconds remaining and the Kings holding a three-point lead, Hield tracked down an offensive rebound to extend a possession. He got the ball back to Hill, who knocked down a jumper with 16.1 seconds left to effectively put the game out of reach and secure the Kings' first win of the season. Hill also hit a big 3-pointer with less than two minutes to go and scored 21 points. Hield and Zach Randolph each had 13 points, and rookie point guard De'Aaron Fox added nine points and 10 assists as the Kings bounced back from a season-opening loss to the Houston Rockets. Harrison Barnes scored 24 points, 16 in the fourth quarter, as Dallas lost back-to-back games to begin the season. Fox, the fifth overall selection in this year's draft, was expected to go to head-to-head with fellow rookie point guard Dennis Smith Jr. But that matchup was squashed when it was announced an hour before the game that Smith, the No. 9 pick, was a late a scratch with swelling in his left knee. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said Smith won't play Saturday against the Rockets, but it wasn't a serious injury. ""It doesn't make any sense to rush through the weekend,"" Carlisle said. ""Doc checked him out, and we think he's going to be fine."" With Smith's injury and Devin Harris missing the game following the death of his brother, J.J. Barea started at point guard and had nine points and 10 assists for the Mavericks. Yogi Ferrell scored 14 off the bench. Dirk Nowitzki added 10 points, and reserve Dorian Finney-Smith had 14. Dallas pulled within two late in the fourth quarter, but Hill hit a 3-pointer with 1:25 remaining to give the Kings an 88-83 lead. Then Hill hit his late jumper to make it 91-86 after Hield had hustled and snagged that key offensive rebound. Sacramento outrebounded the Mavericks 41-29. Dallas kept it close with a 12-0 run to start the fourth quarter after Sacramento built a 71-60 lead at the end of the third. TIP-INS Kings: Jenny Boucek was added to the coaching staff as an assistant player development coach. Boucek last served as the head coach for the WNBA's Seattle Storm. ... Hill tied the game at 46 on a 3 with 0.1 seconds remaining in the first half. Mavericks: Carlisle said Harris could take as much time away from the team as he needed after his brother was killed in a car accident Thursday. ... G Gian Cavell was activated Friday with Smith unavailable. Cavell, who is on a two-way contract, had three points.

"PHOENIX -- In his second NBA game, Lonzo Ball earned his first victory and almost got a triple-double to boot. Ball, the No. 2 overall draft pick who doesn't turn 20 until next Friday, had 29 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists in the Los Angeles Lakers' 132-130 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night. ""The last game I shot six shots,"" he said. ""That didn't work out so well. Figured I'd try something else."" So he took 27 shots and made 12, finishing 4 of 9 on 3-pointers to go with his cache of assists and rebounds. Ball's career high in college was 24 points during his lone season at UCLA. ""Today I just had to do what I had to do to get the win. I had to shoot a few more shots. It doesn't take me long to learn,"" Ball said. ""It was my first time. Everybody is going to criticize me regardless of what I do, but the more I play, the more comfortable I get."" The Suns had a chance to tie it with 1.2 seconds to play, but T.J. Warren missed the first of two free throws. That meant he had to miss the second intentionally and hope for a rebound, but the Suns couldn't get a decent shot off before the buzzer. Ball took over down the stretch, scoring eight points in a 2 1/2-minute span. His final basket during that run, a floating layup, put Los Angeles ahead 130-122 with 1:35 to play. Veteran Phoenix center Tyson Chandler was impressed. ""He gets the ball down quick regardless of whether it's scores or misses, which puts a lot of pressure on the defense as far as getting back,"" Chandler said. ""He has a great feel as a young player for the game."" But the Suns came roaring back behind Eric Bledsoe and Devin Booker, who sank a 3-pointer with 6.4 seconds left to cut it to 131-130. Brandon Ingram made one of two free throws to give Phoenix one last chance, and Warren was fouled by Ingram on an inbounds play. The free throw was off the back of the rim, though, and the Lakers held on. Bledsoe scored 29 points, 17 in the fourth quarter. Booker also flirted with what would have been his first career triple-double, finishing with 25 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. Warren added 24 points, 17 in the second quarter. Ingram scored 25 points for Los Angeles. Both teams were coming off season-opening blowout losses. The Lakers lost to the Los Angeles Clippers 108-92, and Phoenix was routed by Portland 124-79, the most one-sided loss in Suns history and most one-sided season opener ever in the NBA. From the opening tip Friday, it was a fast-paced, often sloppy game with not much attention to defense. ""The hustle and fight from all of them, you've got to commend them,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""But if these two programs are the future of the NBA, there's no defense in the future."" Booker was called for a flagrant one when he fouled Brewer hard on a layup with 6:02 left in the third quarter. Larry Nance Jr. jumped into the fray and put a shoulder into Booker, who responded with a shove. Booker and Nance both were assessed technical fouls. The play came during a 13-2 Lakers outburst that put Los Angeles on top 95-85 after Nance stole the ball from Booker with both players on the floor and flipped the ball to Brook Lopez for a layup with 3:03 to play in the third quarter. The Lakers boosted the lead to 111-99 on Jordan Clarkson's basket with 10:28 to go. ""A lot to learn from that and great experience for our guys and obviously happy we came out with the win,"" Los Angeles coach Luke Walton said. ""It feels good. Let them feel some of that.

(0:15) TORONTO --  DeMar DeRozan fought off flu-like symptoms to give the Toronto Raptors their biggest-ever win over the Philadelphia 76ers. DeRozan scored 30 points, Serge Ibaka had 21 and the Raptors won their 10th straight home game over Philadelphia, routing the 76ers 128-94 on Saturday night. Kyle Lowry scored 17 points, Jakob Poeltl had a career-high 14 and the Raptors won for the 16th time in 17 meetings with the 76ers. The 34-point margin of victory was Toronto's biggest over Philadelphia, eclipsing a 32-point win on Nov. 9, 2014. DeRozan felt ill throughout the day and was sent home after the game without speaking to reporters. He made eight of 12 field goal attempts and shot 14 for 16 from the free throw line. ""We gave him a little more time to isolate tonight,"" Lowry said. ""You give him the opportunity to take his time and be patient he can pretty much get what he wants."" DeRozan scored 15 in the first, going 4 for 4 from the field and hitting 7 of 8 free throws, to give the Raptors a 36-19 lead after one. Toronto made 14 of 16 free throw attempts in the first, taking advantage of 11 Philadelphia fouls. ""He was getting to the paint, vaulting up, getting to his sweet spot, which creates offense within itself,"" coach Dwane Casey said. Ibaka had five 3-pointers and Lowry had four as Toronto shot 13 for 44 from long range. The Raptors finished 31 for 37 at the line. ""Our inability to not get tricked, to not bite on multiple up-fakes, is a discipline we have to improve on,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We need to stay ground-bound. We were poor tonight doing that."" Ben Simmons had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Jerryd Bayless scored 16 for the winless 76ers, who were playing the second game of a back-to-back. Philadelphia lost at home to Boston on Friday night. Justin Anderson had 12 points and Jahlil Okafor had 10 in his season debut. After starting Friday, 76ers center Joel Embiid (left knee) was not available against Toronto. The oft-injured Embiid has not been cleared to play the second game of back-to-backs. ""It's tough without Joel,"" Simmons said. ""We've got to learn to learn to play without him."" Embiid did not travel to Toronto, but is expected to rejoin the team for Monday's game at Detroit. Toronto's Jonas Valanciunas sprained his left ankle when he was fouled by Philadelphia's Dario Saric with two minutes left in the second. Valanciunas stayed in to shoot his free throws but was replaced about a minute later and headed to the locker room. He did not return. Casey said Valanciunas would undergo an MRI exam. Leading 62-49 at halftime, Toronto started the second half with a 10-2 spurt, including eight points from Ibaka. ""They jumped us, especially at the start of the third,"" Brown said. TIP-INS 76ers: Philadelphia committed a season-worst 20 turnovers. ... The Sixers have lost five straight road games dating to last season. Raptors: DeRozan scored more points in the first quarter (15) than he did in the entirety of Thursday's win over Chicago (11). ... Toronto made more free throws in the first (14) than field goals (10). BIG BEN According to Elias, Simmons is the first NBA player since Oscar Robertson with 10 or more points, 10 or more rebounds and five or more assists in each of his first three games.","400974778"
"CLEVELAND --  The Orlando Magic certainly know how to end a long losing streak. Nikola Vucevic scored 23 points and the Magic snapped a 17-game skid against the Cleveland Cavaliers, routing the defending Eastern Conference champions 114-93 on Saturday night. Orlando's players knew their first win over Cleveland since Nov. 23, 2012, was more than your typical early regular-season victory. ""This game had lots of positives, one of the most positives we've had in a long time,"" Vucevic said. ""I'm really happy for this team because we haven't had success against them for a while."" The Magic never trailed and built a 21-point lead late in the first quarter. Orlando led 36-18 after the first, hitting 14 of 24 from the field -- eight of them 3-pointers. Orlando made 17 of 35 3-pointers in all, and took their biggest lead, 106-69, midway through the fourth when both teams cleared their benches. LeBron James scored 14 points in the first quarter and finished with 22 as the Cavaliers lost for the first time in three games. ""They came out and gave us one from the beginning of the game and they kept it going,"" James said. ""We were a couple steps behind and they made us pay."" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue called timeout less than five minutes into the game when Orlando took a 15-4 lead. The Magic continued to build the margin, which reached 42-20 early in the second quarter on Bismack Biyombo's tip-in. They outplayed us,"" Lue said. ""They kicked our butt."" Cleveland trailed 56-45 at halftime and cut the lead to 65-58 midway through the third when James blocked D.J. Augustin's drive and Dwyane Wade hit a 3-pointer. The Magic answered with a 12-0 run, including a banked-in 30-footer from Augustin and two baskets by Vucevic. ""Last year, we probably would've crumbled when they got the lead down,"" Augustin said. ""We've got a lot of goals in mind this season, but we're staying humble."" Vucevic, a night after scoring a career-high 41 points in a loss to Brooklyn, was 11 of 16 from the field. Jonathon Simmons scored 19 points while Evan Fournier added 13 for Orlando. Iman Shumpert scored 21 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter, and Kevin Love had 18 for Cleveland. Derrick Rose missed the game for Cleveland with a sprained left ankle after being fouled by Milwaukee's Greg Monroe on Friday. ""They were far from their best and we understand that,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""We need to keep that in perspective."" THE REAL REASON Vogel called timeout after the Cavaliers cut the lead to seven in the third quarter. He joked his speech in the huddle keyed Orlando's surge that put the game away. ""I just inspired them during that stretch,"" he said. ""It was all me, really."" EXPANDING HIS GAME The 7-foot Vucevic hit 6 of 8 3s on Friday and added another against Cleveland. ""A guy makes six threes, you have to respect that,"" Lue said. ""If you put a smaller guy on him he can go to the block. If you put bigger guys on him he's able to pop and get off shots."" TIP-INS Magic: F Aaron Gordon (sore left ankle) did some work on the court before the game, but sat out for the second night in a row. ... G Elfrid Payton (strained left hamstring) did not play after being injured Friday at Brooklyn. An MRI revealed a mild to moderate strain. No timetable was given for his return. Cavaliers: Rose's injury moved Jose Calderon, the only other true point guard on the roster, into the starting lineup. The veteran was pulled five minutes into the game after missing two shots and didn't start the third quarter when Shumpert ran the offense. Calderon returned in the fourth quarter.","400974779"
"MIAMI --  The final horn sounded on the first Miami Heat home game of the season, and Dion Waiters walked toward midcourt with his hands held high over his head. He was celebrating, and relieved. Goran Dragic scored 23 points, Waiters added 19 and the Heat needed to scramble down the stretch to hold off the Indiana Pacers 112-108 on Saturday night. The Heat led by as many as 21 before seeing nearly all of that disappear in the final minutes. ""If you win by one, you got the win and that's all that matters,"" Waiters said. ""We shouldn't have put ourselves in that situation."" James Johnson scored 14 points -- including a pair of big free throws in the final seconds -- and Kelly Olynyk added 13 for the Heat. Josh Richardson added 12 for Miami. Victor Oladipo scored 28 points for Indiana, which got 18 from Domantas Sabonis and 14 from Thaddeus Young and Al Jefferson. The Pacers were outscored 37-19 in the second quarter to get into trouble, and nearly pulled off a comeback by outscoring Miami 32-21 in the fourth. ""Once we cut it down to 10 going into the fourth we were giving ourselves a chance,"" Young said. ""This game we showed our fight and our effort but we came up a little short at the end."" Oladipo's stepback 3 with 25 seconds left cut Miami's lead to 109-106, before Richardson made one of two free throws for the Heat to make it a two-possession game again. Cory Joseph's runner with 12.9 seconds left bounced off the glass and dropped to get the Pacers within two -- the closest the game was since the midpoint of the second quarter. But Miami escaped, and avoided an 0-2 start. ""When we built the lead our defense was active, our deflections, hands, multiple efforts, that was more in the direction of how we want to get to with our identity,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""In the fourth quarter, it was more our offense getting us in trouble."" A 13-0 second-quarter burst proved big for the Heat, with Olynyk scoring eight points -- including a pair of 3-pointers -- during that run. Tyler Johnson had a pair of assists in that spurt, and he took a pass from James Johnson for a dunk that put Miami up 61-47 late in the half. Dragic hit a 3-pointer to put Miami up 87-66 midway through the third. The Heat were outscored 42-25 the rest of the way. ""I thought we were a little winded in that first half but we got our second wind in the second half,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. TIP INS Pacers: It was the 17th time that Lance Stephenson played a game in Miami. His teams are 2-15 in those contests. ... Indiana's only other trip to Miami is early this year, coming on Nov. 19. ... Jefferson had eight rebounds in 14 minutes off the bench. Heat: Miami is 19-11 in home openers. ... Jordan Mickey became the 171st player in Heat history to start a game. ... James Johnson got the crowd roaring with a baseline dunk in the first quarter, elevating over and around Oladipo. ... The Heat now have tri-captains, with James Johnson and Dragic joining longtime captain Udonis Haslem -- who arranged for the team to have a suite at Sunday's Dolphins-Jets game for some bonding time. BIG INJURIES The Heat were without Hassan Whiteside (bruised knee) and the Pacers were without Myles Turner (concussion), so both teams were without their primary inside threat. Whiteside is being evaluated daily and the Heat haven't said when he'll return. Turner is in the NBA's mandated concussion protocol and is likely to see doctors on Sunday. HOME EDGE Road teams always struggle in Miami-Indiana games. Including playoffs, the Heat are 13-1 in their last 14 home games against Indiana -- while the Pacers are 11-1 in their last 12 home games against Miami.","400974780"
"NEW YORK --  Stan Van Gundy sees such a difference in his Detroit Pistons that he considered picking Andre Drummond to shoot a technical foul shot. He's not quite ready for that, but he's already convinced this team has what last season's lacked. ""I think that anybody watching us can see a difference from what they had seen a year ago in terms of the spirit and the energy and the fight,"" Van Gundy said. ""I don't think there's any doubt about that."" Tobias Harris scored 22 of his 31 points in the second half, and the Pistons erased a 21-point deficit to beat the New York Knicks 111-107 on Saturday night. Harris was one of the many Pistons who had little going to start the Pistons' second game in two nights, but they turned it around after halftime to spoil the Knicks' home opener and improve to 2-1 after going 37-45 last season. ""All throughout last year we weren't a good team on the road so it's been a big emphasis for us to be able to grind out games on the road, not give up and really just fight them out,"" Harris said, ""and that's what we were able to do tonight."" Kristaps Porzingis scored 33 points, but New York fell to 0-2 after losing to former Knicks star Carmelo Anthony and Oklahoma City in its opener. He thought he was fouled when Drummond blocked his shot with the Pistons up three in the final minute. ""It's good that I am able to be aggressive on the floor and score for my team,"" Porzinigis said. ""But a few of those plays at the end I got fouled."" Drummond had 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Pistons, who lost 115-111 in Washington on Friday and seemed to have little energy left early Saturday. But they were solid down the stretch, getting the tiebreaking three-point play from Reggie Jackson with 1:41 remaining. He closed it out with four free throws in the final eight seconds and finished with 16 points. ""We actually came to play,"" Jackson said of the difference in the second half. ""We wanted it."" Enes Kanter had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks, who played without rookie Frank Ntilikina, the No. 8 pick from France who sprained his left ankle in practice Friday. New York led 57-36 on Kanter's three-point play, but Detroit cut it to 64-51 at halftime and had a quick start to the third quarter after Van Gundy started veteran Anthony Tolliver, who hadn't played in the first two games. ""I told the guys, defense was great but it's got to be great for 48 minutes. It can't just be for a half,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""We'll get better at that."" TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond had his 230th double-double since entering the league in 2012-13, trying Pelicans center DeMarcus Cousins for most in the NBA during that span. ... The Pistons had lost their last four games in New York. Knicks: Kyle O'Quinn scored 15 points and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 14. ... Center Willy Hernangomez, an All-Rookie selection last season, didn't play. FREE THROWS FALLING Drummond was 3 for 3 at the line and has hit all six attempts this season after making under 40 percent each of the last three. Van Gundy overruled his assistants who wanted him to let Drummond shoot a technical, but he believes a player who was often fouled intentionally because of his poor percentage has corrected his form. ""He's going to shoot free throws well and so I'm actually hoping somebody will start grabbing him now,"" Van Gundy said. FRUSTRATED FRANK Ntilikina has battled injuries since not long after former team president Phil Jackson took him in the draft. He sat out summer league, and played little in the preseason. His latest injury came when he rolled his ankle when the Knicks were playing 4-on-4 at their practice facility, and Hornacek said it was easy to see the frustration in Ntilikina's face knowing he was hurt again.","400974781"
"CHICAGO -- The San Antonio Spurs aren't sure when Kawhi Leonard's season will start. Fortunately for them, there's another All-Star forward on the roster to carry the load. LaMarcus Aldridge had 28 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Spurs to an 87-77 victory over the Chicago Bulls in the Bulls' home opener. It was his second straight double-double after signing a three-year contract extension a day before the season began. ""I've been in a different mindset since the summer started,"" Aldridge said. ""That carried over to training camp to preseason to now. I don't think I've changed after the contract. My mindset coming into the season was to try to be more dominant."" Rudy Gay added 12 points for the Spurs, who have not provided a timetable for Leonard's return from a right quadriceps injury, though Popovich said it will be ""weeks rather than months."" In the meantime, they'll ride Aldridge, who scored 12 points in a 22-13 run that gave the Spurs a 63-51 third-quarter lead. ""They moved the ball better than we did,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I thought they shared it. They got more open shots than we did. I thought they did a great job. ""L.A. was just a difference maker for us, the way he scored. The defense in the second half and L.A.'s offense was what got us over. I thought they actually executed better than we did."" Robin Lopez had 16 points and seven rebounds for the Bills, also short-handed without power forwards Niko Mirotic (facial fractures, concussion) and Bobby Portis (suspension). Rookie Lauri Markkanen, thrust into the starting lineup because of an incident in practice Tuesday that ultimately sidelined both Mirotic and Portis, had 13 points and 12 rebounds. TIP-INS Spurs: Rookie guard Brandon Paul, who grew up in nearby Gurnee, appeared in his first NBA game, logging six seconds of action in the second quarter. The 26-year-old Paul, a former University of Illinois standout, was Mr. Basketball of Illinois as a senior at Warren Township High School in 2009. ... The Spurs shot just 40.9 percent from the field but held the Bulls to 37.8 percent. Bulls: Lopez made the first 3-pointer of his career in the third quarter. ... Justin Holliday scored 15 points, but shot 5 of 18 from the field. ... Denzel Valentine played after missing Friday's practice with knee soreness. He scored four points in 26 minutes. PORTIS APOLOGY Suspended Bulls forward Portis offered an apology to injured teammate Mirotic prior to the game in his first public comments since punching Mirotic in practice Tuesday and sidelining him for 4-6 weeks with two fractured bones in his face and a concussion. ""I want to publicly apologize to Niko,"" Portis said. ""I feel like I let my fans, the Bulls organization and most importantly my teammates down. This is not who Bobby Portis is."" Portis was suspended eight games. He said he has reached out to Mirotic but has not received a response. HIGH PRAISE Popovich was impressed with Markkanen. ""He's a wonderful player,"" Popovich said. ""He's aggressive. He's smart. Obviously he can shoot the basketball. He's just going to get better and better as he figures things out.""","400974782"
"HOUSTON -- James Harden and Houston Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni stressed Saturday night the importance of establishing a consistent defensive presence. Harden scored 29 points to lead the Rockets to a 107-91 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in the team's home opener on Saturday night. While Houston's hot shooting certainly helped, holding the Mavericks to 20 points or less in each of the first three quarters gave the Rockets plenty of breathing room. ""From the beginning of the game, defensively, we were locked in, and offensively, we made shots,"" Harden said. ""That's going to be our blueprint is making shots."" The Rockets were 18-0 when holding opponents to less than 100 points last season. Through the first three games, they're allowing 104.0 points per game, down from an average of 109.6 points last season ""I think we're trying to build a good defensive base,"" D'Antoni said. ""We're trying to understand where we're at offensively. I wish Chris (Paul) would be here so we can keep getting better. I'm happy where we're at, but we've got a long ways to go. But 3-0 is 3-0."" Playing without Paul, who is week-to-week with a left knee injury, Harden frequently bulldozed his way into the paint for layups while also keeping hot from beyond the arc. Harden made six of 13 3-pointers and added seven assists in 29 minutes. Houston improved to 3-0 for the first time since the 2014-15 season when it started 6-0. Dallas fell to 0-3 for the first time since the 2011-12 season, which followed their NBA title run in 2010-11. Without Paul, the Rockets started Harden and Eric Gordon in their backcourt, with Demetrius Jackson playing 18 minutes and scoring four points off the bench. Gordon had 18 points, while Clint Capela had 13 points and 10 rebounds, and Nene scored 14 points off the bench. ""We've got a long way to go, but this was a good start for us,"" Harden said. ""As we watch film, change thin-- gs and continue to get better, we'll move forward and figure out things we can get better at."" For the Mavericks, both Yogi Ferrell and J.J. Barea had 19 points, Harrison Barnes had 14 and Wesley Matthews 11. Dirk Nowitzki was held to just two points on 1-of-8 shooting in 19 minutes. While the Mavericks played mostly with a smaller, guard-heavy lineup, Houston played its lengthy, physical forwards and dominated the rebound category. Houston outrebounded Dallas 54-41, and the margin was much wider entering the fourth quarter once the game was out of reach. ""There's no excuse. We just have to go get the ball,"" Matthews said. ""Simple and plain we have to go get the ball. Nobody's walking through that door that's going to go grab us 25 rebounds a night. Collectively, we have to do it. It's as simple as that."" Nowitzki received a technical foul for shouting at an official early in the third quarter. Tasked with playing the role of the paint protector on defense, Nowitzki struggled at times to keep Houston from scoring inside. The Rockets outscored the Mavericks 50-30 in the paint. Houston outscored the Mavericks in each of the first three quarters by wide margins of 13, 10 and 11 points thanks in large part to red-hot shooting. The Rockets shot 47.6 percent from the field, going 13-for-31 (42 percent) from 3-point range. Houston led 62-39 at the half. ""We've got to regroup,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We have a day off tomorrow. We have to rest. On Monday, we have the World Champions coming in. It's not like it's getting any easier."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Rookie point guard Dennis Smith Jr. missed his second straight game with swelling in his left knee. Smith, the ninth pick in the NBA draft, had 16 points and 10 assists in his debut against Atlanta. ... The Mavericks were also missing guard Devin Harris, who was granted a leave of absence following the death of his brother Thursday. Rockets: After a 4-0 sweep of the series last season, Houston has won five straight games against Dallas, the longest streak since 1999-2000. The Rockets have won 11 of the past 14 games against Dallas. ... Rookie Zhou Qi made his NBA debut, playing seven minutes in the fourth quarter and posting three rebounds and one block.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Golden State Warriors not only lost to the Memphis Grizzlies, they lost their cool in the closing minute. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant both were ejected with 43 seconds left Saturday night, a fitting end to a frustrating night for Warriors in a 111-101 loss to Memphis. ""My pockets will be a lot lighter for sure,"" Curry said about the ejection after thinking he was fouled and throwing his mouthpiece. Durant may draw additional penalties after it appeared he possible made an obscene gesture to the Memphis crowd. Marc Gasol had 34 points and 14 rebounds, and the Grizzlies built a 19-point third-quarter lead over Golden State before holding on for the win. James Ennis III added 13 points, and Tyreke Evans had 12 as Memphis shot 47 percent compared to 39 percent for Golden State. The Warriors shot 12 of 38 from 3-point range. Curry led the Warriors with 37 points, and Durant added 29 and 13 rebounds. Curry scored on a layup with 43 seconds left to cut the Memphis lead to 107-99 -- as close as the Warriors got to Memphis in the fourth quarter. But Curry thought he was fouled on the play and threw his mouthpiece along the baseline, leading to immediate ejection, the first in a regular season game in Curry's career. ""My frustration boiled over, did something stupid, deserved to get kicked out and that's what happened,"" Curry said. But Curry denied trying to hit official Scott Wall with the throw. ""If I tried to throw it at him and hit him, I've got a pretty good aim,"" Curry said, adding he ""would have been able to execute that."" With Curry headed out, Durant also was arguing and crew chief Brian Forte sent him to the locker room. As Durant was walking out along the sidelines, the Memphis fans taunted him and screen shots of the broadcast showed him with an extended finger, although some though it was an extended ring finger. ""That's part of the game. It's fun,"" Durant said of the crowd reaction. ""They're heckling us, calling us names. .It's nothing personal or nothing serious."" A major portion of the Warriors anemic shooting came in the third quarter when the Golden State made only 6 of 22 shots. That led to 15 straight Memphis points and a 19-point Grizzlies lead in the latter stages of the third. Memphis outscored the Warriors 32-20 in the frame, holding an 88-71 lead entering the fourth. ""If we get stops, obviously you can run a lot more,"" Gasol said referencing Memphis' desire to play with a faster pace this year. ""It starts defensively. We have to get stops, and we have to be able to run and get them scrambling."" TIP-INS Warriors: Draymond Green played in his 400th career game. ... Thompson made a 3-pointer in the first quarter, marking his 57th straight game connecting from outside the arc. ... he Warriors had 20 assists, only the third time they have recorded 20 assists or less in a game since the start of last season -- two of those by Memphis. Grizzlies: Memphis defeated Golden State twice last season, one of only two teams to hang two losses on the eventual NBA champions. San Antonio also defeated the Warriors twice. ... The Grizzlies hold a 13-10 advantage over the Warriors since 2011-12. ... Memphis is 2-0, only the fourth time in franchise history the Grizzlies opened with a pair of wins. MORE ON FRUSTRATION: Kerr noted that when Curry threw his mouthpiece ""that's pretty much an automatic rejection. He was frustrated. We were all frustrated. It was a bad night all around."" BLOCK PARTY: Durant, who had a career-high seven blocks in Friday's win at New Orleans, had three against the Grizzlies, almost half of the Warriors seven in the game. HE SAID IT: When asked if he thought Curry would be suspended, Kerr tongue-in-cheek said it could be eight to 10 games. ""It was egregious. It was awful, it endangered people in the stands."" Then he added: ""You're asking the wrong guy. The league can figure that out.""","400974784"
"MILWAUKEE --  After scoring a career-high 44 points, Giannis Antetokounmpo wrote a note on the game ball. ""This is for daddy. We got a win tonight,"" the 22-year-old Milwaukee Bucks player said, remembering his father, Charles, who died last month at age 54. Antetokounmpo scored 17 points in the fourth quarter, including a dunk that put Milwaukee ahead 111-110 with 11 seconds to go. After a timeout, Damian Lillard found Jusuf Nurkic running open down the lane, but Antetokounmpo blocked his shot at the basket, sending the 7-foot center crashing to the floor. Antetokounmpo, starting his fifth NBA season, made 17 of 23 shots with eight rebounds and four assists as Milwaukee kept pace with a Portland team that had dominated its first two opponents. The Bucks star is averaging 38.3 points through three games, up from 22.9 last year, 16.9 in 2015-16 and 12.7 in 2014-15. ""Seventy-nine more. This is just the beginning,"" he said, thinking about how many regular-season games remain. After Nurkic was rejected at the basket, Khris Middleton was fouled and made both free throws. ""They committed two guys to Dame, so somebody was going to be open,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said, referring to Lillard. ""Turned out to be Nurk but they made a really good defensive play."" Lillard scored 26 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter. CJ McCollum also scored 26, and Nurkic had 17 points and 11 rebounds. Tony Snell scored 17 points and Middleton added 16 for Milwaukee. Portland trailed 108-101 when Nurkic sparked a 9-1 run with a pair of baskets. Lillard made a 3-pointer and then a pair of free throws to put the Blazers ahead 110-109 with 57 seconds left. ""I wish I could replay it, but it's tough when you lose,"" Nurkic said. Milwaukee used an 11-4 run midway through the fourth quarter to open a 106-99 lead on Malcolm Brogdon's fast-break layup off a bounce pass from Antetokounmpo. FRUSTRATING EVENING Portland's Evan Turner spent much of his 32 minutes on the court attempting to guard Antetokounmpo. ""I was comfortable with everything,"" Turner said. ""If I made him take 10 dribbles in the post, made him spin two or three times and he makes the shot, there's nothing you can ask for. He got on a roll, hit some jumpers, had a great night. I guarded him the same way every time."" BACK AND FORTH The game had 10 lead changes and was tied 15 times. DIFFERENT APPROACHES Portland made 11 of 27 3-point attempts. Milwaukee had 54 points in the paint to the Blazers' 26. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Stotts was the Bucks' coach from 2005-07 and was an assistant from 1998-02. Bucks: C Greg Monroe's foul on Cleveland G Derrick Rose on Friday night was upgraded by the league to a flagrant 1 from a common foul.","400974785"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic was looking for his teammates instead of his shot, and it worked out well for the Denver Nuggets. Paul Millsap had 18 points and nine rebounds in his first home game with Denver, Gary Harris scored 17 and the Nuggets used a strong defensive effort to beat the Sacramento Kings 96-79 on Saturday night. Kenneth Faried had 18 points and eight rebounds and Will Barton scored 15 points to help Denver win its home opener. Denver recovered from losing a fourth-quarter lead in Utah on Wednesday to get its first win of the season. ""Coming off a loss you always want to come out the next game and be aggressive,"" Barton said. ""We felt we had some lapses last game on the defensive end. We wanted to get into those guys and make them feel us."" Rookie De'Aaron Fox led the Kings with 18 points off the bench and was one of their few highlights. Sacramento struggled from the field was outrebounded 58-39. Willie Cauley-Stein led the Kings with nine rebounds but scored just two points on 1-for-5 shooting. Sacramento shot 36.5 percent from the field. ""We settled on first shots that were somewhat contested and somewhat open instead of driving the basketball,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""I thought we were slow and the fact they pushed around the floor was a factor and we are undersized at just about every position."" The Kings couldn't take advantage of a rough offensive night from Denver Jokic, who missed all three of his shots and failed to score. He finished with nine rebounds and seven assists. ""You don't have to score to be effective. There are only a certain amount of guys in this league who can do that and he's one of those guys,"" Millsap said. ""He's willing to sacrifice and try to get everybody else involved."" Jokic scored seven points against the Jazz, but coach Michael Malone isn't worried. ""He's not a one-trick pony. If he's not scoring he's facilitating for other people,"" Malone said. ""Teams are putting a lot of emphasis on him, and if teams want to settle on him we have Paul and we have Wilson (Chandler)."" The Nuggets missed their first eight 3-pointers and were 3 of 15 from long range in the first half but found their stroke in the third. Harris hit one as part of a 7-0 run and Barton drained two as Denver built a 16-point lead. ""We felt the lead slipping a little bit just like the last game, so we wanted to ramp it up and not let it slip,"" Barton said. ""Guys did a good job of stepping up and being aggressive, especially on the defensive end."" The lead grew to 21 in the fourth.

Jefferson signed a free-agent contract with Denver on Thursday after the team waived veteran guard Jameer Nelson. ... Chandler led Denver with 12 rebounds. SEASON OF CELEBRATION The Nuggets are marking their 50th year of basketball and started with a salute to six of the greats in team history. Former coach Doug Moe, whose 432 wins is most in franchise history, was joined by Dan Issel, David Thompson, Dikembe Mutombo, Byron Beck and Alex English. The former players and Moe had a private dinner Friday night, which Malone attended. ""My biggest joy was sitting down with Dan Issel and Doug More and listening to the old-school stories,"" Malone said. ""For them to come back in light of all they have done for this organization, it's tremendous.""","400974786"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder were the talk of the offseason after adding two more All-Stars to the roster. None of that mattered against a deep Utah Jazz team built to defend. Rudy Gobert had 16 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Jazz to a 96-87 victory over the Thunder. Utah didn't trail after taking a 13-12 lead in the first quarter. Oklahoma City's All-Star trio of Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony were bottled up in the first half by an active Utah defense. By the time George and Anthony got going, the come-from-behind climb was too steep. Anthony scored a game-high 26 and George added 22. Westbrook was held to six points on 2-for-11 shooting to go with 13 rebounds and nine assists. He was held to single digits just twice in the two previous regular seasons. ""We knew how dynamic those three guys can be,"" Utah's Joe Ingles said. ""We've seen them with their individual teams, but now putting it all together is probably a scary thing if they all get going. We tried to make them take tough shots ... contest every shot that we possibly could. ""We just did a really good job of keeping them in front of us and contesting shots."" The Jazz opened up a 38-19 lead in the in the second quarter thanks to a 27-7 run spanning the first and second quarters. Ingles scored 19, including five 3-pointers, and Derrick Favors continued his early-season success on the inside and the perimeter with 13 points. Ricky Rubio made plays for others and hit big shots to finish with 16 points. Gobert's double-double was his third in three games. ""We talked about trying to have energy tonight on the second night of a back-to-back,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Obviously, we had a really good night and the score reflected that. ""The NBA, no matter what you do, is a make-or-miss league. We were fortunate that they had some shots that didn't fall. When we didn't give them second shots, our defense was pretty solid. That's who we are. That's who we want to be. A defensively-minded club. The Thunder cut the lead to single digits on multiple second-half occasions thanks to George and Anthony, but never truly recovered from a horrid first half in which they shot 30.2 percent from the field and went 2 for 15 on 3-pointers. The Jazz answered with a run of their own each time, shot 49.4 percent for the game and never gave up the lead. ""When you have a new team coming together, it's different for everybody,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Paul, the way he scored in Indiana, is going to be different here. Same with Carmelo. ""Certainly, it is a work in progress. I've said that from the beginning. I'm not surprised."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City scored at least 26 points in each quarter of the season-opening win against the Knicks. It was held to 14 in the first quarter Saturday. ... Thunder cut the lead to 48-44 early in the second quarter, but never got any closer. Jazz: Rodney Hood did not play after suffering a mild left lower leg strain against the Timberwolves on Friday. Rookie Donovan Mitchell started in his place. ... Raul Neto made his debut after missing the first game with a hamstring injury and getting a DNP on Friday. ADJUSTING The Thunder transition with the additions of George and Anthony went smoothly in the season opener as those two and Westbrook combined for 71 points. Things didn't come as easy against the Jazz. ""It's different when you're accustomed to being a rhythm guy, having to create offense off the bounce and get yourself in a rhythm off the dribble,"" George said. ""Whereas the other night I was getting a lot of catch and shoots, so that rhythm is going to be a little different now. So just getting prepared for that, all the open opportunities that I'll have and now knowing how teams are going to play and adjust to Russ. ""It's an adjustment. It's no knock on it, but when you're used to having to create and getting yourself into a rhythm off the bounce, that's (how) you're used to getting in rhythm on shots. Now you're catching it without having to put it on the ground and you have to get your feet set ready for shots. It's definitely different. As the season goes on we should get a lot more comfortable.""","400974787"
"LOS ANGELES -- With two straight blowout wins, the Los Angeles Clippers like how they're playing. Blake Griffin had 29 points and eight rebounds, Patrick Beverley added 15 points and six steals, and the Clippers cruised to a 130-88 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Saturday night in their home opener. The Clippers are a revamped team this season with nine new players, but early signs are only positive. The defeated the Lakers 108-82 in their season opener. ""I like how the ball's moving, I like our pace,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""A lot of guys are handling the ball, a lot of guys are contributing."" The only bad news was watching new starting point guard Milos Teodosic have to be carried off the floor in the second quarter with a left foot injury. The Clippers said X-rays were negative, but Teodosic left on crutches and is scheduled to have an MRI on Sunday. There was little but bad news for the young Suns (0-3), who trailed by 14 at the half and then saw the Clippers open the third quarter with a 14-2 run to take complete command. ""We had a chance to take back into the lead to start the third quarter,"" Suns coach Earl Watson said. ""We had a chance to cut it to seven instead of 20. Once it hit 20 we could never bounce back."" Only two starts finished in double figures, Devin Booker scored 13 points and rookie Josh Jackson had 12 points. Reserve center Alex Len led Phoenix with 15 points. ""I thought we started out pretty well,"" Watson said. ""The third game in four nights, you never know what takes effect with a young team. At the same time, I'd like to see the fight be a little bit more. Or a lot more, until you know they're just fatigued."" TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix has the youngest team in the NBA. It is starting the season with four rookies and four second-year players. Forward Dragan Bender is 19 and three others are 20. Clippers: With nine new players this season, it figures to be a while before Rivers is certain exactly what kind of team he has. Said Rivers: ""I think I know this group and know their talent level. I don't know what kind of team we have yet."" TEODOSIC INJURED The Serbian who took over at the point for Chris Paul, was starting his second game. The 30-year-old rookie was a six-time all EuroLeague selection. After Gallinari missed a 3-point attempt, Teodosic came crashing to the floor near the far end line. He immediately grabbed his left foot/ankle area and motioned to the bench. ""It's definitely a foot injury but we don't know what it is,"" Rivers said. ""He's down because he obviously came over here to play basketball, not to be injured. So let's just hope he's not."" GRIFFIN ROLLING With three starters gone from last season's team, the Clippers figure to look more than ever to their power forward to lead the way. He seems eager to respond. ""It all starts with Blake offensively,"" said Clippers center DeAndre Jordan. ""We'll follow his lead. And he's playing great.""","400974788"
"NEW YORK --  The Brooklyn Nets thought their rebuilding phase was right on track when they signed Allen Crabbe to an offer sheet in the summer of 2016, only to see Portland step in and match it. After finally being able to acquire him in a trade with the Trail Blazers in July, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson is starting to see some of the intangibles that Crabbe's brings. The gamble, although delayed by a year, might have been worth it. Crabbe, who has been on a minutes restriction because of preseason injuries, came up big Sunday, scoring 20 points -- 10 in the fourth quarter -- to help the Nets beat the Atlanta Hawks 116-104. Crabbe had started the second game of the season Friday night with Jeremy Lin out for the season with a knee injury. Before the matinee meeting with Atlanta, the newcomer told his coach he was willing to come off the bench, with Caris LeVert getting the nod at shooting guard. ""He is the ultimate team guy, ultimate professional,"" Atkinson said. ""He said, `I'll come off the bench. That's better for my rhythm.' Everybody wants to start. To me it shows what kind of guy he is."" DeMarre Carroll  added 17, and Caris LeVert and D'Angelo Russell each had 16 points to help the Nets improve to 2-1 with their second straight victory. Marco Belinelli had 19 points for Atlanta. The Hawks have lost two in a row to drop to 1-2. Atlanta point guard Dennis Schroeder, who scored 17, went down with a left ankle injury with 3:37 left and had to be helped off the court. X-rays were taken, but the results weren't available. Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer was already thinking of who to pencil if his point guard is out for an extended time. He said Malcom Delaney and Josh Magette could see time there with Kent Bazemore stepping in as well. Brooklyn found a way to win once again without Lin, holding off the Hawks after leading by 16 points late in the third. The Nets led 98-87 with 7:47 go after a pair of free throws from LeVert. Atlanta then went on a 12-1 run, tying it 99 with on Belinelli's 3-pointer with 5:19 left. ""I think the last quarter we played well, everybody was aggressive, everybody was ready to help on defense,"" Belinelli said. After a Brooklyn timeout with 4:51 remaining, Carroll's block on Schroder's layup attempt ignited an 8-0 run that put the game out of reach for the Hawks. Russell, who had eight assists, fed Crabbe for a 3-pointer that made it 102-99. Following a free throw by Carroll and back-to-back 3-point misses by the Hawks, Russell whipped a pass across to the 3-point line near the Brooklyn bench as Crabbe unleashed another one, making it 106-99 with 3:47 to go. ""I told myself I just wanted to be a little more aggressive within the offense,"" Crabbe. ""They're giving me the green light to shoot the ball, so why not. It's not going to hurt me to get them up."" He made 7 of 12 shots in 25 minutes. After Carroll's free throw increased the lead 107-99, Ersan Ilyasova's layup cut it down to 107-101, the closest the Hawks would get. TIP-INS Hawks: The Hawks are opening with a five-game trip because of renovations at Phillips Arena. Nets: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson limped off court with 8:06 in first quarter due to an injury and returned with 4:14 left in the second. He quickly made a nifty layup, converting a three-point play. ... Brooklyn was held to 19 points in the first quarter after averaging 29.5 over their first two games. ... Rookie Jarrett Allen had a career-high four blocks off the bench in 14 minutes.","400974789"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Andrew Wiggins didn't have time to get near the basket for a final shot. Just inside halfcourt was close enough. Wiggins' desperation heave banked in as time expired to give the Minnesota Timberwolves a 115-113 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday night. ""I could see how much time was left,"" Wiggins said. ""I got as close as I could and let it go."" Carmelo Anthony had hit a 3-pointer with about five seconds left to give the Thunder the lead. The Timberwolves were out of timeouts, so they had to scramble. Taj Gibson inbounded to Wiggins, who rushed up the court and got free with help from a crushing pick by Karl-Anthony Towns before pulling up for the winner. ""Everything worked perfectly,"" Wiggins said. ""Taj found me. KAT had a great screen. When it left my hands, the release felt amazing."" Gibson said the Timberwolves practice those kinds of plays regularly. ""We practice it six times in practice every day,"" Gibson said. ""Once I got the ball, my job is to take the ball out, be patient, look for the open man, look for the guy running the baseline. I was trying to get Jeff (Teague), but Wig was wide open. KAT did what he was supposed to do, backscreen, and the rest is history."" Thunder forward Paul George got knocked down on Towns' screen, and it freed up Wiggins. ""I did see Paul go down, but I didn't have a great look to see how he went down and why,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""If it was an illegal screen, the officials will deal with that stuff. For me it's about focusing on our team and what we have to do and what we could have done differently."" Wiggins scored 27 points and Towns had 27 points and 12 rebounds for Minnesota (2-1). Russell Westbrook scored 15 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter for the Thunder (1-2), who were coming off a loss at Utah on Saturday night. Anthony scored 23 points and Steven Adams had 17 points and 13 rebounds. Minnesota led 61-54 at halftime behind 13 points from Towns and 10 from Wiggins. Adams scored 14 points before the break. The Timberwolves fought off several bursts by the Thunder and led 88-75 at the end of the third quarter. The Thunder opened the fourth quarter with a five-point run that led to a Minnesota timeout. Oklahoma City continued the surge and got the crowd back into the game. A three-point play by Anthony cut Minnesota's lead to 90-87 as Westbrook returned to the game from a rest. Adams converted a three-point play to cut Minnesota's lead to 106-105 with 1:50 to go, and a 3-pointer by Westbrook tied the game at 110. Minnesota hung tough, and Wiggins bailed out the Timberwolves. ""You take them any way you can get them,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""Great shot by a great player."" --- TIP-INS Timberwolves: Gibson, who started for the Thunder at the end of last season, had 11 points and 10 rebounds. ... Shot 57 percent in the first quarter to lead 28-23. ... Minnesota beat Utah at home on Friday. ... Jeff Teague scored 19 points and Jimmy Butler added 15. Thunder: Adams had eight points on 4-for-5 shooting in the first quarter. ... Raymond Felton and Jerami Grant each scored 12 points. QUOTABLE Towns on Wiggins' shot and the final sequence: ""Wig is amazing. He's been hitting that shot, weirdly enough, the whole offseason in practice. The one thing that came through my mind if I didn't catch it was to set a screen for somebody and just try to get someone one. I'm glad Wig was able to capitalize on it. We were able to escape with a win, especially with me not playing as well as I like to."" GEORGE'S STRUGGLES George has made just 23 of 62 shots this season. He scored 14 points on 6-for-20 shooting against the Timberwolves. ""I thought Paul got some really good looks, and it was just one of those nights where the ball didn't go in, but he impacted the game other ways defensively,"" Donovan said. ""I'm not worried about him shooting because he's such an elite shooter.""","400974790"
"LOS ANGELES --  The New Orleans Pelicans were watching another double-digit lead evaporate, with the Los Angeles Lakers using a furious 27-4 run to take a five-point lead. This time, the Pelicans were ready for the challenge. They answered with an 11-0 run of their own to beat the Lakers 119-112 on Sunday night for their first victory of the season. ""We have to stop letting off the gas when we have big leads,"" said New Orleans center DeMarcus Cousins. ""This is something we've done the previous two games and we're trying to stop it on the fly."" The Pelicans (1-2) were able to ward off the challenge from the Lakers (1-2) behind 27 points and 17 rebounds from Anthony Davis, and 22 points and 11 rebounds from Cousins. ""We started off the game playing well,"" said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who earned his 400th career victory. ""Then in the third quarter, our transition defense just wasn't good."" The Lakers' late rally was led by reserves. Jordan Clarkson topped Los Angeles with 24 points, while Kyle Kuzma added 20 points to match guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Lakers prized rookie Lonzo Ball struggled with his shot (3 of 13) and finished with just eight points, but did contribute 13 assists and eight rebounds. ""I like Lonzo's aggressiveness, he just didn't make shots,"" said Lakers coach Luke Walton. The Lakers missed their first eight shots of the game, falling behind by double digits early. New Orleans went up by as many as 22 in the second quarter and was still ahead 94-74 when the Lakers went on their run. Clarkson and Kuzma scored the last nine points of the third, and then with reserves Julius Randle and Josh Hart aiding the comeback, outscored the Pelicans 18-4 to open the final period. ""We let them back in the game, and that's on us, but we kept fighting,"" Davis said. New Orleans trailed 110-106 with 4:46 to play when it answered with its 11-0 run. E'Twaun Moore (19 points) and Cousins sparked the comeback, with Jameer Nelson -- just signed Sunday -- hitting a key 3-pointer. ""I think he already earned his contract,"" Gentry said. ""He made the biggest shot of the night."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Signed Nelson, 35, and waived Jordan Crawford. Gentry said the team was uncertain if Nelson would be worked into the starting lineup alongside Holiday, or back him up at the point. ""We've looked at it and can see both situations being real positive for our team. It's just a matter of us getting together again and thinking it out and seeing what we feel will be the best,"" Gentry said. Nelson was waived by the Nuggets last week. Lakers: Caldwell-Pope was available after serving a two-game suspension for an arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence. Said Walton: ""He's one of our better shooters. He knows personnel, he's a great defender. He does a lot of things for us and we're excited to have him back."" . F Luo Deng, signed prior to last season to a four-year, $72-million deal, was again not activated. GET BACK Gentry felt the Pelicans let up their intensity level and let the Lakers back in the game when they led by 20 late. The Lakers had struggled to run, but suddenly found their fast-break game. Gentry said the answer was easy. ""Yeah, running back,"" he said. ""It's pretty simple. ""We did for most of the game, but there was a stretch there we did not.""","400974791"
"DETROIT -- Four games into his NBA career, Ben Simmons already has a triple-double to his credit. And with some help from Joel Embiid, he finally led the Philadelphia 76ers to a victory. Simmons had 21 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, and Embiid scored 30 points to lift the 76ers to a 97-86 win over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night. Detroit, which rallied from a 21-point deficit to beat the New York Knicks on Saturday night , fell behind by 21 again in the second quarter against the 76ers. The Pistons chipped away and were within three in the fourth, but Philadelphia held on. ""It's awesome to have a triple-double, but at the same time, it's even better to have a win,"" Simmons said. Simmons was the No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft before missing all of last season with a foot injury. He finished two assists shy of a triple-double at Toronto on Saturday night, and his skill and versatility were evident in Detroit. Philadelphia never trailed. It was 56-43 at halftime and 75-67 after three quarters before the Pistons cut the deficit to three on a 3-pointer by Anthony Tolliver. The teams traded baskets for a bit before a three-point play by Robert Covington and 3-pointer by T.J. McConnell put the 76ers up by nine. Detroit trailed by four after a 6-0 run late in the fourth, but an awkward-looking hook shot by Andre Drummond missed everything, and the 76ers were able to close out the game. ""It's mind boggling to have two games in a row where we weren't ready to play. We have to figure out a way to fix that, whether those five guys can boost the intensity or if we have to change the lineup,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""I'm going to take the blame for Simmons. I'm not saying the players couldn't have done things better, but we didn't have a good game plan for him."" Drummond had 14 points and 14 rebounds for the Pistons. TIP-INS 76ers: Simmons had double-doubles in his first three games, but Philadelphia lost them all. Pistons: Drummond moved into sixth place on Detroit's career rebounding list, passing Walter Dukes. Drummond is now four shy of 5,000. ... All Detroit starters scored in double figures except Stanley Johnson, who went without a point. Reggie Jackson had 16 points and seven assists. SLIPPERY This was the second Pistons game at Little Caesars Arena, the new downtown venue they share with the Detroit Red Wings. The people mopping the floor were pretty busy trying to keep it dry in the second half, and 76ers coach Brett Brown said he was glad nobody was hurt. ""You can appreciate our reaction when you see Joel Embiid slip and slide and then hold his knee,"" Brown said. ""And then 30 seconds later, Jerryd Bayless goes down and starts holding his hip. We've experienced a lot of injuries. It's not anybody's fault. It just happened. There was a wet part of the floor and we were lucky to get away without any injuries."" Embiid (left knee) sat out the game at Toronto. He shot 11 of 15 from the field against Detroit, although he did turn the ball over seven times. NEW FACILITY The Pistons and Henry Ford Health System broke ground on a new complex a couple miles north of Little Caesars Arena that will house a training facility and corporate headquarters for the franchise.

"MIAMI --  Josh Richardson did a little of everything for the Miami Heat, and he earned a Dwyane Wade comparison in the process. Richardson scored 21 points, Wayne Ellington made six 3-pointers in the second quarter and the Heat wasted a 21-point lead before recovering to beat the Atlanta Hawks 104-93 on Monday night. Richardson had driving layups on back-to-back possessions in the final minutes, when the Heat went on a 17-6 run that decided things. ""J-Rich gets it done, on the offensive end and especially on the defensive end,"" Ellington said. ""He's huge for us. He's a leader out there on the floor. He's really evolving, his game's evolving, he's getting better every day. He's becoming the type of player he's definitely capable of being."" Ellington scored 20 points and Goran Dragic finished with 19 for Miami, which started 14 of 24 from 3-point range -- and then went 0 for 13 the rest of the way, yet prevailed anyway. Richardson had eight of his points in the fourth for the Heat. Plus, he was stellar again on the defensive end with two steals and two blocks. ""What didn't J-Rich do tonight?"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He was great defensively. Those were the type of plays at the rim that we had a former 2-guard here make, those kind of blocks. There's not many 2s in the league who can make those kind of plays."" Kent Bazemore and Taurean Prince each scored 20 for the Hawks, while John Collins had 14 points and 11 rebounds off the bench for Atlanta. The Hawks went on a 33-12 run in the second half to tie the game at 77, but never got the lead down the stretch even as Miami went from sizzling to icy in an instant. ""It's rare that a team stays that hot for so long,"" Bazemore said. ""We stayed the course. We came out in the third quarter and gave them a good punch to start the third. The biggest thing from tonight is we stayed steady, kept plugging away and gave ourselves a chance."" It looked like a rout early. Ellington's six 3s in the second quarter tied a Heat player record for 3-pointers in any quarter, alongside only Brian Shaw in 1993, and tied the team mark for 3s in a half. Miami's 13 first-half 3s set a franchise record, for any half. The Heat led by double digits for most of the second quarter, took an 18-point lead into halftime and stretched it to 21 when Dragic got the third quarter started with a 3-pointer. Exactly 12 minutes later, it was tied -- but the Heat escaped. ""We found a way to scrap our way back,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. TIP-INS Hawks: Bazemore scored Atlanta's first seven points, and was the only Hawk to score in the first 7:13. ... Former Heat forward Luke Babbitt made his first four shots, including a 3-pointer right in front of the Miami bench. ... Belinelli went over the 15,000-minute mark for his career.

"HOUSTON -- In a game that he dominated offensively, Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol said it was the team's defense that helped the most in the wild come-from-behind win over the Houston Rockets. Gasol scored 26 points to lead the Grizzles to a 98-90 win in Houston on Monday night. Memphis has won its first three games for the first time since the 2014-15 season when the team won its opening six contests. Memphis allowed just two points in the final six minutes and ended the game on a 20-2 run. ""At the end of the game, not allowing them to score, that's a great way to finish,"" Gasol said. ""When you can trust that your defense is going to be there at the end of the game, you don't have to put as much pressure on your offense."" With the game tied at 88 with less than three minutes remaining, tempers flared after Memphis guard Mario Chalmers fell to the ground and tripped James Harden, who then shoved Chalmers as he tried to get off the ground. After a lengthy review, both players received technicals and Harden was called with an offensive foul. Memphis guard Mike Conley said Chalmers' scrappiness provided a spark for the Grizzlies. ""He embodies what we are and for that to happen at that point of the game, it got everybody going,"" Conley said. ""It got everybody believing that, 'Hey, we belong here, we're supposed to be here, and this is our chance to win the game.'"" On the following play, James Ennis III made a shot where he was fouled and converted the free throw to put Memphis up three. After Clint Capela's dunk, Conley hit a 3 to push the lead to 94-90. Conley struggled for most of the game, shooting 3-for-10 from the field and scoring nine of his 17 points at the free throw line, where he was perfect. But he came on huge for Memphis down the stretch, making key shots and getting pivotal assists. ""They did a good job of defending and switching -- every shot I took was a tough shot up until the fourth quarter,"" Conley said. ""In close games, there's a job to be done, and you just have to go out there and do it."" For most of the game, it was Gasol who gave Houston fits. Whether he was overpowering Capela or shooting over smaller forwards, Gasol found a rhythm, making eight of his 15 shots and going 10-for-10 from the free throw line. When told he had five dunks in the game, Gasol said, ""That's four too many."" On Eric Gordon Bobblehead Night where he was presented with his Sixth Man of the Year Award in a pregame ceremony, the veteran guard was ironically a starter in the game. Gordon led the Rockets with 27 points. Harden finished with 22 points, eight assists and five rebounds. Houston was held to 90 points, three less than their season low of 93 from all of last season. ""Our bodies weren't popping and moving like we normally do,"" Harden said. ""We didn't make shots, obviously. They played pretty good defense, but we just didn't pop when we needed it."" Houston led 57-50 at halftime. The Rockets held a lead as big as 12 points in the second half, but the Grizzlies got hot midway through the fourth quarter. OFF-SHOOTING NIGHT The Rockets made just nine 3s on 23.7 percent shooting. Houston was 1-8 when making less than 10 3s last season. ""Obviously, we forced some up -- some were good and didn't go in,"" Rockets head coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We have to improve. We've got to get better, and I knew it was going to be a tough game."" BOO BIRDS: Forward Chandler Parsons was booed heavily by the Toyota Center crowd when he first took the floor.

Antetokounmpo had 32 points and 14 rebounds, and the Milwaukee Bucks scored the final nine points in a 103-94 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night. The reigning Eastern Conference player of the week was 13 for 21 from the field and 6 for 8 at the line. He also had six assists and blocked two shots. The 22-year-old Antetokounmpo has scored at least 30 points in each of his first four games. He had a career-high 44 points Saturday against Portland. ""I mean, we need him to play like this,"" Middleton said. ""He's a match-up nightmare for everybody. The more we can play for him, the more that he relies on us too, the easier the games are going to be for us."" Middleton added 20 points for Milwaukee, which played its third game in four days, all at home. Charlotte, which missed its last seven shots after the score was tied at 94, was led by Frank Kaminsky's 18 points. Jeremy Lamb added 17 points, Kemba Walker had 15 and Dwight Howard grabbed 22 rebounds -- three shy of the team record. Antetokounmpo's two free throws gave Milwaukee a 96-94 lead with 1:34 left. Charlotte missed two 3-pointers on its next possession and Middleton made a 3 from the top of the arc with 43.5 seconds to go. Howard missed two foul shots with 33 seconds remaining to finish 0 for 9 from the line, but Charlotte caught a break when the rebound was tapped to Lamb. But he missed a shot after driving through the lane. Antetokounmpo sank two more free throws, Walker shot an air ball from long range and Middleton capped the scoring with two free throws with 16.2 seconds left. ""I thought the guys executed their sets offensively and I thought they were patient,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""Sometimes we can get in a rush and take that first shot because it's wide open but turning down a good shot to get a great shot, those are what the good teams do in this league, and I thought that's what we did tonight."" A floating shot by Middleton gave Milwaukee a 90-81 lead with 7:49 left. But Charlotte responded by scoring the next seven points, and shortly after tied the score at 94 on a 3-pointer by Kaminsky with 3:05 remaining. But the Hornets were shut out from there. ""It was terrible offense,"" Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. ""The second half, it is just not going to work in this league."" SCOUTING REPORT Antetokounmpo's 147 points through the first four games are the most in team history. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 146 in 1970-71. ""We played Friday, so Saturday you start watching (film on Milwaukee), and you sit and enjoy his greatness,"" Clifford said. ""It's not just his size and athleticism, he has an energy level and a flare and a passion for playing that is fun to watch. Then ...  you're like `What are we going to do?' That happens a lot in this league, but certainly he's one of the guys that you enjoy watching."" INJURIES APLENTY Charlotte announced before the game that guard Julyan Stone will miss four to six weeks with a strained left hamstring. He got hurt in practice Sunday. Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon also did not play because of a left ankle sprain. It is uncertain how long he will be out. TIP-INS Hornets: Howard became the first Hornets player with three straight 15-plus rebound games since Al Jefferson in 2014. Bucks: Milwaukee attempted just three free throws in the first half, compared to 22 for Charlotte.","400974795"
"DALLAS --  Stephen Curry swished a floating one-hander and went to the floor after some contact, looking for a call that wasn't coming. This time, the Golden State star smiled and ran the other way. Curry scored 29 points, Kevin Durant added 25 and the Warriors pulled away from the winless Dallas Mavericks in the second half of a 133-103 victory on Monday night. Klay Thompson had 21 points as the defending champs got back to .500 four games into the season, two nights after losing their cool late in a loss at Memphis. Curry was at the center of it, getting fined $50,000 for throwing his mouthpiece on a non-call in the final minute against the Grizzlies. There wasn't much reason to get worked up this time, even after an 18-point lead early in the second quarter was cut to one before halftime. Golden State never trailed in its seventh straight win in the series. ""I actually kind of liked that we struggled there for a while because we were making the same mistakes, turnovers, not talking on defense and not boxing out,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""It's good that we responded and turned it around in the second half."" Curry made all five of his shots inside the 3-point line while going 2 of 10 beyond the arc. The most damage was at the line in his third straight game with at least 10 attempts. The two-time MVP was 13 of 13 and has made all 39 free throws this season. ""Been trying to finish at the rim, had people close out real hard on 3-point attempts,"" Curry said. ""Rest of it's just being in the right place at the right time and trying to put pressure on the defense, whether it's with my shooting and spacing ability or driving to the lane."" Thompson had consecutive 3-pointers to cap a 15-2 run that turned a two-point lead into an 83-68 advantage in the third quarter, sending Dallas to its second straight 0-4 start. The Mavericks lost a franchise-worst five straight to start last season. Wesley Matthews scored 19 points for the Mavericks. Harrison Barnes had 13 points against his former team, matching J.J. Barea and Yogi Ferrell. Rookie Dennis Smith Jr. had 10 points after missing two games with left knee swelling. ""We can't put ourselves in the hole,"" Smith said. ""We bounced back into halftime we almost tied it. That was just effort. We've got to come out that way."" Durant was 9 of 15 from the field and 4 of 6 from beyond the arc as the Warriors shot 56 percent. The Mavericks trailed 42-24 early in the second quarter before Matthews made all four shots, including a pair of 3-pointers , in a 10-point quarter. Dallas was twice within a point but never had a chance to take the lead. Curry hit two free throws for a three-point halftime lead, then made one before play started in the second half when the Mavericks were called for delay of game. TIP-INS Warriors: Curry became the eighth player to reach 20,000 career minutes for Golden State in the first quarter. ... The Warriors improved to 34-7 after a loss under Kerr. ... Curry and Draymond Green had eight assists apiece. Green scored 10 points with seven rebounds. Mavericks: Curry's younger brother, Mavericks G Seth Curry, has missed all four games with a stress reaction in his lower left leg. Coach Rick Carlisle ruled him out this week. ... G Devin Harris missed his third straight game since his older brother, Bruce Harris, was killed in a car wreck in Dallas last week. TOO MUCH SHOW With the game out of hand in the final minutes, Golden State rookie Jordan Bell was free on a breakaway and bounced the ball off the backboard before dunking it. Kerr told Carlisle after the game that he said something to Bell about not showing up an opponent. ""That was a bit much, but it was just a rookie being a little excited there I guess. That's on us,"" said 39-year-old Dirk Nowitzki, in his 20th season with the Mavericks. TAMPERING? In the spirit of Curry's fine, Kerr recalled the time he was fined as Phoenix's general manager when LeBron James was a free agent before going to Miami in 2010. He was asked on a radio show if the Suns would sign James. ""I laughed and I said, `Yeah, if he'll take the minimum. We don't have any cap room.' Ten grand, wrote a check the next day. They didn't like humor I guess. Tampering. And LeBron was close too. I really think he might have come there for minimum. It just didn't work out.""","400974796"
"SAN ANTONIO -- The Spurs are without their two main leaders from last season, but they are not lacking in direction. Resurgent forward LaMarcus Aldridge and second-year player Dejounte Murray continue to lead the way as San Antonio remained unbeaten by fighting past Toronto. Aldridge had 20 points and Murray had 16 points and 15 rebounds and the Spurs held on to beat the Raptors 101-97 on Monday night. ""Just an overall good win against a really well-coached, disciplined team that has a lot of expectations,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""It's good for our confidence since we're trying to put some things together."" The Spurs are missing leading scorer Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker, who are both rehabilitating from quadriceps injury. San Antonio has struggled to find an offensive flow without their veterans, but Murray is attempting to step into the void in just his second season. ""I just want to win,"" Murray said. ""I got that winning in my (inside) and in my DNA. I just do anything to win. If I don't score a point, I'm going to go rebound. If I don't rebound, I'm going to try facilitate or I'm going to try to play defense. That's the thing that you've got to have."" San Antonio needed that grit from the 21-year-old point guard in slugging through a physical game. Both teams were assessed 20-plus fouls and Aldridge and Serge Ibaka received technical fouls after an altercation with 3:36 remaining in the game. The two got tangled battling for position under the rim when Ibaka threw an elbow into Aldridge's midsection. Aldridge would push Ibaka before the two were separated. Murray showed his growing comfort with a leadership role by taking Aldridge aside. ""I just told him, 'You're on another level, don't worry about that, keep playing your game,' "" Murray said. ""He's having a hell of a year and he's having fun. I told him, `Don't worry about that. Let's move on, let's win this game.' "" Aldridge responded minutes later by drawing a sixth foul on Ibaka. Aldridge shouted in celebration and glared at a fallen Ibaka after driving to the basket and scoring on a layup to give San Antonio a 97-87 lead. ""It just kind of woke me up a little bit,"" Aldridge said. ""It got the team awakened. Guys just kind of picked it up."" The Spurs were able to overcome a season-high 20 turnovers. They were averaging 11 turnovers in their first two games, but had four in the opening four minutes. Toronto took advantage, keeping the game close despite being outrebounded 56-33 as it played without injured center Jonas Valanciunas. ""We played great defense, but we've got to realize with that don't let it go to waste by giving up offensive rebounds to the team,"" DeMar DeRozan said. ""That's something we definitely can take from (this game)."" DeRozan had 28 points and Ibaka had 13 before fouling out as the Raptors lost their first game of the season. TIP-INS Raptors: Valanciunas missed his first game with a sprained left ankle. There is no timetable for his return, but the 7-footer said he expects to play during the team's current six-game road trip. ... Toronto, San Antonio, Golden State and the Los Angeles Clippers are the only teams with at least 48 wins in each of the past four seasons. ...

"DENVER -- Scott Brooks took what basically amounted to a late-game charge. That's right, the coach of the Washington Wizards. Brooks stepped onto the court after a timeout with 32 seconds remaining and was bumped into by Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic, who was on his way to the bench. Jokic was assessed a technical foul in a strange occurrence that helped the Wizards to a 109-104 win Monday night. ""That's something you don't do,"" Wizards star John Wall said. ""No matter what's going on between the players or teammates, that's something you don't do to a coach. It's like me calling a coach a certain name. But hopefully he'll apologize."" Whether it was intentional by Jokic -- or even embellished on the part of the Wizards coach -- depends on who's asked. ""It was an awkward, weird situation. I don't think [Jokic] did it on purpose, but it happened,"" Brooks said. ""I've never had that happen before."" Bradley Beal made the technical free throw, increasing the Wizards' lead to 105-102. Beal then sealed the victory with a driving layup. After the game, Jokic said he was upset about being pushed from behind just before the timeout and was just making his way back to the Nuggets' bench. ""I tried to look at the score and hit ... the coach,"" Jokic said. ""I'm sorry because I put my team in a bad position."" Jokic's coach had his back. ""I just watched it 10 times. Nikola said he didn't do it intentional,"" Michael Malone said. ""Nikola is walking off the court. Scott Brooks is walking on the court. There's contact made. It was embellished a little, to be honest, I think. ""I don't think it was intentional either. Scott Brooks is a very good coach and a good guy. Things happen in the heat of the moment you can't always explain."" In an interview with a pool reporter, crew chief Derrick Stafford said the officials assessed a technical because Jokic ""intentionally walked into Scotty Brooks on his way to the bench."" Beal scored 20 points as all five Washington starters reached double figures. Wall finished with 19 points as he struggled from the floor (3-of-13) but made up for it on the free throw line (13-of-15). He added 12 assists as the Wizards improved to 3-0. Otto Porter Jr. had 17 points and 10 rebounds. Jokic broke out of a scoring slump with 29 points. His running layup early in the first quarter ended a string of six straight quarters without a point. ""I scored, and we lost. Maybe it's better for me to not score,"" Jokic said. TIP-INS Wizards: F/C Jason Smith missed the game in his home state with a sprained right shoulder. Smith grew up in nearby Kersey and went to school at Colorado State. ""He's been wanting to play well and hit 17 3s against them, but it's not going to happen tonight,"" Brooks said. ""He will have to save it for next year."" ... F Markieff Morris missed the game as he recovers from sports hernia surgery. ... Kelly Oubre Jr. had nine of his 14 points in the fourth quarter.

"PHOENIX --  On his way out of Phoenix's locker room Monday night, Devin Booker popped his head into the coaches' office to congratulate interim coach Jay Triano. The Suns had a perfect response to a rough time for the franchise. Booker scored 22 points, including two free throws with 9.8 seconds to play, and Phoenix beat the Sacramento Kings 117-115 for its first win of the season in its first game under Triano. Booker called Monday a must-win game. Phoenix fired coach Earl Watson on Sunday and guard Eric Bledsoe was sent home Monday morning after he sent out a tweet over the weekend that left the impression he no longer wanted to play for the Suns. ""Everything that happened in the last 24 hours should have been eye-opening to us,"" Booker said. ""I'm proud of the team how we responded. Came out and fought."" Phoenix shot 54.5 percent from the field and held on after Sacramento rallied in the final period. Marquese Chriss scored 19 points, and Mike James finished with 18 in his first career start. ""I'm happy for our players,"" Triano said. The Kings have dropped three of four to begin the season. Garrett Temple matched a career high with 23 points, and rookie De'Aaron Fox had 19. The Suns led by double digits for much of the fourth quarter, but Temple hit back-to-back 3-pointers to make it 112-110 with 1:20 to play. Then Fox tied it with a layup. James looped a high-arching left-handed layup over two defenders with 14.8 seconds to go, putting the Suns back in front. Temple drew a foul at the other end but made one of two free throws, and the Suns' Troy Daniels made a foul shot with 5.1 seconds left. ""I work on that a lot actually, like every day,"" James said of his shot. The Kings had one last chance, but Temple missed a 3 at the buzzer. ""I felt it was in. I felt I rushed it a little more than I should have,"" Temple said. ""I had a little more time left. You make some, you miss some."" With Triano directing the team from the sideline, the Suns raced out to a 22-point lead, making 14 of 20 first-quarter shots. ""They came out firing, we knew they would,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Chriss scored 10 points in the first 12 minutes. But the Kings got as close as five in the second quarter and trailed 59-51 at halftime, with former Suns draft pick Bogdan Bogdanovic scoring all 12 of his points in the second in his NBA debut. MOVING ON Triano changed up what had been the Suns' starting five for the first three games under Watson. Booker, T.J. Warren and Tyson Chandler remained in while Chriss and James made their first starts of the season. ""I just want to be on the floor, period,"" Chriss said. ""Being able to get in my flow early helped me."" Triano said he hadn't slept much and was running on adrenaline. ""We're going to learn on the fly and I'm going to stop the game,"" he said. ""If I use all timeouts to teach, I'm going to use all timeouts to teach."" TIP-INS Kings: Joerger said he has known Triano for some time via basketball circles. ""He's an incredible basketball mind,"" Joerger said. ... G-F Vince Carter became the sixth NBA player to play against the Suns in his 20th season or later. ... Sacramento got 78 points from its reserves. Suns: Triano got a quick embrace from Carter just before tipoff. The two were together in Toronto 14 seasons ago. ...

"CLEVELAND -- The Cavaliers' lineups are changing daily. Their defense is a mess, their slow starts are puzzling and the starting point guard is hurt. Cleveland's got some problems. LeBron James minimizes them all. Making a rare start at point guard, James scored 34 points as the Cavs, using another early season lineup, awakened after a sluggish first half and beat the Chicago Bulls 119-112 on Tuesday night. Although he often handles the ball and runs Cleveland's offense, James had not officially been listed as a guard since 2012 with Miami. The superstar added 13 assists, including a no-look, behind-the-back dish to Jae Crowder for a 3-pointer during Cleveland's 15-3 spurt in the third quarter. The Bulls did all they could. James just did more. ""You're playing against the best player on the planet,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. Kevin Love had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and Dwyane Wade, who asked Cavs coach Tyronn Lue to take him out of the starting lineup, came off the bench and added 11 points. Justin Holiday scored 25 and rookie Lauri Markkanen 19 for Chicago, which made a season-high 17 3-pointers. The 7-foot Markkanen became the first player in NBA history to make 10 3-pointers in his first three career games. Cleveland trailed 92-91 entering the fourth before Love dropped a 3 and Kyle Korver made a pair of 3s in 33 seconds. Chicago closed within six in the final two minutes, but the Cavs came up with two offensive rebounds to reset the shot clock before James drove past Markkanen for a left-handed layup to make it 118-110. It was vintage James, perhaps the only player in the game who can play either guard spot, both forward positons and center. It's how he was raised. ""Ever since I was a kid I've always learned every position on the floor,"" he said. ""The point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward and center. And know all the plays, what they're doing and reads. Coach slides me to the 1, I know every set. If he slides me to the 5, I know the 5. I know the 4. I know the 3. I know the 2. ""I know every single play in every single position, so it makes the job a lot easier for me because I know where I should be and what my teammates should do."" The Cavs were coming off an embarrassing loss to Orlando and their defense was atrocious in the first half, when the Bulls made 12 3-pointers and scored 65 points -- 12 less than in their previous game. Lue has been experimenting with lineups and combinations because of new players and injuries. He trotted out another new starting five -- his third in three games -- against the Bulls, moving James to the point, and starting Tristan Thompson at center so Love wouldn't have to guard 7-foot-1 Robin Lopez the entire game. But Cleveland's starters let Chicago control things early. Dropping uncontested 3-pointers, the Bulls opened a 14-point lead before the second group -- led by Wade and Jeff Green -- got the Cavs back in it. Green finished with 16 points. ""Thank God for our bench,"" said Lue, who angrily got after his team at halftime about defense. ""But we've got to be better -- 17 3s again where guys are just looking at us, staring us down and raising for shots. We talked about making the guys put the ball on the floor and we didn't learn our lesson."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago came within one 3-pointer of matching the club record set on March 12, 2011. ... Lopez banked in his second career 3-pointer as the shot clock expired in the first quarter. Lopez made his first career 3 on Saturday against San Antonio. ... Former Cavs point guard Kay Felder, picked up on waivers from Atlanta before the season, scored 13 points in 15 minutes. Cavaliers: Snapped a five-game losing streak to Chicago. ... Starting PG Derrick Rose missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle. ... James played in his 771st regular-season game, matching center Zydrunas Ilgauskas for the most in franchise history. ROOKIE RAVE James is impressed with Markkanen, the No. 7 overall pick from Arizona. ""Very confident,"" James said. ""I watched him a lot. He wore my shoes a couple times. He wore my retro 'Brons a couple times and I liked that. Can shoot the heck out of the ball and he's going to continue to get better. And the best thing about it is he'll get an opportunity."" Markkanen didn't show any nerves, but was in awe being on the floor with James. ""That's a dream come true for me,"" he said. ""Your favorite player when you're growing up and then you get to go against him. He's a pretty tough guy to guard.""

"ORLANDO, Fla. -- On a team that's at its best when consistently moving the ball, there are times Aaron Gordon seems to be working counter his Orlando Magic teammates. But Gordon's habit of taking quick shots and playing isolation basketball came up big for the Magic during their 125-121 comeback win over Brooklyn on Tuesday night. Gordon scored a career-high 41 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 36 seconds remaining. ""I just shot confidently, it was a quick shot,"" said Gordon, who also finished with a game-high 14 rebounds. ""It felt good coming off my hands."" Gordon was 5 for 5 from 3-point range and converted 14 of 18 from the field in 37 minutes. There were times when Gordon's penchant for rushing shots worked against the Magic, especially as they fell behind by as many as 12 points in third quarter. But Gordon remained aggressive all night and defended his actions on the floor after the game. ""I definitely shot the ball well,"" he said. ""Regardless of the statistics, regardless of the numbers that I shot, I'm going to continue to shoot my shot. I feel that I'm open and that I'm in rhythm, whatever happens after that it's out of my control. I'm going to take what I know I can do."" Gordon had missed the Magic's previous two games, a close loss to Brooklyn and a blowout win over Cleveland on Saturday, with an ankle injury. In both games the team benefited from good ball movement and shot selection. They shot 51 percent and had 30 assists in last week's five-point loss to the Nets, then had 28 more assists in the victory at Cleveland. But against the Nets on Tuesday night, Orlando (3-1) finished with just 20 assists on 41 baskets. ""I'm glad we got a 'W' but there is a lesson in this game,"" said Evan Fournier, who finished with 28 points. ""We got away from moving the ball and we can't have that. We're not the type of team that can play (isolation) ball or pick-and-roll, pick-and-roll. Our strength is body movement and ball movement. We basically waited three quarters to do it."" But when the Magic got back to the style of play that suits them best they were able to bounce back in the fourth quarter against a Nets team that had taken a commanding lead by scoring on fast breaks and in transitions off Orlando misses. It looked as though the Nets (2-2) would have their second win of the season over the Magic when DeMarre Carroll snatched a rebound out of Nikola Vucevic's hands and took the ball up for the go-ahead layup with 48 seconds remaining. But Gordon answered with his 3-pointer followed by two free throws by Fournier for the four-point win. The Nets missed three consecutive 3-point shots in the waning moments to end the game. D'Angelo Russell finished with 29 points for the Nets. ""Disappointed. We had our opportunities,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Obviously, we had a lot of open looks. It's a make-or-miss league."" TIP-INS Nets: Russell made his first four 3-pointers in the opening five minutes of the opening quarter. Russell finished the first half with 15 points after cooling off the remainder of the half. ... The Nets outscored Orlando 9-4 on second-chance points and 12-6 on fast-break points during the first two quarters. Magic: Point guard Elfrid Payton missed his second straight game with a hamstring strain. Coach Frank Vogel said he is unsure when Payton will be ready to go. ... Vucevic, who had been the Magic's most consistent player in their first three games, got off to a slow start. He was 3 for 10 from the field and 0 for 3 from 3-point range to finish the first half with just six points. Vucevic ended the night with 12 points, which included a 0-for-5 showing from 3-point range and just 6 of 17 from the floor. QUOTABLE ""I think we're two teams struggling to push up in this league and struggling to make strides. There is a lot of energy there and a lot of want from our guys to kind of improve themselves from last year."" -- Atkinson, on the improvement of both Brooklyn and Orlando.","400974801"
"BOSTON -- Jaylen Brown celebrated his 21st birthday by playing one of the best games of his young career. Brown scored 23 points -- just two points shy of the career high he set in last week's season-opener -- and the Boston Celtics beat the New York Knicks 110-89 on Tuesday night. He left the court with the perfect present -- a win. ""You can't beat that,"" he said. Rookie Jayson Tatum added 22 points. Kyrie Irving finished with 20 points and seven assists. Al Horford chipped in with 13 points and 13 rebounds. After dropping their first two games to open the season, the Celtics have won two straight. The Knicks remain winless through their first three games. Brown and Tatum were both taken No. 3 overall by the Celtics in the last two drafts, and became fast friends because of their proximity in age. Brown was active from the opening tip, connecting on 5 of his first 8 shots and scoring 13 points in the first quarter. He said he has been the beneficiary of teams paying so much attention to Irving and Horford. ""They draw a lot of attention, so I've got to make plays when they're taking up a lot of that attention,"" Brown said. ""Me and Jayson, we've got to make teams guard us."" Enes Kanter led New York with 16 points and 19 rebounds. But he got most of them in a first half in which his team struggled mightily from the field. The Knicks scored the first basket of the night, but never led again. They shot just 42 percent and went 1 of 12 from the 3-point line. TIP-INS Knicks: Kanter had 16 rebounds in the first half. ... New York went 0 for 6 from 3-point line and committed 11 turnovers in the first half. Celtics: This is the third time this season they have scored 100 or more points. ... Had five of their seven blocks in the first half. ... Coach Brad Stevens said Marcus Smart remains day-to-day, but expects that he will travel with the team on its upcoming road trip. DYNAMIC DUO According to Elias Sports Bureau, Tatum and Brown are the first Celtics' duo ever to score 20-plus points at 21 years or younger in the same game in team history. ""We're gonna keep getting more comfortable with each other as time goes on,"" Tatum said. NO SMART, NO PROBLEM Boston played without guard Smart, who sat out his second straight game with a sprained left ankle. But they didn't need him. The Celtics played like a team coming off four days' rest, taking as much as a 25-point lead late in the second quarter. New York never recovered. Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said before the game that Tim Hardaway Jr. had been playing through a preseason ankle injury. He took a couple of hard spills, but still logged 28 minutes. He finished with six points, connecting on just 2 of his 11 shots. ""We were all out there just running like we don't know what's going on and that can't happen,"" Hardaway said. ""I'm not playing the way I want to play. ... I can't harp on (the ankle). You've got to move on, get back in the gym and work.""","400974802"

Darren Collison had 15 points and 16 assists, Bojan Bogdanovic scored 19 points and Domantas Sabonis had 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Pacers, who shot 67 percent from the floor. ""I thought our guards did a good job of establishing the tempo,"" said Pacers coach Nate McMillan, whose team scored 18 fast-break points and registered 31 assists. ""If you move the ball as they did tonight, guys are going to have wide-open looks."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 28 points and seven rebounds for the Timberwolves, who came out flat after a thrilling last-second win at Oklahoma City on Sunday. ""We didn't play as well as we needed to today, and we obviously knew that,"" Towns said. ""We were trying to scratch out a win and found ourselves fighting back to get into the game."" Minnesota was missing forward Jimmy Butler, who sat out with an upper respiratory infection. Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau wouldn't use that as an excuse. ""We have more than enough to win with,"" Thibodeau said. ""You can never underestimate how hard you have to play to win in this league. There's going to be bumps in the road. There's times during the game where it may not be going our way and you have to battle through those things."" Oladipo scored eight points and Indiana made 15 of 22 shots (68 percent) in the first quarter to take a 33-20 lead. His first two baskets came in transition, including an alley-oop from Collison. That facet of the game was a point of emphasis for the Pacers after they scored just five points on the fast break in their loss at Miami on Saturday. ""(Collison) does a great job of setting the pace for us,"" Oladipo said. ""We just got out and run collectively as a unit and it helped us."" Towns scored nine points in an 11-2 Minnesota run in the second quarter as the teams entered halftime tied at 61. But the Pacers ended the third quarter on a 24-5 run to pull ahead 98-84. Then they buried Minnesota with a 14-2 run early in the fourth. ""I didn't like our body language when it wasn't going our way,"" Thibodeau said. ""I guess that's the thing that's disappointing is more the mental part, the mental toughness of fighting through things. The spirit has to remain strong, and you have to find ways to win."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana played without C Myles Turner, who missed his third straight game with a sore neck and concussion-like symptoms. ... Sabonis hit all seven of his field goal attempts, while Oladipo began the game 6-for-6 from the floor. Joseph hit 5 of 6 3-pointers, while Bogdanovic was 9-for-12 from the floor. ... The Pacers had lost two straight after opening the season with a win over Brooklyn. Timberwolves: Thibodeau said Butler's status for Wednesday's game at Detroit was undetermined. ... PG Jeff Teague spent the 2016-17 season with the Pacers. He played all 82 games and averaged 15.3 points and 7.8 assists per game. Teague had two points and seven assists on Tuesday. ... Wiggins, a career 75 percent free throw shooter, was just 1-for-6 from the line and finished with seven points. It was his lowest output since he scored seven points at Memphis last November 19. FAMILIAR FACES Oladipo and Sabonis came over from Oklahoma City in the offseason when Indiana management granted Paul George's trade request. The Pacers will get their first look at George in a Thunder uniform on Wednesday night in Oklahoma City. The four-time All-Star spent the first seven years of his career with the Pacers and is averaging 21.3 points with the Thunder. ""Paul has done some good things for us for many years, but it's really another game,"" McMillan said. ""It's OKC, and they now have Paul George. For us it's another game, a tough back-to-back, but it's good to go in there with a win."" Oladipo and Sabonis each spent just one season with the Thunder. ""At the end of the day, we're just trying to win,"" Oladipo said. ""They're the next opponent, so that's who we've got to get ready for.""","400974803"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Trail Blazers preserved their streak with a late push. CJ McCollum scored 16 of his 23 points in the final quarter and Portland won its NBA-record 17th straight home opener with a 103-93 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night. Damian Lillard and Evan Turner each added 13 points for Portland, which is off to a 3-1 start for the first time since the 2011-12 season. ""We just tried to be aggressive, tried to push the tempo a little bit more and we got some stops, a lot of stops in the second half,"" McCollum said. ""We just wanted to make something happen. We were a little sluggish offensively, our flow wasn't as good as we would like it to be. But luckily we were able to get a win."" DeMarcus Cousins had 39 points and 13 rebounds for his fourth straight double-double to start the season. The Pelicans were hurt when Anthony Davis departed with a left knee injury in the first quarter. McCollum hit back-to-back 3-pointers to put Portland up 87-81 with 7:32 left. Lillard, who had been cold through three quarters, added a layup and another 3 to extend the lead to 92-81. The Pelicans answered with a 10-0 run to close to 92-91 with 4:06 left. Lillard was fouled on a 3-point attempt and made all three free throws to give the Blazers a cushion at 99-83 with 1:25 left. ""We got stops. DeMarcus Cousins is a handful. Jrue Holiday is really crafty out there. They have so many options, guys that are aggressive and can go make something happen,"" Lillard said. ""We buckled down, we got stops, we rebounded. A few shots went in for us and we pulled it out."" Davis left for the locker room midway through the opening period after he appeared to knock knees with Lillard. In his sixth NBA season, Davis had 27 points and 17 rebounds in New Orleans' 119-112 victory over the Lakers in Los Angeles on Sunday. Following the game, Davis was not walking with a noticeable limp when he left the arena. ""At halftime I was hoping AD was going to come back out there,"" Cousins said. ""That didn't happen. I had to step up to the plate, and that's what I tried to do."" Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic got into foul trouble with three in the first half of the opening quarter and Portland fell behind 18-13. The Blazers quickly turned things around with a 16-1 run to lead 29-19 going into the second. Portland stretched the lead to 13 points but the Pelicans caught up to take a 48-47 lead at the half. Lillard struggled through the first three quarters, going just 1 for 12 from the floor. He was averaging 23.7 points going into the game. Cousins hit a turnaround jumper that put the Pelicans up 69-66 late in the third quarter. He had 18 of the team's 25 points in the period and New Orleans led 73-71 going into the final quarter. ""I didn't realize until the game was over how good a job we did on Dame and CJ -- CJ got hot toward the end.  That's two of the best guards in the league. It was a great team effort all the way around (but) we just didn't get the win,"" Cousins said. ""We just didn't have enough push at the end."" Portland's Ed Davis finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for his 50th career double-double. Portland was coming off a 113-110 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday. The Blazers had won their first two games of the season. TIP-INS Pelicans: The Pelicans head to Sacramento on Thursday to visit Cousins' former team. In an interview with ESPN on Tuesday, Cousins said he should have left the Kings earlier but he was loyal to the team he started his career with. Cousins was traded to the Pelicans last season at the All-Star break. ... New Orleans had won three of the last four against the Blazers. Trail Blazers: To celebrate the start of the season, Pyramid Brewing Co. on Tuesday introduced Blazermania IPA. The new beer was on tap at the Moda Center for the home opener. WITHOUT DAVIS Lillard said he wasn't even sure when Davis left the game, and didn't recall bumping into him. ""I think had he been out there, it would have just made it a better game. It would have forced us to be sharper. Not that we took it for granted, but it would have forced us to be sharper knowing that that guy was out there,"" Lillard said.","400974804"
"LOS ANGELES --  The last time Utah ventured to Los Angeles, the Jazz stunned the Clippers in Game 7 of their first-round playoff series. A rematch was hardly foremost on either team's minds when they met back at Staples Center, since both have nine new players this season. This time the Clippers came out on top, remaining unbeaten with a 102-84 victory on Tuesday. ""They beat us in the playoffs. For the guys that were here tonight, that was something that was in the back of our minds,"" said Clippers center DeAndre Jordan. ""For the guys that weren't here, we wanted to come out and see the tone against a really good defensive team that makes you guard them the whole shot clock."" All five starters scored in double figures for the Clippers, led by Blake Griffin's 22 points. Patrick Beverley added 19 points, but turned the ball over seven times. The Jazz (2-2) got 19 points from rookie guard Donovan Mitchell, but no one else scored more than 12. The Clippers went on a 19-2 run to seemingly take command, pushing their lead to as many as 21 points. But sparked by Mitchell and reserves, Utah cut the lead to 82-80 with 4:28 to play. ""We dug ourselves a hole, but I thought we did a good job of fighting back in the game,"" said Utah coach Quin Snyder. The Clippers answered the Utah challenge, picking off three steals down the stretch and getting key baskets from throughout their lineup. ""I loved how we executed for a team that really hasn't been in a fourth-quarter tight game,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. ""That was probably the most impressive thing that we did. The ball swung, moved, moved and we got shots. ""Because we don't know us yet. And for us to do that is nice."" Austin Rivers added 16 points and Danilo Gallinari 14, while Jordan had 11 points and 18 rebounds. TIP-INS Jazz: With so many teams now wanting to run and play at a fast pace, Utah is something of an anomaly in its generally more deliberate style. Said Snyder: ""You have to be who you are. In the end it's all about what style you play that fits your team."" Clippers: Rivers said G Milos Teodosic did not actually tear his plantar fascia on Sunday. ""But whatever he did, he did it well. That's why we're calling it indefinite,"" Rivers said. Austin Rivers started Tuesday in place of Teodosic. Doc Rivers said rookies Sindarius Thornwell or Jawun Evans will pick up the bulk of the extra guard time. Said Rivers: ""I think Sindarius has a chance to be an elite defender in our league."" TEAM PLAY For a team that lost three starters from last season -- and three of its top five scorers -- the Clippers are finding ways to share the scoring load early this season. Griffin is again leading the team in scoring, but he's getting plenty of help. ""It's versatility,"" he said. ""I think that's our calling card this year. We're going to do a lot of things by committee. Defensively we can get stops and offensively we have a lot of guys who can make plays and finish."" OFF SHOOTING The Jazz entered Tuesday shooting 49.4 in their first three games, but the Clippers held them to 43 percent shooting Tuesday. Center Rudy Gobert was shooting 66.7 percent but was only able to get off five shots Tuesday (he made them all). ""We got some good open looks, shots that we make every day,"" he said. ""I think we should keep doing what we do. Keep taking those shots, keep making the right play, and that's what we did and came back.""","400974805"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Marvin Williams often guards Frank Kaminsky in practice, so Williams wasn't surprised when his Charlotte Hornets teammate scored 20 points off the bench Wednesday night against Denver. But what impresses Williams even more is Kaminsky's improvement on defense and in playing the pro game. ""Frank's a smart, smart guy,"" he said. Kaminsky's infusion of offense was critical in a decisive and dominant second quarter as the Hornets built a 25-point lead and cruised to a 110-93 victory over the Nuggets. Kaminsky showed his versatility by scoring in multiple ways. He had 14 points at halftime, hitting two 3-pointers and also scoring on a series of mid-range jumpers and back-to-the-basket moves. Williams said it's obvious Kaminsky benefited from being healthy throughout the offseason for the first time as a pro. ""It's a very big difference if you don't spend three or four months out of the summer time trying to rehab your body to play this season as opposed to getting your body stronger, getting in great shape and being able to work on your game,"" Williams said. ""I feel like for him this summer, he was able to do those things."" Meanwhile, Dwight Howard was again dominant in the paint and on the glass for the Hornets. He scored 15 points and pulled down 19 boards, his third double-double in four games. Kemba Walker added 19 points and five assists for Charlotte. Malik Monk scored 12 of his 17 in the first half, and Jeremy Lamb finished with 16 points. ""Obviously, that was the most balanced and well-rounded game we've played so far,"" coach Steve Clifford said. ""We had better readiness to start."" Nikola Jokic had 18 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Nuggets, who lost their second straight. Gary Harris also scored 18, and Jamal Murray had 16. Mason Plumlee grabbed 10 rebounds to go with eight points. Denver shot 7 of 30 from the field in the second quarter as the Hornets built a 62-39 halftime lead. Nuggets coach Michael Malone was not happy with the effort he saw. ""My message is simple,"" he said. ""I'm going to start our group and if I see guys that don't want to play or compete, I'm going to put guys out there that are going to play hard and compete and at least give us a chance. If you're going to go down, at least go down fighting. That's my nature and I want that to be my team's nature."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Juancho Hernangomez (illness), Tyler Lydon (G league assignment) and two-way players Monte Morris and Torrey Craig were inactive. Hornets: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist made his season debut after missing the first three games for personal reasons. He started and played 10:37, scoring two points on 1-of-6 shooting. ... Charlotte was without Nicolas Batum (sprained left elbow), Michael Carter-Williams (knee soreness) and Julyan Stone (strained left hamstring). ... Treveon Graham left in the first half with a bruised right quadriceps but returned to play 11 minutes after halftime. ... Howard picked up two fouls in the first 4:33. HOWARD CONNECTS One game after missing all nine free throw attempts at Milwaukee, Howard shot 7 of 11 at the line. He also became the first Charlotte player since Emeka Okafor in 2007 with four consecutive 15-rebound games. Howard had seven rebounds, including three offensive boards, in the first quarter despite being limited by two early fouls. COLLEGE COACHES COME TO VISIT Two prominent college coaches were seated courtside. Kentucky's John Calipari and North Carolina's Roy Williams were on hand to watch former players. Calipari was checking in on four former Wildcats: Kidd-Gilchrist, Monk, and Denver's Jamal Murray and Trey Lyles. Marvin Williams and Hornets teammate Marcus Paige played for Williams at North Carolina. Calipari and Williams greeted one another with a hug and brief conversation just before tipoff. Roy Williams received a warmer welcome when shown on the video board. WALKER FOR 3 Walker hit two 3-pointers to give him 800 for his career, which ranks second in franchise history behind Dell Curry's 929. ""I've worked hard to get to this point, so it's an honor,"" Walker said.","400974806"
"DETROIT --  Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy has been waiting for his team to start playing better in transition. Against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit did everything he wanted and more. The Pistons outscored the Minnesota Timberwolves 24-0 in fast-break points on their way to an easy 122-101 victory. ""Counting the playoffs, I've coached something like 900 games in this league, so I can't remember all of them,"" he said. ""I might have seen a disparity like that before, but it is certainly rare."" The Pistons forced 14 turnovers, matching their season-low, but took advantage of the lethargic Timberwolves off missed shots. Andre Drummond had 15 rebounds for the Pistons, who pulled down 83 percent of Minnesota's misses. ""We're getting better defensively, Andre makes us a great rebounding team and our point guards are moving the ball,"" Van Gundy said. ""We want to run, and those are the things that made it possible."" Tobias Harris matched a career high with 34 points, and Detroit had six players score in double figures. Ish Smith had 13 of Detroit's season-high 32 assists. ""Playing team basketball and getting into transition are really important for us,"" said Avery Bradley, who scored 20 points. ""We were able to get stops and get out for easy baskets tonight."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota, while Andrew Wiggins added 21. The Timberwolves lost for the second time in two nights. ""Things change very quickly in this league,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You can be going good, but if you don't come with an edge every night, you're going to get knocked on your butt."" The Pistons trailed by 21 in the first half of their last two games and allowed Minnesota to score the first nine points Wednesday. This time, they stayed in the game and took the lead early in the second quarter. Van Gundy started to talk about the poor start, but shook his head. ""We just played 45 minutes of outstanding basketball,"" he said. ""I'm not going to worry about the first three."" Detroit led 63-44 at halftime after a 40-point second quarter. Harris had 16 points in the half, while Drummond had 10 rebounds. Minnesota committed six fouls in the first three minutes of the third, allowing the Pistons to stay in control from the free-throw line. ""We need to understand that every player in the league is here for a reason, and every team can beat you,"" Taj Gibson said. ""I think after we beat Oklahoma City on Sunday, we relaxed a little. We have to be better than that."" Detroit led 91-73 at the end of the quarter and wasn't challenged in a sloppy final 12 minutes. TIP INS Timberwolves: Jimmy Butler missed his second straight game with an upper respiratory infection. ... The Timberwolves have lost five in a row to Detroit. Pistons: Drummond grabbed his 5,000th career rebound in the first quarter, making him the sixth Pistons player to reach that total. ... Stanley Johnson's first-quarter layup was his first made field goal at Little Caesars Arena after a 0-for-15 start. HARRIS' HOT STREAK Harris has four career games with more than 30 points, with two of them coming in Detroit's last three games. He's averaging 23.2 points in five games this season, well above his career best of 17.1 for the 2014-15 Orlando Magic. ""Tobias was 6-of-9 on 3s tonight, and he obviously isn't going to do that every night,"" Van Gundy said. ""But if he's getting good looks, we want him to take the shot and we'll live with the results.""","400974807"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson kept an eye on the TV in the Houston locker room, which was appropriately showing the World Series. ""Justin Verlander is a neighbor of mine,"" Anderson said. ""He's obviously a clutch guy. The city is lucky to have him."" The Rockets' own Mr. October was pretty clutch in the NBA's version of the bottom of the ninth. Gordon pumped-faked a lunging Joel Embiid, took one dribble, and then buried a 3 at the horn over an outstretched Embiid that completed a furious rally and lifted the Rockets to a 105-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night. ""You've got to be prepared to try and knock down shots like that,"" Gordon said. ""You miss it, you miss it."" He didn't miss. Gordon's winner from the corner gave Houston its only lead over the final 18 minutes and shook a 76ers team that made a series of bad plays and bad decisions down the stretch. Embiid, who scored 21 points, did not shoot over the final 3:44. He was whistled for a goaltending that cut Houston's gap to three, and the Sixers' attempt to run down the clock backfired when Jerryd Bayless -- and not Embiid or Ben Simmons -- missed a shot with the game in the balance. ""I think that we let one slip. Some of it was luck,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. The Rockets scored the final nine points and Gordon hit three 3s in the fourth. If luck was Brown's code word for bad D, he nailed it. Gordon scored 29 points, James Harden had 27 and Clint Capela had 16 points and 20 rebounds. J.J. Redick scored 22 points, and Robert Covington had 20 for the Sixers. ""It's a learning experience,"" Embiid said. ""We're going to need that in the future. We're young. That's not an excuse, but we can all get better."" Embiid, the 7-foot center out of Cameroon, again had the Sixers playing like a playoff team and not pushovers when he's healthy and energized. His 3 off the glass from the top of the arc in the fourth gave the Sixers a nine-point lead. Embiid pointed toward the sky as he ran back on defense and his bucket about blew the roof off an arena packed with fans who have had little reason to cheer the last five years. Harden and Gordon hit 3s that stunned the Sixers and cut the gap to three, starting a rally that lasted down to the final bucket. Both teams played without key cogs to their offense: Chris Paul was out again for the Rockets because of an injured left knee, and Markelle Fultz, the No. 1 pick of the 2017 draft, missed the game with a sore right shoulder. Fultz will miss the next two games and will be evaluated next week. The Sixers drew another big crowd -- 20,682 -- as fans have bought into ""The Process,"" and big plays had fans going wild. They were given souvenir signs that had a picture of Simmons, Embiid and Fultz, the trio expected to soon carry the Sixers into the playoffs. Embiid, who sat out the second quarter, waved his arms and exhorted the crowd to get louder on a ""Trust the Process"" chant, and then hit a free throw for a 72-69 lead. He egged on the crowd on a ""Ref, you suck"" chant and soaked in the calls for ""MVP! MVP!"" Simmons and Embiid have been a fantastic 1-2 punch and helped the Sixers win at Detroit on Monday night. Simmons, the No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft, struggled for most of Tuesday's game until he connected on a rim-rattling dunk off the break that kept the Sixers' lead at five. It just wasn't enough. ""For us to be a good team, we have to win in games like this,"" Gordon said. TIP-INS Rockets: G Trevor Ariza will miss the three-game trip with a sprained left foot. He will be evaluated next week when the Rockets return home. ... C Nene sat out with a sore left Achilles. 76ers: Team president Bryan Colangelo said there had been ""no medical reason"" not to play Fultz this season and the shoulder had no structural damage. ... Fultz is shooting 33 percent, 50 percent from the free-throw line and has not attempted a 3-point shot all season, all as a reserve. PAUL OUT Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said the offense remains ""uneven"" without Paul, who is week-to-week with his knee injury. NUMBERS GAME Houston and the 76ers each hit 12 3s. But the Rockets made 21 of 24 from the free-throw line while the Sixers were just 6 of 10.","400974808"
"NEW YORK --  With injuries on both sides, the point guard matchup came down to LeBron James against Spencer Dinwiddie. James had the bigger numbers. Dinwiddie made the biggest plays. Dinwiddie hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with 43 seconds left, and the Brooklyn Nets overcame James' first triple-double of the season to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 112-107 on Wednesday night. A former second-round pick of Detroit starting only because of injuries to Jeremy Lin and D'Angelo Russell, Dinwiddie scored a career-high 22 points as the Nets blew a 14-point lead in the final quarter but recovered to improve to 3-2 -- the same record as the defending Eastern Conference champion Cavaliers. ""Obviously they're Eastern Conference champions just about every year -- or actually every year -- and then either win the Finals or don't obviously,"" Dinwiddie said. ""And for us to pull out a win and be able to close them out obviously after they made their run and to be able to respond, I think it just of kind of brings a young group a little bit closer together and kind of shows us that we can do it and hopefully propels us going forward."" James had 29 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds in his 56th triple-double, but he missed two free throws -- the second intentionally -- with the Cavaliers trailing by two with 7.6 seconds remaining. DeMarre Carroll then hit a free throw and the Cavs' long inbounds pass intended for James went out of bounds. But the Cavs pointed to the start of the game as their problem. ""Just taking us too much time to get into the game; like get into the flow of the game,"" James said. ""Teams are playing with a faster pace than us to start the game and we have to figure that out for sure."" Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Allen Crabbe added 19 points apiece and Carroll scored 18 for the Nets, who bounced back from Tuesday's loss in Orlando, when Russell sprained his right knee to join Lin on the injured list, and fell just shy of becoming the first NBA team in 32 years to open a season with five straight 115-point games. ""Everybody from 1 to 15 on the roster, everybody's ready,"" Crabbe said. ""Everybody works hard, so when opportunities come guys are ready to step up and ready to play."" With Derrick Rose still nursing a sprained left ankle and Dwyane Wade joining him after bruising his left knee in Tuesday's victory over Chicago, James started at point guard in his 772nd game with the Cavs, passing former teammate Zydrunas Ilgauskas for most in team history. He ran the offense fine but his long-range shooters couldn't convert enough of his passes. Kevin Love finished 4 for 13 from the floor and J.R. Smith was 1 for 9, missing all five 3-point attempts. ""I mean it's a lot of pressure to put on LeBron, have him handle the ball for 40 minutes, and that's why I talk about playing the point guard position, it could wear you down,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Unfortunately that's all we have right now until D-Rose gets back."" The Nets led by 14 when Quincy Acy made a 3-pointer to open the scoring in the fourth, but James led the Cavs on a 13-0 run that gave them a 94-92 lead on Love's 3-pointer. The teams traded narrow leads from there. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Lue said he hoped Rose could play Saturday at New Orleans. ... The Cavs had won the last four meetings. Nets: The Nets are 3-0 at home for the first time since 2002-03, when they started 5-0 back in East Rutherford, New Jersey. ... The last team with five straight 115-games to open a season was the 1985-86 Pistons. The Nets came in leading the NBA with 123.5 points per game. DRAFT DODGING The Cavaliers will get the Nets' first-round pick, which originally was dealt to Boston and then sent to Cleveland in the Kyrie Irving-Isaiah Thomas swap. But Lue said the Cavs aren't paying attention to how the Nets are doing. ""My main focus is just on our team and try to get us to play the right way,"" he said before the game. BRONX BOMBERS IN BROOKLYN Aaron Judge, CC Sabathia and Dellin Betances of the New York Yankees watched from a sideline seat.","400974809"
"MIAMI --  San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich was asked at least a half-dozen times Wednesday about the status of injured starters Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker and when they might be returning. His consistent answer: They'll play when they're ready. With the way the Spurs have started, there's no need to rush them. LaMarcus Aldridge continued his hot start by scoring 31 points, Rudy Gay needed only eight shot attempts to score 22 off the bench and the Spurs stayed unbeaten by topping the Miami Heat 117-100. ""We really didn't get a handle on our defense for basically the entire game,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""That's a big credit to what they do and how they execute, how they have purpose and intention to every single possession."" The win was No. 1,154 for Popovich, now one shy of matching Phil Jackson for sixth-most in NBA history. Danny Green scored 15, Manu Ginobili had 14, Pau Gasol scored 13 and Kyle Anderson finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs, who -- even without Parker and Leonard -- are off to a 4-0 start for the second consecutive season. Popovich wasn't exactly celebrating afterward. ""I thought it was mediocre,"" Popovich said. ""There were way too many mistakes. ... Our offense got us through."" Tyler Johnson scored 23 points for Miami, while James Johnson finished with 21 and Goran Dragic added 20. Dragic's 3-pointer midway through the third got Miami within 61-60, but the Spurs soon took control for good. Gay -- who had Miami on his wish-list of teams when he was a free agent this past summer -- scored 15 points in a 32-13 run that San Antonio put together in the next 9 minutes. The Spurs made seven consecutive shots to end the third, scored on 12 of their final 14 possessions of the quarter and led 93-73 when Gay connected on a stepback jumper with 10 minutes left. ""I'm just playing basketball at this point,"" Gay said. ""It's a lot of unknown with the lineups and we've got guys hurt. So right now we just have to play basketball."" Miami got within 98-87 on a 3-pointer by Dragic with 5:33 left, but Aldridge stopped the Heat comeback try with a turnaround jumper and the margin remained double-digits the rest of the way. ""It's tough to beat this kind of team if you're playing well only on offense,"" Dragic said. ""You need to get some stops. And tonight, our defense was not good."" TIP INS Spurs: Aldridge has scored at least 20 in all four games this season and this was the ninth time he's had at least 31 in a Spurs uniform. San Antonio is 8-1 in those games. ... The Spurs allowed 30 first-quarter points, a season-worst for any quarter. ... Parker practiced Wednesday with the G League's Austin Spurs in San Antonio, and will again Friday. Heat: Miami led for exactly 2:00. ... C Hassan Whiteside (bruised knee) missed his third consecutive game. ... Josh Richardson was 1 for 8 in 33 minutes, missing all four of his 3-point tries and fouling out. ... The Heat started 16 for 16 from the line, before Waiters came up short with 1:52 left. They finished 17 for 18. BAM! PAU! Spoelstra gave fans of onomatopoeia a thrill when he switched his starting lineup, putting Bam Adebayo at center to jump against Gasol (though technically, the Bam-Pau matchup was brief and Adebayo guarded Aldridge to start the game). Adebayo is the first Heat rookie to start within the season's first four games since Mario Chalmers and Michael Beasley in 2008. GINOBILI'S FANS In the Latin gateway of Miami, Spanish-speaking players always are greeted at Heat games and Ginobili is no exception. Ginobili was swarmed by hundreds for a quick meet-and-greet pregame, taking selfies and giving out plenty of embraces. There were at least a half-dozen Argentinian flags being held by fans as well, and many wore his Spurs jersey.","400974810"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul George scored just 10 points against his former team, and it was the kind of game he had longed for. Russell Westbrook's triple-double picked up the slack and helped the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Indiana Pacers 114-96 on Wednesday night. The Pacers traded George to Oklahoma City after it became public knowledge that he didn't plan on staying with the team long-term. George, a four-time All-Star while he was with the Pacers, savored being able to have an off night while his team still won comfortably. Westbrook finished with 28 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds and Carmelo Anthony had 28 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder to take the pressure off George. ""That hasn't happened often in my career,"" George said. ""Fortunate to have those guys carry me. They know how big this game was for me, and they went out and got it for me."" George rarely fouls out, but he committed his sixth with 6:15 remaining after playing just 19 minutes. ""It's a coincidence, right?"" George said. ""I don't know what was the cause. It was an agenda tonight."" Steven Adams added 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Thunder, who snapped a two-game skid. Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, who were sent from Oklahoma City to Indiana as part of the George deal, both started against their former team. Oladipo scored 35 points on 11 for 18 shooting. Oladipo downplayed facing the Thunder. ""Yeah, just another game, man,"" Oladipo said. ""We have to go out and try to win. Unfortunately we came up short."" Oladipo increased his scoring average to 26 points per game. He has thrived in coach Nate McMillan's up-tempo offense. ""Vic's been playing really well for us,"" said Pacers guard Darren Collison, who scored 18 points. ""He has a good flow. It's good to have a player like that, that can get it going the way he's been getting it going. Hopefully we get some wins with that and make us productive."" The Thunder led 54-48 at halftime behind 15 points from Anthony and 11 points and 10 assists from Westbrook. Oladipo scored 21 points before the break. Oklahoma City got it going early in the second half. A 3-pointer by Josh Huestis put the Thunder ahead 70-57. A driving layup by Westbrook expanded the lead to 82-66 with about three minutes left in the period. Westbrook had eight rebounds when he sat down to rest late in the third. He returned in the fourth period and grabbed his 10th rebound with just under five minutes remaining. ""He was great tonight,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Overall, I felt like he surveyed and managed the game and the floor, moving guys around. He did an exceptional job."" TIP-INS Pacers: The Oklahoma City crowd greeted Oladipo and Sabonis warmly during pregame introductions. ... Sabonis got his fourth straight start at center in place of Myles Turner, who was out again with a concussion and a sore neck. Sabonis finished with four points. ... Indiana was coming off a 130-107 win at Minnesota on Tuesday night. ... McMillan was issued a technical foul early in the fourth period. Thunder: Anthony made a layup at the buzzer to end the first period. ... Rookie G Terrance Ferguson played in the fourth period. He sat out Sunday's game against Minnesota with a sprained left ankle. QUOTABLE Oladipo, when asked if he was comfortable at Chesapeake Energy Arena: ""I'm comfortable on this team.""

"DALLAS --  Dennis Smith Jr. took a major step forward in his fourth career game. The 19-year-old point guard had 19 points and five assists to lead the Dallas Mavericks to their first win of the season, 103-94 over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night. ""I've been waiting for this,"" Smith said. ""I got tired of losing."" Smith was at his best in the second half, with 14 points and four assists, as Dallas snapped a four-game losing streak. ""Well, Smith's pretty clearly a gamer. He is unafraid,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Tonight was the biggest amount of responsibility that we have put on him."" Grizzlies guard Mike Conley, who went head-to-head with Smith, was also impressed by the rookie. ""I love his game. I watched a lot of film on him. He plays with a great pace, very patient,"" Conley said. ""He's going to be something special in the league and they've got a good one. It's fun to compete against him."" Memphis had a season-opening three-game win streak come to an end in the opener of a home-and-home back-to-back between the teams. Marc Gasol had 26 points for Memphis. Conley scored 21 points and Tyreke Evans had 13 off the bench for the Grizzlies. Wesley Matthews added 16, Harrison Barnes had 15, J.J. Barea scored 14, and Dirk Nowitzki scored 13 points for Dallas. ""I think the ball is moving better,"" Barea said. ""Everybody is touching it. We are more active on offense."" The Mavericks went ahead 8-7 with 8:30 remaining in the first quarter on a hook shot by Nerlens Noel and never surrendered the lead. Memphis pulled within three in the fourth quarter before Dallas went on a 9-0 run to regain control. ""We couldn't get stops, it's simple,"" Gasol said. ""When you don't have enough stops, you won't be able to get over the hump. ... We didn't play enough good D and we were not disciplined enough in order for us to win."" Dallas led by as much as 19 in the first half, but Gasol helped drag his team back into the game in the third quarter. Gasol scored 12 points on 4-for-6 shooting in in the period, cutting the score to 79-72 before the fourth quarter. Both teams struggled at the free-throw line. The normally reliable Grizzlies made 16 of 24 free throws, and Dallas went 20-for-29. Devin Harris played his first game since the death of his brother on Oct. 19 and had six points. Before the game, Carlisle said Harris wouldn't travel to Memphis with the team on Thursday. TIP-INS Grizzlies: F Chandler Parsons didn't play since he isn't yet medically cleared to play in back-to-back games. Parsons, a former Maverick, is expected to play Thursday. ... Memphis will play 16 back-to-backs this season. Mavericks: Barea played in his 700th career game. ... Dallas' 32 points in the first quarter where a season-high. ... Nowitzki played in his 1,399th career game. He can become the seventh player in NBA history to reach 1,400 on Thursday. NOT SO FREE Gasol went 3-for-8 from the line. He entered the game having converted on 26 of 27 free-throw attempts, including a 10-for-10 night. REBOUNDING The Mavericks have struggled with rebounding this season and had been outrebounded 211-160 in their first four games. The Grizzlies had a 36-35 edge in total rebounds, but Carlisle felt his team won the overall battle because Memphis collected a few rebounds late once the game had been decided.","400974812"
"TJ Warren scores 27 points in Phoenix's 97-88 win over the Jazz giving them back-to-back wins under new head coach Jay Triano. (0:42) PHOENIX -- After three games this season, the Phoenix Suns were allowing almost 129 points per game. Now they're playing tough defense, believe it or not. The Suns have undergone a strange, unexpected transformation since interim coach Jay Triano took over when Earl Watson was fired two games ago. ""They're just having fun,"" Utah's Rudy Gobert said, ""playing hard and playing free and good things can happen when you do that."" T.J. Warren scored 20 of his 27 points in the second half and the Suns improved to 2-0 under Triano with a 97-88 victory over the Jazz on Wednesday night. ""We're just playing together, on both ends,"" Devin Booker said. ""I said it right after they made the coaching change, this should be eye-opening for us. And I love the way we responded."" The Jazz, who lost the previous night to the Clippers in Los Angeles, never led. Phoenix was up by as many as 17 in the first half and 18 in the second. Booker added 17 for the Suns, including a crucial 3-pointer with 1:29 to play after Utah had cut the lead to eight. Alex Len and Tyler Ulis scored 13 apiece. Len also grabbed 13 rebounds. ""They were very aggressive,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""They were the more aggressive team. You saw it on the offensive glass, you saw it getting loose balls. They attacked."" Rodney Hood scored 22 for the Jazz, and Gobert had 16. Derrick Favors and Ricky Rubio added 14 apiece. ""We lacked energy,"" Hood said. ""We've just got to understand when we turn the ball over, especially against a team that is playing loose right now, playing with a lot of confidence, it just makes it harder for us."" It's been quite a turnaround for Phoenix, which opened the season with the most one-sided loss in its history, 124-76 to Portland, and was clobbered by 42 points against the Clippers two games later. That led to the firing of Watson and the promotion of Triano, the former Toronto head coach and coach of the Canadian national team. Phoenix beat Sacramento in Triano's debut Monday night. ""I think we're playing for each other right now,"" Marquese Chriss said. ""We're moving the ball, just playing real unselfishly and we're just pushing the tempo."" The biggest difference has been when the Suns don't have the ball, with Booker -- in the past known for his big-time offense but certainly not his defense -- a major contributor. ""In the years I've been here, I haven't seen Devin this focused at the defensive end of the floor,"" Triano said. ""He's chasing over screens, he's in a stance, his work ethic at the defensive end has been great. I was worried while he transitions into becoming a very good defensive player, his offensive game is going to go, but he was money down the stretch when we needed him."" Just as they did in their previous game, the Suns jumped out to a big lead. It was 10-2 after Booker's basket with nine minutes left in the first quarter and, after Josh Jackson threw a slick behind-the-back pass to Len for a dunk, Phoenix was up 32-15 with 9:42 to play in the half. Phoenix had a fast start to the second half, too. The Suns scored the first six points of the third quarter and outscored the Jazz 21-10 over the first 8 1/2 minutes of the period to take their biggest lead, 69-51, on Ulis' 14-footer with 3:30 remaining. Phoenix was up 83-65 on Warren's basket with 9:02 to play. But the Jazz rallied with a 16-6 run to cut it to 89-81 with 3:31 remaining. After a two-minute scoring drought by both teams, Booker sank his 3 and the Suns never were seriously threatened again. TIP-INS Jazz: Utah committed 24 turnovers to the Suns' 16. ... Hood played despite a mild left leg strain. ... Utah fell to 0-3 on the road. ... The Jazz swept the season series the last two years. Suns: Chriss rolled his left ankle and had be assisted off the court with 3:29 to play but said afterward it was nothing serious. ... The Phoenix bench outscored the Jazz reserves 38-9. ... Triano joins Jerry Colangelo, Scott Skiles, Alvin Gentry, Lindsey Hunter and Jeff Hornacek as Suns coaches to win their first two games.","400974813"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  The defending NBA champions are working to rediscover their defense. Not to mention their basic rebounding fundamentals of boxing out and ability to avoid silly fouls. They barely beat the scrappy Raptors to avoid an 0-2 home start. ""Our defense has been horrible,"" Draymond Green said. Stephen Curry hit a go-ahead 3-pointer from the top with 31.9 seconds left on the way to 30 points, and the sloppy Warriors held off Toronto 117-112 on Wednesday night. Kevin Durant's 3-pointer with 1:02 remaining tied the game at 112, then he found Curry for the 3 that made the difference. ""A 4-year-old up in the stands probably could have seen that we should have been boxing out,"" Durant said of the 17 offensive rebounds surrendered. ""... We don't want to build bad habits and Coach is doing a good job of correcting us when we make mistakes."" Durant finished with 29 points on 11-for-20 shooting, Klay Thompson scored 22 points with four 3-pointers, and Curry capitalized with a huge second half. DeMar DeRozan scored 24 points. He drove through the paint for a dunk with 3:53 to play then hit a key jumper a minute later to put Toronto in position after Curry, Durant and Thompson each missed key 3s down the stretch. Green had 15 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and two steals but also six of Golden State's 17 turnovers. Jakob Poeltl had 11 of his 14 rebounds on the offensive glass. ""It's a focus thing,"" Green said. Curry scored 13 of his points in the third quarter and the defending champions avoided falling to 0-2 at home after losing their opener to Houston on Oct. 17. He made an off-balance layup with 1:28 to go then Golden State made a stop on the other end before Durant's big 3. ""We had ourselves in a great position and we made some key mental mistakes that cost us,"" DeRozan said. ""Nothing went our way, everything went their way in that last minute."" Pascal Siakam scored 20 points as Toronto lost its 13th in a row at Golden State and seventh straight in the series. Serge Ibaka added 15 points and Kyle Lowry 14 points and nine assists. Thompson had two 3s and Durant another from downtown during a 9-0 run late in the second quarter and Thompson another in the waning seconds that put Golden State up 61-53 at the break. BELL'S BACKBOARD DUNK Rookie Jordan Bell's dunk that featured a toss to himself off the backboard Saturday at Memphis drew some debate. Coach Steve Kerr spoke to the first-year forward out of Oregon, whose play had Curry and Durant's jaws dropping. ""I told him after it happened, I said be ready for them to retaliate. He had a bewildered look on his face. I think the issue is you've got old-school people, players on our own team, like Shaun Livingston, David West,"" Kerr said. ""The young guys are like, `Man, that was cool.' I'm sort of in the middle, I never want to embarrass our opponent."" LGBT PRIDE NIGHT Kerr made a heartfelt message about loving and accepting your neighbor as the Warriors hosted LGBT Pride Night. Warriors President and COO Rick Welts was the first openly gay NBA executive. Kerr's remarks: ""There's never been a more important time in our country to respect the person next to you, regardless of race, creed, color, sexual preference, sexual identity. I'm really encouraged by my kids' experience here in California growing up, just in terms of acceptance. It seems like the young generation is learning more and more about we all just are who we are. We're all individuals. What makes our country great is our diversity. The fact that we can respect each other and work together and embrace each other, I think it's an important night for us. We want to welcome everybody from the LGBTQ community. Maybe, if you're coming to the game tonight and your child says, `What does that mean?' explain it to them. Explain to them the importance of loving the person next to you, respecting them, no matter who they are, where they come from. They're human beings, we're all human beings. We're all in this together."" TIP-INS Raptors: DeRozan has never won on the Warriors home floor (0-7). ... Jonas Valanciunas missed his second straight game and Lucas Nogueira also sat out, each with sprained left ankles. Warriors: C JaVale McGee was a healthy inactive based on matchups. ... Thompson has hit a 3 in 59 straight games, the NBA's longest active streak. ... Kerr spent the morning film session on cutting down fouls -- and Golden State had just 15. ""We have a number of issues that we're concerned about but that's No. 1. That's by far at the top of the list because the domino effect of fouling is dramatic,"" he said.","400974814"
"LOS ANGELES --  There will be times when defense is a problem for the young Los Angeles Lakers. Not on this night as they earned their first home win of the season. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit a 3-pointer with 58 seconds remaining and the Lakers handed the Washington Wizards their first loss, 102-99 in overtime Wednesday. Wizards guard John Wall was stuffed by Julius Randle driving to the basket with less than 15 seconds left. After officials initially ruled the ball hit Randle last, a video review gave the Lakers possession, and they broke through pressure to set up a dunk by Randle. Wall missed an off-balance 3 while being defended by Lonzo Ball as time expired. The Lakers forced the Wizards to miss their first seven shots and then their final three. ""You have a chance to win if you can play defense,"" coach Luke Walton said. ""That's kind of the message that we have been trying to deliver, so it was good to have them actually experience that for themselves in a game."" Brandon Ingram scored 19 points for the Lakers, who dropped their first two home games. Ball had six points, eight rebounds and 10 assists in an anticipated matchup against Wall. Larry Nance Jr. added 18 points and 10 rebounds, and Caldwell-Pope scored 14. Bradley Beal had 28 points for the Wizards, who were looking to match their best start since the 1978-79 season by winning four in a row. Wall finished with 18 points and nine rebounds. Washington shot 41.1 percent from the field (39 of 95) and 6 of 26 on 3-pointers. Beal made one of two free throws with 12.8 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, giving the Lakers a chance to send it to overtime when Ingram tipped in his own miss with 0.7 seconds left. Beal missed a corner 3-pointer as time expired in regulation. The Wizards scored six straight points after Ingram tied it at 85 with 3:26 remaining, but the Lakers responded with Ingram's jumper and a 3-pointer by Randle. ""Fourth quarter, we did too much standing around,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We had more dribbles than passes and it wasn't good basketball. Give them credit. They outplayed us down the stretch and they deserved the win tonight."" TIP-INS Wizards: Wall and Beal combined to attempt 10 free throws after going to the stripe at least 18 times in each of their first three games. . Jason Smith had two points and two rebounds in his first action since missing two games with a sprained right shoulder. Lakers: Nance had six points and six rebounds in the first six minutes. ... The Lakers had lost five straight home games against the Wizards. FEISTY FINISH The showdown between Wall and Ball largely fizzled, especially in the first half after the rookie picked up two fouls in the first quarter. But there was some aggression between Ingram and Wizards forward Kelly Oubre Jr. Walton thought it sparked the strong finish for Igram, who had 15 points in the second half. ""Early he seemed to be a little flustered,"" Walton said. ""I thought when they kind of started jawing a little bit it, for whatever reason, got Brandon to another level, and he turned a mediocre game into one where he was grabbing defensive rebounds, calling plays out in a half-court set. Not always the right play, but, hey, steps."" STAR POWER Even with the Dodgers playing Game 2 of the World Series at the same time, Rams running back Todd Gurley and boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. were at Staples Center.

"CHICAGO --  The Chicago Bulls needed a big play, and Lauri Markkanen wanted the ball. Nothing timid about this rookie. Markkanen made a key 3-pointer with 48.5 seconds left in his fourth NBA game, helping the Bulls beat the Atlanta Hawks 91-86 on Thursday night for their first win of the season. ""I'm not afraid of big moments,"" Markkanen said. ""Even though my shot wasn't falling early on, I still believe every shot I shoot, I believe it's going in."" The 7-foot forward finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds, leading a dominant rebounding effort for Chicago. Robin Lopez had 16 points and eight rebounds, and reserve David Nwaba finished with 15 points and 11 boards, helping the Bulls to a whopping 62-40 advantage on the glass. ""I think in the past few games we had struggled to close out possessions,"" Lopez said. ""We had solid defensive possessions, but we let the opposing team get offensive rebounds and tonight I thought we did a great job of getting rebounding, of team rebounding."" Marco Belinelli made five 3-pointers on his way to 23 points for Atlanta, which went 1-4 on the franchise's longest road trip to begin a season. Kent Bazemore scored 16 points and Mike Muscala finished with 14 points and 10 boards. Belinelli made a 3 to give Atlanta an 86-85 lead with 1:48 left, but the Hawks never scored again. Lopez passed to Justin Holiday for a reverse layup and Jerian Grant found Markkanen for his big 3 in the final minute, making it 90-86. ""It was a tough way to end,"" Muscala said. Grant added a free throw in the final seconds, helping Chicago close it out. Holiday had 13 points and 10 rebounds, and Grant finished with 11 points and seven assists. Rookie John Collins had 13 points on 5-for-6 shooting for the Hawks, who won three of four against the Bulls last season. Playing without point guard Dennis Schroder, who missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle, Atlanta did not attempt a free throw in the fourth quarter, while Chicago went 9 for 12 at the line in the final period. ""They basically won the game at the free-throw line,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""That's the difference. And both teams are struggling to score, we just kind of gifted them with free throws."" Markkanen, the seventh overall pick in the June draft, made five 3-pointers and scored 19 points in Tuesday's 119-112 loss at Cleveland, drawing praise from LeBron James for his shooting skills. He got off to a slow start against Atlanta, going 1 for 8 from the field in the first half, but he got back on track by putting the ball on the floor. He drove to the rim for a dunk and a three-point play with 8:33 left in the third. He added a slick driving layup with 6:48 to go, giving the Bulls a 49-44 lead after they trailed by as many as seven in the first half. BRITNEY FAN Lopez has a framed picture of pop star Britney Spears in his locker. He said he found it after Chicago's season-opening loss to Toronto at the Air Canada Centre last Thursday. ""You've got to respect Britney,"" he said. TIP-INS Hawks: F Ersan Ilyasova was active, but did not play due to a left knee strain. Ilyasova got hurt during Sunday's 116-104 loss at Brooklyn. ""Just giving it one more day makes a lot sense for him and us,"" Budenholzer said. Bulls: F Paul Zipser was sidelined by a bruised right knee. Denzel Valentine replaced him in the starting lineup. ... G Kris Dunn (left index finger dislocation) could make his Bulls debut Saturday against Oklahoma City.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  This time the Memphis Grizzlies came out raring to go, though they couldn't sustain the momentum. The Grizzlies turned back a second-half rally by Dallas and closed with a late run to pull away and preserve a 96-91 victory on Thursday night. Marc Gasol had 25 points and 13 rebounds, and Mike Conley added 22 points for the Grizzlies, who lost to the Mavericks 103-94 on Wednesday night in Dallas. The Grizzlies came out sluggish in the loss, but opened Thursday's game with a much better approach, building the lead to 22 in the first half and 20 in the third quarter. Then almost saw it slip away. ""They made us play one-on-one, and then we got a little happy with that and stuck to it,"" Gasol said. ""We got enough stops, especially at the end, to stop the bleeding."" The Grizzlies almost squandered away that second-half advantage. Wesley Matthews, who finished with 18 points, had four 3-pointers in the third to start the comeback. Then a fourth-quarter push gave the Mavericks an 86-84 lead with 3:56 left when J.J. Barea converted three free throws, capping an 18-8 run to open the quarter. That was the last lead for Dallas, as Conley scored the next five points and had nine of the Grizzlies' next 10. ""We shouldn't have been in that position in the first place,"" Matthews said. ""We put ourselves there. . (Wednesday) night we had them down 19 playing the way we did in the second half. What team do we want to be?"" Harrison Barnes led Dallas with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Dirk Nowitzki added 14 points. Memphis led 28-14 after one and 54-35 at halftime and seemed in control of the game, holding the Mavericks to 27 percent shooting. Dallas hit only one of its 13 3-point shots before halftime. ""The second quarter was a killer,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said, later adding: ""I loved the fight in three of the four quarters. I thought we played hard. The second quarter was what really did us in."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Nowitzki has scored 1,445 points against the Grizzlies, more than any active player. Only Kobe Bryant, with 1,636, has more points against the Grizzlies. ... F Josh McRoberts (lower extremity injury), G Seth Curry (stress reaction left tibia) and Devin Harris (personal reasons) were not with team. . Dallas hit only 14 of 40 shots inside the paint. ... Barnes recorded the third 20-10 game of his career. Grizzlies: Gasol has scored at least 25 points in every game this season, except the opener against New Orleans. .It was Gasol's fourth double-double of the season. . Tyreke Evans recorded a season-high 19 points. . Jarell Martin recorded a career-high five blocks and tied his career high with nine rebounds. A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS Evans' 19 points helped the Grizzlies bench outscore the Mavericks reserves 34-23, marking the fourth time in five games this season that the Memphis subs have outscored their counterparts. Wednesday's loss to Dallas was the only time this season the Memphis bench has been outscored. MY BAD The Mavericks, trailing 94-91 and with the ball in the closing 15 seconds, ended up with a forced 3-pointer from rookie Dennis Smith Jr. with 3 seconds left that was off the mark, preserving the Memphis win. ""That was on me,"" Carlisle said. ""With that amount of time, he has to know that a quick 2 is OK. I didn't make that clear to him, so that's on me.

"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks wanted to play a game in the aging arena where the team got its start to celebrate the franchise's half-century in existence. Al Horford and the Boston Celtics spoiled the party. Horford had 27 points and nine rebounds, held league scoring leader Giannis Antetokounmpo in check for long stretches and sank back-to-back 3-pointers late in the third quarter as the Celtics beat the Bucks 96-89 on Thursday night. ""He was great on both ends of the floor,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""He guarded Giannis a large part of the night and I thought did a great job on him and then he obviously hit the big 3s."" Kyrie Irving added 24 points and seven assists for Boston, which avenged a loss to Milwaukee in Boston earlier this month. The game was played at the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, formerly known as the MECCA, which served as the Bucks' home from 1968 until the team moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks chose to play one game this season at the 11,000-seat arena to mark the team's 50th anniversary. The Bucks will move into a new arena next season. Antetokounmpo had 28 points. Khris Middleton and Malcolm Brogdon added 15 apiece. Antetokounmpo, who came into the game leading the league with nearly 37 points per game, scored just 11 in the first half before matching that total in the third quarter as the Bucks built a seven-point lead midway through the period. ""(Antetokounmpo) is a guy that wills his way to the paint, and the big challenge for me was to stay between him and the basket and make him shoot over me,"" Horford said. Horford held Antetokounmpo in check until the third quarter. ""In the first half, I couldn't make plays for my team because there was a lot of people in the paint,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""In the second half, things opened up a little bit. I was trying to be aggressive and make something happen."" The Celtics grabbed control in the fourth, building a 12-point lead midway through the period before Tony Snell sank back-to-back 3-pointers, bringing the capacity crowd to its feet and forcing a timeout. The Celtics quickly built the lead back to double digits, but the Bucks briefly rallied again. Brogdon's layup brought Milwaukee within five points with just under 4 minutes remaining but the Bucks would get no closer. The Celtics jumped out to a 10-point lead early in the first quarter and led 28-23 after the period, led by Irving's nine points. The Bucks led 44-43 at the half on a late running dunk by Middleton. Irving had 16 first-half points. TIP-INS Celtics: G Marcus Smart, who sat out the previous two games with a sprained left ankle, returned to action, scoring eight points in 26 minutes. ... F Daniel Theis made his first career start. Bucks: Brogdon returned after missing one game with a left ankle sprain. ... DeAndre Liggins received a technical foul after blocking Terry Rozier's shot, then standing over him after he fell to the floor. RETURN TO THE MECCA The game was played on a replica of the colorful MECCA court, designed by pop artist Robert Indiana in 1977. ""It's a little cozy,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said of the arena. Stevens made several trips to the arena while coaching in college at Butler University, a one-time Horizon League member along with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which plays its home games there. ""It's fun to be part of these types of games, when you talk about the history of this building and what it has meant to Milwaukee and the NBA,"" Stevens said. The Bucks wore uniforms designed after those from their inaugural season in 1968. Jon McGlocklin, known as ""Mr. Buck,"" addressed the crowd before the game. McGlocklin played on the first team, scored the first basket in team history and started on the 1971 championship squad. He's a long-time television analyst for the team. ARENA ACCOLADES ""It was great to see the intimacy of those seats out there, as well as the fans kind of being right on top of us,"" Irving said. Bucks guard Matthew Dellavedova, who was born two years after Milwaukee played its last game at the arena, enjoyed the experience. ""It was a cool experience playing here and hearing a lot of stories from local people in Milwaukee when they attended games here."" Milwaukee center John Henson described the conditions on the court as ""chilly,"" but he appreciated the opportunity, nonetheless. ""I thought the floor was nice. It was cool just to see the colors.""","400974818"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Blake Griffin made a 3-pointer as time expired and the Los Angeles Clippers remained unbeaten with a 104-103 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday night. Griffin, who scored 16 of his 25 points during the fourth quarter, got the ball on the left side of the floor and hit the 3-pointer just inside the line, the game's sixth lead change during the final two minutes. DeAndre Jordan had seven points and 18 rebounds for Los Angeles, which at 4-0 is one of two unbeaten teams remaining in the NBA. Danilo Gallinari and Austin Rivers had 16 points apiece for the Clippers. Damian Lillard scored 14 of his 25 points during the third quarter for Portland (3-2). C.J. McCollum had 23 points, but missed one of two free throws with five seconds remaining that could have given the Blazers a three-point lead. All five Portland starters scored in double figures. Ed Davis had 10 rebounds. Neither team led by more than five points in the fourth quarter was a tight battle where neither team led by more than five points. Portland wiped out an 89-84 deficit when a clear-path foul led to a five-point possession for Al-Farouq Aminu. Griffin gave the Clippers a 101-100 lead with a minute to play, but McCollum put the Blazers in front when he hit an uncontested 12-foot jumper with 44 seconds remaining. Following an offensive foul by Rivers with five seconds left, McCollum made 1 of 2 free throws, opening the door for Griffin's winner. The Clippers never trailed in the first half after Gallinari hit two free throws for a 14-13 lead. Portland's shooting problems were part of the issue, as the Blazers hit just 10 of their first 35 shots. The Blazers closed within two points twice during the second quarter, but Los Angeles always had an answer. The Clippers outscored Portland 9-3 during the final three minutes to take a 62-53 halftime lead. TIP-INS Clippers: With guard Milos Teodosic out indefinitely (plantar fascia/right foot), there's concern about Los Angeles starters logging heavy minutes. The Clippers' starters played 190 of 240 minutes in Tuesday's win over Utah, and 184 against Portland. . Los Angeles allowed its highest point total of the season. The Clippers came into the game giving up an NBA-low 88.0 points per game. . Griffin has led the Clippers in scoring during their first four games. Blazers: Forward Meyers Leonard sat out after spraining his right ankle during Wednesday's practice. . Portland has lost seven consecutive games to the Clippers . Before the game, Lillard was honored as the 2016-17 Magic Johnson Award winner, given by the Professional Basketball Writers Association to a player who combined on-court performance with dignity and cooperation in dealing with the public and media.","400974819"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- DeMarcus Cousins could exhale at last. The nerves were long gone, his highly anticipated return to Sacramento in the books -- and what a beauty it was. Cousins immediately scored after winning the opening tip and never stopped on the way to 41 points and 23 rebounds, and the emotional big man dominated his old team to rally the New Orleans Pelicans past the Kings 114-106 on Thursday night. Cousins took the crowd at Golden 1 Center on a trip down memory lane, then left them with some heartache after a spectacular performance. He waved to his supportive former home fans as highlights showed of his time in California's capital. ""It was pretty emotional,"" Cousins said. ""I was super nervous coming in. The anticipation was like through the roof. I really couldn't wait for the ball to go up and we could just actually get to the basketball part."" He hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:21 to play for a 108-106 lead and the Pelicans held on -- and Cousins finally got some help in a second-half comeback after New Orleans trailed by 14 at intermission playing without injured star Anthony Davis. Jameer Nelson contributed 18 points with four 3-pointers with Davis sidelined with a left knee injury sustained at Portland on Tuesday. The Pelicans were down 70-56 at halftime with Cousins largely a one-man show already with 20 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Rookie De'Aaron Fox scored 14 points off the bench to lead seven Kings in double figures. Cousins received overwhelming support and love with a standing ovation during pregame introductions with a few boos. After his initial basket, the Kings answered with a 17-2 run. A video and highlight tribute to Cousins played on the scoreboard during a first-quarter timeout as he was formally welcomed back to the city where he played seven seasons, and the big man gave a big wave. ""I loved it,"" Cousins said. ""I've got nothing but love for this city. I came here as a kid and left as a man. As I stated many times, I've got people here I consider family. These fans have been great to me throughout the years."" ""BOOGIE THANK YOU, LOVE YOU, MISS YOU"" read one sign held by a female fan in Golden 1 Center. ""Very talented dude,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Cousins, who was fined $25,000 last week for cursing at a Grizzlies fan in Memphis, shot 14 for 25, dished out six assists and kept his emotions in check. At the 9:23 mark of the first quarter, Cousins and Willie Cauley-Stein were tied up under the basket. Cousins then carried the ball out of the crowd and set it down in front of the New Orleans bench before the jump ball. ""This was just as big a game for them as it was for us,"" Cousins said. ""We knew they would be juiced. We knew they would come out swinging and that's exactly what they did."" He had faced the Kings once already since his February trade, in New Orleans on March 31, and scored 37 points while making 12 of 21 shots in the Pelicans' 117-89 victory. ""For him, he came here as a young kid, really. He'd been with this franchise the entire time,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. ""You have friends in the city, you have things that you've done just from a community service point of view that you had. And then very emotional when he left here. I was there when he got on the plane. I think people don't realize, they look at these guys as something other than a 22- 25- 27-year-old kid, and that's what they are. I don't care how big they are, they've got the same emotions as everyone else has. ""It's tough, because it wasn't his decision to leave. I think when that happens, it stings, it hurts initially. I think he has found himself in a positon where we really appreciate everything he brings to the table."" WEBBER TRIBUTE Former Kings star Chris Webber worked the nationally televised game for TNT and received his own video highlight recognition and a standing ovation late in the first quarter. Webber stood, smiled and acknowledged the fans. TIP-INS Pelicans: Darius Miller started in place of Davis and was scoreless. ... After being outrebounded 63-42 in a 103-93 loss at Portland two nights earlier and giving up 18 offensive boards, New Orleans outrebounded Sacramento 47-34.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Houston Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni seemed genuinely disappointed his team only attempted 55 3-pointers against the Charlotte Hornets. ""I don't know why we didn't shoot 60,"" D'Antoni quipped. ""We passed up about four."" James Harden had his first triple-double of the season with 27 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, and the Rockets finished 22 of 57 from beyond the 3-point arc in a 109-93 win Friday night. Houston nearly broke its own NBA regular season records of 24 3-pointers and 61 3-pointers attempted set last December. Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson led the 3-point barrage. Gordon was 6 of 16 from beyond the arc and had 26 points, while Anderson was 6 of 15 and finished with 21 points. ""As soon Eric and I got (to Houston) it felt natural within the offense (to shoot deep 3-pointers) to give James as much space as possible,"" Anderson said. ""When we catch the ball that far from the basket that is not a shot we're afraid to take."" Of course, the Rockets are known for their long-distance shooting. This was the 15th time in NBA history a team has attempted at least 50 3-pointers. The Rockets account for 11 of those -- all since the start of last season. ""We are going to take them. If that is what is available and it's a good shot then everybody has the green light,"" D'Antoni said. ""Maybe one or two guys shouldn't shoot them, but when we pass them up guys get mad at each other. So we're taking them."" Harden admitted as much. ""We're going to continue to tell everyone to shoot the ball,"" Harden said. ""We create opportunities in space, shoot it.  Luc (Mbah a Moute) passed up a couple. PJ Tucker passed up a couple, even when Chris (Paul) gets back he's got to get used to shooting the ball more than he ever has.  It's going to take some time but the more games we get under our belt, they'll get a feel for it."" The Rockets hit some backbreaking clutch shots just before the shot clock expired, including Harden's 25-footer over Michael Kidd-Gilchrist from the top of the key in the third quarter. Kidd-Gilchrist had worked extremely hard denying Harden a drive and a shot, only to watch the five-time NBA All-Star elevate and drain a jumper in his grill one second before the buzzer sounded. ""Harden and Gordon both made a couple of shots where there was just nothing you could do -- but that's just part of playing them,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. The Rockets took advantage of the Hornets' cold shooting in the first half and built a 10-point lead at halftime. The Hornets started the second half on an 8-0 run but could never get the lead and the Rockets pulled away in the fourth quarter. Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 26 points, and Dwight Howard had another strong game with 19 points and 16 rebounds against his former team. It's the fifth straight game Howard has recorded at least 15 rebounds, a new Hornets record. TIP-INS Rockets: Outscored the Hornets 29-16 in the second quarter and held the Hornets to 4 of 22 shooting from the field. ... Paul, Nene and Trevor Ariza did not play due to injuries. Hornets: Shot 31.3 percent from the field in the first half. ... Howard recorded his 670th career double-double. ... Nic Batum, Cody Zeller, Michael Carter-Williams, Treveon Graham and Julyan Stone did not play due to injuries. FOULING HOWARD: Howard's poor free throw shooting -- he was 5 of 15 -- cost the Hornets points and momentum. Anderson admitted the Rockets fouled the big man on purpose in the fourth quarter. Howard is now 16 of 40 from the stripe this season, well below his career mark of 56.5 percent. At one point in the second quarter Howard made both free throw attempts -- banking the second one off the glass -- and crowd erupted in a sarcastic cheer. STAGNANT OFFENSE: Guard Jeremy Lamb, who is starting for Batum, felt like the Hornets got stagnant on offense. ""Bigs, we have to do a better job of screening and creating action and creating indecision I guess on the defensive part,"" Lamb said. ""We didn't do a good job with the switching.""","400974821"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- The season is a little more than a week old, but the Orlando Magic continue to shock the NBA. The Magic buried the San Antonio Spurs 114-87 behind 25 points from Evan Fournier to run their record to an Eastern Conference-best 4-1. Orlando led by as many as 36 points in a near-perfect performance at both ends of the floor. One week ago, the Magic led the Cleveland Cavaliers by as many as 37 in a 114-93 victory. Jonathon Simmons scored 17 points, Aaron Gordon had 16 and Nikola Vucevic scored 15 for the Magic, who closed this one out early. They led by 27 at halftime and pushed the lead to 36 when Fournier conveted a four-point play with just over three minutes left in the third period. ""I'm impressed with how we're playing offensively,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""Nobody is forcing things at the rim, nobody's forcing it on the perimeter, and as a result, we're getting better and better looks on each possession. That's why you're seeing the offense clicking the way it's clicking."" The Magic got 56 points in the paint and 58 on the perimeter, and they shot 11-for-23 from 3-point range. Fournier hit all four of his 3-point attempts, and Vucevic was 3-for-3 from behind the arc. Orlando shot 60 percent for the first three quarters before emptying the bench in the fourth. ""We've got a lot of weapons out there on the floor, especially with Niko (Vucevic) being able to knock down the 3-ball,"" Gordon said. ""We have a lot of guys who are dangerous from a lot of different areas on the floor."" San Antonio lost for the first time in five games this season. The Spurs tried to play the up-tempo game Orlando favors but couldn't run with the younger, fresher Magic. LaMarcus Aldridge had 24 points and 11 rebounds for San Antonio. Patty Mills added 12 points and Pau Gasol scored 10 with eight rebounds. ""They did a good job of taking us out of what we wanted to do, and they did it for 48 minutes,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""They outplayed us in every facet."" Orlando's quick tempo resulted in open looks from all over the floor, especially in the first half, when all nine players scored. Aldridge scored 12 first-half points on 5-of-9 shooting. The rest of the team combined to go 7 for 35 (20 percent) from the field, and no other Spur had more than four points at halftime. ""I wouldn't say we took them lightly. They just beat us,"" Aldridge said. ""We didn't play good defense and our offense wasn't any good. When you don't do those things, you end up getting beat by a lot of points."" Orlando had 22 assists in the game, 19 of them in the first three periods. ""The respect level we have for them kept our guys engaged in the game the whole way,"" Vogel said. ""Our guys worked tonight. We forced a lot of turnovers and took them out of their rhythm. There are definitely a lot of positives happening for us."" TIP-INS: Spurs: Popovich still needs one win to tie Phil Jackson for sixth on the all-time victory list. Popovich is at 1,154. ... San Antonio went 2-for-13 from 3-point range in the first half. ... Aldridge has scored 20 or more points in each of the first five games. ... Only Miami had scored 100 points against the Spurs this season. Magic: Orlando is shooting 49 percent from the field so far this season, compared to 44 percent last season. ... Gordon has hit 21 of 29 shots in his last two games. ... Orlando is 3-0 at home this season. ... The Magic hadn't beaten the Spurs in Orlando since 2010.","400974822"
"ATLANTA -- Denver paid big money to pry Paul Millsap from Atlanta because the Nuggets knew he'd be a trustworthy scorer in the clutch. Millsap provided a perfectly timed reminder in his Atlanta homecoming. Millsap scored seven of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, Nikola Jokic recorded a double-double with 18 points and 15 rebounds, and Denver beat Atlanta 105-100 on Friday night in the Hawks' home opener. ""When the game is in the balance in that fourth quarter, that's what your $30 million-a-year man has to do,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said of Millsap. ""This guy steps up and makes plays."" Millsap was a four-time All-Star for the Hawks before signing a three-year, $90 million deal with Denver. Millsap helped Denver protect a close lead by scoring on layups in back-to-back possessions with less than four minutes remaining. He added another basket and free throw as Denver blocked Atlanta's comeback attempt. Following the game, Hawks forward Taurean Prince hugged Millsap and told him he appreciated Millsap's help in his career. ""I almost broke down in tears,"" Millsap said. ""It means a lot. ""I had a lot of memories. It's a great city. There's a lot of great people here."" The Hawks gave Millsap a video tribute during a first-quarter timeout. Millsap smiled and waved to cheering fans. ""He's a great player,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said after the game. ""A ton of respect for him and what he does. He makes winning plays."" Will Barton and Gary Harris each scored 18 points, and Emmanuel Mudiay had 16 for Denver (2-3). It was the Nuggets' first win in Atlanta in six years. Jokic, the third-year center from Serbia, helped Denver overcome Atlanta's 14 3-pointers. Dennis Schroder, back in the lineup after missing two games with a sprained left ankle, led Atlanta with 20 points. Schroder's steal and layup cut Denver's lead to 101-98 with 1:22 remaining. Jokic answered with a jumper. Prince had 19 points, and Dewayne Dedmon had 13 points and 10 rebounds for Atlanta. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver's last win in Atlanta was March 16, 2011. ... Malone said he didn't worry about Millsap controlling his emotions in his Atlanta homecoming. ""I respect Paul's experiences and his maturity as a veteran,"" Malone said. ""He knows how to hold his own emotions."" ... Jamal Murray was initially credited with making a 3-pointer from the corner before the buzzer sounded to end the first quarter. Following a video review, officials ruled time expired before the shot. ... Jokic has recorded double-doubles in back-to-back games, his first two of the season. Hawks: Marco Belinelli made five 3s for 15 points. ... A huge ""Coming Soon"" banner covered what was a wall of luxury suites as the $192.5 million renovation of Philips Arena, which began this offseason, is scheduled to be completed following the season. Capacity is down from 18,047 to 15,711 for this season. ... The scoreboards did not work for much of the third quarter. ... Ersan Ilyasova had seven points after missing two games with a left knee strain. STREAKING The Hawks (1-5) have lost five straight since opening the season with a win at Dallas. ""We're battling,"" said Kent Bazemore, who had seven points. ""It's tough. ... The guys are fighting, trying to make the right plays, and we're growing. That's the encouraging thing."" SECOND-CHANCE POINTS The Hawks made 8 of 17 3-point attempts in the first half and 14-of-33 for the game. The Nuggets made only 4-of-20 from 3. Denver countered with a 16-8 advantage in second-chance points in the first half and a 24-13 advantage for the game.","400974823"
"NEW YORK --  Frank Ntilikina and the New York Knicks both got on the board Friday night. The rookie guard scored his first NBA points, and the Knicks beat the Brooklyn Nets 107-86 for their first victory of the season. ""It was great. We had a great game and I think the fans liked it,"" Ntilikina said. Kristaps Porzingis had 30 points and nine rebounds, and Ntilikina finished with nine points as the Knicks became the last team in the league to get a win this season. They did it with a surprisingly strong defensive effort that shut down the NBA's highest-scoring team, holding the Nets about 35 points below their average. New York blew it open with a 25-6 run in the third quarter that turned a three-point lead into a 72-50 cushion and coasted from there after three straight losses that followed a winless preseason. ""It was important because obviously it was our first win, but I think the most important thing in all of these three losses, we stick together,"" center Enes Kanter said. ""We stick together in every practice, we practice really hard and then tonight it was all about defense and we did a great job."" D'Angelo Russell returned from a one-game absence with 15 points for the Nets, who looked nothing like the team that beat Eastern Conference champion Cleveland two nights earlier. They came in averaging 121.2 points and had reached 110 in each of their first five games, but shot just 40.5 percent from the field against their city rivals. ""They were the more energetic team,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""They were the more physical team. They were denying us left and right. We couldn't handle their pressure. We were lethargic and we paid for it."" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek gave veteran Jarrett Jack his first start at point guard and he responded with eight points, seven rebounds and five assists. Ntilikina, who has been injured for much of the time since former president Phil Jackson made him the No. 8 overall draft pick, then picked up the backup minutes and played well. ""We're not surprised because we see it every day in practice,"" Hornacek said. Ntilikina, who missed the previous two games with a sprained left ankle after a scoreless NBA debut, made a long jumper with 49 seconds left in the third quarter. The French guard hit a 3-pointer early in the fourth and also had five assists. Russell got the first basket of the third quarter to cut New York's lead to three, but the Knicks controlled the next seven minutes of play. Porzingis had a follow dunk and three-point play as he and Kanter combined for all the points in a 9-0 run. Soon after, a 12-2 spurt extended the lead to 72-50. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn missed its chance to even the all-time series, which the Knicks lead 95-93. ... Russell was the only Nets starter in double figures. Knicks: Willy Hernangomez, an All-Rookie selection last season who had played just 15 minutes in the first three games -- sitting out one entirely -- got in during the first half and finished with four points. ... It was the Knicks' most lopsided victory since beating Phoenix 128-97 on March 9, 2016. Their largest win last season was 16 points. BACKBOARD BEATING The Knicks outrebounded the Nets 55-34, racking up a 31-6 edge in second-chance points. ""They played harder than us. They killed us on second-chance points,"" swingman Allen Crabbe said. ""You're just not giving yourself a chance."" BROOKLYN BUYER Joseph Tsai, the executive vice president of the Alibaba Group, a Chinese e-commerce company, has agreed to purchase a 49 percent stake of the Nets from Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov , with the option to become controlling owner in four years, a person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press on Friday. Prokhorov, who bought the team in 2010 and oversaw its move from New Jersey to Brooklyn, will eventually become the minority owner, retaining 20 percent of the franchise after Tsai takes control in 2021.","400974824"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  When Jimmy Butler was sidelined for two games with an upper respiratory infection, the Minnesota Timberwolves lacked energy and struggled on defense. The end result was a pair of losses by an average of 22 points. In Butler's return Friday night against Oklahoma City, it was evident just how different a team Minnesota is with him on the court. Butler scored 13 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and helped the Timberwolves hold on for a 119-116 win over the Thunder. His veteran leadership was felt on both ends of the floor for Minnesota, which improved to 3-2. ""He makes a big difference,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""Just having his presence -- he's a great leader, does the right things on the floor."" Karl-Anthony Towns had 33 points and 19 rebounds to lead Minnesota. Towns also had arguably his best defensive game of the young season, posting a season-high four blocks. While Towns and other Timberwolves fed off Butler's energy, Butler did what he could at both ends to keep the Thunder at bay in the final minutes. He scored nine points in the final 4:09 to help the Wolves close it out. He also played a team-high 38 minutes in his return from illness. ""I just wanted to win, man,"" Butler said. ""These guys out there with me, they just played so incredibly hard. When we're playing like that, we look really good, we feel really good, and we end up winning games."" Russell Westbrook led the way for Oklahoma City with 27 points. He had nine assists and eight rebounds, falling just shy of a triple-double. Carmelo Anthony added 23 points for the Thunder. It was the second time in a week the Timberwolves edged the Thunder in a close game. Minnesota won Sunday in Oklahoma City on a buzzer-beater by Andrew Wiggins. This time, Anthony's 3-point attempt to tie it at the end of regulation was no good. ""Obviously, they're a very talented team and we've got a talented team as well,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Both games have been hard-fought."" Minnesota point guard Jeff Teague had 16 points and 10 assists for his first double-double of the season. Teague hit a free throw with 12.4 seconds to play, giving the Wolves a three-point lead. Minnesota overcame an 11-point deficit to enter halftime with the game tied at 59. A three-point play by Towns put the Wolves up two with just under a minute to play in the half. There were 31 lead changes in all, and the game was tied 15 times. Anthony couldn't miss from the floor in the second quarter, scoring the Thunder's first nine points of the period on several long jumpers. The Timberwolves used an 8-0 run in the third to go ahead 83-78. Towns and Taj Gibson each had four points during that stretch, which was capped by Gibson's dunk in transition. The win helped Minnesota move past a pair of blowout losses to Indiana and Detroit. ""We got humbled the last few games,"" Gibson said. ""You just saw a completely different team today."" TIP-INS Thunder: Steven Adams scored the Thunder's first eight points after halftime, including a pair of free throws and an alley-oop dunk. . Oklahoma City entered with the worst free throw percentage in the NBA (67.5 percent), but was 22 of 25 from the line against Minnesota. Timberwolves: Wiggins shot 5 of 15 from the floor. . C Gorgui Dieng hit a long 2-point shot that beat the buzzer to end the third quarter. That gave Minnesota a 90-89 lead to start the fourth. ANTHONY GETS LAST LOOK Westbrook has often been the one to take the last shot for the Thunder, but he deferred to Anthony late in this game. With Oklahoma City trailing by three, it was Anthony who had a look at a potential tying 3-pointer. His shot in the final seconds was no good and Minnesota grabbed the rebound to seal it. ""We had to push the ball at that point in time and I think Russell was just surveying the field and trying to find a way maybe to get Carmelo trailing a little bit there,"" Donovan said. ""I'll see the film, but I do think that Russell is going to try in those situations to get the best shot, and if he can get Carmelo a shot, I think he's going to try to generate a shot for him.""","400974825"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State lost its emotional leader when Draymond Green was ejected shortly before halftime. The defending champs were sloppy again, even forgetting several plays after one timeout and still somehow won -- but it has hardly been easy so far. Kevin Durant had 31 points, 11 rebounds and six assists to help rally the Warriors from 18 points down and beat the Wizards 120-117 on Friday night, a game marred by a fight between Green and Washington's Bradley Beal that led to both being tossed. Stephen Curry added 20 points, eight assists and five rebounds, hitting two 3s and two free throws in the final minute of the third quarter to get Golden State within 97-87 heading into the final 12 minutes. Then Klay Thompson and Durant made 3s early in the fourth for a four-point game. Thompson scored 18 points. Durant's jumper with 1:20 to go put Golden State up by five, but the Warriors still needed his two free throws with 9.4 seconds left. John Wall missed an off-balance 3 then Washington couldn't capitalize on one final chance. David West made two straight baskets for the Warriors midway through the fourth but Otto Porter Jr. hit consecutive 3-pointers for the Wizards, answering a 3 by Durant with a baseline dagger on the way to 29 points for the Wizards. With 19.5 seconds left in the second quarter, Beal held the front of Green's jersey with his left hand while grabbing Green around the jaw with his right. That enraged Green, who threw his right arm in frustration and wrapped arms with Beal as if hugging, then other players joined the scrum. ""It was a scuffle. I'm not going to go into details about it. I'll do that with the league tomorrow,"" Beal said. ""We just got into it and things got out of hand and we both got ejected. I told my teammates I can't put myself in a situation like that to leave them out there to battle out against a tough team without me out there."" Green had to be pulled away from the skirmish by Andre Iguodala and Warriors security personnel. Green was tossed after getting his second technical foul. The back of his uniform was torn from near his right shoulder down to his waist. ""I thought Draymond defended himself and bit the bullet of being ejected for the game,"" West said. Green was hit with his first technical at the 8:05 mark of the second quarter for arguing an offensive foul call. He had six assists, three points, three rebounds and three blocks before his early exit. The Warriors are still trying to figure things out, having given up 17 offensive rebounds two nights earlier in holding off the Raptors and also committing 17 turnovers -- which they did again Friday. Golden State began 1 for 10 from 3-point range while committing seven turnovers and allowing six 3s by early in the second quarter. But the Warriors did enough to win a fourth straight at home against the Wizards. ""We're not ready, we're still not ready,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""We're not locked in."" Wall had 20 points and 14 assists for Washington. Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 19 and Marcin Gortat had 18 for the Wizards, whose three-game winning streak to open the season was snapped in embarrassing fashion with a 102-99 overtime loss at the Lakers on Wednesday. AL ATTLES NIGHT The Warriors honored beloved Al Attles, who missed his tribute night because he's in the hospital. The 80-year-old Attles is in his 58th year with the franchise as a player, coach of the 1975 title team, a GM and now ambassador. Kerr wore an itchy, ""100 percent polyester"" retro suit for the occasion, while Warriors players wore shooting shirts featuring his likeness and a bobblehead was the giveaway. His wife, Wilhelmina Attles, son, Alvin Attles III, and Hall of Famer Rick Barry represented him during an on-court tribute after the first quarter. ""Great to honor him,"" Kerr said. ""I know our fans who have been following us for a long time know about Al's influence, but 57 years with the organization, obviously he won the championship with the team in `75, was GM, drafted Chris Mullin, one of the best players early on in the Warriors history.

"LOS ANGELES -- DeMar DeRozan has stuck with the Toronto Raptors for 600 games because of exactly what he did to the Lakers. DeRozan scored 17 of his 24 points in the second half and the Raptors rallied late for the first victory on their six-game road trip, 101-92 over Los Angeles on Friday night. While extending his franchise record for games played, DeRozan seized control of his own landmark game midway through the fourth quarter. The Compton native checked in and promptly put up a six-point flurry, including the tiebreaking jumper with 6:10 left to put Toronto up for good. Just like that, the Raptors were in control after the lead had changed hands 15 times in the second half. ""My mentality is to go out there and close the game,"" DeRozan said. ""I just try to go out there and do my job."" DeRozan is one of 11 active players with at least 600 games with their current club. He spent one year at USC before the draft sent him in 2009 to Toronto, where he has become a basketball fixture. ""That's crazy,"" DeRozan said of his Toronto tenure. ""That's definitely an honor. I can believe it, but it's a crazy thing when I think about it."" Kyle Lowry added 11 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in his eighth triple-double for the Raptors, who beat the Lakers for the fifth straight time. Serge Ibaka had 18 points and eight rebounds, and Pascal Siakam added 18 points for Toronto. Two days after taking a tough late loss at Golden State and falling to 0-2 on their West Coast trip, the Raptors held off the young Lakers with gritty play from their starting unit. ""A team like Toronto loses back-to-back games, they're going to come out locked in, and they did,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""You could see the look in their eyes."" Lonzo Ball had five points, six assists and seven rebounds on his 20th birthday for the Lakers, who haven't beaten Toronto since 2014. Brook Lopez led the Lakers to a 17-point lead in the first half, but the Raptors erased it in roughly seven minutes spanning halftime. ""I think we lost our intensity, to be honest,"" Ball said. ""We need to stick to what's working. We got away from it. We started playing conservatively a little bit, and when our defense goes down, so does our offense."" Julius Randle scored 18 points for Los Angeles, while rookie Kyle Kuzma had 15 and Lopez added 13. The Lakers went 3 for 23 on 3-pointers, undercutting the ball movement and pace stressed by Walton's offense. TIP-INS Raptors: C Jonas Valanciunas missed his third straight game with a sprained left ankle. ... Lucas Nogueira missed his second consecutive game, also with a sprained left ankle. ... Starting forward Norman Powell is a San Diego native who attended UCLA. Lakers: All four University of Utah products currently in the NBA were at this game: Kuzma and Andrew Bogut for Los Angeles, and Toronto's Jakob Poeltl and Delon Wright. ... Los Angeles Rams LT Andrew Whitworth watched the game at courtside. So did 94-year-old comic book creator Stan Lee. SLOW START Toronto coach Dwane Casey expected a strong effort from his players coming off two road defeats, but had to wait to see it. ""We didn't show up the first half, for whatever reason,"" Casey said. ""We found a way to pull together, but the Lakers did a good job of punching us in the mouth there."" JUMPING IN Siakam continued to take advantage of extensive playing time made available by the injury absences of Valanciunas and Nogueira. After scoring 20 points against the Warriors on Wednesday, Siakam went 8 for 10 from the field and grabbed five rebounds.","400974827"
"NEW ORLEANS --  DeMarcus Cousins came to the bench for the final time as the crowd rose to its feet. He exchanged high fives with Pelicans teammates and fans on the baseline, then motioned to the crowd with his raised right hand to keep the adulation coming. If Cousins, Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday keep playing the way they did against LeBron James' Cavaliers, there will be plenty more scenes like that. Cousins had 29 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Pelicans pulled away for a convincing 123-101 victory over Cleveland on Saturday night. ""I enjoy winning. Don't you?"" Cousins said when asked about his interplay with the jubilant crowd. ""If we play like this on a nightly basis, we've got a very good chance of being the team that we want to be."" Davis added 30 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks to help New Orleans win for the third time in four games. New Orleans' All-Star frontcourt tandem had help from the backcourt, too, with Holiday scoring 29 points and E'Twaun Moore 24 as the Pelicans shot better than 53 percent. ""We're locked in as a unit. We feel like we can battle with the best of them. We're starting to understand what it takes to win games,"" said Cousins, who's played in only 22 games with Davis since the trade that brought Cousins from Sacramento after last season's All-Star Game. ""We're still learning how to play with one another, but the ball movement's been good lately. Defensively, we've been good."" Cousins mostly scored on powerful inside moves, once dribbling through three converging defenders. He also tossed in the sporadic 3. Davis provided his usual mix of decisive spot-up jumpers and crowd-pleasing dunks, either on the break or crashing the boards for put-backs. Holiday complemented penetrating dribble drives with four 3s. ""We're going to be a special team,"" Davis said. ""We don't feel it. We know it."" Kevin Love had 26 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who were without Derrick Rose and trailed most of the game. James had 18 points and Dwyane Wade 15 for Cleveland, which has lost three of four. After trailing by 13 at halftime, Cleveland briefly appeared to be taking control with a 21-7 run during which Love hit three 3s, grabbed four rebounds and added an assist. ""We were playing with a lot of confidence. Guys were shooting their shots, not thinking twice about it,"" Love said of the Cavs' third-quarter surge to a brief 73-72 lead. ""When we play like that, we're tough. We just haven't put together a good 48-minute span."" Cousins' three-point play on a driving layup and Holiday's 3 were bookends of a 12-2 run that put New Orleans back up by nine, and the Pelicans never trailed again. Love briefly left the game after falling to the floor, clutching his left knee under the basket. He returned in the fourth quarter, but the Pelicans put the game away with a 13-3 run, capped by Holiday's fourth 3-pointer, which made it 108-89. ""They're a tough team to defend,"" Love said. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Although Rose previously sounded optimistic that his left ankle sprain would be healed enough to play in New Orleans, coach Tyronn Lue said before the game that Rose was still in pain. ""I don't know about a setback, but he still had soreness this morning when he tried to warm up,"" Lue said. ... Lue added that he inserted the 6-foot-5 Iman Shumpert in the starting lineup against New Orleans because he felt that was the best option for defending the 6-4 Holiday. Pelicans: Newly acquired F Josh Smith made his debut late in the first quarter for his first NBA action since the 2015-16 season. He made his only shot and grabbed two rebounds in a little less than seven minutes. ... The Pelicans finished 13 of 31 (41.9 percent) from 3-point range. NO PANIC James, Love and Wade all said Cavs are unhappy with their recent play, but aren't about to overreact after six games. ""We know we have to get a lot better. We're frustrated,"" Love said. ""But in no way are we going to panic."" Wade, meanwhile, recalled Miami's middling start when he and James first became teammates there in the 2010-11 season. ""It just takes time to get that continuity,"" Wade said. ""At some point, we'll get tired of being a .500 ball club."" EARLY PUSH Moore, who is starting while New Orleans awaits the recovery of Rajon Rando from a preseason core muscle injury, helped the Pelicans build an early double-digit lead. He hit his first five shots -- three of them from 3-point range -- and the last of those made it 40-27 early in the second quarter. WADE'S NEW WORLD Wade came off the bench for a second straight game, but didn't seem to mind. ""I like the role that coach has me in,"" Wade said. ""Put the ball in my hands, allow me to make plays, allow me to score and attack and be myself."" He looked fine after missing one game with a left knee bruise. He drove past Holiday for one, soaring two-handed dunk and also set up a graceful floater with a behind-the-back move.","400974828"
"MIAMI --  Kyrie Irving has done a lot of things in Miami: relaxation, offseason workouts, even the filming of an ""Uncle Drew"" commercial. Something he hadn't done there? Win. He's now crossed that off the list as well. Irving took over down the stretch, scoring nine of his 24 points in the final 2:03 and the Boston Celtics extended their winning streak to four games after holding on late to beat the Heat 96-90 on Saturday night. It was Irving's eighth time playing at Miami, and the first time he walked off the Heat home floor a winner. ""Just big possessions down the stretch (and) understanding you have to stay poised,"" Irving said. ""It's unwavering in those situations like that. Winning time -- so it's pretty simple."" Jayson Tatum scored 20 and Marcus Smart added 16 for the Celtics, who beat Miami for the eighth consecutive time. And afterward, Tatum marveled at Irving's closing flurry. ""It was weird because I've seen it on TV so many times,"" Tatum said. ""And I just saw it in person. I liked it."" Goran Dragic scored 22 points for Miami, which got 16 apiece from Josh Richardson and James Johnson. Former Boston forward Kelly Olynyk had 14 points and nine rebounds for the Heat, who were 7 for 31 from 3-point range. At 2-3, and mindful of how last season's 11-30 start cost Miami a playoff spot, the Heat already sound anxious to get things fixed. ""I don't want to have a season like last year, when it's late and we figure out things,"" Dragic said. ""We've got to do it now, because it's important."" Miami was down 11 going into the fourth, then got within two on a pair of occasions late -- when Irving got rolling. He hit a short floater to put Boston up 88-84, and after Dragic scored to cut the Celtics' lead to two again, Irving pulled off one of his acrobatic reverse layups to restore the four-point edge. And on a possession extended by a Boston offensive rebound, Irving's 3-pointer with 57 seconds left made the margin 93-86. ""That's what he is,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He's a great closer in this game."" TIP-INS Celtics: Boston has won five straight in Miami, matching the longest such streak in franchise history. ... The Celtics aren't sure if Marcus Morris (sore left knee) will be able to play when they return home Monday, but coach Brad Stevens thinks Morris will be ready sometime in the coming week. Morris has already missed as many games this season -- six -- as he did in the previous four seasons combined. Heat: C Hassan Whiteside (bruised left knee) missed his fourth consecutive game, and the Heat still aren't sure when he'll return. ... Miami had what became a five-point possession late in the second quarter, when Richardson made two free throws after a Flagrant-1 on Al Horford -- followed by a three-point play from James Johnson. ... Dion Waiters didn't play in the fourth quarter and scored only five points. HELLO, AGAIN Stevens keeps a close eye on former players, and Olynyk and Jordan Mickey -- former Celtics now with the Heat -- are no exception. ""I really root for everybody,"" Stevens said. Same goes for Spoelstra, who texted injured Celtics forward Gordon Hayward words of support after the All-Star's grotesque ankle injury in Cleveland in the season opener. Hayward considered signing with Miami as a free agent this past summer. SCORING DROUGHT Miami was held under 100 points for the first time this season. Boston outscored Miami 53-37 in the middle two quarters -- holding the Heat to 39 percent shooting from the field and 19 percent from 3-point range during that 24-minute span.  But the big problems that Spoelstra was unhappy about postgame were Boston's edges in points off turnovers (21-13) and second-chance points (21-9).","400974829"
"CHICAGO --  Russell Westbrook had yet another triple-double milestone to accomplish. Westbrook had recorded a triple-double against every NBA opponent except for the Chicago Bulls. He marked that team off his list at last. Westbrook had 12 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 101-69 rout of the Bulls on Saturday night. He became the first player in league history to record a triple-double against 29 different opponents. Westbrook has even done it against his own team. ""He had one against us in practice,"" Carmelo Anthony said with a smile. Anthony scored 21 points and Paul George had 20 for the Thunder, who won their first road game in three attempts after losing three of their last four games overall. Steven Adams and Raymond Felton had 12 points apiece for the Thunder. Lauri Markkanen scored 15 points to lead the rebuilding Bulls, who were coming off their first win in four games this season after beating the Atlanta Hawks 91-86 on Thursday. Justin Holiday added 11 points and Robin Lopez had 10 for Chicago, which shot 28.2 percent from the field. ""We took a step in the wrong direction tonight,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We didn't compete. We didn't stay together. We didn't fight through adversity as a team. We were careless. We were stagnant."" The Thunder shot 44.3 percent from the field in completing a back-to-back after losing to the Minnesota Timberwolves 119-116 on Friday night. Oklahoma City improved to 3-0 when Westbrook has a triple-double. ""Defense, that's my main thing coming into this year, finding ways to impact the game defensively, how I know I can,"" said Westbrook, who had an NBA record 42 triple-doubles last season. The Bulls made 6 of 11 3-point attempts to trail 26-23 after the first quarter before missing all eight of their 3-point attempts in the second quarter.

""Anyone here will tell you that we didn't compete from the beginning,"" Lopez said. ""That's something we can't afford -- short lapses let alone for an entire 48-minute game."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City was leading the league with 10.6 steals per game and finished with a season-high 16. . The Thunder had dropped four of their six previous games against Chicago. Bulls: PG Kris Dunn (left index finger dislocation) made his Bulls debut off the bench and aggravated his finger but is expected to be OK. He was injured during an Oct. 6 preseason game. Dunn had eight points and five fouls. . F Paul Zipser (knee contusion) returned after missing one game. . G Cameron Payne (right foot surgery) is expected to meet with doctors Friday. Hoiberg said he hopes Payne returns around Jan. 1. UP IN THE AIR Some Thunder players posted photos on social media showing the dented nose of the charter flight they took to Chicago on early Saturday. According to Delta Air Lines, the flight from Minneapolis apparently encountered a bird when it landed. ""You never take anything for granted, just be thankful and blessed they we were able to land the plane and everything was OK,"" Westbrook said. ""Seeing stuff like that just shows you how you need to cherish life and understand the important things in life and embrace every moment."" Coach Billy Donovan said the plane encountered turbulence about halfway through the flight, which landed safely. ""The plane dropped a little bit,"" Donovan said. ""Then they just basically told us they were trying to get to a lower altitude because they maybe were concerned about the cabin pressure.""

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Ten days ago, the boos rained down on a struggling Chandler Parsons as the Memphis Grizzlies fans expressed their displeasure with the lack of return on the team's $94 million investment. No one booed Parsons on Saturday night. Parsons finally gave Memphis fans what they've waited for since his signing 16 months ago, scoring 24 points on accurate shooting to lead the Grizzlies to a 103-89 victory over the Houston Rockets. ""That was awesome. I've been waiting on tonight for a really long time,"" said Parsons, who was 9 of 11 from the field, including 6 of 8 from 3-point range. "".It's all about confidence with me. I felt like everything I threw up there was going to go in."" Parsons, who has struggled and battled injuries since signing with the Grizzlies last season and was jeered in their home opener, was part of a dominating Memphis bench effort. By the time Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni cleared his bench with just under 4 minutes left and Memphis leading by 19, the Grizzlies held a 62-15 advantage in bench points. The reserves are made up of players such as Tyreke Evans, Mario Chalmers, rookie Dillon Brooks -- all of whom were not with the team last year -- and Parsons. ""Our chemistry is perfect right now, just because most of our second unit, we're coming back from injuries. Coming back from rehab,"" said Chalmers, who had 15 points, four assists and two steals. ""That's the thing we have in common. We're all hungry."" The Rockets shot 38 percent for the game, were 14 of 38 from outside the arc (37 percent) and committed 19 turnovers, leading to 23 points. Ryan Anderson led the Rockets with 22 points, while James Harden added 20 points and eight assists, but was 6 of 18 from the field, including 2 of 9 from 3-point range. Clint Capela had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the Rockets, who were playing their fourth game in six days, including three on the road. ""They played really well, so that's the biggest thing,"" D'Antoni said of Memphis. ""But then having said that, I thought we ran out of steam, and we've got guys playing a lot of minutes.

Lewis D'Antoni, 103, was a successful high school coach in West Virginia. ... F Trevor Ariza and C Nene both returned to action after missing the last two games: Ariza with a left midfoot sprain and Nene with left Achilles soreness. .The 89 points were the fewest scored by the Rockets under D'Antoni, one fewer than the 90 scored in their loss to Memphis on Monday.

Rookie Ivan Rabb made his first appearance of the season in the closing minute. .Chalmers 15 points was a season high. ALL HAIL THE RESERVES The bench performance came at an opportune time. No Memphis starter reached double figures. The Grizzlies reserves have outscored the opponents bench 246-126 through the first six games. MISSING GORDON Houston played without starting guard and second-leading scorer Eric Gordon, who sat out with a stomach illness -- a huge blow for the Rockets. ""If Eric could have went, then that would have given us one more guy that can make a play. When you don't have that, then it just snowballed away,"" D'Antoni said. ARIZA'S RETURN D'Antoni called Ariza's return after two games ""remarkable. We thought he would be out 3-4 weeks."" Ariza, who finished with 10 points, said he is just trying to find his rhythm.

"DALLAS --  Ben Simmons' NBA career was put on hold when he missed all of last season with a broken foot. Six games into his rookie season the first overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft is making up for lost time. ""He doesn't look like a rookie out there. He's just playing basketball,"" 76ers center Joel Embiid said. ""Once you play basketball, you don't care about nothing. Everything just comes naturally."" Simmons had 23 points, eight assists and seven rebounds as Philadelphia outlasted the Dallas Mavericks 112-110 on Saturday night for their second win of the season. ""Everyone knew he was going to be good, but he's way better than expected,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Some of the plays, just amazing stuff."" Simmons, who is tall for a point guard at 6-foot-10, also had three steals and shot 10 for 15 from the field. ""He's incredible,"" teammate T.J. McConnell said. ""A guy his height is able to move like that and distribute the ball the way he does, it opens up the floor and makes things easier for everyone. He's a game changer for sure."" Embiid added 23 points and nine rebounds as the 76ers won in Dallas for the first time since Jan. 29, 2005. Embiid did suffer a right hand contusion in the win. He had X-rays immediately after the game, which came back negative. Dallas had a chance to tie the game and force overtime with 0.2 seconds remaining with Yogi Ferrell at the free throw line, but the guard missed the first attempt and Dallas couldn't score on a rebound after he intentionally missed the second. Before that miss Ferrell had made 25 of 26 free throws this season. ""Felt good, just strong back rim,"" Ferrell said. ""They say normally that's a good miss when it's back rim. Went out there with confidence, I wanted to shoot those free throws, I felt like could I have made them, I just didn't."" Simmons won the battle of rookie point guards with Dallas' Dennis Smith Jr, who countered with 12 points and eight assists, but struggled with six turnovers. McConnell added 15 points off the bench and Robert Covington had 11 points for the 76ers. Harrison Barnes led Dallas with 25 points. Wesley Matthews had 19, Ferrell 17 and J.J. Barea 15. Embiid got the best of former teammate and friend Nerlens Noel, who had four points and four rebounds. Noel spent three and a half seasons with the 76ers before being traded to Dallas last February. Both teams relied heavily on 3-pointers as Philadelphia went 16-for-35 from beyond the arc, while Dallas made 19 of 40 3-point attempts. Philadelphia seemingly took control and closed the third quarter with a 13-4 run after Dallas took a 76-74 lead with 5:06 remaining in the period. ""I just thought that we got stops and played fast,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""All over the place, the game was unusual and I thought to our guys' credit, they played hard, they played together."" The Mavericks opened the fourth quarter with a 9-0 run and kept the game close, but couldn't regain the lead in their final outing before a two-game road trip. TIP-INS 76ers: F J.J. Reddick missed the game with lower back tightness. Dario Saric started in Reddick's place and had 12 points in 29 minutes. ... Philadelphia led 57-56 at halftime.

"Lonzo Ball says his game needs to improve and points to Donovan Mitchell's huge dunk and 3-pointer as plays that can be traced back to lapses on Ball's part. (0:59) SALT LAKE CITY -- His Utah Jazz teammates had been waiting for athletic rookie Donovan Mitchell to show off his explosiveness in a game. They finally got it Saturday night when the No. 12 overall draft pick caught an offensive rebound with one hand, behind his head and slammed it home in the same motion with Lonzo Ball looking up from the ground and the crowd going wild. Mitchell scored a career-high 22 points and the Jazz held on for a 96-81 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. The victory broke a two-game losing streak for the Jazz. ""I haven't caught a dunk like that in a long time, so it was kind of crazy,"" Mitchell said. ""It was kind of surreal. ""I've been struggling the last few games offensively. Defensively, I've been playing well, but as a young kid, it gets in your head that you're not scoring that much."" The Jazz jumped out to a 21-7 lead thanks to a 16-3 run highlighted by a floater from Mitchell after he pump-faked Ball and got to his spot with a eurostep. The Lakers, however, hung around throughout the night and made it a game in the fourth quarter, but never led. Ricky Rubio scored a season-high 21 points, had seven rebounds and four assists for the Jazz while Derrick Favors had his first double-double of the season with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Mitchell's corner 3-pointer with 1:48 remaining gave the Jazz a 91-79 lead and put the game away. ""I thought that we were gritty,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""I like that we shot 31 3s. We had one less turnover than last game, so showed improvement on that. ""The game became different when they started switching everything in pick-and-roll. That's something we need to learn how to attack better. ... Guys just have to have courage to drive to the basket. ... There were times when we were questioning ourselves in those situations."" Brandon Ingram led the Lakers with 16 points and Jordan Clarkson put up 15 off the bench. Ball, the No. 2 overall draft pick, finished with nine points, two rebounds and four assists -- the rebounds and assists were season lows. ""We are still trying to find our identity still,"" Ball said. ""We are trying to run and some of the possessions are getting caught in the half court and we are just standing. So it comes with practice. We have to figure it out in practice and transition to the game. ""I think I had nine points, four assists, something like that. It's not enough."" Utah cruised through the second quarter before the Lakers found some momentum in the third and cut the lead to eight points thanks to nine third-quarter points from Ingram. Mitchell put together one of the best stretches of his young career to push the lead back to 75-64 at the end the quarter. He had an old school three-point play, the monstrous rebound dunk and a 3 from the top of the arc in just over 2 minutes. An 8-2 run to start the fourth quarter cut the Jazz lead to 77-72, but the Lakers were never quite able to get over the hump. ""I think the little things hurt us down the stretch,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""They executed a little better than we did down the stretch. They hit that offensive glass, that is a big team. ""It wasn't our guys not fighting. I thought our guys did a good job of fighting they had some big second opportunities that hurt. They made more shots than we did at the end of the day.""

""No. 1, the size, strength and quickness of everybody in this league,"" Walton said. ""No. 2, the 3-point line is further back. Teams scout much more in depth in the NBA. And the schedule is crazy for these guys. ""Any rookie that can contribute in the NBA is impressive. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Portland Trail Blazers didn't expect to see the same Phoenix team they beat by a record score in the season opener. They were right. Damian Lillard scored 25 points, C.J. McCollum had 23 and the Trail Blazers outlasted persistent Phoenix 114-107 on Saturday night. Lillard hit a 10-foot runner with 29 seconds left to give the Blazers (4-2) a four-point lead in a game where they never led by double digits. Jusuf Nurkic had 17 points and nine rebounds, and Pat Connaughton scored 13 points off the bench for Portland. The game looked nothing like the matchup in Phoenix on Oct. 18, when the Blazers won 124-76, the largest margin for a season opener in NBA history. Since then, Phoenix has gone through a coaching change that seems to have given the Suns a spark. Earl Watson was fired following an 0-3 start, replaced on an interim basis by assistant coach Jay Triano. Phoenix came into Portland on a two-game winning streak, and threatened to make it three. ""It was a tough win. I was really impressed with Phoenix. They really turned their season around in a short amount of time. It's sure a different team than the one we played a week and a half ago,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. Devin Booker hit 11 of 19 shots and scored a season-high 34 points for Phoenix (2-4). T.J. Warren and Alex Len had 12 points apiece for the Suns. ""I thought we played the right way,"" said Triano, a Portland assistant under Stotts for four years. ""I didn't think we finished our shots down the stretch, but we put ourselves in a position, on the road, to win a game. I give our guys a lot of credit."" The Blazers led 98-91 early in the fourth quarter, but couldn't pull away. Phoenix pulled within a possession on three occasions, and had a chance to tie with less than a minute to play when Marquese Chriss missed a 20-foot jumper. Lillard pounced, split the Phoenix defense and hit a floating runner to put Portland ahead 110-106. ""We're just not playing well offensively. The ball is moving, we're getting good looks, and when those good looks don't fall, we just try to make things happen. That's when we have the turnovers and the low percentage of shots,"" Lillard said. Portland led 61-57 at halftime after making eight 3-pointers and shooting 48 percent. Connaughton hit his first four shots off the bench, including three 3-pointers, as the Blazers opened a 36-30 lead early in the second quarter. Lillard and Nurkic, a combined 3 of 15 during the first half, scored 16 of Portland's first 18 points of the second half. Still, the Blazers couldn't shake Phoenix.

This is the fourth time Phoenix has played Portland in October, including twice during preseason. ... Booker has reached double-figure scoring in his past six games against Portland.

Portland outrebounded the Suns 53-46, the fifth time in six games it has won the rebounding battle. LILLARD STILL SEARCHING Lillard continues to struggle with his shot this season, after making just 7 of 21 against Phoenix. Through six games, Lillard is shooting 37.9 percent (33 of 87), and 30 percent (17 of 56) over his last three games. The distance doesn't seem to matter, as Lillard is shooting 37.5 percent (12 of 32) from 3-point range. ""I'm bouncing into my shots. I had a couple of shots tonight where I was like, `How did that not go in?' When I had good rhythm into it, I had good legs go into it. It just didn't go into the basket,"" Lillard said.","400974834"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers didn't pass Doc Rivers' eye test. He saw finger pointing and blame in the second half of a 95-87 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night that was the Clippers' first defeat in five games, leaving the NBA without an unbeaten team this season. ""We lost the lead because our heads weren't right,"" said Rivers, who used profanity in his postgame comments. ""We are never going to be a good team if we play and act like that."" The Clippers stalled with 19 turnovers. ""You put yourself in that position when you turn the ball over 19 times,"" said Patrick Beverley, who had a team-high four miscues, ""but that's something we can control and we will."" Andre Drummond had 15 points and 17 rebounds, Reggie Jackson added 15 points and Langston Galloway had 13 off the bench for the Pistons. ""It's a big confidence booster,"" Anthony Tolliver said. ""Obviously these guys being undefeated. They're playing at a very high level."" Danilo Gallinari hit a 3-pointer that left the Clippers trailing 92-87. But he struggled offensively, going 4 of 16 from the field and missing 7 of 10 3-pointers. The Clippers shot 33 percent for the game. Jackson made a pair of free throws with 30 seconds left that sent the home fans heading for the exits. ""We just believe in each other,"" Jackson said. ""We all have our roles, but we know we're going to do it collectively. We don't know how it's going to get done every single day but we're all just holding ourselves to a standard that we're going to play 48 minutes."" Austin Rivers scored 20 points for the Clippers, going 6 of 8 from 3-point range. Blake Griffin had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and DeAndre Jordan added 14 rebounds. Griffin disagreed with Rivers' assessment. ""We made small, stupid mistakes as a team,"" he said. ""I didn't see anyone pointing fingers. We didn't make the right plays down the stretch. We just got stagnant at times."" The Clippers were 15 of 38 from 3-point range. The Pistons dominated the fourth, outscoring the Clippers 28-15. They hit five 3-pointers, including the first of three in a row by Stanley Johnson that gave Detroit the lead for good. The Clippers' first five baskets of the third came on 3-pointers and pushed their lead to 13 points. But they were limited to just two points over the final five minutes of the period and clung to a 72-67 lead heading into the fourth. ""The second half was tremendous,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""There was nothing easy or smooth about it. They physically manhandled us in the first half, got to the line a lot more than we did and everything else. But then we fought really hard in the second half."" TIP-INS Pistons: Their six-game road skid against the Clippers ended. ... Jackson went over 5,000 points in his career. Clippers: Griffin made two 3-pointers, giving him multiple 3s in a career-best five straight games.","400974835"
"ATLANTA --  Giannis Antetokounmpo was wary of a mid-afternoon tip-off, concerned about a sluggish start for the Milwaukee Bucks. ""Usually in games like this, early game, you come out a little bit lazy, and we've done that in the past,"" he said. ""I wanted to set a good tone."" Took care of that practically by himself. Antetokounmpo scored 33 points, Khris Middleton had 27 and the Bucks cruised to a 117-106 victory over the outmanned Atlanta Hawks on Sunday. Antetokounmpo also had 11 rebounds and five assists. He went 14 for 21 from the field, scoring from all over the floor while helping Milwaukee to its third win in its last four games. He began the game with 175 points, 53 rebounds and 28 assists, the best start by a player in NBA history through his first five games. ""We came out, and Giannis was really aggressive,"" Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon said. ""He got us off to a good start offensively and on the defensive end. We followed his lead."" Dennis Schroder finished with 21 points and Taurean Prince had 17 for Atlanta, which has lost six straight. The Hawks have no inside experience or size this season after letting Paul Millsap and Al Horford leave as free agents and trading Dwight Howard to Charlotte. Atlanta was outrebounded by 12, never led and trailed by as much as 23 in the second and third. ""They came out with energy. We didn't match it in the first five minutes,"" Schroder said. ""In the second half we didn't a better job defending Antetokounmpo, but we've got to play for 48 minutes and be better."" Antetokounmpo, the NBA's scoring leader with a 34.7 average, had 13 of Milwaukee's first 20 points. Coach Jason Kidd rested him until midway through the second quarter, when his hard dunk made it 59-41. The Bucks hit nine 3-pointers in the first half, including four by Rashad Vaughn on six attempts. They finished with season highs in points and 3s (13). Milwaukee had such command of the game that Kidd didn't call a timeout until the Hawks trimmed the lead to 11 at the 7:42 mark of the fourth. John Henson hit a hook shot on Milwaukee's next possession to make it 98-85. The Bucks dominated on both ends of the floor. ""Their defense is pretty insane,"" Schroder said. ""After the pick-and-roll, you try and pass it to the roller. It's tough to get it to him."" TIP-INS Bucks: Kidd said C-F Greg Monroe is expected to miss at least two weeks with a left calf strain. Monroe was injured in Friday's 96-89 home loss to Boston. Kidd liked how Vaughn handled the extra minutes in Monroe's spot, finishing with 12 points and three rebounds in 21 minutes. Vaughn sat on the bench the previous three games. ""It just shows you how mature he has been in his work ethic,"" Kidd said. ""He's ready to go. He answered the call today."" Hawks: Mike Muscala started in place of F Ersan Ilyasova, who has missed three of the last four games with a left knee strain. Coach Mike Budenholzer wouldn't speculate how long the team expects him to be out. Muscala had 10 points and two rebounds in 29 minutes.","400974836"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo took a big step toward stamping Indianapolis as his town Sunday. All it took was one clutch shot. The Pacers' new starting guard knocked down a step-back 3-pointer with 10 seconds left to complete a late rally and give Indiana a rare 97-94 victory over San Antonio. ""It was a little deep, a little too deep,"" he said. ""Honestly, I didn't really want to shoot it that far but the move felt good and I just made my follow through. I like shooting at the end of the game. That's stuff you dream about."" In Indiana, game-winners have been hard to find lately. Four-time All-Star Paul George had 15 go-ahead shots in the final 20 seconds of games during his career with the Pacers -- and missed all 15. Oladipo had no trouble making the first with his new team. In fact, the two guys Indiana acquired from Oklahoma City in last summer's widely-panned deal for George, became the catalysts in only the Pacers' third win over the Spurs since 2007. Oladipo finished with 23 points and five assists and led the Pacers in scoring for the sixth time in six games. Domantas Sabonis added 22 points and 12 rebounds, both career highs, while going 9 of 9 from the field. It wasn't by happenstance. ""We try to come in every night and prove that we're not just those players who were in the Paul George trade and that we actually mean something,"" Sabonis said after again replacing the injured Myles Turner in the starting lineup. They helped offset LaMarcus Aldridge, who finished with 26 points and eight rebounds, and Pau Gasol, who had 17 points, seven rebounds, five blocks and five assists. San Antonio's second straight loss will force coach Gregg Popovich to wait at least one more day to tie Phil Jackson for No. 6 on the NBA's career victory list, too. But when the Spurs opened the fourth quarter on an 18-5 run to take an 82-73 lead with 6:44 left, it looked like the Spurs might run away. Instead Sabonis and Oladipo spurred a 16-3 spurt that gave Indiana an 89-85 lead with 3:06 left and a couple of possessions later, Oladipo broke an 89-89 tie with a three-point play. Danny Green answered with five straight to give the Spurs a 94-92 lead, but Oladipo hit the long jumper to put Indiana ahead for good. ""It was well-contested,"" Popovich said. ""He was deep and he was off balance. But give him credit, he knocked it down. It was well-contested and it doesn't bother me at all."" Aldridge's 19-footer with 5 seconds left bounced off the rim, Cory Joseph grabbed the rebound and drew a foul and made two free throws. Patty Mills' 3 from the corner at the buzzer was way off the mark. TIP-INS Spurs: Shot 40 percent after making a season low 33.7 percent Friday at Orlando. ... Aldridge has led San Antonio in scoring in all six games this season. ... Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker continue to miss games with quad injuries. ... Manu Ginobili was 0 for 6 from the field and 0 for 2 on 3s and had three points. Pacers: Turner missed his fifth consecutive game with a concussion. It's not clear when he'll return. ... Indiana and San Antonio each finished with 44 rebounds. ... Sabonis has had 11 or more rebounds in four straight games. HALL OF FAME TRIBUTE The Indiana Pacers honored their newest Hall of Fame member, George McGinnis, at halftime. ""To have three guys, three players from the same team and a coach in the Hall of Fame, I think that tells you how good our team was,"" McGinnis said. He was referring to former teammates Mel Daniels and Roger Brown, both of whom have died, and coach Bobby ""Slick"" Leonard, who is the team's color analyst on radio broadcasts. BACK HOME AGAIN Popovich seems to enjoy reliving his past when he gets back to Indiana. The longtime Spurs coach played high school basketball in Merrillville, Indiana, which is located in the northwest corner of the state.  Before the game, Popovich was shown a photo from his prep days and was asked about his career. ""They should have made me a high school All-American,"" he said with a laugh. ""They screwed me. I was a 6-foot-2 center, come on.""","400974837"
"NEW YORK -- After getting a pep talk from his coach, Jamal Murray came through with a big game for the Denver Nuggets. Murray scored 26 points, Nikola Jokic had 21 points and 14 rebounds, and the Nuggets beat the Brooklyn Nets 124-111 on Sunday. ""Before the game this morning (Murray) said, `Coach right now I'm a broken arrow,"" Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. ""I said, `No, you're not. You're going to be fine. Just stay with it. I believe in you and you have to believe in yourself.' Tonight, he came out and imposed his will on the game and was fantastic for us."" Wilson Chandler added 18 points for the Nuggets, who have won two straight games. Spencer Dinwiddie tied a career-high with 22 points, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 18 points and Joe Harris tied his season-high with 16 points for the Nets. The Nuggets went on a 22-4 run to begin the third quarter as Brooklyn missed 10 of its first 11 shots. Chandler carried Denver in the third with 14 points as the Nuggets took a 100-84 lead into the fourth quarter and never looked back. ""I thought that third quarter was phenomenal,"" Malone said. ""That was by far our best quarter of basketball on both ends of the floor. We outscored them 40-21 and to hold them to only 40 percent for the game was terrific."" While the third quarter was Denver's best quarter of the season, it was arguably Brooklyn's worst of the season. ""It's just the defensive end, really,"" Harris said. ""You can't give up 40 points in one quarter. Obviously they got comfortable, came off with a little more energy than we did and that was the game right there."" Hollis-Jefferson led Brooklyn with 16 points at the half as the Nets took a 63-60 lead into the locker room. Brooklyn's 63 points matched a season-high for points in the first half previously done in the season opener against Indiana. Emmanuel Mudiay led Denver with 15 points at the half. Brooklyn's 36 first quarter points marked its most in an opening period this season. TIP-INS Nuggets: Malone believes his young backcourt will be the key to success this season. ""The biggest challenge for us is going to be when you have a 21-year-old backup point guard and a 20-year old starting point guard, there are going to be inconsistencies. Can we try to help them and speed up their maturation as players? Because we have big plans, we want to be a playoff team and when you have two young guards who are going through growing pains at times, it doesn't make it always easy."" . Juancho Hernangomez (mononucleosis) was out. Nets: Coach Kenny Atkinson said DeMarre Carroll (right ankle soreness) and Quincy Acy (left groin strain) are day-to-day. Jeremy Lin (right knee) was also out. ... Timofey Mozgov has now made two 3-pointers in seven games, which is more than he totaled the previous two. ... Jacob Wiley made his NBA debut.","400974838"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  General manager Rich Cho's decision to pair Kemba Walker with Dwight Howard is off to a rousing start in Charlotte. The Hornets' All-Star point guard is meshing extremely well with an eight-time All-Star center looking to jumpstart his NBA career while playing for his third team in three seasons. Walker had 34 points and 10 assists, Howard had 22 points and 10 rebounds, and the Hornets defeated Orlando 120-113 on Sunday night to snap the Magic's three-game win streak. On two occasions, Walker found Howard for an alley-oop dunk -- and the pick-and-roll has opened more avenues for Walker to score. Walker credits the duo's early success to constant communication with Howard, saying they talk at length after every game and practice. Walker also said they text constantly during off days. ""We are trying to make sure we are on the same page,"" Walker said. ""I tell him I am going to be learning ways to get him the basketball and just be patient with me. And that is what he has been doing. And he's opening up so many other aspects of my game. He attracts so much attention and gets other people open."" The Hornets are 3-3 despite starting the season without injured Nic Batum, the team's highest-paid player. Howard likes that he and Walker are cut from the same competitive cloth. ""It's good that both of the leaders on the team have that chemistry together -- and it's only building,"" Howard said. Orlando entered averaging 118 points per game -- second-most in the NBA behind Golden State -- and having scored at least 100 in all five games. Charlotte was just better, though. The Hornets led by as many as 16 in the second half, but Orlando cut the lead to 95-92 with nine minutes remaining. That's when Walker took over, knocking down a 3-pointer and scoring -- plus a foul -- on a drive past former teammate Bismack Biyombo. Walker then drove into the lane and dished to Marvin Williams for an easy score to push the lead back to nine. Williams finished with 13 points and 11 rebounds. Walker later scored off a drive and knocked down another 3 to quell another Magic rally. ""We just weren't physical enough and we didn't take him out of his rhythm,"" Magic guard Terrence Ross said. ""He kind of got to his sweet spots and that kind of hurt us and he got going once he got more comfortable."" The Hornets outrebounded the Magic 59-40. ""The sense of urgency, I don't think it was there for us this night,"" Orlando's Aaron Gordon said. ""Just lackadaisical. We weren't finding our man, we were letting them get too many second-chance points and that'll kill you. We just weren't doing the little stuff."" Jonathan Simmons led the Magic with 27 points off the bench on 9-of-15 shooting. Evan Fournier added 23 points, while Ross and Gordon each had 17. TIP-INS Magic: It was a tough night for point guard D.J. Augustin, held scoreless on 0-for-7 shooting. ... Orlando shot 26.3 percent in the first half from 3-point range. ... Adreian Payne (hand) and Elfrid Payton (hamstring) did not play. ... Orlando shot 42.3 percent from the field. Hornets: Walker also grabbed six rebounds and became the first Hornets player since Raymond Felton to have at least 30 points, 10 assists and five boards in a game. IN LIKE A LAMB Jeremy Lamb had 20 points, marking his sixth straight game with at least 15 while filling in for Batum. ""I'm trying to be aggressive and do the things to help my team win,"" Lamb said. ""I'm playing off the guys and taking my shots."" BALL MOVEMENT Magic coach Frank Vogel wasn't thrilled with his team's ball movement. ""Our guys were trying,"" Vogel said. ""They tried to play really fast but you have to get open. Charlotte does a good job of making you work for everything and then you get in the paint and they're swarming and sprinting out to the perimeter. And they're a good defensive team."" STICKING AROUND After the game, the Hornets announced they exercised their fourth-year option on Frank Kaminsky, who did not play because of an illness. NEED MORE Despite the win, Hornets coach Steve Clifford was concerned about the lack of production he's getting from his bench. ""The starters can't play 30-something minutes every night,"" he said.","400974839"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Two consecutive fourth-quarter meltdowns put the Wizards in a hole on their current road trip. It also set the stage for Washington's most lopsided win of the season. A defense that forced 20 turnovers and an offense that set a season high with 17 3-pointers helped, too. John Wall scored 11 of his 19 points in the first quarter and had nine assists, Otto Porter Jr. had 16 points and the Wizards beat the Sacramento Kings 110-83 on Sunday. ""It was probably the best that we've played on both ends of the court,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""Hopefully we can continue that trend."" The 27-point victory kept the Wizards out of the record books. Washington's first five games were decided by five points or fewer; no team had ever opened the season with six. Wall made it a moot point early by making his first four shots, including three 3-pointers, as Washington jumped to a 13-0 lead that was never threatened. ""I haven't been shooting the ball well so far this season,"" Wall said. ""If I make shots, teams are willing to live with that instead of letting me get into the paint and get to the basket. If I'm able to knock down shots on a consistent basis it makes our team a lot better and it makes us tougher to guard."" Bradley Beal added 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting for Washington after being fined $50,000 by the NBA earlier in the day for his role in a fight with Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors on Friday. The Wizards were up 63-32 at halftime, had a 36-point advantage early in the third quarter and prevented the Kings from getting closer than 27 the rest of the way. Mike Scott added 13 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. had nine points and seven rebounds to help Washington snap a two-game losing streak. Beal was surprised to be playing at all. The veteran guard expected to be suspended after the fight with Green late in the first half of Friday's 120-117 loss to the Warriors. Beal and Green received technical fouls and were ejected from the game. ""I was really happy I wasn't suspended,"" Beal said. ""I knew I was going to get fined one way or the other. It is what it is. Now I can put this behind me."" While Beal played, Washington was without forward Markieff Morris and guard Carrick Felix. Both received one-game suspensions for coming off the bench during the fight. Not that it mattered. The Kings shot 27.9 percent in the first half and trailed by double digits for the final 43 minutes. ""Once they got on us, our young guys got a little frantic and then the wheels kind of came off,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Brian Bogdanovic scored 15 while Kosta Koufos added seven points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento. ALL THOSE 3s Of the 85 shots attempted by Washington, 34 came from beyond the arc. That accounted for 40 percent of the Wizards' shooting. The 17 made 3-pointers were one shy of the franchise record. ""We were aggressive off the dribble and they did a good job of closing in their defense,"" Beal said. ""Then we take full advantage of making the extra pass and getting guys shots."" TIP-INS Wizards: Washington's 35 points in the opening 12 minutes were their most in any quarter this season. ... The day off probably benefited Morris, who is still on the mend from sports hernia surgery. The Wizards' bench combined for 45 points. Kings: Sacramento missed its first nine shots and 13 of 16 to begin the game. ... Zach Randolph and George Hill were given the day off by Joerger.","400974840"
"CLEVELAND --  After the Cavaliers' fourth loss in five games, LeBron James is turning to the calendar for comfort. ""What month is this for me? October? I'm not about to go crazy over it right now. It's too long of a season. I've been a part of this way too many times,"" James said after Sunday night's 114-95 loss to the New York Knicks. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 34 points, Kristaps Porzingis had 32 and the Knicks won for the second time after losing their first three games. Cleveland, which was blown out by Orlando at home and lost to Brooklyn during this stretch, fell below .500. The Cavaliers were routed 123-101 in New Orleans on Saturday. ""Tonight's loss and the last couple are unacceptable,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. The Cavaliers are favorites to return to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight season, but their issues continued, particularly on the defensive end. ""Guys are scoring at will against us,"" James said. ""Our defense is pretty bad right now."" New York, after winning its first game Friday over the Nets, led 89-71 late in the third quarter. Cleveland cut it to 94-88 on James' drive, forcing New York to call a timeout with 8:21 left. Courtney Lee scored on a drive and hit a 3-pointer, helping the Knicks make it 103-88. New York took its largest lead, 114-93, in the final minute. ""We could have folded against a veteran team like that, but we made some big shots and pulled it out,"" New York coach Jeff Hornacek said. New York beat Cleveland for the first time since Oct. 30, 2014 -- James' first game back with the Cavaliers after playing four seasons in Miami -- a span that covered 10 games. ""It's nice to finally beat the Cavs for the first time in my career,"" Porzingis said. ""Hopefully we can be in the playoffs where that really matters."" Hardaway came in shooting 27 percent in four games but scored 24 points in the first half. He was 11 of 19 from the field and hit 5 of 10 3-pointers. ""I did a lot more attacking,"" Hardaway said. ""I took the 3s when they were there. Seeing one go down opens up a lot."" Kevin Love led the Cavaliers with 22 points while James had 16. Derrick Rose returned after missing four games because of a sprained left ankle and scored 15 points. Cleveland led 13-10, but Hardaway scored 10 points, including two 3-pointers and a dunk off an alley-oop pass from Jarrett Jack, as New York went on a 14-0 run. The Cavaliers tied it at 49 late in the second quarter, but the Knicks scored seven straight points and pushed the lead to 62-54 at halftime. New York took over in the third quarter and built the lead to 17 on several occasions in the period. BIG DAY REMEMBERED Sunday marked the anniversary of James' professional debut in 2003 against Sacramento. He had 25 points with nine assists and six rebounds. ""I played better 14 years ago than I did tonight,"" James said. ALMOST Hardaway fell two points of his career high, which came on March 3 of last season against the Cavaliers while he played for Atlanta. ANOTHER CHANGE Rose's return meant Lue went with his fifth different starting lineup in the first seven games. ANOTHER INJURY Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert didn't play because of a sore right knee. He had spent time at point guard with Rose sidelined and started Saturday. TIP-INS Knicks: Porzingis had 12 rebounds while Enes Kanter had 18 points and 12 rebounds. ... Lee scored 15 points and had 10 rebounds. ... Jack and G Ramon Sessions each spent one full season with Cleveland. Cavaliers: Cleveland's loss to Orlando snapped a 17-game winning streak against the Magic. ... Power forward Tristan Thompson had one point, no rebounds and four fouls in 19 minutes. ... Love hit two 3-pointers in the first six minutes, giving him 900 for his career.","400974841"
"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Stephen Curry believes the Warriors are close to being their old, dominant selves again, even if so much seems to be going wrong so far. One night, it's offensive rebounds surrendered. Another, it's turnovers. Or, an all-out foul fest. The defending champions are showing some serious flaws -- and coach Steve Kerr is calling out his team to be far more composed. Curry and Golden State got handed a second home defeat at this early stage of the season, falling 115-107 to the Pistons on Sunday night as Avery Bradley scored 23 points for Detroit. ""It just has to matter enough. Right now it just doesn't seem to matter. Our guys are lacking in energy and focus and discipline,"" Kerr said. ""We finally started caring with six minutes left when we were threatened and we immediately cut it to three because we cared. But the right team won, karma was in the right place tonight."" Tobias Harris hit a 3-pointer with 1:27 remaining that all but sealed it after Kevin Durant fueled a late Warriors rally. Durant hit consecutive 3-pointers to get Golden State back within 101-94 then dunked the next time down to make it 103-96 with 4:40 to go before finding Thompson for a 3 on the next possession. Durant's dunk at 2:12 made it 108-105. Curry had a steal and drive with 1:51 left but couldn't convert, then missed a 3 as Golden State kept possession. Durant missed from deep the next time down. The Warriors lost only twice total at Oracle Arena in both their 2015 championship year and again in the 73-win season that followed, then just five times at home on the way to another title last season. ""We're really close to being ourselves,"" Curry said. ""For the most part those little things are keeping us from really opening up the gates in games like tonight where we had a pretty comfortable lead in the third quarter."" Klay Thompson scored 29 points and became the 11th player in franchise history to eclipse 9,000 career points. Durant wound up with 28 points and Curry 27. Stanley Johnson's dunk with 6:56 left put the Pistons up 98-88. ""When our intensity and energy rises on defense I think we're a pretty good team,"" Johnson said. Golden State looked efficient again initially, passing well and making better decisions, but it was sloppy down the stretch. The Warriors shot 57.1 percent with 29 assists and were at a 63.5-percent clip midway through the third quarter before allowing the Pistons back in the game. Reggie Jackson scored 18 of his 22 points in the first half and Bradley made five 3-pointers for the Pistons, who impressed on the second night of a SoCal-NorCal back-to-back. Detroit beat the Clippers 95-87 on Saturday to hand Los Angeles its first defeat and leaving no more undefeated NBA teams. With 11 blocks, Golden State has gone seven straight games with at least seven blocks. THOMPSON'S PLEDGE Thompson is donating $69,000 to Northern California fire victims and relief efforts from the devastating wildfires in the North Bay. He pledged $1,000 through ""Points With Purpose"" for each point he scored during this three-game homestand. ""I love that he's doing that on his own,"" Kerr said. ""It shows how much he cares, it shows how much he's matured over the years. This was something he came up with. He's gone for it."" GREEN FINED Green was fined $25,000 for his actions in a fight with Washington's Bradley Beal on Friday night that led to both players being ejected. Beal received a $50,000 fine. Also, Wizards F Kelly Oubre Jr. was fined $15,000 for entering the altercation. ""I'm still watching that video over again trying to figure out what I did wrong,"" Green said. With 19.5 seconds left in the second quarter, Beal held the front of Green's jersey with his left hand while grabbing Green around the jaw with his right. That enraged Green, and they became entangled with arms around each other. It was Green's second technical of the game. ""A little confused. I don't know how you get fined 25 grand for being attacked. It seemed like maybe there's some prior reputation involved,"" Kerr said. ""There's some curious stuff in there. It looked to me like Oubre came out there running into the crowd and caused a lot more. Draymond, he was the one who was attacked in the first place. So it seems like maybe those fines could have been reversed."" TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit rallied from 14 down -- 68-54 midway through the third -- to go ahead by 13 then held off a Warriors flurry. ... The Pistons shot 12 for 27 from 3-point range and made all 17 of their free throws. ... They snapped a seven-game losing streak on Golden State's home floor. Warriors: Curry hit a career-best 54 straight free throws dating to his final two last season -- 52 in a row to begin this season when he missed a technical shot in the third. ""It was a good run,"" he said. ... The Warriors had gone two straight games with 17 turnovers before finishing with 25 Sunday.","400974842"
"BOSTON --  The injury to free agent Gordon Hayward devastated the Boston Celtics emotionally and threatened to derail their efforts to improve on last year's Eastern Conference finals appearance. It took about three games for them to figure things out. ""Once that happened, we really didn't know where we were at as a team,"" center Al Horford said on Monday night after the Celtics won their fifth straight game, beating the San Antonio Spurs 108-9. ""We've really come together."" Kyrie Irving scored 24 points for the third straight game, Jaylen Brown added 18 and Horford had 13 rebounds for Boston, which last beat the Spurs in 2011 -- a 10-game losing streak. Irving also had three steals and a blocked shot, and coach Brad Stevens praised his defense. ""You can tell he's getting more comfortable every time he takes the floor,"" Stevens said. Boston signed Hayward in the offseason in an attempt to bolster the team that earned the No. 1 seed in the East. But the deal that swapped Irving for Isaiah Thomas signaled a near-complete break with last year's team. Then Hayward was injured before the season was six minutes old, and the Celtics lost their first two games, on back-to-back nights. Since then, they haven't lost. And Irving is the biggest reason why. ""Things were going rough for him at the beginning of the season. A lot of people doubted him,"" said guard Terry Rozier, who had 10 of his 12 points in the fourth quarter. ""I feel like we all had to adapt to him. It's worked out pretty well."" Reserves Brandon Paul had 18 points and Rudy Gay scored 14 for San Antonio. It was the first game this season that LaMarcus Aldridge didn't lead San Antonio in scoring. He had 11 points. Boston led 54-49 at halftime and scored 10 of the first 12 points in the third quarter -- eight from Irving on a pair of 3-pointers and a layup. The Celtics point guard was 10 for 15 shooting through three quarters, including 3 for 6 from 3-point range, before sitting most of the fourth while Boston nursed a double-digit lead. ""No different than any other night I've seen him play,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He's a hell of a player. You think that's going to change? Kyrie does what he does and he does it very well."" MISSING San Antonio remains without Tony Parker (left quad) and Kawhi Leonard (right quad), and Popovich rested Manu Ginobili as the Spurs lost on back-to-back nights and fell to 1/3 on a four-game road trip. ""I rested him,"" Popovich said, adding jokingly, ""That's something I never do."" SPURTS Rozier scored 10 of the Celtics' first 13 points in the fourth quarter, eight of them in a 52-second span when Boston turned an 11-point lead into a 93-74 rout. Rozier made just one of his first nine shots before making four in a row in the fourth. TIP-INS Spurs: Made a 3-pointer for the 982nd consecutive game. ... Popovich was left waiting for career victory No. 1,155, which would tie him with Phil Jackson at sixth on the NBA's all-time list. ... Popovich's next road win will be his 500th, something just three coaches in NBA history have achieved. Celtics: Irving's 128 points in his first six games as a Celtic were the most since Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen each had 131 in 2007. ... Marcus Morris practiced with the developmental league team on Monday and will rejoin the Celtics on Tuesday. Coach Brad Stevens said his right knee has ""really, really improved.""","400974843"
"MIAMI --  It's never been easy for Andrew Wiggins in Miami, and Monday was no exception. That's what made the win even sweeter. Jeff Teague scored 23 points, Wiggins scored 22 -- 13 of them coming after halftime, including a pair of huge baskets late in regulation -- and the Minnesota Timberwolves scored the first six points of overtime before holding on to beat the Miami Heat 125-122. ""We have a lot of people who know how to win, know how to close out games,"" Wiggins said. That was evident. The Timberwolves never trailed in the final 11 1/2 minutes, yet still needed to see Dion Waiters' 35-footer as time expired clang helplessly off the rim before they could escape. ""We've got some guys on this team that can really play,"" Teague said. ""Down the stretch, Wig was huge."" Karl-Anthony Towns scored 20 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who got 16 from Jimmy Butler and 13 from Jamal Crawford. Waiters tied a career-high by scoring 33 for Miami, 14 of those coming in the fourth quarter including a layup that sent the game to overtime. But the Heat dropped their third straight -- all at home. ""It doesn't mean (anything) if we don't get the win,"" Waiters said. Kelly Olynyk scored 23 points and Goran Dragic added 18 for Miami -- which was again without center Hassan Whiteside, out for a fifth consecutive game with a bruised left knee. Bam Adebayo started again in his place and had the best game of his rookie season, finishing with 13 points and 13 rebounds. ""It was great to see,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of the rookie's stat line, which came against a star in Towns. Wiggins got to the line with 43 seconds left after missing a dunk on a play where Justise Winslow was called for a foul that left the Heat arguing otherwise -- but replays suggested was indeed correct. He made both free throws to put Minnesota up by four, and the Heat would eventually get back within one on a 3-pointer by Waiters with 5.1 seconds left. Teague made a pair of free throws, and Miami's desperation heave from Waiters was off. ""There's a lot of work for us to do defensively,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. Wiggins had both Minnesota baskets in the final 1:01 of regulation, a putback of his own miss and an emphatic dunk for a four-point lead. He's had some good scoring games against the Heat -- at least 22 in four of seven contests -- but he's earned it all. After shooting 7 for 23 Monday, he's now 46 for 125 (36.8 percent) against the Heat. He had a chance to put the Timberwolves up four again with 12 seconds left in regulation, but missed a layup. Winslow got the rebound for Miami and on the ensuing possession Waiters blew past Butler for a layup to tie it at 110. Minnesota scored the next six, and found a way from there. ""We did things necessary to win at the end,"" Thibodeau said. TIP INS Timberwolves: Minnesota's first six 3-pointers came from six different players. ... Towns took only 11 shots from the floor, perhaps a bit of a surprise since Miami was without Whiteside. ... The Timberwolves can get their first three-game winning streak since January with a win on Wednesday. Heat: Miami missed more free throws in the first quarter (three) than in its two previous games combined (two). ... Okaro White gave the Heat a big boost late in the third, scoring five points on a putback dunk and 3-pointer that cut Minnesota's six-point lead to one. ... Miami was cold from 3-point range again, shooting 7 for 27 from beyond the arc. DRAGIC'S STARTS Dragic came out sizzling, and that's been a trend. He was 5 for 5 in the first quarter, the second time he's done that in the last three games. Dragic is shooting 20 for 29 (69 percent) in first quarters this season, and 16 for 20 (80 percent) in the opening periods of his last four games. FREE THROWS Minnesota was 32 for 35 from the line, a huge factor in the game. Miami was 17 for 25.","400974844"
"NEW YORK --  A 23-point third quarter lead vanished in less than six minutes, before Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. combined to make sure that the deficit was short-lived. Porzingis scored a career-high 38 points and Hardaway Jr., who re-signed with New York as a free agent for $71 million, scored all 13 of his points in the fourth quarter to help the Knicks beat the Denver Nuggets 116-110 on Monday night. The Knicks had taken their biggest lead of the game, 69-46, on Courtney Lee's layup with 10:38 left in the third quarter. However, the Nuggets responded by scoring the next 13 points to ignite a 27-2 run and they took their first lead, 73-71, on Wilson Chandler's free throws with 4:42 left in the third quarter. The Knicks committed 10 turnovers during that six-minute stretch. ""We had a lot of turnovers. It was one of the worst quarters we've ever had,"" Porzingis said. ""But, we are going to learn from this game."" The game was tied 77-77 when Doug McDermott's 3-pointer put the Knicks back in front for good with 1:09 left in the third. New York led 84-81 going into the final quarter. Will Barton brought the Nuggets to within one, 89-88, with 9:50 left in the game. But, Hardaway Jr. scored the Knicks' next 11 points, including three 3-pointers, and Porzingis' jumper with 5:35 left gave New York a 104-95 lead. ""I made some big shots and I was happy about that,"" Hardaway Jr. said. ""They were contested, but once you see one go down and you start feeling yourself a little bit it helps my confidence and the team's confidence."" Denver responded by scoring the next seven points and pulling within two on another pair of Chandler free throws with 3:10 remaining. But, Jarrett Jack hit a long jumper and Lee added two free throws and the Knicks were able to hold on down the stretch. ""Fourth quarter, too many mental breakdowns. Lack of discipline to give Tim Hardaway Jr. three straights 3's and he was the one guy we were supposed to be running off the line,"" said Nuggets' Head Coach Mike Malone. ""So, just poor game awareness."" Nikola Jokic led the Nuggets with 28 points and Jamal Murray scored 20. Kyle O'Quinn added 15 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks. Lee and Enes Kanter each had 12 points for the Knicks. McDermott finished with 11 and Jack finished with 10 assists Gary Harris scored 18 points, Emmanuel Mudlay had 15 and Barton added 13 for the Nuggets. TIP-INS: Nuggets: Denver had won the previous five meetings with the Knicks. New York's previous win in the series was a 109-93 victory at Madison Square Garden on November 16, 2014. Knicks: New York's three-game winning streak is its longest since they won four in a row last season. SPENDING TIME IN THE GARDEN Monday's tilt with the Nuggets marked the beginning of a five-game homestand for the Knicks. OH BROTHER Siblings Willy Hernangomez (Knicks) and Juancho Hernangomez (Nuggets) were on opposing sides Monday night. Willy got off the bench to play just over three minutes, while Juancho was inactive due to an illness and did not attend the game. ""I was really looking forward to seeing him,"" Willy said. ""But, he has mono and is being quarantined right now. Maybe for another few weeks."" FOUL FRENZY The Nuggets could not keep their hands to themselves in the second quarter, committing their fifth foul and putting the Knicks in the bonus at the 8:24 mark. New York went on to outscore Denver 30-18 in the 12-minute session.","400974845"
"HOUSTON --  The Houston Rockets allowed Philadelphia 76ers point guard Ben Simmons to take jump shots on Monday night and he made them pay. In Philadelphia's 115-107 win in Houston, Simmons made 10 of 15 shots, many of them from mid-range, to score a career-high 24 points, adding nine assists and seven rebounds. When asked why he took more jumpers than he had in his first six games, Simmons' teammate Amir Johnson answered from behind the group of reporters. ""People don't know he can shoot,"" Johnson said. ""Buckets."" Philadelphia head coach Brett Brown said Simmons' ability to reliably make jump shots will complement his ability to drive or use his length in the paint even more effective. ""I'm really leaving the whole evolution of his jump shot -- when he wants to shoot it, when he feels comfortable shooting it -- with him,"" Brown said. ""When he feels the confidence to shoot things and people sag off of him, he's going to shoot it. If he doesn't, so be it, he'll go find another way to impact the game. It's coming."" Simmons, the 2016 first-overall pick, is shooting 51 percent through his first seven games but has struggled at times outside of the paint and has missed all four 3-point attempts. ""I'm comfortable taking them,"" Simmons said of jump shots. ""I've got to start doing that more often."" After losing 105-104 on a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from Eric Gordon in Philadelphia on Oct. 18, the 76ers snapped an eight-game losing streak against the Rockets, winning in Houston for the first time since Feb. 16, 2011. The Rockets missed nine of their last 10 shots, scoring just four points in the final 3:28 and dropped consecutive games for the first time this season. Brown credited his team's defense, particularly on the perimeter, down the stretch for getting late stops against Houston. ""That's what won us the game,"" Brown said. ""Because if you blink or you're a step short on a switch, you get punished badly with this team because of their ability to shoot and to shoot 3s."" James Harden scored 29 points and Gordon had 25. The Rockets shot just 39.8 percent from the floor. Last season, they were 1-7 when shooting below 40 percent. ""I would never put a lot of stock into that,"" Rockets head coach Mike D'Antoni said of the poor shooting. ""They make them, they don't make them, whatever. The defense, the ball movement and running the floor is going to be constant, and that requires an effort that I don't think we're there yet."" Harden called the team's energy ""terrible, terrible,"" and said the defense allowed too many easy points in the first and third quarters. ""We can't have those mental lapses on the defensive end, they get momentum,"" Harden said. ""They start making shots they probably normally don't make."" The 76ers led 58-56 at halftime. TIP-INS 76ers: SG JJ Redick missed his third straight game with lower back tightness. ... PG Markelle Fultz (shoulder) missed his fourth straight game. Fultz is out indefinitely and will be reevaluated in three weeks, the 76ers said Sunday. Rockets: Nene entered the game questionable with left Achilles soreness but played 10 minutes in the game, getting seven points, three rebounds and a block off the bench. ...  After shooting 17-for-35 (48.5 percent) in a three-game road trip, PF Ryan Anderson shot 2-for-9 from beyond the arc. TRUST THE PROCESS The 76ers arrived in Houston a day early on Sunday to attend Game 5 of the MLB World Series at Minute Maid Park in downtown Houston, blocks away from the Toyota Center. The players represented both the Dodgers and Astros with a mix of customized jerseys with their names and numbers on the back. LIKE A BOSS Houston-native rapper Slim Thug was the celebrity guest shooter for Houston's new ""First Shot,"" promotion. The 6-foot-6 rapper swished his free throw before tipoff, ensuring a $5,000 donation from the Rockets to charity. His shot followed banked shots off the glass from both Texans WR DeAndre Hopkins and Blue October lead singer Justin Furstenfeld in the first two games. EFFICIENT EMBIID Joel Embiid had 22 points, nine rebounds and five assists with two steals in 25 minutes. Dating back to 1983-84, it is just the third time a player has posted those numbers in 25 minutes of play or less. Pau Gasol did it in 2015 for Chicago and Fat Lever did it in 1990 for Denver.","400974846"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Kemba Walker re-entered the game with under 8 minutes left and things changed for the Charlotte Hornets. Walker scored nine of his 27 points in a fourth-quarter rally as the Charlotte handed the Memphis Grizzlies their first home loss of the season with a 104-99 win Monday night. ""I was just trying to make plays. Trying to do what I can to help my teammates,"" Walker said of the final stretch, where he also added a couple of assists. ""My main focus was to continue to be aggressive, and if I can't score, try to find other people to score."" Jeremy Lamb added 17 points and rookie Malik Monk finished with 13 points. Memphis held a 10-point lead with 7:57 remaining, but Walker re-entered the game and kick-started the Charlotte rally, which included an 18-4 run by the Hornets. Memphis couldn't catch Charlotte primarily because they made only 6 of 27 shots in the fourth, including 2 of 11 from outside the arc, many of them coming in the closing minutes as the Grizzlies tried to stop the Hornets rally. There were plenty of close shots missed by Memphis as well. ""Everything went wrong at the same time,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said of the Hornets outscoring Memphis 31-17 in the final period. ""It just seemed like we couldn't make a layup, when we had open layup. When we had open threes, we couldn't make open threes."" Tyreke Evans led Memphis with 19 points and 10 rebounds, while Mike Conley finished with 16 points. But Conley was a major part of a 34 percent shooting night for the Grizzlies missing 14 of his 18 shots in the game and all seven from outside the arc. James Ennis III and Dillon Brooks scored 11 points apiece. ""I really liked the fight,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. TIP-INS Hornets: Won their first road game this season. ... Monk had a nice representation of fans in the stands. His hometown of Lepanto, Arkansas is about 40 miles from Memphis. ... Walker had a team-high six assists and has led the Hornets in assists in each game this season. ... Dwight Howard had seven rebounds, the first time this season he has not reached double digits. Grizzlies: Memphis' last four home games have come against teams playing on the second night of a back-to-back. Charlotte defeated Orlando at home Sunday night. ... The game was Memphis' first of the season against an Eastern Conference team. ... C Marc Gasol was listed as questionable before the game with a bum left ankle, but played, finishing with 10 points. ... The Grizzlies bench continued to dominate opponents, outscoring the Hornets reserves 51-39. SHOOTING WOES: Neither team shot particularly well -- Memphis at 34 percent and the Hornets connecting on 42 percent. But that 42 percent marked the first time an opponent has shot above 40 percent against the Grizzlies at FedExForum in five home games this season. BIG MAN BATTLE The game featured two big, physical centers in Gasol and Howard, but neither showed their normal offensive production. Howard missed eight of his nine shots and both his free throws for 2 points, while Gasol was 4 of 15 from the field. ""Trust me,"" Gasol said, ""in 10 years, I still haven't met a player that wants to miss on purpose."" LOSING LEADS Despite suffering only their second loss, Memphis has squandered significant leads several times already this season. ""I know a lot of it is casual play, and that will get you burnt in this league. It's so easy to lose a lead with the way teams shoot the ball,"" Fizdale said.","400974847"
"NEW ORLEANS -- Marreese Speights held his follow-through as he watched his fifth 3-pointer in a six-minute span swish though. The 6-foot-10 forward then turned away with his lips pursed and three fingers extended on each of his hands, which he held down below his hips as he galloped triumphantly toward the other end. Speights highlighted an 18-point performance by hitting five of his career-high six 3-pointers during a decisive 22-6 run, and the Orlando Magic soundly defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 115-99 on Monday night. Speights' second 3 of the game made it 87-83 in the final minute of the third quarter. He drained four more early in the fourth, after which Orlando led 106-89. Magic coach Frank Vogel called it ""a luxury"" to have a front-court player like Speights who can score from the perimeter coming off the bench. During his first six games with Orlando this season, Speights attempted nine 3s, hitting three. He was clearly more confident in his shot in New Orleans, attempting 10 3s, often without hesitation and from a foot or two behind the 3-point line a couple times. ""When you see a guy come in and make every shot, you feel like it's your night,"" Magic small forward Evan Fournier said of Speights' effect on the game. ""So we're like, 'OK, we're not going to lose this game.'"" Speights' previous career high for 3s in a game was four. He said he was apprehensive during the early years of his NBA career to shoot from beyond the 3-point line, but starting doing so more about halfway through his second of three seasons with Golden State. ""When I come into the game, I feel like I'm hot, and to be able to have open shots like that, you've got to knock them down,"" Speights said. ""My teammates did great finding me."" And New Orleans did a poor job of contesting those shots, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""You've got to get in the air space and that takes effort,"" Gentry said. ""He shot too many open shots, if you ask me."" Nikola Vucevic, Jonathon Simmons and Fournier each scored 20 points for Orlando, which shot 50.6 percent (43 of 85) from the field and 47.1 percent (16 of 34) from 3-point range. Aaron Gordon added 17 points. Anthony Davis had 39 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans, which was coming off a lopsided victory over Cleveland on Saturday, but was unable to threaten the Magic during the final seven minutes. DeMarcus Cousins had 12 points and 12 assists for the Pelicans, and Jrue Holiday scored 11 points. ""They made us pay in the second half with all of the open 3s,"" Davis said. ""We did not correctly do the things we can control. We just need to come out with more energy on the defensive end."" TIP-INS Magic: Scored the first eight points of the game and led 33-24 after the first quarter, when Fournier hit three 3s and scored 11 of his points. ... Orlando came in averaging 117.2 points and has reached 113 in all seven of its games. Pelicans: Cousins, who entered the night second in the NBA in turnovers with five per game, had two passes intercepted in the first 3:31 and finished with six turnovers. ... The Pelicans were aiming for their first winning record since the last day of the 2014-15 season, which also was the last time they made the playoffs. RESILIENCE Fournier said winning on the second night of back-to-back games is ""the hardest thing to do in NBA basketball,"" and that the Magic should be proud to have done it twice already this season. The victory in New Orleans came a night after a loss in Charlotte. ""But we should have the same mindset all the time,"" Fournier added. ""That's the way we should play for 82 games."" UNFLATTERING NUMBERS The Pelicans made only seven of their 28 3-point attempts, hitting only 3 of 18 from deep in the second half, when they scored just 35 points after leading 64-40 at halftime. They also turned the ball over 20 times, leading to 25 Magic points. ""It just wasn't our night offensively, so we've got to do better the next game,"" said Holiday, who had six turnovers. ""We've got to be better taking care of the ball and I will personally get better.""","400974848"
"SALT LAKE CITY -- Rodney Hood was determined to find his groove after two fouls in the first quarter earned him an early seat on the bench. He found it in the third quarter when a quick floater jump-started a Utah Jazz comeback. Hood scored 15 of his season-high 25 points in the third quarter to help the Jazz rally to beat the Dallas Mavericks 104-89 on Monday night. ""Just aggressiveness,"" Hood said. ""My teammates were telling me to be more aggressive. The early foul trouble kind of threw me out of rhythm. Being more in attack mode. ""I knew I was going to get a chance to make an impact. ... I knew I was going to get into the flow."" The Mavs hit nine of 14 3-pointers in the first half and the Jazz struggled to defend their drive-and-kick action. But Utah came alive in the second half thanks to Hood and a 25-4 run to start the third quarter. The Jazz adjusted their defense in the second half and made things much more difficult for one of the best 3-point shooting teams in the league. The Mavericks were just 3 for 10 from behind the arc in the second half. ""That's what they're really good at, drive-and-kick to generate 3s as good as anybody in the league,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""The second half we did a good job of not over-helping. You've got to be able to guard your yard. When we do that and can defensive rebound, it gives us a chance to play offense in the flow of the game. When you're taking the ball out of the net, it's a lot harder. ""We did a better job of staying in front. Just man-on-man and being focused on it. Then Rudy's rim protection."" Dallas climbed back within five late in the fourth quarter, but an 11-0 run highlighted by a pull-up Hood 3-pointer from the top of the arc put the game away. Hood had just five first-half points. ""I'm not into moral victories about one good half played in an NBA game,"" Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. ""You've got to bring it for the whole game or you get beat. ""The second half was not just bad, it was unbelievable."" Ricky Rubio saw his shot begin to fall in the second half and finished with 20 points.

"PORTLAND, Ore. -- DeMar DeRozan credited Toronto's second unit for Portland's ugly second quarter. The Trail Blazers were held to just six total points -- Evan Turner's layup and four free throws -- in the period and Toronto went on to win 99-85 on Monday night. ""They did something big for us holding them to one field goal throughout the whole quarter,"" DeRozan said about the bench. ""It gave us a great opportunity to go out there and pull out this win."" DeRozan had 25 points to lead the Raptors, who were up by as many as 26 points. Kyle Lowry added a season-high 19 points and added 10 rebounds. ""Man, they did a great job of cutting off everything,"" Lowry said about the second unit. ""It was such an ugly slugfest in the second quarter."" The win extended Toronto's winning streak over Portland to five straight games. Damian Lillard had a season-high 36 points for the Blazers, who got within 13 in the final quarter. CJ McCollum, who had scored 20 or more points in each of Portland's first six games this season, had 16. Toronto was without center Serge Ibaka, who is averaging 15 points a game this season, because of swelling in his right knee. The knee started to bother him following a victory over the Lakers in Los Angeles on Friday. Jacob Poetl took his place in the starting lineup. The Raptors also missed Jonas Valanciunas for a fourth straight game with a left ankle sprain. Toronto's focused on defense throughout, coach Dwane Casey said. ""I mean, you're not going to stop a great player like Lillard or McCollum,"" Casey said. ""But our whole emphasis was to make them work for every inch of the court."" DeRozan had 15 points in the first quarter and the teams were knotted at 29 going into the second. DeRozan led the Raptors with 24 points in the 101-92 victory over the Lakers.

Portland's other four points in the quarter came from free throws and the Raptors led 54-35 at the break. The Blazers' six total points were a franchise low for the second quarter. ""It wasn't like they were unstoppable,"" Lillard said. ""They were scoring and we weren't."" Going back into the first quarter, the Blazers missed 20 straight shots over the miserable stretch. ""Brutal,"" Coach Terry Stotts said about the stretch. ""It was tough. I felt bad for them."" Lillard hit a pair of consecutive 3-pointers and a layup in the third quarter, but the Blazers couldn't make up much ground. The Raptors led 81-61 going into the final period. Portland went on a 10-5 run to open the fourth and close the gap to 86-71 with 8:55 left. Lillard added a 16-footer to cut the margin to 13.

"LOS ANGELES --  Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors had looked a tad vulnerable to start the new season. They had a 4-3 record and blew a 14-point second half lead at home to the Detroit Pistons on Sunday. One day later, the team played more like the defending champions, using a stifling defense to blow out the Los Angeles Clippers 141-113. It was Golden State's 11th consecutive win over Los Angeles. ""That looked like us,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. The Warriors got a terrific all-around game from Curry, who scored 31 points, hit seven of his 11 3-point attempts and added six assists and five rebounds. The Clippers (4-2) were the last team in the NBA to lose a game, but dropped their second straight despite 19 points from Danilo Gallinari and 17 from Lou Williams. The last time the Clippers defeated the Warriors was Christmas Day in 2014. ""I don't think they get enough credit defensively. It's amazing,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. ""Whenever we talk about Golden State, we only talk about their offense. And I think their defense is what sets them apart."" Though the Clippers try to run their offense through Blake Griffin, the power forward was quickly doubled whenever he touched the ball down low and struggled to get his shot off. He finished with 16 points on four of 10 shooting. ""They came pretty early,"" Griffin said. ""Some teams wait for the first dribble, some teams wait until you have a foot outside the lane. They doubled pretty early and pretty consistently throughout the game."" The Warriors had 37 assists on the night to 12 turnovers. They outrebounded Los Angeles 46-35 and outshot them, if only 89-86. ""Our whole thing is, if we get more field goal attempts than our opponent, there's a chance we're going to win,"" Kerr said. ""But we haven't been doing that. We came in averaging nine fewer attempts."" In addition to Curry, the Warriors got 19 points and seven rebounds from Kevin Durant, 16 points and nine rebounds from Draymond Green and 15 points and six assists from Klay Thompson. ""Our defensive effort really got us to where we wanted to be,"" Curry said. ""The coach gave us a challenge before the game to just try and win the possession and field-goal game. Throughout the course of the game, that was the key. We played Warriors basketball and now we have to sustain it."" TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said he supported Green after his forward was fined $25,000 for his part in a skirmish with Bullets guard Bradley Beal on Friday: ""He got attacked. I didn't agree with his punishment but all you can do as a team is accept it."" Clippers: Had entered game holding opponents to a league-low 92.4 points per game and a 40.4 field goal percentage shooting (second). Rivers said the superb early defense starts with having DeAndre Jordan at center, but new starting guards Patrick Beverley and Austin Rivers have been tough on the perimeter: ""Defensively, that combination has been really good."" WARRIORS DEFENSE On Monday, however, it was the Golden State defense that dominated. While the Warriors were shooting 58.4 percent from the field, they were holding the Clippers to 45.3 percent. ""Defensively, they had a field day,"" Rivers said. ""They got to every loose ball in the first half. They got to every offensive rebound, and every time they got one, they made a three. They're so unselfish.""","400974851"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  A strong first-half allowed the Indiana Pacers starters to rest for most of the second half. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 17 points to lead a balanced Indiana offense and help the Pacers to a 101-83 rout of the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night. The Pacers (4-3) scored the first nine points and built a 55-30 lead at the half. ""We got to do some cheering today,"" Pacers guard Victor Oladipo said of reserves receiving quality minutes in a blowout. Indiana second-year forward Domantas Sabonis, coming off a personal-best 22 points and 12 rebounds on Sunday, had a double-double in the first half with 10 points and 12 rebounds. He finished with a career-high 16 rebounds in addition to 12 points and five assists. Sabonis was actually sick the previous day. ""I laid in bed and tried to recover and get ready for today,"" he said. ""I'm just coming out there and proving to people that I can play."" Pacers coach Nate McMillan was particularly pleased with his team meeting the per game goal of 25 assists. ""We want that ball moving,"" he said. ""What we're trying to do is create other opportunities to where we get open looks as opposed to contested shots. If we're dishing out 25 assists or more, everybody is touching the ball and it's very difficult to defend that type of movement."" Rookie guard De'Aaron Fox led the Kings (1-6) off the bench with 18 points. Fox has already matched the loss total in his only college season at Kentucky, which finished 32-6. ""It's different,"" he said. ""For me, I've never really lost in my life. It's just a hump we need to get through."" TIP-INS Kings: Five different players have led Sacramento in scoring in seven games. This was the third time Fox has had the most points. ... They've been outrebounded in each of their six losses, and by a combined 283-198. Pacers: Oladipo, acquired with Sabonis in an offseason trade that sent All-Star guard Paul George to Oklahoma City, had led his team in scoring in the previous six games. . Third-year forward/center Myles Turner missed his sixth consecutive start due to a concussion and sore neck, but is close to returning after completing a normal practice workout on Tuesday. POINT SWITCH Each team has a starting point guard who used to suit up for the other side. Pacers point guard Darren Collison, in his second stint with Indiana, played the previous three seasons for the Kings. Indianapolis native and longtime Pacers fan favorite George Hill returned to face his hometown team, which traded the point guard to Utah in a three-team, offseason deal in 2016. Hill, who had played five seasons for the Pacers, signed with the Kings in the offseason and has averaged 9.8 points and 3.0 assists in five starts. Hill averaged a career-high 16.9 points for the Jazz last season. BOGDANOVIC TIMES TWO They share the same, unusual, lengthy last name, but aren't related. Small forward Bojan Bogdanovic, who signed as a free agent with the Pacers for his fourth NBA season, is from Croatia. Kings rookie shooting guard Bogdan Bogdanovic, three years younger at 25, is from Serbia.","400974852"
"NEW YORK --  When Brooklyn ran off 17 straight points to erase an 18-point deficit in the third quarter, Phoenix guard Devin Booker thought back to last season, when his teammates often bickered among themselves when they faced huge deficits. This time, the Suns remained steady. The Nets added another spurt to lead in the fourth quarter, but behind 32 points from Booker and a stellar final period by T.J. Warren, the Suns rallied to beat Brooklyn 122-114 on Tuesday night. ""We called a timeout and we came together,"" Booker said. ""Our problem last year, when teams used to go on a run, it used to be a domino effect. We used to get down on each other, start arguing."" Mike James had 24 points, and Warren scored 14 of his 20 points during the fourth for the Suns, who were up 83-65 with 5:58 to go in the third quarter after Booker pulled up with a 19-foot jumper. Then Brooklyn rallied, and Phoenix seemed headed for a disappointing defeat after Ronda Hollis-Jefferson's basket gave Brooklyn an eight-point lead with 6:35 left in the fourth. Before that, Suns interim coach Jay Triano had gambled on Warren, who started the fourth with five fouls, as Brooklyn's defense clogged Booker, who only managed two points in the last 12 minutes of the game. ""We had to risk putting him back in the game just to get our offense going,"" Triano said. ""When they lean all over Devin Booker, it opens up space for T.J., and he got us going in the fourth quarter when we needed baskets."" The Suns, who lost a tough one at Portland on Saturday, quickly answered with a 24-8 run for their first win on their five-game road trip. Phoenix outrebounded Brooklyn 66-44, with Alex Len coming off the bench to lead the way with 15. D'Angelo Russell scored 33 points and Hollis-Jefferson had 21 for the Nets, who've lost three straight after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers last Wednesday at home. ""We could do a better job,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. ""I feel like we should definitely make better decisions. At the end of the day, I put the blame on us."" Warren and James combined on a 7-0 run that closed the lead to 106-101 with 6:15, forcing the Nets to call a timeout. ""I thought Warren really hurt us,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""He had some big offensive rebounds at the end and we couldn't keep off him. I think Devin Booker attracts a lot of attention."" After a miss by the Nets, Warren tipped in Booker's failed layup to initiate a 9-0 run capped by Dragan Bender's 3-pointer that gave the Suns a 116-108 lead with 2:03 left in the game. MEMORIAL MOMENT A moment of silence was held prior to the national anthem at Barclays Center after a man in a rented pickup truck mowed down pedestrians and cyclists along a busy bike path near the World Trade Center memorial, killing at least eight and seriously injuring 11. LATE ARRIVAL The Suns' bus to the arena was delayed by the terror incident, which happened two blocks away from their hotel. TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix played for the fourth straight year on Halloween, improving to 8-9 on the holiday. ... Tyson Chandler grabbed 13 rebounds. Nets: Brooklyn has lost five straight games played on Halloween, dropping to 6-8, including 5-5 at home. ... Reserve forward Quincy Acy (left groin strain) missed his second straight game. ... Brooklyn committed a season-low seven points and edged the Suns 22-13 in fastbreak points.","400974853"
"MILWAUKEE --  Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder were met with little resistance as they kept attacking the lane. When the reigning NBA MVP didn't take it to the hoop himself, he found Steven Adams in the paint for an easy bucket. Other times, Paul George got his hands on the ball for a 3. Too many options for the Oklahoma City, and not nearly enough defense for the Milwaukee Bucks in the Thunder's 110-91 win on Tuesday night. ""Russ, Russ pushes the tempo,"" George said. ""Nobody can push him from the paint, and we're getting wide open looks."" George scored 20 points, hitting 4 of 8 from 3-point range. Westbrook had 12 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, while Carmelo Anthony scored eight of his 17 points in the pivotal first quarter. Oklahoma City went from down four to a 20-8 lead on George's jumper with 4:16 left in the first. It was essentially over from there, especially with the way Westbrook kept finding driving lanes. ""We really moved the ball well and we generated high-quality shots,"" coach Billy Donovan said. ""We got a little bit lax and had a couple of possessions we needed to clean up but I thought for the most part the guys did a good job of attacking their defense."" Adams finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. Jerami Grant added 17 points off the bench for the Thunder. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo had 28 points on 9-of-14 shooting. But the NBA's scoring leader spent much of the first quarter on the bench with two fouls, and the Bucks struggled from the 3-point line, opening 1 of 14. No other Buck scored in double figures. The star-laden Thunder taught a lesson to the up-and-coming Bucks, who hope to contend in the Eastern Conference. ""When we play the grown-ups, we've got to be ready, and we weren't,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""They played the grown-ups tonight."" BOGGED DOWN Oklahoma City prides itself on defense, with the Thunder came into the game averaging a league-high 11.5 steals. They were second in the league in forcing 19.7 turnovers a night. The Bucks coughed up the ball just 14 times but still came up well short. Khris Middleton (nine points, seven rebounds) struggled from the field, going 3 of 13 overall and missing all five 3-point attempts. Kidd said it will be up to Antetokounmpo's teammates to not try to force the ball to the star forward. ""Every night (the defense does) not want me to get into the paint,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I think I need to do a better job of getting into the paint and making plays for my teammates and for myself."" STAT LINES Grant finished 5 of 9 from the floor and scored 17 points for the first time since April 1, 2016. ... Milwaukee's Tony Snell had a team-high five assists, the first time that he had at least five since March 28, 2015. TIP-INS Thunder: George, Anthony, Adams and Westbrook combined for 48 first-half points. The quartet alone outscored the Bucks in the half, who trailed 60-42 at halftime. ... Among the star trio of Anthony, George and Westbrook, Anthony was the last to leave the floor for the night, playing until there were 6 minutes left in the game with the Thunder leading by 23. Bucks: The team had trouble getting anything going offensively with Antetokounmpo in foul trouble. Snell and Thon Maker hit back-to-back 3s late in the first half to end the 1-of-14 stretch. Milwaukee finished 9 of 30 for the night from behind the arc. ... C Greg Monroe's inside presence was missed. The veteran is out for at least another 12 days with a strained left calf. The 6-foot-11 Monroe helps open up the floor with his ability to score in the lane.","400974854"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers were locked in to deliver their best effort of the season. The Detroit Pistons were anything but ready, and the gap between the two mindsets was obvious. Julius Randle scored 17 points, Lonzo Ball added 13 and the Lakers smashed the Pistons 113-93 on Tuesday night. Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy was unsure about how his team might handle the adulation associated with a surprising 5-2 start, and those concerns proved to be well-founded in a loss he described as a ""humbling experience. ""There's nothing we did well and they dominated us,"" Van Gundy said. ""We had no fight in us. It was a bad, bad night."" The Lakers used a 16-5 run in the first quarter to take a lead they would never relinquish, eventually jumping out in front by as many as 23. Another superb defensive effort keyed the win, as the Lakers allowed three free-throws, the fewest in a game in franchise history. ""This is the way we want to play,"" said Lakers forward Brandon Ingram, who had 13 points. ""This is kind of the identity we want to bring every single game."" Larry Nance Jr. had 14 points and 12 rebounds for his third double-double for the Lakers, who had lost the previous three games against the Pistons. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 13 points in his first chance to play against the Pistons, who drafted him No. 8 overall in 2013. Tobias Harris and Reggie Jackson each had 18 points for the Pistons, who were unable to sweep their three-game California road trip. Andre Drummond had 10 points and 12 rebounds. Ball had a modest statistical performance, finishing with six rebounds and three assists, but Lakers head coach Luke Walton credited him with setting the tone. Ball was aggressive in attacking the paint to create an easy shot for himself or a teammate, and that unselfishness became infectious. Seven Lakers finished with double figures, and six had at least three assists. ""Take away the Phoenix game, this is the best game he's played I thought,"" Walton said. ""The way that his pace was, the way he pushed the ball all the time. He was in the other team's paint. He just set the tone and I thought the whole team fed off the way he was playing."" TIP INS Pistons: After allowing 24 fast-break points in their first seven games, the Pistons allowed the Lakers to get free for 17 points. . Ish Smith had 12 of the Pistons' 30 points off the bench. . Lakers: Rookie Kyle Kuzma finished with 16 points, scoring 10 points of the Lakers' 33 points in the second quarter. . Los Angeles improved to 14-4 against the Pistons at Staples Center. RANDLE'S ROLE Randle is thriving as an impact substitution this season. He showed it again by pacing the team in scoring despite playing just 17:25, the lightest workload for any Laker that finished with at least 10 points. ""He has just been playing with great energy,"" Walton said. ""He can change games and he did tonight with the way he came in."" Van Gundy credited the second-unit pairing of Randle and Kuzma for effectively putting the game out of reach in the second quarter. HALLOWEEN HIJINKS Lakers forward Corey Brewer arrived at Staples Center in costume as Spider-Man, while Caldwell-Pope dressed up as Steve Urkel from the 1990's TV sitcom ""Family Matters."" Caldwell-Pope said the Lakers were so successful because they were having fun, and he certainly did against his former team. ""We threw the first punch,"" Caldwell-Pope said. ""We kept our feet on the gas. We pushed the ball and got easy layups.""","400974855"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Malik Monk said his goal was just to bring a little energy to the Charlotte Hornets in the fourth quarter. The rookie from Kentucky did a whole lot more than that. Monk scored 16 of Charlotte's first 18 points in the fourth quarter to help the Hornets beat the Milwaukee Bucks 126-121 on Wednesday night for their third straight win. ""I can score,"" Monk said with a laugh. The Bucks learned that the hard way. Kemba Walker had 26 points, Monk scored 18 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and the Hornets put the clamps on the NBA's leading scorer, holding Giannis Antetokounmpo to a season-low 14 points and 13 rebounds. Antetokounmpo came in averaging 33.7 points per game, but struggled with foul trouble and was limited to five points in the final three quarters. Khris Middleton led Milwaukee with 43 points. Malcolm Brogdon added 20. But this was Monk's night. The Hornets trailed 86-85 when Antetokounmpo picked up his fifth foul with 36 seconds left in the third quarter. The Hornets went on a 21-9 tear behind Monk and fellow rookie Dwayne Bacon. Monk had four 3-pointers early in the fourth and Bacon made some clutch shots to help stretch the lead and finished with 10 points. When Antetokounmpo returned with 7:21 remaining, the Bucks were down 11 and could never regain the lead. ""I like shooting the ball, but attacking is going to help open everything else for my teammates,"" Monk said. The effort certainly impressed Bucks coach Jason Kidd. ""He made some great plays and you have to tip your hat to the rookie making shots,"" Kidd said. ""As we go forward we'll have a better scouting report, but we know he can shoot the ball and he can get going. He's done that in college and he did that tonight."" TIP INS Bucks: John Henson started for the first time this season over Thon Maker. ... Greg Monroe and Jabari Parker did not play due to injuries. Hornets: Walker recorded his 193rd 20-point game, passing Larry Johnson for the franchise record. ... Jeremy Lamb had 16 points and has scored at least 15 points in every game this season. ... Michael Kidd-Gilchrist played only seven minutes before leaving with an illness. ... Nic Batum, Michael Carter-Williams and Julyan Stone did not play due to injuries. MIDDLETON LIGHTS IT UP: The loss overshadowed a terrific night for Middleton, who was 15 of 28 from the field and made five 3-pointers to keep the Bucks close. ""It finally felt good to see multiple shots go down, but it would have felt a little bit better if we got the win,"" Middleton said. FOUL TROUBLE: As for Antetokounmpo, he could never seem to get into a rhythm after picking up two fouls in the first quarter. ""Any time you are going to have to sit and then you have to worry about picking up another foul, you can't be aggressive,"" Kidd said. ""He has to understand where they are going to try to get his next foul. Him and Khris and our bigs have been fouling at a very high rate. As a team we have been fouling at a very high rate. We have to do a better job at that."" Antetokounmpo said fatigue played a factor after playing the second night of a back-to-back. ""I just missed shots,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I think that was what happened tonight. I don't see any defense that affects me.  I can shoot over guys easily but there were no legs tonight."" CLIFFORD: DEFENSE AWFUL Despite the win, Hornets coach Steve Clifford was not happy with his team's defensive performance, saying that is not a formula for winning games. ""That's not a defensive game that's going to lead to consistent success in this league,"" Clifford said. WALKER'S BIG FIRST HALF Walker had an impressive first half, scoring 20 points on 6-for-7 shooting from the field, which included making all three 3-point attempts and all five of his free throws to give the Hornets a 60-57 lead at the break.","400974856"
"CLEVELAND --  There's not much more for the Cleveland Cavaliers to talk about. A day after a clear-the-air team meeting, LeBron James and his teammates didn't get any better. Thaddeus Young scored 26 points, Darren Collison had 25 and the Indiana Pacers sent Cleveland to its fourth straight loss, 124-107 on Wednesday night. James had 33 points and 11 assists, but it wasn't enough to keep Cleveland from losing for the fifth time in six games and falling to 3-5. James was upbeat following Sunday's 19-point loss to New York and pointed out it was still October. He was in a far less positive mood Wednesday, saying three times, ""It's a new month."" The Cavaliers held a lengthy meeting before Tuesday's practice to discuss their struggles, but the defending Eastern Conference champions have lost by a combined margin of 58 points in their losing streak. ""A lot of teams are playing well right now,"" James said. ""We're not. That's just a simple fact."" The Cavaliers still have issues to work out, especially on the defensive end. Cleveland led 69-68 in the third quarter, but Indiana hit four straight 3-pointers and built an eight-point lead. Indiana was 16 of 26 from 3-point range. Cleveland had allowed the second most 3-pointers in the league going into the game. Victor Oladipo scored 23 points for the Pacers. Bojan Bogdanovic added 17, and Domantas Sabonis had 15 points and 12 rebounds. Cleveland has battled injuries since training camp and was hit with another when forward Tristan Thompson left in the second quarter with a strained left calf. He exited the arena on crutches. The Cavaliers haven't looked like the team that has been in three straight NBA Finals since winning their first two games. ""No one's going to feel sorry for us,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""We've got to do it ourselves."" Indiana showed little effect from playing the second end of a back-to-back. The Pacers rolled past Sacramento 101-83 on Tuesday and led for most of the first half. ""It's a big win for this young team,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We knew Cleveland would come out with a sense of urgency after losing their last three."" Lance Stephenson was assessed a flagrant one in the second quarter for hitting James in the groin area as the four-time MVP drove to the basket. James spent several seconds on the baseline hunched over in pain before walking to the bench while the officials looked at the replay. James made both free throws, sparking an 11-0 run. Derrick Rose had 19 points while Kevin Love had 13 points and 13 rebounds. BAD NUMBER James tied a season high with eight turnovers. ""That's way too many,"" he said. ""I've been in the three or four range, but when you double that, that's not a good ingredient for your team to be successful."" GOOD BALANCE Each of Indiana's five starters scored in double figures and combined for 106 points. ""That's what we're doing, winning games by committee,"" Young said. ""We're moving the ball and trusting each other. I love playing with this team."" CLOSING IN James will likely reach two personal milestones Friday against Washington. He's eight points away from becoming the seventh player with 29,000 in his career. James can also extend his streak of double-figure scoring games to 800. The last time he didn't score 10 in a regular-season game was Jan. 5, 2007 in Milwaukee, where he had eight. TIP-INS Pacers: Bogdanovic took a knee to the head from Dwyane Wade, who was leaping trying to block his shot in the fourth quarter, but stayed in the game. ... C Myles Turner worked out before the game, but remains in the concussion protocol. Cavaliers: Thompson had eight rebounds and two points in 14 minutes. He had one point, no rebounds and four fouls in 19 minutes Sunday. ... G Iman Shumpert (sore right knee) has missed the last two games.","400974857"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid was bleeped on TV when Ben Simmons slapped him on the chest during another victorious postgame interview. The red band version of Simmons' highlight reel looked at times almost obscene to Atlanta: He switched from his left to right hand mid-air to score a bucket. Simmons let the ball roll high of his right fingertips for another uncontested score. And the exclamation point, a thunderous slam in the final minute that had fans standing and chanting ""Trust the Process!"" Simmons had 19 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists, and Embiid had 21 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to their third straight win, 119-109 over the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night. ""Yeah, I've gotta dunk more,"" Simmons said. ""I don't know. I just get out there and I'm like, uhh, these guys are pretty big. Once I start dunking it ..."" His thought trailed off but the Hawks -- and the rest of the NBA -- got the message. Simmons is the real deal. Simmons, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft, has lived up to his top billing in his rookie year. Simmons has scored in double figures in every game and flirted with his second triple-double. Simmons keeps saying he can play better -- but the 21-year-old guard has already joined Oscar Robertson as the only players in NBA history with 100 points, 50 rebounds and 40 assists in his first six games. Just how much more is he capable of the rest of the way? ""There's a lot more. Way more,"" he said. ""I think in a few years, it's going to be fun."" Robert Covington scored 22 points to help the Sixers (4-4) reach .500 for the first time in four years. The Sixers' rebuild more commonly known as ""The Process,"" isn't a success yet. But it's November and they don't have a losing record. The Sixers were fired up coming off wins on the road at Dallas and Houston and hit their first six 3s of the game. They led 25-8 and had everything going right in their first win at home this season. In coach Brett Brown's five seasons, the Sixers had not been at .500 since they were 5-5 on Nov. 15, 2013. They started that season 3-0 and lost the opener -- and many more after that -- in each successive season. Dennis Schroder scored 25 points and Taurean Prince had 17 for the woeful Hawks. ""We've got to find a way to eliminate the slow start,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. TIP-INS Hawks: G Malcolm Delaney left with a sprained right ankle. He scored eight points. ... The Hawks opened the fourth 0 for 11 with four turnovers. 76ers: Dario Saric was in the starting lineup for the third straight game and JJ Redick started after he missed the last two games with tightness in his back. ... The Sixers had 12 assists on 14 baskets in the first quarter. OKAFOR OUT Jahlil Okafor, the No. 3 pick of the 2015 draft, wants out after the Sixers declined to pick up his fourth-year contract option for next season. Buried on the bench, Okafor said he didn't want the Sixers to pick up his option and is ready for a fresh start. His request to team president Bryan Colangelo that the Sixers buy out the final year of the contract was declined. ""I'm just in a position to where, how can I get on the court,"" he said. ""That's not happening here and I want to play. Bryan knows that, I've talked with him about it. And now it's tough because my option didn't get picked up. Teams are not really looking to give up anything when somebody can walk out the door at the end of the season."" Okafor was selected by former team president Sam Hinkie as a sort of insurance policy in case Embiid could never recover from injuries that cost him the first two seasons of his career. With Embiid sidelined, Okafor led the Sixers in scoring as a rookie with 17.5 points. But injuries limited to him to 50 games last year and he was dropped from the rotation this season. Okafor is healthy and has played just one game this season. The 21-year-old Okafor, out of Duke, is frustrated but said he will remain professional about the situation. ""This is my life. This is my career. I'm not getting the opportunity here, which is fine,"" he said. ""The team looks great. I'm not a part of that. I want the team to do great things, but at the same time, I want to play."" Okafor would have been owed $6.3 million in 2018-19. Okafor has avoided trouble since his rookie season was marred by a series of incidents that included a two-game suspension for his role in a Boston street fight. Okafor hoped a contract buyout would let him latch on with a team and play this season. ""Bryan didn't think that would be a good idea because he said he'd be giving me away to a team for free,"" he said. ""But that's pretty much where we stand right now."" Brown said Okafor wasn't in the rotation for defensive reasons and out of deference to veteran backup Amir Johnson.","400974858"
"WASHINGTON -- There's a renewed belief around the Phoenix Suns. It's no wonder why, the way T.J. Warren is playing. Warren scored 28 of his career-high 40 points in the second half to continue a strong road trip, and the Suns overcame a 22-point deficit to beat the Washington Wizards 122-116 on Wednesday night. ""He just seems to be thriving with the attention that everyone pays to everyone else,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said. ""He has the ability to score and break guys down one on one, so we try to give him as much space as we can."" Warren finished 16 of 22 (72.7 percent) from the floor also had 10 rebounds. A night earlier, he scored all 20 of his points in the second half of a 122-114 win at Brooklyn. Eight games into the season, he has posted two of the top four scoring games in his four-year career. Devin Booker added 22 points to help the Suns improve to 4-1 under Triano, following an 0-3 start that led to Earl Watson's firing. ""With everything that was going on we just had to look ourselves in the mirror and just realize that this is on us,"" Warren said about the early upheaval. The Suns tied a season best with 37 points in the second quarter, then followed that with 35 each in the third and fourth against a Wizards team that couldn't regain their first-half intensity. Bradley Beal scored a season-high 40 points for Washington. John Wall added 21 points, and Marcin Gortat had 13 rebounds for Washington, which was without starters Otto Porter (illness) and Markieff Morris (suspension). The Wizards have given back double-digit leads in all three of their home games this season, though they won the first two. They also gave away an 18-point, third-quarter lead in of last Friday's loss at Golden State. ""For us to sit here and act like we're somebody, we're not,"" said Beal. ""We haven't proven nothing, we haven't done nothing. So we've got to stay aggressive at all times. We've got to realize that we're a targeted team."" The Suns closed their deficit to 12 by the end of the second quarter, cut it to five early in the third, surged ahead during a 21-10 run that stretched into the fourth, and then rode Warren in the final stages. Warren gave the Suns the lead for good, 109-108, when he absorbed Beal's foul and converted a three-point play. He followed with baseline 3 made to make it a four-point game and a jumper to make it 116-110 with 1:29 left. ""It was me just cutting the basket and getting open layups."" said Warren. ""Just me being T.J."" COULD'VE FOOLED US Triano suggested it's been a steep curve to re-learn the NBA head coaching role. He also took the helm of the Toronto Raptors from 2008-2011. ""It's a little hectic, a little bit different,"" Triano said before the game. ""I like basketball. I don't like doing this (interviewing) stuff, the meetings with GMs, and agents and players. I love the Xs and Os."" ACTIVE, BUT NOT The Wizards activated Morris (sports hernia) for the first time this season in order to serve a one-game suspension for leaving the bench during a scuffle Friday night.

He fouled out with 2:58 to play. ... Despite playing on the road, Phoenix led 38-30 in free throw opportunities. Wizards: With Porter out, F Jason Smith made his second start for Washington. ... Wall received his first technical foul of the season for his reaction following a made layup in the second quarter. He was tied for second in the NBA last season with 15.","400974859"
"BOSTON --  Jaylen Brown has already figured out he'll receive a lot less attention from opposing defenses when he's on the floor with Kyrie Irving. Brown has also realized he'll get some open shots, too. Brown scored 22 points on 7-of-8 shooting in three quarters, and the Boston Celtics coasted past the skidding Sacramento Kings 113-86 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight victory. ""Kyrie and (Al) Horford are going to draw so much attention, especially Kyrie,"" Brown said. ""I'm just licking my chops anytime they double-team Kyrie. I'm just trying to be as ready as possible to take the pressure off them."" Irving also scored 22 for the Celtics, who posted their 11th consecutive win over the Kings in Boston, dating to their last loss on Jan. 19, 2007. Terry Rozier added 12 points, and Daniel Theis had 10 points with 10 rebounds. ""You know what was interesting? I thought that he only took eight shots, but obviously 22 points on eight shots is great,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said about Brown. ""I thought that he took all the right ones."" Buddy Hield scored 17 points and Zach Randolph 16 for the Kings, who lost their sixth in a row -- the last three by an average of 24 points. ""Despite these losses, I think we're playing better. We're moving the ball, playing with each other,"" Hield said. ""It can mentally break you down. We've just got to be mentally strong each and every day."" Boston led 58-45 at halftime and took complete control early in the third quarter, pushing it to 66-47 on Irving's second 3-pointer in the opening two minutes. Brown hit consecutive 3-pointers 27 seconds apart during a 17-2 run that made it 87-56 late in the third. Irving had seven points during the spree, including his third from beyond the arc in the quarter. The Celtics led 89-60 after three. TIP-INS Kings: Have been held to 100 points or fewer in four of their seven losses. . Sacramento was outrebounded 52-26 and shot only 43 percent. ""We just struggle to score,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""When you play a team that can score, sometimes that inability lets them be even more free and more loose."" Celtics: F Marcus Morris, who has not played this season due to a sore left knee, worked ""really hard"" on Wednesday and the team expects to see him play ""sooner than later,"" Stevens said. Morris is scheduled to go on the upcoming road trip. HAYWARD UPDATE Stevens talked about star Gordon Hayward's progress from a gruesome broken left ankle suffered in the team's opener at Cleveland. ""He's going to be in a boot for however long,"" the coach said. ""It's going to be a while before he's allowed to put any weight on it."" Stevens said Hayward is in ""good spirits"" and ""has been doing his chair shooting every day."" The injured forward has visited the team's practice facility a few times. STAY CALM Joerger talked about the need to stay positive before the game despite his team's rough start. ""I try not to hit them over the head every timeout, being negative,"" he said, breaking into a smile. ""Very rarely have I lost it this season, which I think you can do twice a season -- you can go temporarily insane. ""This is about where we're going to be two years from now. I have to look at it in a broader lens on a day-to-day basis.""","400974860"
"MIAMI --  Erik Spoelstra seems to get the same birthday present from his team every year. He is not complaining. Goran Dragic scored 20 points, Tyler Johnson added 19 and the Miami Heat beat the Chicago Bulls 97-91 on Wednesday to snap a three-game slide. It also marked the fourth consecutive year that the Heat played and won on their coach's birthday -- Spoelstra is now 47, celebrating that on the same day he and his wife publicly announced they are expecting their first child. ""It was good to finally get a result ... get a little bit closer to our identity,"" Spoelstra said. ""I liked all the emotions we had to go through. These guys want to win so badly."" There clearly were emotions: Miami was up 15 early, trailed by six midway through the third, then used a 32-12 run down the stretch to finally put the game away. Hassan Whiteside returned from a five-game absence with a bruised knee and scored 13 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for the Heat, who went 3-3 on their six-game homestand. ""It was a roller-coaster game,"" Dragic said. ""We're happy how we bounced back."" Lauri Markkanen scored 25 points and Robin Lopez added 22 for the Bulls, who were 7 for 28 from 3-point range and got five of those makes in the final 2 minutes. Chicago fell to 1-5, matching its worst start since 2007-08. Markkanen also grabbed eight rebounds. ""We had a couple good days of practice, competed a lot,"" Markkanen said. ""It definitely showed today, but just wasn't good enough to win."" Dion Waiters also scored 13 for the Heat, who were without starting forward James Johnson -- a late scratch with right knee tendinitis. Miami was rolling early, up 20-6 after 8 minutes and 35-20 midway through the second quarter. The Bulls started 1 for 10 from the floor, and Whiteside had eight rebounds in the game's first 4:50. A 24-10 run by Chicago tied the game late in the half, seven of those field goals by the Bulls coming in close proximity to the rim. Chicago led by as many as six in the third and probably should have been up more, but missed five shots at the rim late in the quarter. ""Certainly something we can build on,"" said Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg, who raved about his team's effort after the slow start. The Heat reclaimed the lead with a 10-1 run to end the third, then kept it the rest of the way. And now Miami's six-game homestand is followed by a six-game trip that starts Friday. ""We're happy with the win, especially before this long road trip,"" Dragic said. ""It's getting there."" TIP INS Bulls: Chicago tinkered with its lineup, starting David Nwaba instead of Paul Zipser. Hoiberg is exploring combinations ahead of the looming return of Bobby Portis (suspension). ... The Bulls' 14-point deficit was their largest in a first quarter this season. ... Justin Holiday started 1 for 13. Heat: Whiteside made his 200th Heat appearance. ... The Heat play at home three times the rest of November, and have 17 of their next 24 on the road. ... Justise Winslow made his first shot, giving him seven straight makes over three games. NEW ERA Wednesday marked the first time since March 26, 2003, that the Heat and Bulls played and Dwyane Wade wasn't on either roster. Miami and Chicago played 71 times between 2003-04 and last season; Wade played for Miami in 64 games, sat out four and played for Chicago in three last season. SPO STATS Among the 30 current NBA coaches, only San Antonio's Gregg Popovich has held his job longer than Spoelstra. But there are only nine coaches younger than the Spoelstra: Luke Walton, Tyronn Lue, Brad Stevens, Dave Joerger, former Heat assistant David Fizdale, Frank Vogel, Jason Kidd, Michael Malone and Hoiberg.","400974861"
"NEW YORK --  The struggles stopped for the Houston Rockets once they got to New York. Nothing gets the Rockets right like a game in an arena where they keep on winning. ""You're in the Garden man, you got to bring it,"" James Harden said. ""The lights are on, so guys played well."" Harden had 31 points and nine assists, and the Rockets had their 3-pointers falling again in a 119-97 victory over the Knicks on Wednesday night. Harden made six 3-pointers and the Rockets hit 19 to bounce back after two straight losses. ""Well, it's a lot easier to make a 3 when you're up seven instead when you're down seven and you're trying to make every shot that's got to count and you're also giving up points at the other end,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. Ryan Anderson added 21 points for the Rockets. They won their eighth straight at Madison Square Garden, a streak that lasts so long that D'Antoni was the Knicks' coach last time they beat Houston at home, back on Jan. 26, 2009. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 23 points for the Knicks, but Kristaps Porzingis was held to 19 as their three-game winning streak was snapped. Porzingis had scored 30 in five of the first six games, including a career-high 38 in a victory over Denver on Monday night, and came in third in the league with 29.3 per game. The Rockets arrived in New York struggling a bit, particularly from long range. Houston had been held below 30 percent from behind the arc already four times, including 28 percent in its loss to Philadelphia on Monday night, and hasn't had a 40 percent night yet. D'Antoni said the Rockets' data showed they were getting similar 3-point attempts as last season, when they set an NBA record for makes, but they just hadn't been nearly as accurate. They finished at 36.5 percent Wednesday -- but only after they cooled off to a 2-for-12 final quarter with the outcome decided. New York led 30-24 early in the second before Houston ran off 16 straight points to go up by 10, and cruised from there. ""I think they did a really good job of running in transition and creating something for their teammates and then just shooting 3s,"" Porzingis said. ""And that's really hard to stop."" TIP-INS Rockets: Houston scored 36 points in the second quarter and 40 in the third. ... Clint Capela finished with 12 points and 13 rebounds. ... Eric Gordon had 17 points and Trevor Ariza 16. Knicks: The Knicks have three games remaining on a five-game homestand, their longest of the season. ... New York is 0-3 when scoring fewer than 100 points. ... Rookie Frank Ntilikina led the Knicks with eight assists, his season high. ONE-SIDED RIVALRY The Rockets beat the Knicks for the 23rd time in the last 25 meetings. Houston has swept the series in 10 of the last 12 seasons. CHANGE OF PLANS The Rockets decided to cancel their morning shootaround at Madison Square Garden because of the difficulty of getting to the arena from their hotel. They are staying in Battery Park, near where eight people were killed Tuesday when a man drove his truck onto a bike path, and the investigation was ongoing Wednesday morning. D'Antoni said they had the bus ready to take them and figured it wasn't worth it. ""There was no chance to get here and no use being on the bus for two hours for that,"" he said.","400974862"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Aaron Gordon wasn't the first option on the Orlando Magic's game-winning play, but he came through when he got the ball. Gordon made a 3-pointer with 52 seconds left to erase Memphis' only lead of the fourth quarter as the Magic beat the Grizzlies 101-99 on Wednesday night. The assist on the 23-footer that gave the Magic a 100-99 lead came from Evan Fournier, for whom the play initially was designed. ""There was some sort of miscommunication on their part,"" Gordon said of the Grizzlies' defense that initially left him open under the basket. ""I saw Evan start to drive and I had to relocate. I got to the 3-point line and knocked it down."" Then Gordon had to endure watching Memphis rookie Dillon Brooks misfire on an open 3 with five seconds left. ""I for sure thought that game was over. I thought they had won,"" Gordon said of Brooks' shot. ""You could pack it up. ... I for sure thought that ball was going to go straight to the rim, and that was going to be the end of the game."" Fournier led the Magic with 22 points, while Gordon finished with 19. Terrence Ross added 15 points to help Orlando win for the fifth time in six games. Orlando held leads throughout the fourth quarter, by no more than five points after the first minutes of the period. But Memphis could only take the lead once -- at 99-97 -- on a floating bank shot by Marc Gasol with 1:04 left. Gordon's game-winning 3 gave the Magic the lead back for good, although Orlando committed three of its 24 turnovers in the final 36.2 seconds. ""We got very lucky down the stretch, but that's the game of basketball,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. Tyreke Evans led the Grizzlies with 32 points, while Gasol finished with 22 points and nine rebounds. James Ennis III scored 14 points for Memphis, which played without started point guard Mike Conley, who is nursing a sore left Achilles. Despite taking the late lead and even having a chance to win, Memphis coach David Fizdale said his team deserved to lose for multiple reasons. ""You cannot mess with the basketball gods. I deeply believe that,"" Fizdale said. ""Our huddles were a joke. Our communication was ridiculous. No one owned anything. ""The most frustrating part about it was, that's a game we had in our grips."" TIP-INS Magic: Fournier connected on a 3-pointer in the first quarter and now has made a 3 in 33 straight games, third-longest active streak in the league. ... The Magic have made a 3-pointer in 828 consecutive games. ... G D.J. Augustin left late in the first half with a left hamstring strain and did not return. .Fournier has scored at least 20 points in seven of the Magic's eight games this season. Grizzlies: Evans' 32 points, was his first 30-point performance since scoring 34 points against Golden State on December 14, 2014. ... Mario Chalmers started in Conley's spot, his first start of the season. ... Gasol, as he was in Monday's game against Charlotte, was listed as questionable with a left ankle problem, but played. LONG TIME COMING The win snapped Orlando's nine-game losing streak in Memphis. The Magic had not won on the Grizzlies' home floor since Jan. 23, 2008. Orlando is 3-14 in road games against the Grizzlies since the team moved from Vancouver. CONLEY SITS An explanation may have emerged for Mike Conley's recent erratic play. The point guard is nursing a sore left Achilles. Conley has made only 13 of 51 shots over the previous three games, including 2 of 18 from outside the arc. ""He was trying to play through a lot of pain in that same area,"" Fizdale said. ""I just felt like, it's early in the season, and there's no need to push something like that.""","400974863"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Jimmy Butler insisted he wasn't merely trying to earn foul shots when he faked Pelicans guard E'Twaun Moore into the air, 20 feet from the basket, with the score tied in the final minute. ""I was trying to get a bucket,"" Butler said, agreeing that it wasn't an easy shot with the 6-foot-4 Moore coming down on him as he put up his jumper. ""It's crazy to me, though, because I make the hard ones, but I cannot make wide-open jump shots to save my life right now."" Butler can worry about that later. His go-ahead shot as he was fouled with 34 seconds left highlighted a 23-point performance and lifted the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 104-98 victory over New Orleans on Wednesday night. Andrew Wiggins scored 18 points and stole the ball from Jrue Holiday with 24 seconds left to help seal the victory for Minnesota, which lost a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter before winning its third straight. Perhaps the most hopeful sign for Minnesota, which is trying to make the playoffs for the first time since 2004, is that the Wolves won despite 22 turnovers and the fact that Karl-Anthony Towns, limited by foul trouble, scored only two points. ""It's a different feeling. We've got a different confidence level,"" Towns said, his constant smile, up-beat tone and subtle dance steps while grabbing grub from a buffet table in the locker room indicating how pleased he is to be on a team that can win when he has a rough game. ""I'll tell you one thing. It's damn good to leave with a W,"" Towns said. ""Statistics don't matter. It's about making sure the team's successful."" DeMarcus Cousins had 35 points and nine rebounds, and the Pelicans tied it at 96 when Cousins bounced a pass to Anthony Davis cutting down the lane for a two-handed dunk. Davis had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Holiday added 14 points for New Orleans, which has lost two straight. ""We're still a team figuring each other out and figuring out what's best for us and what's the best spots to put guys in,"" Cousins said. ""But I'm extremely confident in this team."" New Orleans trailed 92-80 before Cousins and Tony Allen each scored six points during a 14-4 run to tie it with 2:22 to go. That comeback bid was ""definitely a sign that shows me this is a team that doesn't stop fighting. That's a plus for any team,"" Cousins said. ""We just need to fix a lot of minor things."" Taj Gibson had 11 points and 12 rebounds to help the Timberwolves outrebound the Pelicans 47-38. Gorgui Dieng and Nemanja Bjelica scored 12 points apiece as Minnesota shot 49.4 percent (41 of 83). TIP INS Timberwolves: Towns had to sit with three fouls with 8:49 left in the second quarter after he caught Cousins across the face with his left hand. He didn't score his first points until his put-back dunk with less than five minutes left. The third-year pro out of Kentucky has never been shut out. ... Jamal Crawford, who had 11 points, closed out the first quarter by banking in a 39-foot shot from the mid-court circle. ... The Timberwolves led for most of the first half, shooting 60.5 percent (26 of 43) and going up by as many as 12 points when Butler's dunk made it 60-48. Pelicans: Allen had a season-high 10 points in 19 minutes off the bench. ... The Pelicans fell to 1/3 at home after the second loss of a three-game home stand. ... Cousins, who entered the game with 36 turnovers, had six in the first half and finished with eight of New Orleans' 19 total turnovers. OFF TARGET Cousins tied a career high with five 3-pointers, but missed his last three. The rest of the Pelicans were 3 of 21 combined from deep. Of the Pelicans' 31 3s, coach Alvin Gentry said, ""28 of them were really good looks and shots that you have to knock down."" QUOTABLE ""Thibs is never happy. Come on now. Don't write that. That's fake news,"" Towns said when asked whether coach Tom Thibodeau would be happy after two straight close road wins improved his club to 5-3. But Thibodeau could be seen smiling as Towns chatted with him near the locker room exit shortly afterward.","400974864"
"DENVER --  Nikola Jokic received some playful ribbing for his errant, behind-the-back pass on a fast break late in the first half. On this night, that was about all that went wrong for the Denver Nuggets. Jamal Murray scored 16 of his 24 points in a decisive third-quarter spurt, Jokic added 16 rebounds and 10 assists while narrowly missing a triple-double, and the Nuggets beat the Toronto Raptors 129-111 on Wednesday. ""We moved the ball and were unselfish, made a lot of cuts, made the defense work,"" said Murray, who has scored at least 20 in three straight games. ""We kept playing our game and they tried to play to our pace."" Paul Millsap added 20 points in his best offensive output since joining the Nuggets. He signed a three-year, $90 million deal with Denver in July, but has recently struggled with his jumper. Millsap had 13 points in the first quarter, including two 3-pointers, to jump-start the Nuggets early. ""He was really aggressive,"" Jokic said of his fellow big man. ""We just continued to play aggressive."" Now, about that pass to Wilson Chandler just before halftime: Jokic was dribbling down the court, had a defender on him and tried to loft it behind his back to Chandler for a highlight-reel dunk. Only, it was a bit too high. ""I thought he could jump. He's an athletic guy,"" Jokic teased in the locker room. ""My fault,"" Chandler quickly responded. Murray broke loose in the third to help turn a 60-51 lead into a 36-point advantage in a matter of minutes. The 43 points in the third marked the biggest quarter for the Nuggets this season. Jokic finished with eight points and didn't play over the final 7:41. Not that he minded missing out on his seventh career triple-double. ""I couldn't make shots today,"" said Jokic, who was 4 of 10 from the field. ""I didn't force it. I tried to do some other stuff."" Norman Powell led the Raptors with 14 points as they made their fifth stop on a six-game road swing, their longest of the season. ""That was an embarrassing performance by all of us, from coaches to players,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""One thing we said:  You've got to come in here and compete and play hard, play a physical game, and we didn't do either one on either end of the floor."" Murray was briefly checked out by trainers in the first quarter after flying into the courtside seats while trying to steal a pass. He landed about three rows back and in the vicinity of Colorado Avalanche forward Matt Duchene. In the process, Murray also spilled a beer and had to make a quick trip into the locker room to change jerseys. ""I smelled like Heineken,"" he said. TIP-INS Raptors: Delon Wright had 12 points off the bench. ... Kyle Lowry finished with nine points. Nuggets: F Juancho Hernangomez missed a sixth straight game with mononucleosis. ""I do not anticipate him being back for a few weeks,"" coach Michael Malone said. .... Broncos LB Von Miller showed up wearing an Avalanche hockey sweater bearing his No. 58. ... Denver connected on 16 3-pointers to start a six-game homestand. MID-RANGE MAN Malone called DeMar DeRozan the ""king of the mid-range jumper."" DeRozan shot 4 of 10 to finish with a season-low 10 points for Toronto. ""DeMar does it in a different way,"" Casey said. ""He still gets to the free throw line. He gets a three the old-fashioned way."" HIGH PRAISE Casey said Jokic's game reminds him of Dallas standout Dirk Nowitzki. ""As far as his range and size, the way he gets the ball up on his shot. You can't get to it,"" Casey said. ""You have to have extraordinary reach to get to his shot. They do some special things to try to create space for him."" UPSET Malone wasn't pleased with his team allowing 40 points in the fourth quarter even if the game was well in hand. ""Unacceptable,"" he said. ""I don't care what the score is, how much you're up. Our defense the last six minutes was embarrassing.""","400974865"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Faith became the keyword in Quin Snyder's postgame press conference. The Utah Jazz coach talked about his faith in rookie Donovan Mitchell, his faith in Ricky Rubio and his faith in his team. Mitchell scored a career-high 28 points and the Jazz beat the Portland Trail Blazers 112-103 in overtime Wednesday night. The game was tight throughout, with 17 lead changes and 14 ties -- and neither team ever leading by double-digits. ""The game wasn't real fluid for either team offensively early on,"" Snyder said. ""We hung in there and didn't get discouraged. As the game progressed, were much more aggressive. ""You have faith in someone when they're not playing well. That's what we have to have in this team."" The Jazz ran their offense through Mitchell in overtime and he didn't disappoint. The No. 12 overall pick accounted for the first six Utah points with a 3-pointer, a pair of free throws and Rudy Gobert's two free throws that Mitchell set up with a pass to the cutting big man. ""I didn't think it would happen this fast,"" Mitchell said. ""It was definitely surreal. Plays ran for me, just a matter of hitting the shots."" Rubio, who finished with a season-high 30 points, buried a 3-pointer from the top of the arc with 30.9 seconds left in overtime to give the Jazz a seven-point lead and put the game away. The two Utah guards were fantastic down the stretch after the Jazz struggled on the offensive end. ""Each thing has to be better and a little bit sharper,"" Blazers guard Damian Lillard said. ""We can take pressure off each other by screening a little bit better, throwing better passes on time and on target. ""I think part of it is our execution. We've got to get to our spots, we've got to scrape for each other, we've got to sprint and make hard cuts and just be strong with the ball."" Lillard put the Blazers on his shoulders in the fourth quarter, but was kept in relative check in overtime. The two-time All Star finished with 33 points, and Jusuf Nurkic had a season-high 19 points. The Blazers cleared out for Lillard on the final possession of regulation, but Gobert blocked his floater as time expired. ""When you have a six-point lead, or whatever we had, with two or three minutes to go,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said, ""you've got to make the plays to hold the lead and come out with a win. We didn't do that."" TIP-INS Blazers: Portland entered the game ranked No. 6 in the league allowing 98.3 points per game. Stotts said that's been the focus this season and their effectiveness has been more mental that schematic. ... Portland shot a season-low 26.5 percent from 3-point range. Jazz: Rodney Hood was 0 for 11 two days after scoring a season-high 25 points. He was benched down the stretch. ... Thabo Sefelosha scored a season-high 15 points. ... The Jazz reserves outscored their Blazers counterparts 54-20. ... Gobert finished with 16 points, 10 rebounds and three blocked shots. BUDDING FRIENDSHIP Lillard and Mitchell have become friends in the last year and text regularly. Lillard said he liked Mitchell's game at Louisville and noticed that he wore Lillard's Adidas signature shoe. He texted Mitchell congratulations after the draft and had hoped the rookie would slide to Portland in the draft. The two went head-to-head on numerous occasions throughout the night. ""Love going head to head with a guy who loves to compete,"" Mitchell said. ""It was kind of crazy how all that came out. ... You learn from stuff like that in big moments. It felt like he was coasting all game and I looked at the score and he had 33."" NO JOE Jazz forward Joe Johnson is out at least two weeks with right wrist instability. Jonas Jerebko, who had only played four minutes in the first seven games, checked in early in the first quarter and will see more time in the rotation. ""Jonas is going to play, we need him to play,"" Snyder said. ""As the game goes on, we've had to feel (out) the game. There isn't clarity. It's not hockey. We don't just sub rote. ... The game is going to dictate minutes for our team for the majority of the guys.""","400974866"
"LOS ANGELES --  Clippers coach Doc Rivers keeps saying that with nine new players and so many injuries, he hasn't had time to install much of a half-court offense. So his early message has been simple -- keep moving the ball and run at every opportunity. That worked well enough Wednesday night, when the Clippers beat the Dallas Mavericks 119-88 to snap a two-game losing streak. ""This is the first game in three games that we got our pace back,"" Rivers said. ""When our guards are going downhill, then that tells you our pace is back."" The Clippers are adjusting to life without point guard Chris Paul (traded to the Rockets) and his replacement, the injured Milos Teodosic. It doesn't hurt their cause that they have several players who excel at passing the ball, from holdovers Blake Griffin and Austin Rivers, to newcomers Danilo Gallinari, Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams. ""We have more fast, athletic guys than we had last year,"" Austin Rivers said. ""When we play at that speed, it's hard to guard us."" The Clippers were given a lesson in speed in their previous game Monday, a 141-113 pasting by the NBA's premier running team, the champion Golden State Warriors. The Mavs are hardly in the class with the Warriors right now, falling to 1-8 with their fourth consecutive loss. On Wednesday, they started veteran guard Devin Harris in a failed effort to add some spark. ""Everything is an attempt to try and get out of this rut,"" Harris said. ""We have to get back to playing simple basketball."" The Clippers spread their offense around. Griffin had 20 points, seven assists and six rebounds. Austin Rivers added 19 points, Williams 17 points and Gallinari 14 points, six rebounds and four assists. The Clippers outscored the Mavs 48-26 in the paint and outrebounded them 48-38. ""We had a couple of catastrophic turnovers that got them going in their building,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Before you knew it, we're playing out of a hole again. Our margin for error is extremely slim."" Rookie Dennis Smith Jr. led Dallas with 18 points despite shooting just 6 for 15 from the field. Harrison Barnes added 14 points and Dirk Nowitzki had 13 points and eight rebounds. TIP-INS Mavericks: Averaged only 98.3 points per game during their first eight games. Said Carlisle: ""When you keep losing the possession game, it's very tough to win. We have to get consistency with rebounding and turnovers. We have to get better in all areas."" Clippers: After shooting 29.9 percent in his first five games with Los Angeles, Gallinari was 8 for 15 against the Warriors on Monday. Doc Rivers said he was playing it low key with his new forward: ""All I told him was to keep shooting it. Nobody ever told me that."" AFTERNOON DELIGHT The Clippers next play back-to-back 12:30 p.m. games at Staples Center on Saturday and Sunday. Doc Rivers is less than thrilled. ""Those are tricky games,"" Rivers said. ""We have to be ready for them. They're tough. They sneak up on you so quick."" Rivers said he had asked the league not to schedule back-to-back afternoon games. ""We did, and it worked so well,"" he said. ""I had one request after the season -- no back-to-back afternoon games. And they said, OK. And they gave it to us anyway.

"SAN ANTONIO --  Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are already thinking about Golden State's postseason possibilities. The Warriors' slow start could be a byproduct of that early daydreaming. Klay Thompson scored 27 points, Durant had 24 and the Warriors overcame a lethargic first half to beat injury-riddled San Antonio 112-92 on Thursday night, handing the Spurs their fourth straight loss. Curry added 21 points for Golden State in its first meeting against San Antonio since sweeping the Western Conference finals en route to the NBA title. ""Me and (Durant) were talking about it on the bench tonight,"" Curry said. ""It is tough to still be Nov. 1st or 2nd and be looking forward to April, May, June. But having gone through the experience last year and three years ago and understanding what it takes to win a championship, it's kind of cliche, but every game you can learn a little bit something about yourself and continue to build great habits to get there."" One lesson is staying focused against the Spurs, even as the five-time champions face their own struggles. San Antonio played without Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker, as they did in the conference finals. Unlike those blowout victories, the Warriors struggled to close out the Spurs. ""We might as well start every game here down 20,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""Other than the playoffs last year, that will be four or five straight games where that happened. You have to be able to match the Spurs' intensity, especially because they're such a good rebounding team."" The Warriors took their first lead two minutes into the third quarter at 60-57 on Durant's 3-pointer. Durant missed his first eight shots and the Spurs made six 3-pointers in the first quarter in bolting to an early double-digit lead. Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge had 24 points and 10 rebounds, continuing his resurgent season. ""LaMarcus was magnificent,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He's been magnificent every game. His perseverance his hustle, his focus has been off the charts. He's done a great job."" Kyle Anderson added 16 points in place of Leonard, who has not played this season while suffering from an injured right quadriceps. San Antonio led 31-12 lead after Golden State went scoreless for 4 1/2 minutes midway through the opening period. Golden State slowly cut into the lead behind its defense. After shooting 48 percent in the first quarter, the Spurs were held to 33 percent in the second quarter. San Antonio was 1 for 5 on 3-pointers and 7 for 21 overall in the second quarter. ""Our focus (sparked the rally), especially on the defensive end, and not fouling,"" Thompson said. ""Those two things are great because when we do that, we are able to get out in transition and get easy buckets. Our focus on that side of the ball was really good."" Thompson finished 11 for 17 from the field, including 5 for 8 on 3-pointers. The Spurs finished 7 for 24 on 3-pointers, failing to make a 3 in the second half after draining six in the opening quarter. ""We contested shots, we rebounded and we got out in transition,"" Durant said. Zaza Pachulia, making his first appearance in San Antonio since Leonard was lost after landing on the center's foot in Game 1, was heavily booed throughout the game. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State has made at least 10 3-pointers in each of its games this season. The Warriors were 14 for 28 on 3s against the Spurs. ...

Mills made his 600th career 3-pointer, 551 of which have come with the Spurs. ... San Antonio is 62-19 at home against Golden State. . Brandon Paul is the first Spurs rookie to play over 105 minutes in his first eight games since Kawhi Leonard did so in 2011. FAKE NEWS Popovich told TNT that Leonard could return in three weeks after missing the entire preseason and the first eight games of the regular season due to a right quadriceps injury. When asked if that was true, Pop demurred. ""You can't trust the media,"" Popovich said, chuckling. ""Come on."" BLOCK PARTY Golden State had 11 blocked shots, including an emphatic block by Thompson on Aldridge. The block led to an animated celebration by Thompson, followed by an ensuing turnover. ""It felt great, until I turned it over and got pulled out,"" Thompson said. ""That is karma for you. But it felt really good."" NO WAY Popovich was ejected with 4:47 remaining in the game after complaining Patrick McCaw was not called traveling minutes after Aldridge was assessed a traveling violation.","400974868"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard didn't really need to gesture to his wrist. The crowd already knew it was Lillard Time. The star guard made a 3-pointer with 0.7 seconds left and the Portland Trail Blazers extended their winning streak over the Los Angeles Lakers to 13 games with a 113-110 victory Thursday night. Lillard finished with 32 points, and Portland snapped a two-game skid. Jusuf Nurkic added 28 points. Lillard was 1 of 5 from 3-point range before the game-winner. The crowd roared when the shot fell, and Lillard nodded and pointed to his wrist. ""I felt good. The ball was coming off my hands good all night, even the ones that I didn't make. In those moments, you don't think about what happened before. It's a chance to rise to the occasion. You're 0 for 0 in that moment,"" Lillard said. ""I go back to my very first game-winner against New Orleans my rookie year. I had a terrible shooting game but I was able to block that out. All that mattered was that moment. No different tonight."" Brook Lopez had 27 points and rookie Kyle Kuzma added a season-high 22 for the Lakers, who were short-handed after Larry Nance Jr. broke his left hand in the second half. Fellow rookie Lonzo Ball was 0 for 2 from the field with no points, four assists and three rebounds. There were a few fans in the crowd wearing Ball's No. 2 jersey for his first appearance in Portland. But most fans booed him heartily during player introductions. Nance was hurt late in the third quarter and went to the locker room. He did not play the rest of the way. Nance was averaging 11.1 points and 7.9 rebounds for the Lakers. Afterward, the Lakers confirmed Nance broke a bone in his hand. ""Obviously, I feel terrible for him. He's been playing so solid for us,"" coach Luke Walton said. ""It's tough but that's what team sports are about, and someone else has to step up."" Portland took a 106-105 lead on Lillard's free throws with 1:56 left. Kuzma made a hook shot on the other end, but Lillard answered with a layup before Nurkic made free throws for a 110-107 lead. The standing crowd chanted ""Beat LA! Beat LA!"" But Kentavious Caldwell-Pope quieted the fans with a 3-pointer off an assist from Ball to tie it with 15.5 seconds left. Lillard hit the winner over the outstretched arm of Brandon Ingram. Kuzma took the final shot, a missed 3-pointer from 28 feet out at the buzzer that would have tied it. Lillard had missed a 3 the night before at the end of regulation in Portland's 112-103 overtime loss at Utah. ""He made a good read last night and (Rudy) Gobert made a great play,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""Tonight I think he had his mind made up to take the shot. It's what great players do."" The Blazers were without Al-Farouq Aminu, who injured his right ankle Wednesday against the Jazz. The team posted a photo of the 6-foot-9 forward on crutches before Thursday's game. Aminu was averaging 9.4 points and 8.1 rebounds this season. Noah Vonleh, who returned the night before following a shoulder injury in camp, started in his place. Portland led by 18 in the first half but the Lakers closed the gap to 66-62 at halftime. It was tight the rest of the way. ""We have the game against Toronto, then you have a tough one last night against Utah. Maybe if we come back and have a blowout, maybe we don't have to look at ourselves as much,"" Lillard said. ""We come in here tonight and we had a dogfight on our hands. We really had to look at ourselves and make it happen. We had to trust ourselves and trust each other to get it done. ""So I think a game like this and having to pull out a game like this does more for our team, character-wise."" TIP-INS Lakers: Los Angeles was 0 for 9 from 3-point range in the first half. ... The Lakers were coming off a 113-93 victory at home against the Pistons on Tuesday night. Trail Blazers: Rookie big man Zach Collins started the second half in place of Vonleh, who had four fouls. Collins, a 7-footer out of Gonzaga, was acquired by the Blazers in a draft-day deal with Sacramento. ON BALL ""I thought he was a little too passive tonight,"" Walton said about his rookie point guard. ""The hardest thing for young players is consistency. He's so unselfish that sometimes we want him to be more aggressive with attacking the defenses."" Ball, for his part, recognized that. ""I definitely could have been more aggressive,"" he said.","400974869"
"DETROIT --  The best ovation yet for the Detroit Pistons at Little Caesars Arena came as a result of Andre Drummond's free throw shooting. Surprising, yes, but coach Stan Van Gundy didn't view Drummond's performance as a fluke. ""Obviously, their idea was, `We'll just let him catch the ball, and then we'll hammer him,"" Van Gundy said. ""I don't think that strategy's going to work this year."" Drummond scored 24 points, going 14 of 16 at the free throw line, and the Pistons took over sole possession of first place in the Central Division with a 105-96 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night. Drummond scored 14 during a third quarter in which he made 10 of 12 foul shots, quite a showing for a player who is under 40 percent from the line in his career. It was the most free throws Drummond has made in a game in his career, and he's shooting 78 percent (28 of 36) from the line this season. ""It's just a mental toughness thing,"" Drummond said. ""Being ready all the time to shoot the same shot."" Avery Bradley scored 19 of his 23 points in the first half for the Pistons, who went on a 21-5 run late in the second quarter and led 59-48 at halftime. The lead was 17 early in the third, and Drummond helped hold off the Bucks for the rest of that period. ""Obviously, he really helps the Pistons when he's making free throws,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""He's worked hard on it and he's done a nice job of improving that part of his game. He can keep a run going from the line or he can stop an opponent's run, and that's a huge factor given everything else he can do."" Detroit went on a 9-1 spurt to start the fourth and led 91-73. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 29 points for Milwaukee. ""I thought we defended him really well, and then I get the boxscore: 29 points ... four blocked shots,"" Van Gundy said. ""I mean, the guy's just a great, great player."" There have been a surprising number of empty seats in the first season for the Pistons at Little Caesars Arena, and that was the case again Friday. But there were enough fans to create a lively atmosphere, especially as Drummond made free throw after free throw in the third. In the final seconds of the period, he stole the ball near midcourt and dribbled all the way to the basket before drawing a foul. He waved his hand to ask for more noise, and the crowd obliged. STANDINGS Detroit, which entered the game tied with Indiana for first place in the Central Division, has won four of five. This was the first game back home for the Pistons after a road trip that included a win at Golden State , and they moved a game ahead of the Pacers. DEPTH Detroit's bench outscored Milwaukee's 28-14. Only two subs scored for the Bucks, and Kidd said afterward that the starters can't play 48 minutes. ""We have to get better off the bench, but everyone has to start playing better defense,"" backup guard Jason Terry said. ""We have a few days off coming up, and that's important, because we've lost our defensive principles. We'll start hitting those shots, but you can't win if you don't play defense."" TIP-INS Bucks: Khris Middleton, coming off a 43-point performance Wednesday against Charlotte , scored 16. ... Milwaukee was without Greg Monroe, sidelined because of a left calf strain. Pistons: Detroit played without Jon Leuer due to a left ankle sprain.","400974870"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  For one night at least, the rebuilding project for the Chicago Bulls looked pretty good. Justin Holiday scored 19 points, Robin Lopez had 11 points and 10 rebounds, and the Bulls beat the Orlando Magic 105-83 on Friday. Chicago had seven players score in double figures in its first road win of the season. David Nwaba had 16 points, and rookie Lauri Markkanen made three 3-pointers on his way to 13 points. ""There are going to be games where you progress and games you regress and this was progress for us,"" Lopez said. ""We did a great job of playing team defense and everyone having each other's backs. We have guys who are willing to sacrifice for each other in order for the team to grow."" Evan Fournier led Orlando with 21 points, and Nikola Vucevic had 14 points. Aaron Gordon added 11 points and seven rebounds. The Magic led 45-44 at halftime, but the Bulls pulled away with a big second half. Lopez scored each of his 11 points in the third as Chicago outscored Orlando 29-15 in the period. Denzel Valentine hit three big 3-pointers to help the Bulls close it out in the fourth. ""I was really happy with the way we came out, the energy, the intensity at the defensive end,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""This team has been scoring it as well as anybody in the league, to hold this team to 38 points in the second half, showed how locked in our guys were."" Valentine and Kris Dunn each scored 11 points for Chicago, which shot 14 for 29 from 3-point range. Fellow reserve Paul Zipser had 10 points. Orlando played without D.J. Augustin and Elfrid Payton due to injuries, leaving Shelvin Mack as their only true point guard. Jonathon Simmons also played some point with Augustin and Payton out. ""Yeah, it's a factor,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""It hurts your rhythm a little bit but it's not an excuse."" The Magic shot 40.7 percent (35 for 86) from the field, including a 10-for-35 performance from behind the arc. REVERSAL OF FORTUNES The Magic came into the game with the NBA's best 3-point shooting percentages on offense (.442) and on defense (.283). The Bulls were 28th in 3-point shooting coming into the game. QUOTABLE ""We're putting in a lot of work to get better every day and today we took a big step forward,"" Holiday said.

"PHILADELPHIA --  J.J. Redick has seen plenty in his 12 NBA seasons, yet he insists he's never heard a louder regular-season crowd. Those fans in Philadelphia were going bonkers over their new sharpshooter. Redick scored 31 points and hit three decisive 3-pointers late, Ben Simmons had a triple-double and the 76ers moved above .500 for the first time in nearly four years with a 121-110 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. Redick said he had ""goosebumps"" hearing the ear-splitting sellout crowd finally get a chance to celebrate success. ""We all recognize the significance of tonight and getting over .500 for the first time in a long time,"" Redick said. ""My focus was more on winning. Obviously I had a good third quarter there where I got hot and then the three 3s down the stretch were more about, let's just get a win."" Redick was 8 of 12 from 3-point range, including the go-ahead jumper with 2:06 left, another 3 to barely beat the shot clock with 1:08 remaining and a third from the left corner to make it 119-110 with 46 seconds to go. ""He's amazing,"" Simmons said. Simmons was pretty good, too. He had 14 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists for his second triple-double in a rookie season delayed a year because of injury. The Sixers (5-4) last had a winning record when they were also 5-4 on Nov. 13, 2013, but their painful rebuild appears near an end as they won their fourth straight game. Victor Oladipo shook off a slow start to score 31 points, Bojan Bogdanovic added 21 and Myles Turner had 11 points and nine rebounds in his return from a concussion for the Pacers. They were outscored 11-0 to close the game as their three-game winning streak was snapped. ""We had a couple possessions where we had open looks,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""You have to knock those shots down."" After Redick's 3 made it 113-110, Domantas Sabonis was called for a charge at the other end and fouled out. After two empty possessions that included Joel Embiid missing a dunk, Simmons slipped and it appeared Philadelphia was going to turn it over. But Redick ended up with the ball and drilled an off-balance 3 as the shot clock expired. ""Believe it or not, it is something that I occasionally practice,"" Redick said. Each team led by nine points in an up-tempo game before the Sixers took control behind Redick, who signed a free-agent deal with Philadelphia in the offseason. Turner hadn't played since sustaining a concussion in Indiana's season-opening win against Brooklyn on Oct. 18. McMillan had Turner come off the bench, and after a rusty start, he helped Indiana dominate inside in the first half. Turner had a thunderous dunk over Dario Saric late in the first quarter and blocked Embiid's jumper early in the second. His 3-pointer ignited a late 9-0 run that helped Indiana to a 63-56 halftime lead. But Turner struggled with his shot in the second half and Embiid got the better of him late. ""He was a little rusty,"" McMillan said. ""He had to play more minutes than we probably would have liked. Sabonis got in foul trouble. He missed some shots that he's capable of knocking down, and just timing."" Embiid had 18 points and nine rebounds. Robert Covington scored 22 for the 76ers, who shot 50 percent from the field. TIP-INS Pacers: F T.J. Leaf didn't return after spraining his left ankle early in the second quarter. McMillan said X-rays were negative. . Damien Wilkins (personal reasons) was inactive. 76ers: Richaun Holmes had several loud dunks during an effective third-quarter stint in his season debut. The center had been out since breaking his left wrist in the preseason. . Furkan Kormaz was assigned to Delaware of the G-League after the game.

"WASHINGTON -- Look out, NBA. Walking to the locker room after scoring 57 points Friday night, LeBron James expressed what amounted to a warning for upcoming opponents: ""This is the best I'm feeling in my career."" Just in case there were any questions about Eastern Conference supremacy, James poured in the second-highest point total of his career and an NBA-best this season to help his Cleveland Cavaliers end a four-game losing skid by beating the Washington Wizards 130-122 on Friday night. ""Every shot that I took,"" the four-time league MVP said, ""I felt like it was going in."" He hadn't scored this much since getting a career-high 61 for the Miami Heat on March 3, 2014, against the Charlotte Hornets. And James did it efficiently against Washington, making 23 of 34 field-goal tries and all nine free throws, adding 11 rebounds and seven assists. ""He still has it, if you guys didn't know that,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We knew that."" Perhaps. But neither Brooks nor his players could find a way to slow James. Several Wizards tried to -- including All-Star point guard John Wall, even after he hurt his left shoulder so badly that he was wearing black sling in the locker room. ""It's on fire right now,"" Wall said about his shoulder, which he hurt on a collision with Channing Frye. ""It was like my arm went dead."" Wall stayed in the game and had X-rays afterward but won't get results until Saturday. At 6-foot-4 and 195 pounds, Wall never really stood much of a chance against James, who is listed at 6-8, 250, especially in the low post. ""Whenever you're hitting tough, hand-in-your-face turnaround fadeaways from off the left and the right shoulder, it's your night,"" Wizards forward Kelly Oubre Jr. said about James. ""He was on a different level tonight."" Certainly was. And did it with style at both ends of the floor, too. James hurdled over a seated Bradley Beal while dribbling, swatted a shot by Wall off the backboard, and looked for a camera to wag both index fingers at in the midst of a three-point play. Probably just a coincidence that Washington's two starting guards said in an interview shown on ESPN earlier Friday that they thought the Cavaliers wanted to avoid the Wizards in the playoffs last season. And while Beal backed up that sort of talk, scoring 36 points, Wall was not at his peak. Yes, he handed out 15 assists, but he scored only 13 points, shooting 4 for 13 from the field and going 5 for 12 on free throws. James wouldn't take the bait when asked about what Beal and Wall had said, replying: ""I don't have a comment about that. I have so much more on my plate right now."" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue skirted the topic also, saying in a voice dripping with sarcasm: ""They're right: They are the best team in the East."" James didn't need much help, but teammates Derrick Rose (20 points) and Jae Crowder (17) each managed to top their season highs before the third quarter was done. Cleveland finally looked like a team that has been to the NBA Finals three consecutive years, thanks in large part to James. ""It's like it's `his' Finals. Seems like every year he's there,"" Brooks said before tipoff. ""I can imagine there's no, like, panic in their locker room."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: James reached at least 10 points for the 800th game in a row; Michael Jordan (866) is the only other NBA player with a streak that long. ... James, 32, also became the youngest player to reach 29,000 career points in the NBA. Last season, he became the youngest to reach 27,000, and then the youngest to reach 28,000. Wizards: Oubre showed up to the arena wearing a jacket with a curse word sewn onto the back. ... F Otto Porter Jr. scored 15 points in his return after missing one game because of an illness. MORRIS DEBUTS In his season debut, Wizards F Markieff Morris had two points, four rebounds and one flagrant foul in 16 minutes. Morris had offseason sports hernia surgery, then missed one game because of a league suspension. ""Just trying to get back in a groove,"" Morris said.","400974873"
"ATLANTA --  The Houston Rockets overwhelmed the woeful Atlanta Hawks with fast-break baskets and 3-point shooting. James Harden scored 21 of his 29 points in Houston's high-scoring first half, and the Rockets handed the Hawks their eighth straight loss with a 119-104 victory Friday night. The Rockets scored 28 fast-break points, almost doubling their previous high of 15. ""We don't want to hold the ball,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""And we want to make quick decisions. ... I just think we did a lot of good things."" Houston led 69-51 at halftime with its highest-scoring half of the season. The Rockets went 11 for 22 from 3-point range in the first half and 16 for 47 from beyond the arc for the game. ""We haven't been shooting the 3-ball all that great this year,"" said Eric Gordon, who made three 3s and had 20 points. ""... Once we start shooting 3s we'll be hard to stop."" Luc Mbah a Moute also scored 20 points to help Houston improve to 6-1 on the road. The Southwest Division-leading Rockets (7-3) closed a stretch where they played five of six games away from Houston, including back-to-back road wins against the Knicks and Hawks. ""A good two games for us, but it's got to be not just two games or 10 games, it's got to be an entire season to get where we want to go,"" Harden said. Kent Bazemore scored 18 points for the Hawks (1-8), who have not won since their season-opening victory at Dallas. Bazemore had the difficult task of defending Harden. ""They just shoot the crap out of the ball,"" Bazemore said. ""You can be six inches from it and they let it go. ... When a team like that comes in, it's going to be a tough challenge. You have to play about flawless."" Dennis Schroder and Taurean Prince each had 16 points for Atlanta. Luke Babbitt scored 12 points on four 3-pointers, and rookie John Collins had eight points and 12 rebounds.

"NEW YORK --  After racing back for an emphatic block on one end and streaking downcourt to get the ball back and slam it down while being fouled on the other, Kristaps Porzingis had one thing left to finish off his highlight-reel, end-to-end possession . ""I had to calm myself down to knock down the free throw,"" Porzingis said. He did, his final point in a 37-point performance that carried the New York Knicks to a 120-107 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night, giving Jeff Hornacek his first win over his former team and making a believer out of his opponent. ""Porzingis is special. He has a chance to be the best player in this league,"" said Suns center Tyson Chandler, the former Defensive Player of the Year. ""Watching him tonight and seeing what he's done so far this season, he has a real shot of being the best player in this league."" Porzingis fell just shy of the career-best 38 points he scored Monday against Denver, unable to score again after rejecting rookie Josh Jackson and delivering his powerful dunk on the other end to trigger loud ""MVP! MVP!"" chants. ""I loved that play,"" Porzingis said. ""Just the energy that was in the Garden at the moment, it was unbelievable."" Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 21 points and Enes Kanter added 16 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks. They bounced back from a loss to Houston on Wednesday to win for the fourth time in five games after a 0-3 start. The Suns swept the two-game series last season, Hornacek's first coaching the Knicks. He spent 2 1/2 seasons coaching the Suns from 2013-16. Devin Booker scored 34 points for the Suns, who had won two straight and four of five after they also started 0-3. Phoenix lost forward T.J. Warren to a head injury in the first half, a game after he scored a career-best 40 points. Porzingis was 13 for 22 from the field in his sixth 30-point performance in eight games this season. ""When you see a 7-3 guy backing up the court, doing between the legs, playing 1-on-1, that's special,"" Kanter said. ""I mean, he's been doing an unbelievable job."" The Knicks led 32-19 after one quarter, then ran off the first eight of the second for a 40-19 advantage. Phoenix cut it to 72-66 early in the third but the Knicks pulled away again, pushing the lead back to 16 by the end of the period. TIP-INS Suns: Warren was hurt in the first quarter when he crashed into Kanter, remaining on the court for a few minutes before returning to the locker room. The Suns said he had a headache and wouldn't play in the second half. ... F Marquese Chriss fouled out with more than 10 minutes remaining, finishing with five points and nine rebounds in about 16 minutes. Knicks: Porzingis was listed as questionable to play after not practicing Thursday because of a stomach illness. He went to the Knicks' training facility and sat in on their film session, but was then sent home. ... Kanter was cut under his chin in the collision with Warren but was able to return without stitches. COMMENTS CONTROVERSY Porzingis downplayed comments made in a Latvian magazine by his brother Janis, an agent in the firm that represents him, that surfaced a day earlier. Janis Porzingis referenced his brother's dissatisfaction with the Knicks last season, when he skipped his exit interview, and noted that Kristaps would need to be happy to re-sign with the team in the future, even if leaving meant taking less money. But Kristaps said much of the comments were taken out of context and that fans shouldn't be concerned. ""I think the fans know I'm here in New York, I love New York and I see myself as a Knick for a long, long time, and I don't think they should be worried about it,"" Porzingis said. END OF THE ROAD The Suns were denied their first three-game road winning streak since winning five in a row under Hornacek in December 2014. SERIES STATS The Knicks went back ahead 63-62 in the series. The Suns still haven't led since winning Oct. 24, 1968, in their first meeting.","400974875"
"DALLAS -- DeMarcus Cousins had his second 20-20 game in barely a week. His coach noticed the smaller number from his burly center -- assists. Cousins had 20 points, 22 rebounds and seven assists, Anthony Davis led New Orleans with 30 points and had 13 boards and the Pelicans opened a four-game trip with a 99-94 victory over the last-place Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. The 6-foot-11 Cousins was eight days removed from season highs of 41 points and 23 rebounds in a win over Sacramento, his former team. The game after that, he had his seventh career triple-double in a blowout victory at home over LeBron James and Cleveland. ""They are pretty good in the post and pretty good outside,"" coach Alvin Gentry said about Cousins and the 6-10 Davis. ""The thing that I love is that they are also unselfish players. You look at DeMarcus and most nights he has seven assists, eight assists, nine assists. ""AD is in the post and finding the right people, and scoring pretty much at will."" Harrison Barnes scored a season-high 26 points for the Mavericks, who are 1-9 for the first time since 1993-94. That was the second straight 1-9 start for teams that lost an average of 70 games over two seasons. ""I thought there were a couple of times tonight we passed up some shots we had,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""The last three games we've had some pretty big skyscrapers in there."" Jrue Holliday added eight assists and a season-high eight rebounds for the Pelicans, who were coming off two straight home losses. Davis was 10 of 19 from the field and Cousins 8 of 16 to offset an otherwise cold night for the Pelicans. They shot 40 percent and were 7 of 29 from 3-point range. Cousins had four of the long-range misses without making one. ""We are just trying to dominate in the paint,"" said Davis, who matched his season high with three blocks. ""Knowing that they don't have a lot of rim protection, we did a great job of finding each other."" The starting Dallas backcourt of Dennis Smith Jr. and Wesley Matthews went a combined 10 of 32 as the Mavericks shot 39 percent. Smith scored 11 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter after a high-flying dunk in the first half. ""We were taking too long to make our decisions whether we are going to attack, pass or shoot,"" Smith said. ""We just have to get used to switching."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Cousins tied his career high with 20 defensive rebounds. ... Davis and Cousins were a combined 9 of 10 in the first quarter, with Davis scoring 13 and Cousins 10. ... E'Twaun Moore scored 11 points, and Tony Allen added 10. Darius Miller was 3 of 5 from long range for nine points. Mavericks: Dirk Nowitzki, the 39-year-old in his 20th season, scored seven points on 2-of-9 shooting and is at 39 percent for the season. ... Matthews, who had seven points on 3-of-12 shooting, got a technical foul in the second quarter for complaining about a foul. BACK AND FORTH The Pelicans led by 14 in the first quarter before Barnes scored 13 second-quarter points to help the Mavericks take their only lead at 31-30. New Orleans pushed the margin back to 17 in the third and fourth quarter -- and let the lead dwindle to six in both quarters as well. ""Man, we are not worried about that,"" Davis said. ""We don't care about putting away or not. We just want to win."" MEJRI SUCCESS Backup Dallas center Salah Mejri had 13 rebounds and five blocks while starter Nerlens Noel went scoreless with seven rebounds while playing just 13 minutes. Mejri scored seven points. ""Salah always battles Cousins well,"" Carlisle said. ""He's willing to give his body and take charges.""","400974876"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Bryn Forbes and San Antonio's reserves gave the Spurs a big lift at an opportune time. Forbes scored 22 points, Rudy Gay had 20 and San Antonio stopped a four-game slide with a 108-101 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night. ""Wins help, but I think we just played better,"" said Patty Mills, who scored 17 points in his second start. ""I think even if we would have lost that game we still could have had a positive feedback because we played better. That's where we're trying to be right now."" The Spurs played without Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker, who are out with quadriceps injuries. Charlotte was without Nicholas Batum and Michael Carter-Williams, who also have not played this season, along with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Each team had to find scoring elsewhere, and San Antonio's backups responded in a big way. ""I thought they were physical and pretty tenacious (and) communicated well,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. Dejounte Murray added 10 points, helping San Antonio's reserves outscore Charlotte's 64-16. ""I just try and contribute the way I can contribute,"" Forbes said of his role off the bench. ""Do what they tell me to do and try to affect the game in some way. That's all I was really thinking coming into the game."" Forbes was 8 for 11 while coming within five points of matching his career high. ""I thought Forbes was terrific,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""He had three high pick-and-roll 3s and then he hit the last one near the front of our bench and it was a great shot at the end of the shot clock."" Jeremy Lamb led Charlotte with 27 points. The Hornets had won three in a row, but could not sustain a rally midway through the fourth quarter. After Kemba Walker hit a pair of free throws to pull within 86-84, the Spurs regained a double-digit lead less than three minutes later. Mills fueled the run, hitting four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. ""Patty Mills hit some tough ones,"" Lamb said. ""They were contested. He just hit some."" Mills said he was inspired by Manu Ginobili, his 40-year-old teammate whom he teasingly calls ""Grandpa."" Ginobili had 10 points and five assists while becoming the first South American to play in 1,000 games in the NBA. The 40-year-old Ginobili was spry, scoring six points in his first six minutes and then throwing down a one-handed dunk in the fourth quarter after playing 21 minutes. San Antonio had eight dunks, one less than its made 3-pointers for a team that relies on outside shooting. The Spurs shot 47 percent from the field. LaMarcus Aldridge had 14 points for San Antonio, marking just the second time in nine games that he has not led the team in scoring. Dwight Howard had 20 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte, but was 1 for 4 on free throws in the final four minutes. TIP-INS Hornets: Kidd-Gilchrist missed the game for personal reasons. ... Lamb has scored at least 15 points in all nine games this season after doing so only 11 times last season. ... Dwayne Bacon made his fourth start of the season. ... The Hornets scored 19 points in the first quarter, the lowest by a Spurs opponent this season, but it was not Charlotte's lowest production. The Hornets were held to 18 points in the first quarter against Orlando on Oct. 20. Spurs: Aldridge had a blocked shot for the 17th straight game, the league's longest active streak. ... Kyle Anderson scored in double figures for the fourth time this season, equaling his total in 72 games last season. . Forbes' career high of 27 points came against Dallas on April 7. MANU MILESTONE Ginobili was initially listed as questionable and then ruled out by Popovich for rest, but the 16-year veteran convinced the staff that he needed to play. ""Yeah usually on back-to-backs I don't play, or play very few of them, but today I really felt like I had to play, that I needed to play,"" Ginobili said. ""Because I was disappointed at the way I played the day before and I needed that feeling to redeem myself or feel better about myself."" Ginobili joined Parker and Tim Duncan as the only players in franchise history to play 1,000 games with the Spurs. KEEP SHOOTING Mills has struggled shooting this season, but was 4 for 7 on 3-pointers against the Hornets. ""The most important thing is I don't shy away from shooting, especially open shots,"" Mills said. ""If I can stay mentally aggressive that way than it's good. I thought tonight I thought was more aggressive in that sense compared to other games, but still shooting them.""","400974877"
"DENVER --  Paul Millsap proved worthy of his big contract on Friday night. Millsap had 27 points, including three straight free throws with 11.9 seconds remaining, and the Denver Nuggets held on for a 95-94 victory over the Miami Heat. Nikola Jokic added 19 points and 14 rebounds as the Nuggets shook off some late struggles at the line to win their second straight on a six-game homestand. Millsap, who signed a $90 million, three-year deal with Denver in July, delivered at a key moment. After missing three of his previous four foul shots, the Nuggets' big offseason acquisition was fouled at the 3-point line by James Johnson and sunk each of his free throws, delighting a lively crowd at the Pepsi Center. ""I've learned over the years to never drop your head and never get down on yourself,"" Millsap said. ""It feels good."" Dion Waiters nearly won it for Miami on the other end with a 3-point try that rattled in and out in the final second. ""I saw the ball going in,"" Jokic said. ""Last year we lost a bunch of times like this, so I saw it going in then out and said `Yes!"" Goran Dragic scored 23 points for the Heat. Waiters and Johnson each had 15. Denver didn't have a lead until midway through the third quarter when Jokic swished a short jumper to make it 65-63. The Nuggets kept the lead until late in the fourth. ""We weren't great all night but we showed a lot of resolve in getting this win,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. In the final minute, Waiters had a driving layup with 30 seconds remaining and Dragic made 1 of 2 from the line to give the Heat a 94-92 lead. ""It's a tough loss,"" Dragic said. ""We felt like we had it, that game, but it is what it is."" TIP-INS Heat: Dragic and Whiteside both started a perfect 4 for 4 from the field as Miami led 37-28 at the end of the first. The Heat were 15 of 19 from the field in the quarter. Nuggets: F Juan Hernangomez missed a seventh straight game with mononucleosis. Malone said Hernangomez has taken part in limited work at practice but won't return for a few weeks. ... Emmanuel Mudiay had 12 points and Wilson Chandler had 11. ... The Nuggets outscored Miami 25-13 in the third quarter to take a 76-71 lead. SLIPPERY BASKETBALLS Waiters briefly lost control of the ball on the final possession before his potential game-winner rimmed out. He blamed the ending on ""slippery"" basketballs. ""The whole night everybody had no clean feel for the ball. It was so slippery,"" Waiters said. ""I don't like their basketballs here."" FREE THROW SHOOTING For most of the game, the Nuggets didn't take advantage of the chances they got at the line. They shot 14 of 25, while the Heat were 7 of 11. ""How many free throws did we miss? 11?"" Jokic asked after the game. ""I mean that's something we need to work on. Free throws are the easiest shots in the game.""","400974878"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Midway through the third quarter, DeMar DeRozan was frustrated. He'd been sloppy with the ball and was letting his team down. ""I feel like I was just making lots of mental mistakes and I was determined to pick it up,"" he said. A four-point play sparked DeRozan and he went on to score a season-high 37 points as the Toronto Raptors finished their longest road trip of the season Friday night with a 109-100 victory over the Utah Jazz. ""My teammates just kept pounding it in my head that I had it going and I just had to keep it going. It definitely felt good,"" DeRozan said. The three-time All-Star made all 14 of his free throws and added a trio of 3-pointers to complement his trademark mid-range offensive game and overcome six turnovers. His 17 third-quarter points helped stake the Raptors to a lead they never relinquished in handing the Jazz their first loss in six home games. Toronto went 3-3 on its Western Conference swing. A game after an ""embarrassing performance"" in a 129-111 loss to Denver, according to Toronto coach Dwane Casey, the Raptors repeatedly got into the lane and found open shooters. They led 99-87 after Norman Powell's 3-pointer midway through the fourth. ""We were moving the ball really well,"" Powell said. ""We had a lot more flow and pace to our offense. We kept them guessing and guys were able to knock down open looks."" From there, the Raptors let DeRozan go to work on isolation plays that resulted in six straight points as they put the game out of reach. Rookie guard Donovan Mitchell followed his career-high 28 points on Wednesday with 25 to lead the Jazz. Rodney Hood added 17 points but had another rough shooting night, going 6 for 19. ""Tonight I had zero assists and I'm not happy about that at all. I'm not worried about how many points I scored. I didn't find any of my open teammates,"" Mitchell said. Powell matched his season high with 15 points and Kyle Lowry also had 15 for Toronto. The Jazz are stocked with defensive stoppers, but no one could slow DeRozan in the third quarter. He extended his usual range to beyond the arc and scored in a variety of ways to give the Raptors an 89-82 lead entering the final period. ""He did a really good job of getting to the free throw line, attacking the defense, being physical, initiating contact, getting them on the pump fake,"" Casey said of his star shooting guard. Toronto shot 54 percent and didn't seem fazed by shot blocker Rudy Gobert or the NBA's second-stingiest defense. TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto was the only Eastern Conference team to have a winning record in road games against Western Conference clubs last season, and has done so for four straight years. ... Toronto and Utah lead the NBA with seven international players on each team. ... The 109 points marked the most scored against Utah this season. ... Hood was called for a Flagrant 2 foul on Jakob Poeltl in the fourth quarter after retaliating for a hard bump. Poeltl missed both free throws. Jazz: F Joe Johnson is out at least a couple of weeks with a right wrist injury. ... Before the game, Utah coach Quin Snyder acknowledged the Raptors' long road trip and said: ""We want to take advantage. If we are the fresher team, let's be the fresher team."" But the Raptors certainly didn't look fatigued. ... Utah had only 11 assists. LONG BALL DeRozan, a 28 percent 3-point shooter for his career, has often avoided long-range shots. He went 3 for 7 against the Jazz and said, ""I don't think about it. Me, I've never made it a big deal to shoot 3s, but I never felt like I couldn't. ... I never look if I'm behind the line or in front of it."" HEADED HOME The Raptors were happy to get their longest trip out of the way at the beginning of the season. ""We've been going for two weeks ... but to finish like this is going to do a lot for our confidence,"" DeRozan said. ""It was a seesaw first road trip for us but we can go back home and say, `Hey, we made it through and we can be better next time around.' To have that type of feeling after this trip is definitely good."" THE LANE IS OPEN In allowing a season high for points, the Jazz struggled in doing what they do best. ""Well, it wasn't the best defensive effort. That's got to be there for us,"" Snyder said. ""A lot of individual breakdowns where guys were getting beat put us in some compromising positions and they were able to score. We're not going to win if we don't play defense better than that.""","400974879"
"Carmelo Anthony details a conversation he had with Russell Westbrook telling him not to adjust his game to fit with the Thunder's newest stars, but rather let the new players work around Westbrook. (1:17) OKLAHOMA CITY --  Once Kyrie Irving got it going, not even Oklahoma City's star-studded roster could withstand the surge. Irving scored 22 of his 25 points in the second half and the Boston Celtics rallied from 18 down to beat the Thunder 101-94 on Friday night for their seventh straight victory. ""We battled,"" Irving said. ""We took away some things they were feeling comfortable with in the first half, picked up our pace and our defensive pressure and things started going our way, and then we just kept battling to the end."" Al Horford scored 17 of his 20 points after halftime and Jaylen Brown added 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Celtics. Boston has allowed 94 or fewer points in every game during its winning streak. Paul George had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and Russell Westbrook added 19 points and 11 assists for the Thunder. Carmelo Anthony had 10 points and 14 rebounds but shot just 3 of 17. ""The first half, we played extremely well defensively,"" Anthony said. ""The Celtics kept fighting. They stuck with it. I think we took our foot off the gas a little bit. We didn't put a full game together tonight. It showed that it was just a tale of two halves. One great half and one not-so-great half."" In a play that seemingly summarized the first half, Irving drove hard to the hoop in the closing seconds of the second quarter and went for a layup before Andre Roberson emphatically swatted it to the ground as time expired with the Thunder leading 55-37. Irving was 1 of 9 from the field before the break. ""It was ugly,"" Irving said. ""It was an ugly first half. We don't want to get in the habit of that, getting down by 18, understanding that against a good team like that, it could turn into 30 in a matter of an instant."" Boston chipped away at Oklahoma City's lead throughout the third quarter and cut it to a point. Irving had nine points in the period to help the Celtics shave their deficit to 71-67. ""I think tonight in that third quarter coming out we had some breakdowns defensively, which led to them getting momentum on their side,"" Anthony said. ""We just couldn't get the momentum back once they got it. That was just kind of a mental lapse we had coming out of halftime."" A 3-pointer by Semi Ojeleye with just under six minutes to play tied it at 79, and a 3-pointer by Horford put the Celtics ahead 82-79. Irving made a 3 and was fouled by Westbrook. Irving missed the free throw, but came up with the rebound and made a layup to put the Celtics up 87-81 with 4:13 to play. ""Just getting off the screen and being aggressive,"" he said. ""Thankful that it (the 3-pointer) went in. Missed my free throw but getting the rebound, I knew Russ had five fouls, so just trying to attack him on that layup kind of gave us the separation we needed to feel comfortable."" TIP-INS Celtics: Irving went scoreless with no assists in the first quarter. His first points of the game came with about two minutes left in the first half. ... Boston shot just 30 percent in the first quarter. Thunder: Westbrook was called for a Flagrant 1 foul in the first quarter against Brown. ... George scored 10 points in the first period. ... Oklahoma City was outscored 30-16 in the third. STAT LINE Anthony shot 1 for 12 in the second half. He entered as the Thunder's leading scorer at 22.9 points per game. ""Those nights happen,"" Anthony said. ""It makes it even worse when you lose a game."" QUOTABLE Irving: ""I really didn't make any adjustments. The first four shots I took, they were pretty good looks. Just getting used to the switching. They were loading up on the weak side when me and Al were coming off our pick-and-rolls. It just took a matter of time for us just to settle in.""","400974880"
"LOS ANGELES -- With all the fuss surrounding D'Angelo Russell's return to Los Angeles after being traded to Brooklyn last summer, some Lakers fans might have forgotten it was also Brook Lopez's first game against the only franchise he had ever known before that deal. Lopez's new Lakers teammates are pretty sure he didn't forget, even if he didn't want to acknowledge it after a stellar performance. Lopez hit six 3-pointers and scored a season-high 34 points against the Nets, and rookie Kyle Kuzma had 21 points and 13 rebounds during his first career start in the Lakers' 124-112 victory over Brooklyn on Friday night. Lopez had 23 points in the second half and added 10 rebounds while the Lakers stayed comfortably ahead. He hit four 3-pointers in the third quarter and finished with a series of ferocious dunks in the final minutes. The genial 7-footer is normally loquacious, but Lopez wouldn't say much about facing the Nets. ""It honestly wasn't about (revenge) at all,"" he said. ""It was typical. Just another game for me."" Lopez had spent his entire nine-year NBA career with the Nets, becoming the top scorer in franchise history while leading Brooklyn in scoring during each of the past five seasons. But the North Hollywood native will be a free agent next summer, and the Nets shipped him home after he put up 20.5 points per game last season. ""When you have the talent level that Brook has, and you've been in the league long enough, you can anticipate a player of that level having a big game against his old team,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""It's just the way our league works. Some of those 3s, I was yelling at my coaches, `Why is he shooting that?' And he was making them, so we left him in. It was good to see."" While most Staples Center fans paid attention to the still-popular Russell's return, Lopez calmly posted his biggest offensive game yet for his new team. ""He was great,"" said Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson, who gets credit from Lopez for encouraging him to become a 3-point shooter. ""Credit to him. He's a very good player."" Jordan Clarkson added 19 points and Brandon Ingram had 18 for the Lakers, who played with surprising energy one night after a last-second loss in Portland and a 2:30 a.m. return home. Allen Crabbe scored 25 points in the opener of Brooklyn's five-game road trip. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 21 for the Nets, who have lost four straight. D-LO RETURNS Russell had 17 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in his first game against the Lakers since they traded him to Brooklyn in the four-player deal that brought Lopez and Kuzma to Los Angeles. Russell was the No. 2 pick in the 2015 draft and the cornerstone of the Lakers' rebuilding project under former bosses Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak. When owner Jeanie Buss replaced the duo with Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka last year, Russell was shipped off to Brooklyn four months later along with high-priced center Timofey Mozgov. Before the game, Russell declined to criticize Johnson or the Lakers, saying he enjoyed his time in LA. He was greeted largely by warm cheers during pregame introductions. ""The LA fans should have love for D'Angelo,"" Walton said. ""The LA fans should have love for Timo. Neither one of them asked to be traded. They played hard for this city."" Johnson made the deal to clear Mozgov's onerous contract off the books for the Lakers' pursuit of top-tier free agents next summer, but also to clear a path for rookie Lonzo Ball, his preferred choice as the team's new point guard and cornerstone. After the trade, Johnson also made comments that appeared to be critical of Russell's leadership ability. ""I would say it ruffled a few feathers, but you control what you can control,"" Russell said of Johnson's comments. ""He's in a position to say what he wants, so I'm going to do what I can do."" KUZMA'S START Kuzma took another big step in his ascendant career with the Lakers, who appear to have a steal in the player Brooklyn selected with the 27th overall pick and immediately traded to Los Angeles. Given his first chance to start after Larry Nance Jr. broke his hand in Portland, Kuzma scored 17 points on 7-of-8 shooting in the first half. TIP-INS Nets: Russell is only 20 months older than Ball. ... Lopez returns to Brooklyn on Feb. 2. Lakers: Nance will be sidelined for four to six weeks after surgery on Friday. He had started Los Angeles' first eight games, making steady contributions on both ends of the floor. ... Ball had six points on 3-of-15 shooting and seven assists.","400974881"
"LOS ANGELES --  Memphis used a balanced offense and strong play from its reserves to beat the Los Angeles Clippers. The Grizzlies had seven players score in double figures, including all four reserves to top the Clippers 113-104 on Saturday. Mike Conley returned to the lineup after sitting out the last game with a sore Achilles go lead Memphis with 22 points. ""Any time you can get multiple guys in double figures, it means the ball's moving, everybody's in rhythm, people are being unselfish,"" said Grizzlies coach David Fizdale. The Memphis backups outscored the Los Angeles reserves 55-22. ""They're a team that every single guy is in attack mode,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. ""That's what makes them good. They also share the ball well and space the floor. Every single guy you have to be ready to guard. Just watching it was frustrating."" Blake Griffin scored 30 points to lead the Clippers, who too often found their offense motionless and Griffin forced to go one-on-one. ""I don't think we should rely on anyone too much,"" Rivers said. ""We should just move the ball and play. The ball will find the better players always. ""We have to get away from just looking for one guy."" The Clippers' only lead was early in the first quarter. The Grizzlies started hitting 3-pointers -- they connected on 11 of their first 19 attempts -- and pulled away. Although the Clippers would twice rally to tie Memphis, they could never regain the lead. The Clippers were 4 of 26 from 3-point range, while the Grizzlies went 13 of 31. ""I'll take threes anytime we can get them,"" Fizdale said. ""I've seen enough games where we've been on the dismal end of the 3-point shooting."" Tyreke Evans led the Memphis reserves with 20 points, while the Grizzlies also got 13 from Brandan Wright, 12 from Mario Chalmers and 10 from Chandler Parsons. Starting center Marc Gasol added 21 points. The Clippers struggled to mount much offense beyond Griffin. Patrick Beverley scored 10 points in the fourth quarter to finish with 23. No other Clipper scored more than Lou Williams' 13. THE CONLEY DIFFERENCE The Memphis shooting point guard hit four of his nine 3-point attempts, playing 33 minutes and showing no ill effects from his Achilles. ""You could just a difference in places we could get on the floor,"" Fizdale said. ""Any time he's playing well, we're in the game."" BAD THEME Rivers said there was a consistent thread to the Clippers' three losses this season. ""If I had one frustration, offensively in the three games we've lost, we kind of get stuck,"" he said. ""The ball stays on one side of the floor. It's not moving. If you don't see our guards at the basket a lot, it probably means we're not moving the ball. That was disappointing."" Said Clippers center DeAndre Jordan: ""(The offense) got stagnant, we got stuck on one side of the floor again. Then we become easier to guard. So for our team everybody needs to be involved. We have a lot of guys standing around right now."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: After playing six of their first eight games at home, Saturday marked the first of five consecutive road games. . Entering Saturday the Memphis reserves had outscored opposing bench players 344-198. Clippers: Recalled rookie guard Jawun Evans from its development team. The 6-foot Evans, out of Oklahoma State, had played two games with Los Angeles before being sent to its nearby Ontario affiliate.","400974882"
"DETROIT --  Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy knew during the offseason that he needed another piece to get the Pistons into playoff contention in the Eastern Conference. It appears he found the right player in Avery Bradley. Bradley scored 24 points, Andre Drummond had 16 points and 19 rebounds, and the Pistons beat the Sacramento Kings 108-99 on Saturday. The 26-year-old Bradley went 10 for 15 from the field. He was acquired in a trade with Boston in July. ""I've said this several times, but he has really changed the defensive demeanor of our team,"" Van Gundy said. ""He doesn't deserve all of the credit -- moving Stanley (Johnson) into the starting lineup has also helped -- but we're playing much better defense with Avery on the floor."" Tobias Harris added 20 points for Detroit (7-3), which won for the fifth time in six games. The Pistons had 18 points off Sacramento turnovers, while the Kings only had nine. They have recorded more points off turnovers than their opponent in nine of their 10 games. ""This wasn't our best game, but we were able to get some stops when we needed them,"" Harris said. ""We're building off each other, and that's a good thing."" Sacramento (1-8) lost its seventh straight game and gave up more than 100 points for the sixth time in a row. Zach Randolph led the Kings with 19 points, and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 14. ""This is a learning experience,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""It was a small-ball game tonight, and they were able to hurt us with that."" Back-to-back 3-pointers by Reggie Jackson and Harris gave the Pistons a 77-69 lead late in the third quarter. Detroit led 85-74 heading into the fourth, and held off a brief Sacramento surge early in the period. ""That wasn't an easy win by any means,"" Van Gundy said. ""We didn't have a lot of energy, and their starting lineup gave us a lot of trouble, but we were able to grind it out."" The Pistons scored the game's first 10 points, but Randolph scored 10 points in the first quarter to keep the Kings close. Sacramento led briefly in the second quarter, but Bradley's 13 points were enough to give Detroit a 52-49 lead at halftime. ""It seemed like we were down four points around 80 times tonight, but we could never put together the big run we needed,"" Joerger said. ""We talked about how much ball pressure they use, and then we would come down three times and they would deflect three passes."" TIP-INS Kings: Randolph's first-quarter scoring started moments after Michigan State's winning field goal against Penn State was shown on the Little Caesars Arena scoreboard, accompanied by the MSU fight song. Randolph went to the Final Four as a Spartan in 2001. Pistons: Jon Leuer (ankle sprain) missed the game, while Johnson is day to day after leaving in the third quarter with a sore hip flexor.","400974883"
"CHICAGO --  DeMarcus Cousins had an uncharacteristically quiet game early Saturday night. He turned it up after halftime and looked like his usual dominant self. Cousins had 25 points and 11 rebounds -- 18 and seven in the second half -- to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 96-90 overtime victory over the Chicago Bulls. ""I struggled early on, but that being said, you just got to out and find other ways to have an impact on the game,"" said Cousins, who was averaging 29 points and 14 rebounds. ""That's what I tried to do. It was a great team effort all around. We pulled out an ugly, gritty win."" Anthony Davis had 27 points and 16 rebounds to help the Pelicans snap a six-game, regular-season losing streak to the Bulls. Jameer Nelson added 13 points, Darius Miller had 11, and Jrue Holiday 10 for New Orleans. The Pelicans improved to 4-2 on the road. Justin Holiday had 18 points, Denzel Valentine added 16 and Lauri Markkanen and Robin Lopez had 14 apiece for the Bulls. They were coming off their first road victory. Both teams looked sluggish completing their first back-to-backs of the season. The Bulls shot 35.4 percent from the field to the Pelicans' 40.2 percent. ""We were like playing in mud,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""It was a struggle we couldn't seem to get ourselves going but we found a way. At the end of the day, I told the guys, `You just got to find a way to win on the road."" Cousins made two of three foul shots for a 91-86 lead with 2:35 left in overtime before Nelson hit a 3 for a 96-88 lead with 48.9 seconds remaining. Davis rebounded Lopez's putback attempt with 9.7 seconds remaining in regulation. Holiday missed at the other end with 4 to go before Cousins blocked Lopez to send the game to overtime. ""He made a great play,"" Lopez said of Jerian Grant's pass to him. ""I missed two shots. It's frustrating."" The Pelicans opened the final quarter on a 20-7 run to take a 77-71 lead. Justin Holiday scored 10 points in the third quarter for the Bulls, who led by as much as nine and 64-57 after the period. ""I feel like they're better than their record shows,"" Cousins said about the Bulls. ""They're probably top-three hardest-playing teams in the league at this point."" The Pelicans shot 40.5 percent from the field to the Bulls' 31.9 percent in the first half of a tied game. ""We're going to have nights like this on the offensive end,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We had a few of them this year. If we can battle like that defensively, we're going to have a chance most nights."" RETURN LOOMING Bulls forward Bobby Portis' eight-game suspension ended Saturday. Hoiberg refrained from saying whether Portis will play Tuesday at Toronto. Portis was suspended Oct. 18 due to injuring teammate Nikola Mirotic in a fight at practice. Mirotic suffered broken bones in his face and a concussion and is expected to miss four to six weeks. He has been working out, but has yet to get on the court, Hoiberg said. ""The important thing is he's making progress and is in good spirits,"" Hoiberg said. A LOT OF TIME Cousins played more than 43 minutes and Davis over 41 as the Pelicans rely on their two bigs. ""It is kind of a catch-22,"" Gentry said. ""Do you take them out or do you try to win games and then try to find rest for them?"" TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans split two preseason games against the Bulls. ... Cousins and Davis are the only teammates among the league's top five scorers. Bulls: G David Nwaba exited with a right ankle sprain with 5:17 remaining in the third quarter. He had seven points and four rebounds. ... Brothers Jrue Holiday (New Orleans) and Justin Holiday (Chicago) both started. ... Markkanen added to his NBA record with his eighth straight game of at least two 3-pointers to start his career.","400974884"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- The last time the Minnesota Timberwolves won four games in a row was five years ago, when Karl-Anthony Towns was just a junior in high school. The Wolves are growing up fast, without much of the pains of past few seasons. Towns had 31 points and 12 rebounds, Andrew Wiggins added 23 points on 9-for-14 shooting and the Timberwolves used a season-high 33 assists to beat the floundering Dallas Mavericks 112-99 on Saturday night for their first four-game winning streak since Dec. 7-15, 2012. ""It's just one of many,"" Towns said, ""and hopefully four will seem like a little bit to us. It'll seem something like we're having a bad season if we're only getting four in a row at some point."" Holding Mavericks star Harrison Barnes scoreless in the second half, the Wolves enjoyed a blowout for once after the margin of their previous five victories totaled just 17 points. They played so well they still won by 13 points despite lapsing in a fourth quarter won by the Mavericks 30-19 to make notoriously demanding coach Tom Thibodeau uncomfortable. ""Obviously, it's better than losing,"" he said, ""but the big thing is for us to concentrate on improving."" Even Thibodeau had plenty of compliments afterward, though. Coming off a career-low two points Wednesday at New Orleans, when foul trouble against bulwarks DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis limited him to 22 minutes, Towns responded like the Timberwolves needed him to and thought he would. He had seven points and two rebounds during a 13-0 run late in the third quarter that pushed their lead to 25 points. ""The situation was more in my favor today,"" Towns said. ""I was able to go out there and play my game."" Barnes finished with 17 points for the Mavericks, who have the worst record in the NBA and their first 1-10 start since the 1993-94 season when they staggered out of the gate at 1-23 and finished 13-69. ""They've got a lot of good defenders that they can put on him,"" said coach Rick Carlisle, who kept Barnes on the bench in the fourth. ""Look, we just didn't do a good job moving the ball to start the second half, either. So some of that's on us. Some of it's on me. I've got to get him some better looks."" With franchise cornerstone Dirk Nowitzki not the same as his younger self, the Mavericks been relying heavily on their bounty of point guards. Rookie Dennis Smith Jr. had 18 points and Devin Harris (15 points) and J.J. Barea (14 points) provided a few sparks off the bench, but there's just not enough production to be found. The Mavericks entered the game with the third-lowest scoring average in the league. ""We have to bear down, collectively, and come with the energy and effort,"" Barnes said. ""Our starts in the first and the third have been problematic for us all season."" BUTLER DID IT The Wolves improved to 6-1 with linchpin Jimmy Butler on the floor, having lost both games the tenacious, versatile small forward missed with a virus, and the upside to this one was he finished with a season-low four points. He had five rebounds and seven assists. ""When I feel like it's my time to shoot, I'll shoot it. But as of right now, my teammates are rolling,"" Butler said. ""Feed them. Let them get us going."" WORK, BENCH Taj Gibson picked up some slack with 12 points and 10 rebounds, and Jeff Teague had 11 points and 10 assists. The reserves, playing as a five-man unit for long stretches, contributed often, too. Nemanja Bjelica and Tyus Jones each sank a pair of 3-pointers in the second quarter. Jamal Crawford used a shake-and-bake move for a 20-foot pull-up jumper he swished for a 90-62 lead that was the largest of the game for the Wolves. ROUGH ROAD AHEAD The Mavericks might have to wait a while longer for that next win. Their next 10 games include two matchups each with Oklahoma City and San Antonio and one against Cleveland, and all but one of them are against teams that made the playoffs last season. The Timberwolves, who visit Dallas on Nov. 17, are the only outlier. TIP-INS Mavericks: Nowitzki had seven points on 3-for-8 shooting in 22 minutes. ... Salah Mejri started at center for the first time this season. The 7-foot-2 Tunisian, who had 13 rebounds and five blocks against the Pelicans, went scoreless in nine minutes while picking up three fouls. Timberwolves: Bjelica is second in the NBA in 3-point shooting, behind Oklahoma City's Raymond Felton. He's the only player on the team with at least one make from behind the arc in all nine games this season. ... The Wolves have attempted more free throws than their opponent in all nine games.","400974885"
"DENVER --  The Golden State Warriors took to the road to work out some early season wrinkles in their overall game. Kevin Durant scored 25 points, Stephen Curry had 22 and the Warriors rode a big third quarter to a 127-108 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green added 15 points apiece for the Warriors. They have won six of their last seven, including all three during their just concluded trip. ""Getting on the road was good for us,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""Sometimes you need to get on the road to feel more threatened. A team like this especially that's used to being successful. I thought we took a couple of home games for granted and we weren't defending, we weren't bring energy."" Will Barton had 21 points off the bench to lead the Nuggets. None of Denver's starters reached double figures in scoring. Up by five at halftime, the Warriors forced a decisive turn in the game with a 24-4 run to start the third, taking an 84-59 lead when Curry hit a fall-away 3-pointer from the baseline after poking the ball away from Mason Plumlee for a steal. The Warriors finished with 43 points in the third -- the most points allowed by the Nuggets in a period this season -- and took a 103-76 lead into the fourth quarter. ""I think everybody came out with great energy in the second half. We found something in the pick and roll and we tried to exploit it,"" Durant said. ""Guys were moving on the backside without the ball, finding the open area and knocking down shots. ""We didn't play well a few games early on, but the last three games have been solid for us,"" Durant added. ""We'll try to take it home and build on that."" Durant had 13 of his points in the period and Curry added 12 in the same span, helping Golden State lead by as many as 29 points and outscore Denver by 22 points in the quarter. ""They just blitzed us and we didn't respond,"" Barton said. Both teams began to substitute freely early in the fourth quarter and the Warriors coasted to the victory. The Nuggets, trailing by 13 after the first quarter, scored 15 straight points to start the second behind their bench players and moved in front for the first time in the game on Barton's fastbreak 3-pointer 38-36 midway through the period. But Golden State came back to lead 60-55 at the half, scoring nine of the last 13 points in the final two minutes of the quarter capped by Thompson's 3-pointer off a feed from Curry an instant before the halftime buzzer sounded. Golden State, showcasing its transition game and ball movement throughout the game, finished with 37 assists, including a game high 11 by Curry. ""They never cave in,"" Barton said. ""When we went on that run in the second quarter, they just kept playing, kept on making plays, stuck to their game plan and weathered the storm. And if we're trying to be a good team, we've got to be able to do the same things."" LIGHTS OUT The Warriors shot 54.9 percent from the field, a season high by a Nuggets' opponent and yet another signal of Goden State's offensive potential on a nightly basis. ""I don't want to sit here and say we won't do that all season, but as long as we get good shots, we give ourselves a chance to shoot a good percentage,"" Green said. TIP-INS Warriors: G Shaun Livingston was inactive for the game as part of a designated rest day. ... F Damian Jones, the Warriors' first-round pick, is on assignment with the team's G League squad in Santa Cruz and could be there for a while. ""He's going to spend a lot of time down there because there's no point in him coming up here and sitting on the bench,"" Coach Steve Kerr said prior to the game. ""He needs to play. I could see bringing him up once in a while and giving him some playing time if we had an injury or something but for the most part he needs to play."" Nuggets: F Juancho Hernangomez remains sidelined because of a bout of mononucleosis. He has missed the past eight games. ... Michigan State coach Tom Izzo was in attendance to see a pair of his former Spartan stars -- Nuggets guard Gary Harris, who started 67 of his 68 career games under Izzo, and Warriors forward Green, a native of Saginaw, Michigan, who helped the Spartans to two Final Four appearances.","400974886"
"Kevin Love can't connect on the floater, but LeBron James is there for the putback dunk. (0:18) CLEVELAND -- Coming off LeBron James' 57-point performance, it appeared the Cavaliers had finally gained some momentum. A team that hadn't won since its season opener proved otherwise. Dennis Schroder scored 28 points and the injury-riddled Atlanta Hawks ended an eight-game losing streak, beating skidding Cleveland 117-115 on Sunday. The Hawks hadn't won since beating Dallas on Oct. 18 and were missing five players, but the Cavaliers went down to yet another puzzling loss. James, who had 26 points and 13 rebounds, was soaking his feet in a tub of ice water and had ice wraps on both knees and his right elbow following the game. He didn't have an explanation for why there was no carry-over from Friday's 130-122 win over Washington. ""That's a question I cannot answer,"" James said. ""I was ready to go. A lot of the guys were ready to go. I cannot answer that question."" Cavaliers forward Kevin Love was taken to the hospital after leaving in the third quarter with an illness. The team announced that Love, who had four points and four rebounds in 19 minutes, was treated and released. The Cavaliers cut a 16-point deficit in the second half to two on James' basket with 21 seconds left. Atlanta's Isaiah Taylor missed two free throws with 12.1 seconds to go, but Channing Frye missed a 3-pointer and Dwyane Wade's tip-in fell off the rim. ""To get a win in Cleveland is not easy to do,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""They had a chance down the stretch where they got back in it, but I'm happy for our guys. It's a good win."" The Cavaliers have also lost to Orlando, New York, Indiana and Brooklyn during their rocky stretch, which has included three straight defeats at home. Wade kept Cleveland in the game with 19 points in the first half and finished with a season-high 25. Cleveland's first-quarter problems continued. Coach Tyronn Lue used two timeouts in the first seven minutes as the Hawks raced ahead 27-11. ""No energy. The effort was pretty bad,"" James said of the early deficit. ""You turn the corner but you can't fix it in one game. We just have to try and figure it out."" Schroder scored 11 straight points in the third quarter to keep Atlanta ahead. Cleveland steadily cut into the lead behind Kyle Korver's 19 points in the fourth. ""It's a special place to play and everyone was excited to compete against these guys,"" Schroder said. Atlanta put seven players in double figures, including the five starters. Luke Babbitt, making his first start of the season in place of Mike Muscala (sprained ankle), and Taurean Prince each scored 17 points. TIP-INS Cavaliers: G Iman Shumpert (sore right knee) will practice Monday for the first time since being injured Nov. 29. He could play Tuesday against Milwaukee. ... F Tristan Thompson (strained left calf) is expected to miss three to four weeks. Hawks: Rookie F Tyler Cavanaugh was in uniform after signing a two-way contract Saturday. ... G Malcolm Delaney (sprained right ankle), F Ersan Ilyasova (bruised left knee), C Miles Plumlee (strained right quadriceps) and F DeAndre' Bembry (fractured right wrist) also were unavailable. RIGHT TO THE POINT Frye said he should have made the 3-pointer in the closing seconds. The veteran forward also put his finger on the Cavaliers' problems. ""Honestly, we've got to play harder, be more attentive to detail and have a better sense of urgency,"" he said. ON THE WAY BACK Cleveland point guard Isaiah Thomas, acquired as part of the trade that sent Kyrie Irving to Boston, has been doing on-court workouts. The team announced before the season that it hoped he would return by January. ""The staff's doing a great job trying to get him ready,"" Lue said. ""We don't want to rush him back if he's not 100 percent. They've been doing a good job taking it slow and make sure they rehabilitate him the right way."" Thomas averaged a career-high 28.9 points, third in the league, last season. Derrick Rose has been starting at point guard while James has also run the offense.","400974887"
"Hassan Whiteside takes the feed from James Johnson and throws down the dunk. (0:18) LOS ANGELES --  For most of the fourth quarter Sunday, the Miami Heat looked capable of blowing a game they led by as many as 25 points in the second half. They did not score their first basket in the period until more than five minutes had passed. They turned the ball over seven times to the Clippers, who suddenly got hot and opened the quarter with a 16-0 run. The Clippers stormed all the way back to take the lead, but the Heat made the key free throws in the final seconds that Los Angeles could not, hanging on for a 104-101 victory. After Austin Rivers failed to make two free throws with 17.1 seconds left for the Clippers, James Johnson hit two for Miami to put the Heat back up by one. The Clippers' final chance found the ball in Blake Griffin's hands, guarded on a switch by Miami's Hassan Whiteside. Griffin missed a 3-point attempt with 3 seconds left and Josh Richardson hit two final three throws for Miami. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra seemed almost excited by the final Whiteside-Griffin matchup. ""That's what you want out of a Defensive Player of the Year candidate going against an MVP-level candidate,"" he said. ""You don't see too many of those in today's game where it's just `mano y mano.' "" Whiteside led the Heat with 21 points and 17 rebounds, while Griffin led the Clippers with 23 points -- but three shy of what he wanted. ""We don't want to be in that position, but if we are it's a shot I'm willing to take,"" Griffin said. ""Unfortunately, it didn't go in."" The Heat dominated play early. They led 34-20 at the end of the first quarter and 62-49 at the half, before pushing their lead to as big as 89-64 near the end of the third quarter. ""I'm more upset about falling behind by 25,"" Griffin said. ""Coming back shows a lot of heart . but you shouldn't put yourself in that position in the first place."" Miami got strong bench play. Tyler Johnson had 19 points and Wayne Ellington 17. The Heat were 14 of 36 on 3-pointers. The Clippers got 22 from Lou Williams off the bench, 13 coming in the fourth quarter when he led Los Angeles' initial comeback with reserves. ""The second unit saved us,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. ""They were spectacular."" TIP-INS Heat: Starting guard Dion Waiters was not with the team. He returned to Miami for the birth of his daughter -- Dior Raina Waiters was born Sunday morning. Waiters is expected to rejoin the Heat later this week as their six-game road trip continues. Clippers: Recalled forward Brice Johnson from their NBA G League in Ontario, California. In Ontario's first two games, Johnson averaged 17.5 points and 10.5 rebounds. HEAT SWITCH Griffin was originally guarded on the final play by Johnson, but was screened by Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, leaving Whiteside to defend him on the final play. ""When DeAndre Jordan came and set the screen on me, I heard a loud `pull switch,' "" Johnson said. ""I had all the confidence in the world that our big fella was going to get that stop."" RIVERS LAMENT The point guard blamed himself for the loss after missing his two last free throws and the Clippers up by one. ""Those are the situations I dream of being in,"" he said. ""It's just really disappointing and frustrating. I feel like it's my fault we lost the game."" GALLINARI HURTING Clippers starting forward Danilo Gallinari sat out the second half with a left hip contusion. Gallinari will go on the Clippers' three-game road trip, but limped out of the arena after the game. Gallinari said he originally injured the hip a week ago, but aggravated it Sunday. ""I've been having pain the last two or three games and now it's getting to the point where I'm having problems walking,"" he said. ""I've got to take care of it.""","400974888"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Kyrie Irving and Al Horford have been the primary forces behind so much of what the Boston Celtics are doing well during their eight-game winning streak. On Sunday, it was key contributions off the bench from Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier. The reserve duo brought energy and grit during the Celtics' 104-88 win over Orlando on Sunday night. Boston (8-2) carried a modest eight-point lead into the fourth quarter, but quickly pushed that advantage to double-digits as Smart and Rozier hustled for loose balls to help turn a tight game into a blowout in the final quarter. ""Their impact is huge,"" said Celtics coach Brad Stevens. ""I thought a big part of our playoff success last year was Smart and Terry coming off the bench together and that has been validated in the first couple of weeks of the season."" Smart was one of six Celtics players in double figures with 11 points to go along with eight rebounds, eight assists and three steals. Rozier added six points and seven rebounds. ""We play really well off of each other,"" Smart said. ""When Terry has the ball he can create for himself and when I have the ball vice versa. ""Me and Terry, we just complement each other."" They helped put together an impressive defensive performance by the Celtics, limiting the NBA's best 3-point shooting team to just under 21 percent from behind the arc. Boston outscored the Magic 27-19 in the fourth quarter while leading by as many as 23 points in the final period. The Magic (6-4) only got six points from leading scorer Evan Fournier. Nikola Vucevic was held to just 13 points, which included a 1 for 4 showing from beyond the arc. It was the eighth time during this current eight-game winning streak that the Celtics have held an opponent to under 94 points. Boston, meanwhile, received strong scoring from Jaylen Brown and Horford, who finished with 18 points and 14 points, respectively. ""We're in a good place presently but we understand there are still some things we can control on that end, some effort things as well as principle things,"" said Irving, who only scored one point in the second half and finished with 11 points on the night. ""But we feel like we are in a good place, but obviously there is always room to improve."" The Magic, which has been slowed by injuries to their top two point guards, were out of offensive rhythm for the second straight game and their second straight loss. They shot just 36 percent from the field and converted only 6 of 29 3-point attempts. ""We didn't execute great shot selection and patience at times,"" said Orlando coach Frank Vogel. ""Credit Boston's defense because they take you out of your stuff, your first action or your first look and you have to be patient against that."" TIP-INS Celtics: Morris, who made his season debut during Friday's win over Oklahoma City, was inserted into the starting lineup for Sunday's game. Celtics coach Brad Stevens, however, said Morris will not play in Monday's game at Atlanta. Morris missed the first eight games due to a sore knee. ... After a subpar first half on Friday, Irving had 10 points on 4-of-8 shooting in the first half Sunday to help the Celtics take a 49-38 lead into halftime. Magic: Point guard Elfrid Payton missed his eighth straight game with a strained left hamstring injury, but Vogel is expecting him to be ready to go against the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. ...The Magic converted just 3 of 13 from 3-point range in the first half.","400974889"
"TORONTO -- Another big night from Bradley Beal helped the Washington Wizards win without All-Star guard John Wall. Beal scored 38 points, Otto Porter Jr. had 19 and the Wizards never trailed in beating Toronto 107-96 on Sunday night, winning for the second time in 11 meetings with the Raptors. Marcin Gortat, who had 11 points and 12 rebounds, said Beal is ""playing at a different level."" Beal has scored at least 36 points in three straight games, including a season-high 40 in last week's win over Phoenix. ""Hands down, he's probably the best go-to guy at the 2 spot in the league,"" Gortat said. ""He's just a freak right now."" Markieff Morris and Kelly Oubre Jr. each scored 10 points for the Wizards, who had lost four of their previous five. Tim Frazier shook off a sore left wrist to start for Wall and had eight assists. Wall sat out because of a sprained left shoulder sustained in Friday's 130-122 loss to Cleveland. He is expected to return for Tuesday's home game against Dallas. ""We knew that we were going to have to play a good basketball game to beat them without John and I thought our guys responded,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. Toronto lost its starting point guard when Kyle Lowry was ejected with 8:08 remaining in the second quarter after picking up two technical fouls in quick succession for arguing. Lowry finished with two points in 12 minutes. ""It helped us,"" Beal said. ""He's a great player, a great scorer, great facilitator. I think he let the refs frustrate him and got ejected. That plays in our favor."" Lowry left without speaking to reporters, but Raptors coach Dwane Casey said he felt referee JB DeRosa's ejection was too hasty. ""I thought it was unfortunate,"" Casey said. ""People have said worse that than, they've said far worse than what he said to the official. First off, if you're a young official, walk away. You don't stand there and debate with a player that's frustrated."" DeMar DeRozan scored 26 points and Norman Powell had 19 as Toronto lost for the first time in three home games this season. Delon Wright scored 11 points and Fred VanVleet had 10 as the Raptors lost in their return from a season-high, six-game road trip that saw them go 3-3 against Western Conference opponents. ""We talked about the travel situation, how tough it is to find energy and professionalism and playing with a purpose once you come back off a long road trip and evidently it didn't sink in,"" Casey said. Toronto trailed by 19 in the third quarter before mounting a comeback, cutting the gap to 88-85 on a three-point play by DeRozan with 7:24 remaining. Beal and Oubre handled all the offense as Washington scored 12 of the next 14 points to take a 100-87 lead with 4:30 remaining. Beal scored nine points and Porter had eight as Washington led 32-17 after one, a quarter in which the Raptors had nearly as many turnovers (four) as made field goals (five). Toronto shot 5 for 19 in the first, including 1 for 7 from 3-point range, and missed seven of 13 free throw attempts. ""Our starts have been horrendous,"" Casey said. TIP-INS Wizards: Morris played his second game of the season after missing the first six following sports hernia surgery. ... Beal missed just two of 11 field goal attempts in the first half, then missed his first two of the second half. Raptors: CJ Miles returned after missing Friday's win at Utah because of flu-like symptoms. He went scoreless in 13 minutes. ... Toronto's 17 points in the first were a season-low for any quarter. The Raptors scored 18 in the fourth quarter of last week's win at Portland. WARMING UP Lowry wore a heat pad on his lower back during pregame warmups, and Casey said his point guard has been dealing with some soreness. CHARGES DENIED Brooks said he might rein in Frazier's habit of drawing charges after Frazier injured his wrist taking a charge in Friday's loss to Cleveland. ""He took three charges in practice a couple of days ago,"" Brooks said. ""I might have a no charge rule for Tim for a while.""","400974890"
"James Harden sets a new career high with 56 points to go with his 13 assists in a win against the Jazz. (1:01) HOUSTON --  James Harden had just scored a career-high 56 points when he was asked if he knew he had fallen one point shy of the Houston Rockets' record. Harden shrugged and replied, ""We won, right?"" And they did it with Harden only playing 35 minutes in a 137-110 victory over the Utah Jazz on Sunday night that ran their Western Conference-best record to 8-3. Harden fell just shy of Calvin Murphy's 57 points against New Jersey in 1978, but he joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to have 10 assists and shoot better than 75 percent from the field in a 50-point performance. Harden had 13 assists and shot a sizzling 76 percent from the floor, hitting 19 of 25 shots after missing his last three attempts. The MVP runner-up was a perfect 7 for 7 from beyond the arc until he missed a step-back 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter as the shot clock was about to expire. Even when the Jazz could deny Harden his shot, he dished it off for someone else to score. Eric Gordon scored 20 points, Trevor Ariza had 14 and Nene scored 13 off the bench. ""That was one of the best performances I've ever seen,"" Gordon said. ""He was picking them apart and not just with scoring. What else can you do?"" Ariza had the answer to that: nothing. ""I don't think there's any defense for him, period,"" Ariza said. ""When he's on, what can you do? Two people can't guard him when he's on like that."" Harden received a standing ovation from the Toyota Center crowd, which rained down ""MVP! MVP!"" chants at multiple points during the game. He had 22 points in both the first and third quarters, 30 at halftime and sat for the final 7:32 of the blowout. Harden said he was unaware he was 8 for 8 in the first quarter and made his first 10 shots to start the game. ""I mean, I was just shooting, I don't really know,"" Harden said. ""I don't pay too much attention to it."" Donovan Mitchell led Utah with 17 points in 25 minutes off the bench. Rudy Gobert had 13 points but was held to a season-low five rebounds in 25 minutes. The Rockets have won three straight, while the Jazz have lost back-to-back games following a three-game winning streak. Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder called Harden one of the smartest players in the league. ""We're disappointed, obviously, in our group and our performance, particularly defensively,"" Snyder said. ""There wasn't enough resilience, and there wasn't enough toughness. There wasn't a collective resolve that you need against a team that's that talented and against a player that's having the kind of night he was having."" Houston scored at least 119 points for a third straight game. Last season, the Rockets were 43-5 when scoring 110 points or more and 12-22 when failing to do so. Houston's 23 3-pointers fell two shy of Cleveland's NBA record, set last season. ""I'm just going to hazard a guess when we shoot 59 (percent) from 3s, we're probably not going to lose too many games,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said with a grin. ""That's just a wild guess."" Jazz: Gobert received a technical foul late in the first half for shouting at an official following a dunk. ... The Jazz shot 43.7 percent from the field, including 38.2 percent from 3-point range. Rockets: Clint Capela had eight points, eight rebounds and four blocks, including two on Gobert. ... Houston made 59.3 percent of its shots, including 59 percent from beyond the 3-point line on 23-of-39 shooting. GREETING THE CHAMPS Between the first and second quarter, the Rockets recognized the Houston Astros for their World Series win over Los Angeles, the first in franchise history. At midcourt, manager A.J. Hinch, outfielder Jake Marisnick and pitchers Lance McCullers, Mike Fiers and Dallas Keuchel held the World Series trophy to a loud ovation. Earlier in the day, several Astros players brought the trophy to the Texans' game against the Colts. BILES' MISS As part of the Rockets' new First Shot promotion featuring a local celebrity shooting a free throw before tipoff for charity, Olympic gold medalist gymnast Simone Biles became the first participant to miss her attempt. A made shot secures a $5,000 donation from the Rockets, while a miss equals $1,000. The 4-foot-9 gymnast from nearby Spring, Texas clanked her shot off the backboard to the right of the rim. MOMENT OF SILENCE Prior to the singing of the national anthem, the Rockets observed a moment of silence for the victims of Sunday morning's mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, near San Antonio.","400974891"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs overcame a slow start and a heavy heart to beat the Phoenix Suns. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 21 points and San Antonio rolled to a 112-95 victory on Sunday night following a dominant third quarter. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich earned his 1,156th victory, passing Phil Jackson for sixth all-time, but the veteran coach's thoughts were on the victims of the mass shooting in nearby Sutherland Springs. A lone gunman killed 26 people and injured 20 others at First Baptist Church, which is located 32 miles from the AT&amp;T Center. The gunman was found dead in his vehicle following a brief chase. ""We won a basketball game. Considering what's gone on today, it's pretty meaningless,"" Popovich said in his brief postgame remarks. ""When you think about the tragedy those families are suffering, it's inconceivable and impossible to put your head around. So, I think talking about basketball is probably pretty inappropriate. So, you guys have a good night."" The Spurs were low on energy in the first half, falling behind 65-61 against the short-handed Suns. Playing without four players and with T.J. Warren nursing a head injury, Phoenix shot 69 percent from the field in the second quarter. Warren scored a team-high 17 points. ""In the first half we were moving the ball, especially entering the second quarter,"" Warren said. ""Moving the ball, getting good shots, exploiting mismatches, but we know basketball is two halves not one. We've just got to put it all together."" The Spurs turned things around in the third quarter by holding the Suns to 13 points, the lowest production by an opponent in any quarter this season. San Antonio won the period by 21 points, its largest point differential in the third quarter since 2012. ""The last couple games our third quarters have been kind of slow, and we just had to come out with intensity,"" said Spurs forward Rudy Gay, who had 12 points. ""We made a couple defensive changes, and offensively that's going to come, but we just had to have the mindset of coming out there to win the game in the third quarter."" Patty Mills had 11 points in the third, going 3 for 3 on 3-pointers, and Aldridge had eight. Mills finished with 17 points and Danny Green added 14. With Manu Ginobili sitting out for rest after playing in back-to-back games, San Antonio's young reserves stepped forward. Dejounte Murray had 13 points, Bryn Forbes added 12 and Brandon Paul scored 11. Forbes scored in double figures in consecutive games for the first time in his two-year career. Troy Daniels added 14 points for Phoenix and Devin Booker was held to a season-low nine points on 3-for-11 shooting. TIP-INS Suns: Warren played after recovering from a head injury suffered against New York. Warren reported having a headache, but was cleared after participating in non-contact drills Saturday and completing pregame workouts. ... Phoenix was without guards Eric Bledsoe (not with team) Brandon Knight (left ACL tear) and Davon Reed (left meniscus repair) and forward Alan Williams (right meniscus repair). Bledsoe has not been with the team since Oct. 22 when he posted ""I Don't wanna be here,"" on Twitter, the day the Suns fired coach Earl Watson. Spurs: Gay came up hobbling after tumbling to the court with 10 minutes left in the game after Paul fell into him following a dunk. Popovich quickly rose from the bench with a look of concern, but Gay remained in the game after walking to the scorer's table to recuperate. ... San Antonio has made a 3-pointer in 985 consecutive games. . The Spurs have held double-digit leads in seven of their 10 games this season. PARKER PROGRESSING Tony Parker, who like Kawhi Leonard has yet to play this season, participated in pregame warmups. Parker, who had surgery to repair a torn left quadriceps tendon, was moving with no noticeable limp or discomfort. Parker is scheduled to return in mid- to late-November, which is about the same time Leonard is expected to return. SCHEDULING CONFLICT Jay Triano is still getting accustomed to his new role in Phoenix. Triano was puzzled when asked if he recalled playing a back-to-back in the final days of a 10-day road trip. ""We have a back-to-back?"" asked Triano, who was named interim coach Oct. 23 after the Suns fired Earl Watson. Reporters chuckled, ""Yea, tomorrow."" Triano laughed, ""I told you that before, one at a time."" PLAYING FOR THE BEST Spurs center Pau Gasol said there are similarities between Jackson and Popovich, even though they have different coaching styles. ""Two of the greatest of all-time,"" Gasol said. ""I had the luxury and privilege to be coached by two of the greatest. I'm a lucky guy. Very different, in different ways, but ultimately, they love the game, they respect the game, they're thorough (and) they're incredible coaches. I'm glad for Pop. His dedication to the game, and how excellent and superb he's been as a coach, and how successful his teams have been.""","400974892"
"Kristaps Porzingis records 40 points and six blocks, leading the Knicks to a comeback win against the Pacers and putting him in company with a MSG legend. (0:46) NEW YORK --  Kristaps Porzingis was aware of Phil Jackson's concern that he wasn't ready to take over. Once Carmelo Anthony was traded, he knew he'd get the chance to prove otherwise. Porzingis scored a career-high 40 points, carrying the New York Knicks back from a 19-point deficit for a 108-101 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night. ""The challenge is never too big for me"", said Porzingis, who is the first player in the NBA since 1983-84 to post at least 40 points, five rebounds, five blocks and make two 3-pointers. ""I always accept the challenge and that's why I knew coming into this season, if Melo was not going to be here, then I am going to have to be the guy."" After scoring 15 straight points that spanned the third and fourth quarters, the 22-year-old from Latvia passed to rookie Frank Ntilikina for a 3-pointer that broke a 99-all tie with 1:34 remaining. ""I had to get rid of the ball,"" Porzingis said. ""That was the right play in that moment. Frank made that big shot."" Porzingis added eight rebounds and six blocked shots in his seventh 30-point performance in nine games this season, a good glimpse of someone that's definitely welcomed the chance to fill the void created by Anthony's exit. Ntilikina scored 10 points and seven assists off the bench as the Knicks won for the fifth time in six games after an 0-3 start. Tim Hardaway Jr. had 16 points. Ntilikina's 3-pointer was his second of a fourth quarter in which he played its entirety. ""I knew it was a good shot, a wide-open shot,"" he said. ""Nobody was there to deny the shot, so I took it. And I just took it with confidence."" Thaddeus Young scored 18 points and Victor Oladipo had 17 for the Pacers, who led 84-65 with under 2 minutes remaining in the third quarter. ""They went to switching. We didn't show patience in attacking the mismatch"", Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. Porzingis, who played after tweaking his left ankle in a 37-point performance Friday night, reeled off nine straight points that made it 84-74 in the opening seconds of the fourth. He scored 24 points over the final 13 minutes of the game. Young then broke a five-minute stretch in which Indiana failed to make a shot, hitting consecutive 3-point baskets that put them back up 90-74 with 10:02 left in the final quarter. But it wasn't enough to quiet down the Knicks, who went on a 25-9 run, capped by Porzingis' five straight points, including a 17-foot jumper that evened it at 99 with 2:14 left. After Ntilikina's 3-pointer made it 102-99, Knicks center Enes Kanter picked up a bad pass by Darren Collison and fed Tim Hardaway Jr. for a layup that made it 104-99 with 1:10 to go. Oladipo cut the deficit to 104-101 with 32 seconds left in the game, but Lance Thomas' two free throws made it 106-101 to seal the comeback win with 11.9 seconds to play. ""Porzingis, he obviously got hot and brought them back into the game to help win the game,"" Oladipo said. ""It is a tough loss for us, especially being up. I got to do better as a leader as well, especially down the stretch of the fourth quarter."" Myles Turner added 15 points and Collison had 15 points and 10 assists for the Pacers, who've lost two straight. TIP-INS Pacers: F T.J. Leaf, who sprained his left ankle during Friday night's game in Philadelphia, did not play. ... Domantas Sabonis had 16 points off the bench. Knicks: Kanter grabbed 18 rebounds. .

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Jeff Teague spent the first quarter getting his Timberwolves teammates into the game. He spent the rest of the night taking the Hornets out of it. Teague had 18 points and 12 assists, and Minnesota beat Charlotte 112-94 on Sunday for its fifth straight victory. Teague scored just two points but dished out seven assists as the first quarter ended with the teams tied at 28. But in the second quarter, Teague took over the scoring duties, hitting three 3-pointers in transition as Minnesota pulled out to a 17-point lead and never looked back. ""We've got so much talent on this team, so many guys who can do so many things,"" said Teague, who signed with the Timberwolves after spending seven years in Atlanta and one in Indiana. ""I think it's my role to try to get those guys going, and then things will come a little easier to me."" Andrew Wiggins led Minnesota with 20 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns, Jimmy Butler, Gorgui Dieng and Jamal Crawford all reached double figures in scoring. ""He's not only scoring, he's getting everyone else involved,"" Butler said of Teague. ""When he's playing at a high level, it's so much easier for everybody to follow."" The Timberwolves moved to 7-3 on the young season, just a half-game behind Houston for the top spot in the Western Conference. The last time Minnesota won five games in a row was Jan. 2-10, 2009. Cody Zeller led Charlotte with 16 points, while Marvin Williams, Dwight Howard and Jeremy Lamb each scored 13 points for the Hornets. All-Star Kemba Walker was limited to nine points on 4-for-15 shooting. ""We weren't there. Our talk was off, our communication was bad, we weren't getting to our spots,"" Hornets forward Frank Kaminsky said. ""It's just, we didn't play well on defense. That's the end of the story."" Minnesota pulled out to a double-digit lead on the strength of a 12-2 run midway through the second quarter. The flurry culminated in three 3-pointers on three straight shots. Teague pulled up in transition and hit the first two; on the next possession, he called for the ball at the top of the key, and when Howard closed hard on Teague, the Timberwolves' assist leader slipped a pass to Butler, who drained a 3 from the wing. Teague later added another 3-pointer and a driving layup for 11 points in the quarter as Minnesota led 68-51 at the half. ""I thought he had a good blend when the game was hanging in the balance in the second quarter,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""He had three 3s that sort of opened it up. I think when he does that, it puts more pressure on the defense to come up, and that opens up other things."" With six players scoring at least 13 points, a 54-38 rebounding edge and 30 free throw attempts, the Timberwolves put together one of their strongest all-around games of the season. But the point guard who's been in Minneapolis for all of 10 games knows there's plenty of work left to do. ""It's still a work in progress. We're still trying to figure out each other,"" Teague said. ""We're starting to get into a little groove but we're miles away from the team we want to be."" TIP-INS Hornets: F Michael Kidd-Gilchrist missed his second straight game due to personal reasons. ... The Hornets have lost two straight after posting a season-high, three-game winning streak. . Charlotte dropped to 1-4 on the road.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard appears to have shelved whatever problems he had with his shooting touch the first two weeks of the NBA season. The Portland guard tied his season high with 36 points, hitting 10 of 18 shots and going 15 of 15 from the free throw line, and the Trail Blazers held off the Oklahoma City Thunder 103-99 on Sunday night. Lillard also handed out a season-high 13 assists. Paul George topped the Thunder (4-5) with 27 points. Russell Westbrook had 25 points and nine assists. Lillard went through a five-game stretch where he shot a collective 34 percent (30 of 88). But he has picked it up of late, as Sunday was his fourth consecutive 30-point game. It didn't hurt the confident Lillard that he was facing Westbrook, the 2016-17 NBA MVP. ""I go into every game with the same attitude, but obviously when you're playing against a former MVP, you want to embrace that challenge. You know that if you don't, he's going to take your lunch,"" Lillard said. ""If I don't step up, how's my team going to step up?"" Jusuf Nurkic had 25 points and eight rebounds, while C.J. McCollum hit six 3-pointers and scored 22 points for the Blazers. Coming off a 28-point performance against the Los Angeles Lakers last Thursday, it was the first time Nurkic has scored at least 20 points in consecutive games this season. ""I'm focusing on finishing at the rim, and help in any way that I can. I know this team can win if I bring my good game,"" Nurkic said. Portland needed all of Lillard and Nurkic's efforts to fend off Oklahoma City, which played short-handed for much of the second half after Carmelo Anthony was ejected for a flagrant 2 foul. Anthony, who had 15 points and six rebounds, was ejected with 4:26 left in the third quarter. Driving to the basket for a layup, Anthony elbowed the chin of Nurkic, who collapsed and lay on the floor for more than a minute. Initially, Nurkic was called for the foul, but following a video review, Anthony was hit with a flagrant 2 foul. The call baffled Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan. ""I've never seen, in the history of the game, a guy gets an and-1' play and then get ejected from the game,"" Donovan said. Portland was beginning to take control of the game before the Anthony ejection, and it only helped fuel the Blazers. Portland separated itself with a 10-0 run to take a 16-point lead. Lillard scored 14 points during the third quarter as the Blazers led 78-67 heading into the fourth. But after going scoreless for more than four minutes, the Blazers' advantage began to wilt. Oklahoma City got to 90-88 on two free throws by Westbrook, but consecutive 3-pointers by McCollum, and Lillard's layup helped the Blazers maintain the lead. The Thunder's comeback hopes were dashed when, down 98-94 with 20.5 seconds left, Westbrook missed three consecutive free throws. ""We've been in these positions before and found ways to lose them. We kept our composure and made our free throws when it mattered,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. The game started as an offensive showcase, as the teams combined to hit 13 of their first 16 shots. The Thunder cooled considerably, though, while Portland shot 58 percent during the first half to take a 50-46 halftime lead. For a second straight game, the Blazers were without starting forward Al-Farouq Aminu, who sprained his right ankle Wednesday night against Utah. TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City is 0-4 against Northwest Division foes this season. ... One tradition that continues is Portland fans' booing of Raymond Felton. The Thunder guard was a bust during his one season playing for the Blazers in 2011-12. Felton scored a season-high 15 points. Blazers: Lillard had seven assists in the first eight minutes . Lillard has hit 43 consecutive free throws. ... Nurkic is averaging 24.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 3.3 assists over his past three games. ANTHONY FLAGRANT EXPLAINED Crew chief Rodney Mott explained why Anthony's third-quarter foul was a flagrant 2 and not a common foul. ""We deemed that the contact was excessive and that it was not a natural basketball move where he seeks out Nurkic, hits him in the face with an elbow and goes back to the basket,"" Mott told a pool reporter.","400974895"
"LOS ANGELES --  Luke Walton realizes the Los Angeles Lakers will have to climb a steep learning curve as long as they're starting two rookies and a second-year pro who recently turned 20. The exciting youngsters are learning how to survive the NBA's perils from veterans Brook Lopez and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who led the way to another win for a rapidly evolving team. Lopez scored 21 points, Brandon Ingram added 20 and the Lakers blew most of a 22-point lead before hanging on for their third victory in four games, 107-102 over the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday night. Rookie Kyle Kuzma had 13 points and 12 rebounds in his second career start as the Lakers beat Memphis at Staples Center for the fourth straight time despite the Grizzlies' furious late rally. That's all part of the plan for the Lakers, who improved to 5-5 with another resilient effort. ""When we're playing aggressive like that, when we're defending like that, or communicating like that, we're in the game, which is not easy at this level,"" Walton said. ""There's a lot of really good teams out there. We've played and competed and even beat a few of them so far. But I think for our young players, it shows them firsthand what that's all about."" Los Angeles got at least nine points from seven players, including 15 apiece from Caldwell-Pope and Jordan Clarkson. Tyreke Evans scored 26 points and Mike Conley added 11 of his 23 in the fourth quarter for the Grizzlies, who trailed by 15 points with 5:18 to play before rallying. Memphis trimmed the Lakers' lead to 103-100 with 42 seconds left on Dillon Brooks' free throws after a flagrant foul by Lopez. But Caldwell-Pope swiped the ball from James Ennis III moments before hitting a jumper with 19.1 seconds to play. Lopez added two free throws with 5.5 seconds left to seal it. ""Those guys have played a lot of NBA games, and a lot of us have only played 10 NBA games,"" Kuzma said. ""It's big for them to step up and lead."" Marc Gasol had 15 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists for the Grizzlies, who have lost three of four. One night after opening a five-game road trip with a win over the Clippers, Memphis ran out of time to counter the Lakers' third-quarter surge to an 86-64 lead. ""It was a tough (third) quarter,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""They really got after us. The thing that I was most happy about is the resolve we showed, and our huddles were awesome. Guys were really encouraging each other."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Chandler Parsons sat out to rest. ... Brooks scored 13 points in his second straight start. ... Kanye West watched from courtside and chatted with Conley at halftime. Conley recently said the music mogul once called him out of the blue to say he's a big fan, and that he thinks Conley is wildly underrated.

He eventually walked to the locker room without aid and returned to the bench several minutes later. The team said he injured his left hip. ... C Andrew Bogut sat out with back tightness. ... Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig got wild cheers when he appeared on the video board. Nashville Predators defensemen P.K. Subban and Roman Josi also attended the game.

He relished his matchup with Gasol, praising the Spaniard as one of the NBA's toughest tasks for a big man. QUOTABLE ""We just waited too long to have that sense of urgency to win the game,"" Conley said. ""We have to be better, especially on the second game of a back-to-back against a young team.

Dribbling and weaving through the lane and around the perimeter, Irving scored from all over and kept his teammates involved all night. ""It's a beautiful game when it's played the right way,"" the four-time All-Star said. ""It's not going to look good every possession, but you've got to be able to move onto the next play. I understand that better than most."" Irving scored 35 points, Jayson Tatum added 21 and the Boston Celtics held off the Atlanta Hawks 110-107 Monday night for their ninth straight victory. Irving's 3 from the right wing put the Celtics up 104-103 -- the game's 25th lead change -- with 1:37 remaining, and Boston led the rest of the way. Dennis Schroder had 23 points for the rebuilding Hawks, who dropped to 2-9 a night after a surprising two-point win at Cleveland. ""It would've been sweet to win two in a row against those kinds of teams,"" Schroder said. ""But we ended up short."" Boston improved to 9-2, best in the NBA, and has its longest winning streak in seven years. Al Horford had 15 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists in his best game against the Hawks. Horford spent his first nine seasons in Atlanta before leaving as a free agent ahead of last season and had totals of 20 points and 17 rebounds in three games against his former team. Irving had his first 30-point game as a Celtic on a night packed with highlights. He dribbled between his legs and behind his back before hitting a floater off the glass from the left baseline to put Boston up 46-44. He had two impressive assists late in the third with long, one-handed passes that led to 3s by Marcus Smart and Tatum, the latter giving Boston a 72-71 lead. Irving either scored or assisted on every basket of a 16-2 run in the third that put the Celtics up by seven. He finished with seven assists. ""He's just very unique,"" Horford said. ""He has a good sense of how teams are playing him."" The Celtics started to pull away and took their biggest lead at 10 on Semi Ojeleye's 3 early in the fourth, but the Hawks came back to take a few brief leads in the final period. ""To compete the way we did and give ourselves a chance to win, we got better tonight and we can learn from it,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenhozler said. THAT'S A DRAG Boston coach Brad Stevens wasn't pleased with the ball movement or defense early in the third, storming the floor to call timeout after Atlanta's Luke Babbitt hit a 3 to put the Hawks up 57-54. ""You could just tell mentally and physically we were dragging a little bit,"" Irving said. ""That's going to happen sometimes considering how hard we play, but we don't want to make that a habit for us. No excuse."" RAINING DOWN Budenholzer joked before the game that he regretted having his assistants work with the 6-foot-10 Horford a couple of years ago to develop a strong presence beyond the perimeter. Horford, who went just 1 for 5 on 3s, entered the game shooting nearly 52 percent on 33 attempts from the arc. ""I think there was just a real push from us and a credit to him that he could do it,"" Budenholzer said. ""It's part of the way the game is, and his passing just opens up the court even more for him to drive and attack. He's such a good player, such a smart player.""

Golden State is 3-11 over the past three seasons when held below 100 points. ""I thought it was our best defensive effort of the year,"" Kerr said. ""It was a grind-it-out game and I thought we did a good job of staying with it. We held them to 80 points. That's kind of a playoff style win where you have to grind it out, nothing's easy.""

Durant added six assists and three blocks, making all 10 of his free throws as the Warriors shot 22 of 24 from the line. ""I just feel that's East Coast basketball. If we want to be a great team we've got to play different ways,"" Durant said. ""It's a good test for us."" James Johnson scored 21 points off the bench and Goran Dragic contributed 19 points for Miami a night after squeaking out a 104-101 road win against the Clippers. Thompson missed his first four 3-point tries before connecting late in the first half as Golden State took a 50-37 lead into intermission. Curry was 1 for 9 in the first half and Durant 3 for 8 -- and they went a combined 0 for 7 from deep -- before Golden State got going a bit after halftime. Curry was hit with a technical at the 3:20 mark of the first quarter for an elbow to Tyler Johnson while the Golden State star drove to the basket. Both teams were cold shooting in the early going -- Golden State 29.2 percent in the first quarter to 38.1 by Miami, which committed seven of its 23 turnovers in the period. WHITESIDE'S MINUTES Heat center Hassan Whiteside played just 16-plus minutes, shooting 1 of 9 for three points and six rebounds and sat most of the second half. ""This is one game, he understands how important he is to our team to play at a high level, high energy level, so we'll move on to Phoenix and look to have a much better game,"" coach Erik Spoelstra said. KERR ON GUN CONTROL Shootings touch Kerr personally. His father, Malcolm, was murdered on Jan. 18, 1984, as the President of American University of Beirut. Kerr offered condolences and thoughts to victims of the Texas church shooting that killed 26 -- not to mention a strong message on gun control. ""It's just awful, and that's the prevailing sentiment from all of us today,"" Kerr said. ""To solve it, I think we almost have to look at it like a public health issue. Too often, I think we get caught up in political rhetoric, Second Amendment rights, NRA stuff. We have to look at this it has nothing to do with partisanship or political parties. ""This has got to be a public safety issue, a public health issue. We have to somehow get our government to cut through all the crap and get right to the point -- the point of fact which is safety, which means a lot of things we can do without taking away people's Second Amendment rights. Let's do the sensible thing."" TIP-INS Heat: Spoelstra received a technical for arguing late in the first half. ... Miami lost its fourth straight on the Warriors' home floor. ... Starting G Dion Waiters is still away from the team after he returned to Miami for the birth of his daughter Sunday morning. Warriors: C David West had a night off for rest. ""It's a routine we're going to follow all year,"" Kerr said of spelling West, Andre Iguodala and other veterans as needed. ... Warriors great Al Attles is expected back at Oracle on Wednesday night, one day after his 81st birthday. Attles was hospitalized and missed a night honoring him Oct. 27. ... Golden State has 10 or more 3s in all 11 games so far -- something the team did 14 consecutive times last season.","400974899"
"CLEVELAND --  Kevin Love joked that he might swing by the hospital on his way home. On a recent visit, he got a dose of something that made him and the Cavaliers feel better. Love scored a season-high 32 points without attempting a 3-pointer, LeBron James added 30 following an interesting couple days on social media, and Cleveland withstood a 40-point performance by Giannis Antetokounmpo to beat the Milwaukee Bucks 124-119 on Tuesday night. The Cavs have been one of the NBA's biggest surprises this season -- for all the wrong reasons. But after losing five of six, they did enough to hand the young-and-improving Bucks their fourth straight loss and keep Cleveland fans from panicking. Love was briefly hospitalized after scoring just four points and leaving a surprising loss to Atlanta in the third quarter on Sunday. Following his best game this season, Cleveland's center was asked what IV medications he received. ""I don't know,"" he said with a smile. ""Whatever they gave me I might go back and check myself in tonight."" Love added 16 rebounds. J.R. Smith found his stroke and added a season-high 20 points for the Cavs. ""That's my guy,"" James said of Smith, who went 5 of 7 on 3-pointers while wearing a model of James' sneakers. ""Swish is my guy and he's been struggling the first 10 games. I told him it was the shoes. He finally decided to wear my shoes. After a long conversation we finally decided to wear them and he had a breakout game. ""He hit the 3-ball, got into the paint. That was Swish. We're gonna need more of that from him a lot coming up."" Still a few weeks shy of his 23rd birthday, the multi-talented Antetokounmpo finished 16 of 21 from the floor. He also had nine rebounds and eight turnovers before fouling out with 18 seconds left. Malcolm Brogdon had 22 points for Milwaukee, and Khris Middleton finished with 20. Before the game, the Bucks got some scoring help by acquiring guard Eric Bledsoe from Phoenix in exchange for forward/center Greg Monroe and two draft picks. Afterward, coach Jason Kidd complained about the officiating. Milwaukee was called for 31 personals compared to 18 for Cleveland, and the Cavs attempted 38 free throws. Kidd pointed out that over the past three games, opponents have tried 95 free throws to 40 for Milwaukee. ""I just got fined,"" he said. ""That's one way. The other way is by expressing to the officials and I did that the whole night. The different crews that we've had have been awful."" Cleveland's start to the season has been puzzling on so many levels. Loaded with as much talent as any team in the league, the Eastern Conference champions have been beating good teams and losing to squads they should be handling. ""We don't want to,"" Love said. ""We'd rather come out and play -- because we're capable -- at a high level of basketball every single game. We have a ton of talent in here."" The myriad issues have led to the usual scrutiny of James, who caused a stir on social media Monday night. Moments after former teammate Kyrie Irving and the Boston Celtics beat the Hawks for their ninth straight win, James posted a meme on his Instagram account of the kids' cartoon character Arthur with a clenched fist with the caption ""mood."" Asked for the meaning, James shrugged. ""I like Arthur,"" he said. FIRST UNIT Plagued by slow starts through their first 10 games, the Cavs came out with better intensity and focus. Cleveland shot 69 percent from the floor (11 of 16) and made 14 of 15 free throws in the first quarter while opening an 11-point lead. It was a much better showing from the Cavs' starters, who were criticized by Dwyane Wade after Sunday's loss. TRADE TALK Bledsoe will take some of the pressure off Antetokounmpo, the league's leading scorer. ""He's a great player,"" he said. ""He's going help the team. He's going to make the game easier for everyone."" TIP-INS Bucks: Brogdon has picked up his scoring. He has three straight 20-point games for the first time in his career. ""He worked extremely hard this summer on his game,"" Kidd said. ""He knows what's coming. He knows what to expect."" ... C John Henson had two fouls in the first three minutes and was plagued by foul trouble all game. He also picked up a technical. Cavaliers: James played in his 1,072nd game, tying him for 82nd place on the career list with a certain Michael Jeffrey Jordan. ... Smith passed Rashard Lewis (1,787) for 14th place on the NBA's career 3-pointers made list. ... Love didn't attempt a 3-pointer for the first time since Jan. 23, 2015. ... G Iman Shumpert returned after missing a week with a sore right knee and scored six points in 19 minutes.","400974900"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The New Orleans Pelicans appeared to be in big trouble. Then Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins took over. Davis had 37 points and 14 rebounds, Cousins added 32 points and 13 boards and the Pelicans rallied to beat the Indiana Pacers 117-112 on Tuesday night. ""I think our talent is different than a lot of bigs -- there's so many ways we can dominate a game,"" Cousins said. ""And I think we're just scratching the surface right now. We can get so much better."" Davis was 14 for 18 from the field in New Orleans' third straight win. Cousins also had six assists. ""We've been doing this almost all season,"" Davis said. ""It's all the other guys (on this team) that make mine and DeMarcus' jobs easy."" Indiana had six players score in double figures in its third straight loss. Myles Turner had 21 points and 12 rebounds, Victor Oladipo scored 15 points, and Bojan Bogdanovic and Lance Stephenson each had 14. Indiana led 75-61 at halftime, but the Pelicans outscored the Pacers 35-19 in the third quarter. Indiana also blew a double-digit lead in a 108-101 loss to the New York Knicks on Sunday. ""Same thing that happened the last two games,"" Turner said. ""We come out flat in the third quarter. They took advantage of it."" Darren Collison's corner 3-pointer with 1:31 left got Indiana within one, but Davis responded with a jumper for New Orleans. Jrue Holiday made a couple free throws and Cousins added a layup to help the Pelicans hold on. TIP-INS Pelicans: Five of New Orleans' six wins have come on the road.

"WASHINGTON -- The Dallas Mavericks love coming to Washington. Harrison Barnes scored 31 points, rookie Dennis Smith Jr. had 22 and the Mavericks snapped a six-game losing streak with a 113-99 victory over John Wall and the Wizards on Tuesday night. Dallas has won nine straight in Washington dating to 2008 and 14 of the last 15 meetings overall. ""We've been getting kicked around and it's no fun and tonight our guys drew a line in the sand and really brought things to another level defensively,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. Wesley Matthews made four 3-pointers and finished with 14 points for Dallas, which improved to 2-10 with its first road win of the season. Salah Mejri had 10 points, 12 rebounds and five blocked shots. Wall had 23 points and 14 assists in his return from a sprained left shoulder, but the Wizards lost for the fifth time in seven games. Bradley Beal had 23 points, and Otto Porter Jr. finished with 13. Dallas scored a season-high 64 in the first half and led by 11 at the break. Barnes had 16 points in the opening half, and the Mavericks shot 52 percent from the field. ""We are not a team that can just outscore anybody,"" Wall said. ""You have to be able to guard in this league and we have not done that."" Dallas led by as many as 16 in the second half before Washington put together a 14-0 run to close to 90-88 with 8:56 remaining. The Mavericks responded with a 15-5 spurt and were never challenged again. The Mavericks outrebounded the Wizards 53-39 and held Washington to just 42.7 percent shooting from the field. Wall had just four points in the second half. Dallas came into the game averaging 97.9 points per game, 28th in the league, but scored a season-high 113. ""I don't know why that is,"" Dirk Nowitzki said when asked about the Mavericks' longtime success in Washington. ""At this point we'll take the win whenever and wherever we can get."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Dorian Smith-Finney was active after missing the last four games with left knee soreness. Smith-Finney had five points in 16 minutes. ... Nowitzki started at center for the fifth time this season and scored six points. Wizards: Wall shot 13 of 18 from the free-throw line after combining to go just 5 for 16 in his previous two games. ... Beal had his streak of scoring at least 35 points snapped at three games, one short of setting a Washington record. RIM PROTECTOR Mejri was 3 for 4 from the field and 4 for 6 at the line. He came off the bench after starting the last game for the Mavericks. ""He was an eraser at the rim,"" Carlisle said. ""He rebounded. He gave us a presence in there."" PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT For the first time since the season started, Dallas was able to get together and just practice. For Nowitzki, that made all the difference in the world. ""That 11 games in 18 day stretch was tough for us and we didn't really have a lot of practice time and we have a bunch of young guys so thought yesterday was a big day for us,"" he said.","400974902"
"NEW YORK --  No Knicks player has ever started a season like Kristaps Porzingis. He won't celebrate now, since he only cares about the finish. Porzingis scored 28 points, including a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 1:48 remaining, and New York beat the Charlotte Hornets 118-113 on Tuesday night for its third straight victory. The Eastern Conference player of the week was held below 30 for only the third time in 10 games this season, but he delivered when it mattered, scoring seven points in the final 2:32. That gave him 300 points through 10 games, two more than Bernard King had to open 1984-85. ""The sweetest thing for us, the best thing for us, would be to make the playoffs. This means nothing,"" Porzingis said. ""If we can keep winning and I'll keep doing what I have to do, then the real reward will come."" Doug McDermott added a season-high 20 points off the bench and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 19 for the Knicks, who have won six of seven after a 0-3 start. New York shot 60 percent from the field to catch up and eventually pass Charlotte. Asked what has keyed the Knicks' turnaround, McDermott said: ""Just unselfish play and having a guy like KP who is playing the best basketball in the NBA, borderline."" Kemba Walker, Dwight Howard and rookie Malik Monk each had 21 points in the Hornets' third straight loss. The Knicks, who erased a 19-point deficit against Indiana in their last game, were down 15 in this one before mounting a charge in the fourth quarter with Porzingis on the bench. They cut it to four with about 7 minutes left, but Howard converted a follow shot and Walker banked in a 3-pointer to push the lead back to 109-100 with 5:34 to play. New York answered with four 3-pointers in a 14-2 run, with Porzingis' clutch shot from straightaway making it 114-111. His drive to the basket with 11 seconds remaining made it 116-113, and Monk missed a 3-pointer before Walker lost the ball out of bounds on the sideline. ""Too many mistakes down the stretch,"" Walker said. ""We made some really bad mental mistakes at the end and they capitalized. This is stuff we've got to learn from. We've got to be better with our execution."" The Hornets were 7 of 9 from 3-point range in the first quarter and led 41-32. They increased the lead to 69-58 at halftime even with the Knicks hitting 61 percent of their shots in the first 24 minutes. TIP-INS Hornets: Howard was listed as probable before the game with a sprained right foot, though coach Steve Clifford didn't seem concerned that Howard would have to sit. ... Walker snapped out a shooting slump by going 8 for 16 from the field. He was 8 for 27 during the Hornets' losses to San Antonio and Minnesota. Knicks: The Knicks (6-4) are over .500 after 10 games for the first time since the 2012-13 season, when they won the Atlantic Division title. ... Enes Kanter scored 14 points. COMEBACK KIDS The Knicks have come from at least 15 points down in back-to-back games for the first time since Dec. 18 and 20, 2006, against Utah and Charlotte. DWIGHT DOCKED DOLLARS Howard was fined $25,000 earlier Tuesday by the NBA for making an obscene gesture toward a fan late in the first half of the Hornets' loss in Minnesota on Sunday. STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE The Hornets have not only had a tough schedule to open the season, but they had to play it short-handed. Nicolas Batum has missed all 11 games with a sprained left elbow, while Michael Kidd-Gilchrist has missed five. Charlotte has played Houston, Minnesota, San Antonio and Memphis, some of the strongest teams in the Western Conference. ""With the schedule that we've played, if you would have told me no Nic, really no MKG, missing Cody (Zeller) for a number of games, that we'd be 5-5 with this sked, I'd be fine with it,"" Clifford said before the game. ""We have a good team. This is by far the most talented team we've had since I've been there, and you can't play without two starters. Not at the wing position or anywhere else.""","400974903"
"TORONTO --  Bobby Portis gave the Chicago Bulls a boost in his first game back from suspension. Just not enough to top DeMar DeRozan and the Toronto Raptors. DeRozan scored 24 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and the Raptors beat Chicago 119-114 on Tuesday night for their first three-game winning streak over the Bulls since 2009. Portis had 21 points and 13 rebounds in his return after sitting out Chicago's first eight games. ""Bobby gave us a great lift out there,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""He played with great emotion. He went out there and gave us energy when we needed it."" The Bulls suspended Portis after he punched teammate Nikola Mirotic during a preseason practice. Mirotic, who suffered facial fractures and a concussion, is expected to miss four to six weeks. ""I got my dream taken away from me for three weeks,"" Portis said. ""I don't want my dream taken away from me anymore."" DeRozan called Portis ""a solid player"" after watching the third-year forward make 8 of 13 field goal attempts. ""He's got a great touch on his jump shot,"" DeRozan said. ""He came out and played well for them tonight."" Before the game, Portis said Mirotic did not reply to his phone and text messages following the incident, adding that the two have not yet spoken. Kyle Lowry scored 17 points and Serge Ibaka had 16 for the Raptors, who had lost 11 straight meetings with the Bulls before the current streak began with an overtime victory on March 21. Toronto beat Chicago 117-100 on Oct. 19, the opening game of the season for both teams. Robin Lopez scored 20 points and Justin Holiday had 15 as Chicago lost for the fourth time in five games. Toronto led by as many as 23 but Chicago cut the deficit to 115-112 following a hook shot by Portis with 41 seconds left. DeRozan answered with a turnaround jump shot with 20 seconds left, leading to a Bulls timeout. ""They kept playing and we let up a little bit,"" DeRozan said. TIP-INS Bulls: Hoiberg said Mirotic is responding well to having his activity level increased daily, but has yet to resume running. ... Chicago had held its three previous opponents below 100 points. ... The Bulls are 1-4 on the road. Raptors: Toronto recorded more than 20 assists for the seventh time in their first 10 games, finishing with 22. ... The five-point margin of victory was the smallest of the season for the Raptors, who had won by nine points or more in their five previous wins. ... Toronto matched a season-high with 13 made 3-pointers. All five starters made at least one. ... The Raptors assigned F Bruno Caboclo to its G-League team, Raptors 905. ANGER MANAGEMENT Hoiberg said he tore into his team at halftime after what he called an ""awful"" defensive performance in the first two quarters. Toronto ended the second with a 16-4 run. ""They got anything they wanted in the first half,"" Hoiberg said. ""We didn't take anything away from them. It was too easy."" REMEMBERING HALLADAY A moment of silence was held before the national anthems in honor of former Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay, who died in a plane crash Tuesday. ""It's sad,"" Casey said. ""He was huge here in Toronto over the years. I used to keep up with him all the time and watch him pitch.""","400974904"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs savored their finest shooting performance of the season. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 25 points, and San Antonio made a season-high 15 3-pointers to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 120-107 on Tuesday night. ""We had 33 assists, which is a great unselfish game, really good. A lot of people participated. Making shots does make things simpler,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""The ball moved, our pace was better, but our defense still needs to get better. That will take some time with all the new guys and the combinations that are out there right now."" San Antonio set several season-highs in capturing its third straight win. The Spurs had a season-best 12 steals and 33 assists, and Danny Green, Rudy Gay and Pau Gasol all set or matched their best scoring output of the season. Green scored 24 points, Gay had 22 and Gasol added 19. The trio combined to make 11 of 15 3-pointers. San Antonio finished 15-for-28 from beyond the arc. The Spurs were dominant in the third quarter for the second straight game. After routing Phoenix by 21 points in the third quarter Sunday, San Antonio outscored the Clippers by 19 (40-21). ""Because of the way the first half went, it was a winnable game for both teams,"" Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. ""But the difference was they came out and executed the same way in the second half on both ends and we didn't."" The Clippers shot 8 for 21 in the third quarter while committing six turnovers. The Spurs trailed 55-52 entering the second half, but opened the third on a 23-11 run and extended their lead to 17 points in the final minute of the quarter. ""We came out in the third quarter with a much better mindset defensively,"" Gasol said. ""That's always going to be a factor and kind of key. See if we can extend for longer periods of time so we don't give up 55 points in the first half like we have the last two games."" The Spurs made six 3s in the quarter, with Gay and Green both making two. Green and Aldridge each had eight points in the third. Aldridge, Gasol and Green all made a 3-pointer in the first five minutes as the team shot 6-for-9 on 3s to open the game. Green finished 8 for 15, including 4 for 6 on 3-pointers. ""When he's doing that, teams are kind of hesitant to double team,"" Aldridge said. The Clippers shot 51 percent from the field in the first half, but committed 18 turnovers. Austin Rivers led Los Angeles with 24 points. Blake Griffin added 15 points on 4-for-13 shooting. The Clippers played without starting small forward Danilo Gallinari for the first time this season, while the Spurs continued without Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker. TIP-INS Clippers: Gallinari did not play after battling a strained left glute for about a week. Following Sunday's home loss to Miami, Gallinari told reporters he could barely walk on it. It was the first game the nine-year veteran has missed this season. ... Wesley Johnson made his first start of the season. ... The Clippers had been undefeated on the road. They are 2-4 at home. ... Los Angeles is 1-4 since winning its first four games. Spurs: Reserve forward Joffrey Lauvergne missed his eighth straight game with sprained right ankle. ... Aldridge blocked a shot for the 18th straight game, the league's longest active streak. ... Spurs rookie Derrick White will have to wear a cast for four to five weeks after fracturing his right wrist on Saturday while playing for San Antonio's G League affiliate in Austin. ... San Antonio's previous high for 3-pointers was 12 against Boston on Oct. 30. NOT HAPPY Shouting could be heard from the Clippers' locker room as they held a players-only meeting that lasted almost half an hour after the game ended. The players did not comment on the meeting, but mentioned the team's defense needs to improve. ""We have no excuse to be honest,"" Austin Rivers said. ""We have the best defensive five in the NBA. We have the best defensive point guard in the NBA. I consider myself an elite, top five shooting-defensive guard in the league. We have too many good defenders. We should be a top five defensive team without a doubt."" SLOW PROGRESS Popovich said before the game that Leonard's rehabilitation from a quadriceps injury has been slower than Parker's. Parker, who's coming off left quadriceps surgery, has worked out with San Antonio's G League affiliate and has been shooting before home games. He's expected to return in mid-to-late November. Leonard, meanwhile, has made slower progress in rehabilitating right quadriceps tendinopathy. ""(Leonard) is just coming along more slowly, for whatever reason,"" Popovich said. ""It's just been more difficult for him to get through the rehab routine. His body hasn't reacted the same way. Tony is at the point where he has been going five-on-five and that sort of thing. ... It will be a few more weeks, but he's definitely going in the right direction, and so is Kawhi. It's just been taking a little bit longer."" Popovich said Leonard will go through the same workouts before he returns. ""Sure, I wouldn't want him to go right from rehab to jumping on the court,"" Popovich said. ""He's got to go three-on-three, five-on-five, feel comfortable. ... You're really not until you're mentally ready to go.""","400974905"
"Nikola Jokic steals the ball from Spencer Dinwiddie and heads down court for the layup. (0:25) DENVER --  Even though Nikola Jokic loves to pass, his teammates wanted to see him get selfish. After some prodding, the young center obliged, then delivered a career night. Jokic had a career-high 41 points, Will Barton and Paul Millsap scored 17 apiece and the Denver Nuggets beat the Brooklyn Nets 112-104 on Tuesday night. Jokic also had 12 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. He is the ninth player in NBA history to have those totals to go with 41 points and at least four 3-pointers. He left the game early in the fourth still shy of his career high of 40 points set Feb. 10 against New York but returned late in the fourth. He scored two quick buckets and then fouled out, but only after his teammates gently encouraged him to shoot. ""If you pass the ball, the ball will find you at some point,"" Jokic said. ""You don't need to be selfish. When you have the open shot, just take it."" The Nets starters couldn't match Jokic's output. The five combined for 40 points and watched from the bench as Jokic outscored them with his four points late in the game. ""He went out there and put on a show,"" Barton said. ""When a guy's rolling like that, you want to see him keep it going and get as many points as possible."" Tyler Zeller came off the bench to lead Brooklyn with a season-high 21 points. Only three Nets were in double figures. D'Angelo Russell had 12 points a night after scoring 23, and Timofey Mozgov scored 11. ""I don't think we had the requisite juice. The execution wasn't good,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It was like we were walking in mud in everything we did."" Jokic scored in bunches, and each time he helped Denver extend leads. He had 11 points in the second when the Nuggets led by 13, and he scored 14 more in the third to help push the lead to 86-61. Brooklyn went on a 13-4 run in the final 2:59 to make it a closer game. GIVEAWAY DAY The Nets committed a season-high 25 turnovers, which led to 27 points for Denver. They had just 16 turnovers in the win over Phoenix on Monday night. ""Turnovers were such a big issue tonight and then we came out a little lackadaisical and no energy,"" DeMarre Carroll said. ""I thought our defense was pretty good but we kept turning it over and they got easy offense."" Nuggets guard Gary Harris was the most disruptive. He had a career-high six steals against Brooklyn. ""That's what Gary does,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He is a guy that can be physical and get to you and blow up the offense, and he did that tonight."" TIP-INS Nets: F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was out with a right hip contusion suffered in Monday's win at Phoenix, and F Trevor Booker missed his third straight game with a sore lower back. Atkinson said Hollis-Jefferson will be evaluated Wednesday. Nuggets: Barton tied a season high with eight rebounds. ... The Nuggets have used the same starting lineup for all 11 games this season. ... Denver has won three straight against Brooklyn. ... The Nuggets have two games left on their season-long six-game homestand.","400974906"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Now that the Philadelphia 76ers have their first five-game winning streak in more than five seasons, they hardly sound satisfied. Dario Saric scored a season-high 25 points and the 76ers won their fifth straight game with a 104-97 victory over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night. The winning streak is the Sixers' longest since the 2011-12 season. ""Because it's a win and it's on the road, makes it more special,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""But really, there are parts you want to tighten up at the end. ... To the guys' credit, it's a gutsy win. ""I leave here not elated at all. We foul too much, we turn over the ball too much, but we played. We were tough and we found a way to grind it out."" Philadelphia used a 21-7 run to start the third quarter, highlighted by eight straight points from J.J. Redick, to take a 67-51 lead it never relinquished. The Sixers seemed to have more energy on both ends of the floor despite being on the road without starting center Joel Embiid. Ben Simmons initiated the offense while Saric and Redick knocked down shots. Saric grabbed 10 rebounds, Redick scored 20 points and Simmons finished with 16 points, 13 rebounds and six assists as the former No. 1 draft pick had his seventh double-double of the season. Robert Covington added 14 points and 12 rebounds. Not only did the Sixers earn a tough road win, they found an answer each time the Jazz tried to squeeze back in the game. It was Philadelphia's first victory in Utah since 2005. ""It shows a lot about our team,"" Simmons said. ""We're playing a lot more calm than before. Trying to make less errors and turnovers down the stretch and taking care of the ball. And getting stops. It just comes down to that."" The Jazz, who have lost three straight, didn't do anything particularly well outside of a second-quarter rally after falling behind by 16 in the first 12 minutes. The defense allowed wide-open shots by the 76ers and was uncharacteristically sloppy throughout, giving up backdoor cuts and slashes to the basket for easy points. On the other end, the Jazz couldn't connect on their own good looks. Rodney Hood led Utah with 19 points on 4-for-16 shooting, and Rudy Gobert posted his seventh double-double of the season with 16 points and 15 rebounds. ""Obviously, we had an abysmal night shooting the ball,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""Overall, there were some periods where we got stops and that really helps our offense, but the breakdowns that occurred, particularly in the beginning of the game when you are trying to come back and trying to make plays, you are susceptible to those types of back cuts and those are breakdowns."" TIP-INS 76ers: Richaun Holmes started in place of Embiid. ... Jerryd Bayless was out due to a bruised left wrist. Jazz: Donovan Mitchell started the second half over Hood. ... Utah shot 30.3 percent from the floor and 23.1 percent from 3-point range. TRUST THE PROCESS Embiid did not travel with the 76ers and was given a scheduled rest as the team closely watches his return from injury. Brown said the ""sports science people"" have a sophisticated plan put together. Embiid will join the team before it plays the Sacramento Kings on Thursday. REDSHIRT FRESHMAN Top draft pick Markelle Fultz is traveling with the 76ers despite being out with a shoulder injury. Brown said there's plenty to learn by being around the team. ""None of us can dismiss the benefit that Ben Simmons had of effectively being a redshirt and taking it all in, not necessarily in real time,"" Brown said. ""The NBA is so unforgiving. ... All this time off I'm not looking at as negative. I've learned with all the players -- Nerlens (Noel), Jahlil (Okafor), Joel and Ben and now Markelle -- you can make it work. It's Jon Gruden's quarterback camp. ... Bring them in and talk video stuff and what do you see? Still make him feel a part of us and educate him. Although it's not in a uniform, it still counts for something."" QUOTABLE ""The world's not ending,"" Hood said about the three-game losing streak. ""We've just got to figure it out and go from there.""","400974907"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Mike Conley was as relieved as the rest of the Memphis Grizzlies when CJ McCollum missed a pull-up jumper with 3.7 seconds left. ""He had a great look,"" Conley said. ""So we're thankful to get away with a win."" Tyreke Evans scored 21 points off the bench, Conley had 20 -- all in the second half -- and Memphis held off the Portland Trail Blazers 98-97 on Tuesday night. Marc Gasol added 16 points as the Grizzlies improved to 2-1 on their five-game road trip. Memphis wrestled with the Blazers for the lead in the final quarter after neither team was able to put together a double-digit advantage through the first three. Dillon Brooks stripped Portland's Ed Davis and got a layup with a free throw that gave the Grizzlies a 96-91 lead with 39 seconds left. But the Blazers weren't out of it. McCollum hit a 3-pointer with 13.4 seconds remaining to pull Portland within one. After a video review, officials reversed an out-of-bounds call with 12.1 seconds left, giving the ball to the Blazers. McCollum missed a jumper from about 17 feet out and got his own rebound but couldn't get another shot off in time. He finished with a season-high 36 points. ""I got a good look on a shot I make very often. I've got to finish it, but I didn't,"" McCollum said. Damian Lillard, who had 12 points for Portland, said it shouldn't have come down to that shot. ""He got a good look, it didn't fall. It's a lot of things that impact the outcome of a game,"" Lillard said. ""The last play is always what people talk about, but it's a lot that puts you in that position."" Brooks, starting for the Grizzlies as a rookie, went to college at Oregon and was treated to hearty applause during pregame introductions. Ducks coach Dana Altman had courtside seats for the game. Brooks was a second-round pick by Houston and was sent to Memphis in a draft-night trade. He was last season's Pac-12 player of the year and helped take the Ducks to the team's first Final Four appearance since 1939. He averaged 16.1 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game during his final season. With Ben McLemore (foot) and Wayne Seldon (quadriceps) out injured, Brooks made his third start of the season and finished with seven points and eight rebounds. ""He looks like he's been playing in the league for a while,"" Conley said. ""Each game he gets more respect."" Brooks, who guarded McCollum for much of the night, was also relieved after that final shot. ""He likes going left and he got me on a little push off,"" Brooks said. ""I contested it pretty good I was just hoping that he missed."" The Grizzlies jumped out to a 21-14 lead, but Portland closed the gap early in the second quarter and Evan Turner's pull-up jumper tied it at 29. Lillard missed his first seven shots from the field, finally ending the drought on a layup with 3:12 left in the first half. McCollum nearly lost the ball on a drive to the basket but regained control to make a falling-down jumper at the buzzer and give the Blazers a 50-47 lead at halftime. McCollum led all scorers with 15 points at the break, then opened the second half with a 3. But the Grizzlies went on a 10-0 run to take a 61-57 lead. Portland tied it 71-all at the end of the third quarter, but Conley hit a 3 for Memphis as time ran out in the period. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Conley was 0 for 5 from the field in the first half. ... McLemore was assigned to the G-League Memphis Hustle in preparation for his return. ... Evans has scored 20-plus points in four straight games. Trail Blazers: McCollum's career high for points is 43 set last season. He made four 3-pointers Tuesday and the final one was the 500th of his career. ONE THAT GOT AWAY Lillard thought the Blazers let this one get away. ""They played a slow game, limited the possessions of the game and we had our opportunities,"" he said. ""We had some turnovers and some possessions on defense where we allowed them to take advantage of us. They just made more plays than we did in that fourth quarter. We had some fouls. Let that one slip. We had our chances.""","400974908"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Zach Randolph chuckled at the thought that he is too old to still log major minutes in the NBA. The veteran big man has a different perspective on his game. ""I'm in my prime,"" Randolph said with a wide grin. Looked pretty good Tuesday night. Randolph scored each of his 18 of his points in the second half, Buddy Hield had 21 points and the Sacramento Kings rallied for a 94-86 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. ""Just kept battling,"" Randolph said. ""We have to stick with it. It's a long season. Anything can happen. We have a good team. We can compete with anybody. It's a confidence thing and a believing thing."" Sacramento stopped a seven-game losing streak with its first win since Oct. 20. The Kings (2-8) were limited to 10 points in the first quarter and trailed by as many as 17, but they stormed back to take the lead going into halftime and never trailed in the second half. The 36-year-old Randolph was 8 for 15 from the field and also contributed eight rebounds. The Kings signed him in the offseason primarily to fill a mentor role on a team filled with young players. ""He's like a pillar for us,"" teammate Justin Jackson said. ""Just having him on the court, everybody has to pay attention to him. Whenever they start doing that, that frees us up a little bit more."" Russell Westbrook had 20 points, 12 rebounds and six assists for Oklahoma City, which has dropped three in a row. The Thunder shot 33.7 percent (29 for 86) from the field, committed three shot clock violations in the third quarter alone and finished with 17 turnovers. Carmelo Anthony added 16 points and seven rebounds in his first game since he was ejected in Oklahoma City's 103-99 loss at Portland on Sunday. ""At times we had some possessions that were not great but I also thought we had a lot of really good looks at times that didn't go down,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""We just didn't make enough shots or play well enough on offense."" This one will sting the Thunder for a while. Oklahoma City led 25-8 late in the first quarter and appeared headed for a lopsided win before Sacramento quickly erased the deficit and went in front for good. ""It starts with me"" Westbrook said. ""Part of my job is to do that and make sure my guys are ready to play. I take ownership in that. It's part of my job to get us back on a roll."" Randolph was held scoreless in the first half but scored 12 in the third and six in the fourth, including a layup that made it 89-83 with 1:18 remaining. Westbrook's 3-pointer trimmed the gap to 89-86 but Sacramento made three free throws and Jackson added an emphatic dunk with one second left. Jackson had 16 points for the Kings, and De'Aaron Fox finished with 10 points and eight assists. Steven Adams scored 14 points for Oklahoma City, and Paul George had 12. WHAT A RELIEF With the starting five struggling, Sacramento's reserves scored the team's first 29 points -- an NBA record, according to Elias Sports Bureau. The previous record was 23 set by Milwaukee against Orlando on April 5, 2011. ""We beat a good team with good players, good coaching and a great front office and everybody had a part in it,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""I'd love to give a bunch of `Atta boys' out but that was a total team effort."" TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook assisted on Oklahoma City's first four baskets, including three to Adams, but didn't get another until early in the fourth quarter. The six-time All-Star also was called for a Flagrant 1 penalty in the third quarter after hitting Bogdan Bogdanovic in the face with his left hand while attempting a shot. ... Anthony was called for a technical foul in the fourth. Kings: Sacramento missed its first 11 shots.","400974909"
"DETROIT --  Stan Van Gundy is one of the NBA's most outspoken coaches when it comes to politics and social issues, so his reaction to a postgame meeting with the Rev. Jesse Jackson was no surprise. ""I was a little bit in awe, right there,"" Van Gundy said. ""To think of what he's done with his life and the sacrifices he's made and the way he has served our country, and then I'm standing there. I'm a basketball coach."" Van Gundy might think of himself as just a basketball coach, but his team is playing well right now. With Jackson in attendance Wednesday night, the Detroit Pistons won for the sixth time in seven games, beating the Indiana Pacers 114-97 . Tobias Harris scored 23 points and Andre Drummond added 14 points and 21 rebounds for the first-place Pistons, who lead Cleveland by three games in the Central Division. Indiana lost its fourth straight. Jackson was seated behind one of the baskets at Little Caesars Arena, and Van Gundy said he spoke with him after the game. The Detroit coach joked that leaving Jackson and coming to the media room to talk to reporters was ""the definition of a letdown."" Victor Oladipo led the Pacers with 21 points, but Indiana has allowed at least 100 points in 10 of 12 games this season. The Pacers were without injured big man Domantas Sabonis. ""This is part of the process,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""We knew there was going to be some adversity during the season and here it goes. Things turn quickly and you have to play your way out of it."" Detroit led 59-52 at halftime, and after the Pacers fought back to tie the game at 65, the Pistons went on a 13-0 run to take control. Harris made a 3-pointer to put Detroit ahead by 11, and Drummond capped that streak with a putback that he made despite being hit in the face by Indiana's Thaddeus Young. Drummond was momentarily shaken up but played on. It was 82-75 after three quarters, then the Pistons scored eight straight points to start the fourth, including 3-pointers by Reggie Bullock and Anthony Tolliver. COMEBACK The Pistons trailed 33-22 early in the second quarter, making this their fourth comeback victory of the season from a double-digit deficit. Drummond and Avery Bradley both picked up two fouls in the first 5:31, which contributed to Detroit's slow start. The Pistons outscored Indiana 37-22 in the second and turned their deficit into a halftime lead. ""The way the game is now anyway, 11 down, 13 down, especially in the first half, I don't think of it as, like, we made a comeback tonight,"" Van Gundy said. ""We were ahead at halftime. It was early on in the game."" LOOKING BACK This is the first time the Pistons have started 8-3 since the 2008-09 season. They stumbled in the latter half of that season and finished 39-43, but made the playoffs. TOUGH NIGHT Giving up a lot of points has been the norm for Indiana this season, but this was only the fourth time the Pacers were held under 100. Indiana shot 43 percent from the field and was 7 of 24 from 3-point range. Detroit outscored the Pacers 56-36 in the paint. ""They were really good,"" Oladipo said. ""They do a great job forcing you into tough 2s. They did a great job protecting their paint, made it hard on us to score."" TIP-INS Pacers: Sabonis sat out a second straight game with a bruised right calf. ... Al Jefferson scored 19 points and Young added 16. Pistons: F Stanley Johnson (right hip flexor strain) did not play. ... Drummond, whose free throw shooting had improved dramatically early this season, went 0 for 7 from the line.","400974910"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  If there was any question how important point guard Elfrid Payton is to running the Orlando Magic's offense smoothly that has been put to rest. After missing the previous eight games because of a left hamstring injury, Payton returned to the floor against the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. The Magic found their rhythm and winning touch with Payton back in the lineup in a 112-99 victory over the short-handed Knicks. Payton had 11 points and 11 assists in 29 minutes. ""A sight for sore eyes,"" said Magic coach Frank Vogel, whose team ended a two-game losing streak Wednesday night. ""That's what it was for me seeing Elfrid Payton back out there."" Suddenly, the spacing was there, the ball was moving and the Magic players were getting the ball just where they wanted it. And it took Aaron Gordon exactly 32 seconds into the game for Payton to find him flying toward the basketball for one of their signature alley-oop connections. Payton was indeed back and so was the Magic's offensive explosiveness. ""It was really cool just to have Frank be so aware that I hadn't gotten a lob in a while,"" Gordon said. ""EP was back, he knew that play was going to be open, and we hadn't run it while."" The Magic (7-4) had played without Payton for nearly 2 1/2 weeks and have been without backup D.J. Augustin (hamstring) the last three games. That left Orlando with one healthy point guard, third-stringer Shelvin Mack who wasn't use to playing with the starting unit. But the Magic looked more like the team that started fast Wednesday night. They shot 54 percent from the floor and 46 percent from 3-point range with Payton running the show most of the night despite his hamstring still feeling tight. Nikola Vucevic led five Magic players in double figures with 24 points while Evan Fournier added 23 and Gordon finished with 21 points. Payton was only too glad to be back out there creating for his teammates. ""It feels good,"" he said. ""That's what I'm here for to make everybody's job as easy as possible."" The Knicks, meanwhile, were out of sorts with Kristaps Porzingis out of the lineup with ankle and elbow injuries sidelining him for the night. With the NBA's second-leading scorer not on the floor, the Knicks only found consistent scoring from Tim Hardaway Jr., who led all scorers with 26. Otherwise, they were marred in inconsistency as their three-game winning streak came to an end. New York (6-5) committed 23 turnovers with Orlando jumping the passing lanes for 16 steals. ""That was a big difference in the game,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said about the turnovers. ""(The Magic) had a little more energy."" But the Knicks, playing a back-to-back, managed to keep the game relatively close until early in the fourth quarter. That's when Jonathon Simmons came off the bench for Magic and scored 11 straight points during a stretch to help Orlando re-establish a double-digit lead. Simmons, who had played backup point in Payton's absence, scored 15 of his 16 points in the second half in his more natural wing role. ""When we're at our best, it's with the starting unit doing what they are doing and Simmons coming in and running the show with the second unit,"" Vogel said. ""So EP has a ripple effect, putting Simmons back in his natural environment."" TIP-INS Knicks: Forward Michael Beasley started in place of injured Porzingis. Beasley scored four points. ... Point guard Jarrett Jack converted 3 of 4 field goals in the first half and had four assists but he also had four turnovers. He finished with six turnovers on the night. Magic: Fournier had five steals in the first half and was a major reason the Magic outscored the Knicks on fast break points 14-0 during the first two quarters. For the game, the Magic outscored the Knicks 21-4 on fast breaks.","400974911"
"Lakers' turnover leads to Kyrie Irving with the ball to show off the nifty handle, dribbling through the entire defense and almost losing control before sinking the layup. (0:34) BOSTON --  The Celtics are piling up injuries almost as quickly as they are victories this season. Aron Baynes matched his career high with 21 points, Kyrie Irving scored 19 and Boston overcame injuries to Al Horford and Jayson Tatum to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 107-96 on Wednesday night for their 10th straight win. Baynes also had eight rebounds and three assists, and Boston improved to 10-2 even as Horford sat out after being placed in concussion protocol earlier in the day. The Celtics then lost rookie forward Tatum late in the second quarter, when he went to the locker room with a sore right ankle. Coach Brad Stevens said Tatum had X-rays and was fitted with a walking boot as a precaution. He will be re-examined on Thursday. It's yet another blow for a team that lost Gordon Hayward for the season after a gruesome leg injury on opening night. ""Until we have only four left, I guess we're just gonna keep playing,"" Stevens said. Boston led by 20 in the second quarter before letting the lead shrink to two in the third. Los Angeles then struggled down the stretch, shooting 5 of 18 from the field with six turnovers in the final period. Brandon Ingram and Jordan Clarkson led the Lakers with 18 points apiece. Julius Randle had 16 points and 12 rebounds. Celtics fans gave rookie Lonzo Ball an icy welcome in his first trip to TD Garden. They booed the No. 2 overall pick throughout the night whenever he touched the ball. He finished with nine points, six assists and five rebounds, making just 4 of 15 from the field. With Tatum sidelined in the second half, Boston struggled defensively, and the Lakers exploited the paint for several easy baskets. ""They hit us in the mouth and we were kind of shocked,"" Kyle Kuzma said. ""The second quarter and the second half we fought back."" Irving also got banged up and had his right leg examined by trainers between the third and fourth quarters. He came back with just over six minutes to play and immediately made an impact, scoring back-to-back baskets to push Boston's lead back to 100-90. The Celtics led by 48-28 in the second quarter but were outscored 24-13 over the final 6:51 of the half to let the Lakers back into the game. TIP-INS Lakers: Only lead of the game was 2-0. ... Had 12 turnovers in the first half. Celtics: Shot just 8 of 24 in the fourth quarter. ... The 61 points scored by the first half was a season high. ... Took a season-high 98 field-goal attempts. LAY OFF BALL Celtics forward Marcus Morris thinks fans should ease up on Ball. ""He's a good kid -- it's his dad,"" Morris said. ""He's got a big mouth, everybody knows it. ... He has a long time to do this. He's a young guy. It kind of sucks that he's gotta go everywhere and they just boo him and boo him and boo him. He's just a regular player."" Ball said he didn't take offense to it. ""They're home. I'd boo too if I was a fan,"" he said. RIVALRY REKINDLED? Lakers coach Luke Walton said this generation of players views the Celtics-Lakers rivalry differently than those around for the 1980s matchups. ""I think some of them get it, more than others,"" he said. ""Guys like Lonzo that grew up in LA, I think if you grew up in either one of these cities, you're probably pretty well schooled on the rivalry. For some of these young guys, they probably don't know much about it."" Celtics fans chanted ""Beat LA!"" after Walton was whistled for a technical foul in the third quarter.

"PHOENIX --  Goran Dragic felt right at home at Talking Stick Resort Arena, and it showed. The former Phoenix Suns guard scored a season-high 29 points in the Miami Heat's 126-115 victory over the Suns on Wednesday night. The Heat made 12 3-pointers, shot a season-best 53.1 percent overall and never trailed. The Suns lost their fourth straight. ""The rims are friendly,"" said Dragic, who had two stints with Phoenix before being traded to Miami in 2015. ""I've played a lot of games here and yeah, it definitely helps."" Dragic scored 10 points in the third quarter. The Heat took a 94-86 lead into the fourth and opened the final period with a 7-0 run. ""Greatness in this league is consistency, and Goran, you can book it every single night what you're going to get from him,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He had a little bit extra punch to him in this game."" Phoenix made it 112-106 on Devin Booker's jumper with 2:53 to play but got no closer. Hassan Whiteside added 23 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high four blocked shots for Miami. Booker led Phoenix with 30 points, and Mike James had 18. ""Everyone in the NBA is a good player and you have to realize that and fight back,"" Booker said. ""We keep getting within 10 and can't get over that hump."" Guard Dion Waiters, playing in his first game since last Friday, made a layup to give the Heat a 47-31 lead with 9:18 to go in the second quarter for Miami's largest lead of the first half. Waiters was away from the Heat for the birth of his daughter and returned to score 16 points. The Suns went on an 11-1 run to cut the lead to six, but Waiters' 3-pointer with 10.8 seconds left gave the Heat a 69-54 halftime advantage. The 69 points was the highest total in a half for the Heat this season. The Heat led by 14 points in the first quarter. Phoenix hit five of its last seven shots of the quarter, and cut the lead to 36-27. STAREDOWN Whiteside blocked James' driving dunk attempt with 4:56 to go in the first half, then stared down at the fallen James. Whiteside was a tough matchup inside for Phoenix without big man Tyson Chandler (back spasms) in the lineup. Whiteside said he looked longer at James because he thought James was shaken up. ""He put some force behind that dunk. I didn't know he could dunk like that,"" Whiteside said. ""I challenge anybody at the rim. He tried, he definitely had some heart for trying. Not too many guys would try that."" TIP-INS Heat: Justise Winslow started at power forward for the first time this season and had a season-high 14 points and six rebounds. ... Miami's 17.1 turnovers per game were the third-worst in the NBA entering the game, so Spoelstra said he'd like to simplify things on offense. ""Hopefully that can help, but the responsibility and the accepting of that responsibility is the most important thing,"" Spoelstra said. The Heat had 14 on Wednesday. ... G Tyler Johnson did not play due to illness. Suns: Alex Len made his first start of the season at center, in place of Chandler. ... Newly acquired C Greg Monroe has yet to report to the team. Monroe, who came over in Tuesday's trade that sent Eric Bledsoe to Milwaukee, is dealing with a calf strain. ...

"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Steve Kerr will never wish for a star player to sit injured as Kevin Durant did against Minnesota on Wednesday night. The Golden State coach sure saw a lot of encouraging signs from many in his supporting cast to pick up the slack with the NBA Finals MVP nursing a bruised left thigh. The good ol' standbys did their share of dazzling, too. Klay Thompson scored 28 points with six 3-pointers, Stephen Curry had 22 points, eight assists and eight rebounds, and the Warriors beat the Timberwolves 125-101 for their fifth straight win. Even without injured KD, the defending champs began to look like their dominant selves behind another strong defensive performance. ""Five guys helping and communicating, talking, it was a thing of beauty tonight,"" Curry said of the defense. Draymond Green posted another balanced effort with seven points, six rebounds, six assists and two blocks for the Warriors, who played without NBA Finals MVP Durant as he nursed a bruised left thigh. Andre Iguodala started in place of Durant, and the 2015 Finals MVP scored a season-high 11 points. The Warriors notched a season-best quarter with 44 points in the third to pull away after leading 51-50 at halftime. ""I actually kind of like these games when we have to sit somebody,"" Kerr said. ""We have so much talent, we can afford to miss one of our main guys. It's good for the team, it's good for morale, it's good for individual development, and it forces the group to play together when you're missing one of your main guys."" Andrew Wiggins scored 17 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 16 points and 12 rebounds as the Timberwolves had their five-game winning streak snapped. This marked the first regular-season matchup between the teams after they played a pair of exhibition games in China last month. It's the first time the teams faced off each atop their respective divisions. Only three times previously had they played both with records of .500 or above. ""We got humbled tonight,"" Minnesota's Taj Gibson said. ""That's the kind of level we want to get to, the way they're playing over there."" Thompson shot 11 for 20 overall and 6 of 12 from long range. Omri Casspi added 13 points, three blocks and two steals. Golden State had to overcome another cold start on offense, shooting 8 for 22 in the first quarter -- 4 of 10 on 3s. Two days earlier in a win against Miami, the Warriors shot 36.8 percent and 11 of 32 from beyond the arc. CAUTION WITH DURANT Durant categorized his injury as ""nothing too serious."" He said he hurt the quadriceps muscle the first play of the game against the Heat on Monday. ""If this were a playoff game, he'd be playing, but it's not, so it makes perfect sense to give him tonight off,"" Kerr said. ""We have a couple more nights before our next game. He should be fine I would think by then."" KD hopes to play Saturday against the 76ers. ""Probably, we'll see,"" he said. ATTLES RETURNS Warriors great Al Attles returned to Oracle Arena one day after his 81st birthday and the entire arena sang ""Happy Birthday"" during the second quarter as Attles waved and smiled. A former player, coach and general manager of the team -- he was part of Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game -- he had missed a night honoring him Oct. 27. FUNNY MOMENT When Kerr announced pregame that Iguodala would replace Durant, he stopped and instructed everyone they could tweet out the news before he resumed the media session. ""Is everybody ready to tweet?"" he said. Then, he began clipping his fingernails and said the media could let him know when ready to proceed. ""Hang on, I've got a troublesome cuticle,"" he quipped.

"John Wall comes out of nowhere to block Brandon Ingram late in the second quarter. (0:18) WASHINGTON --  Los Angeles Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball's cold-shooting start to his NBA career just keeps getting worse. For a change, the Washington Wizards managed to play the sort of defense that contributes to limiting an opponent's scoring. John Wall and the Wizards managed to make a double-digit edge hold up against the Lakers this time, with the All-Star point guard scoring 23 points and Bradley Beal adding 22 while Washington held Ball to 3 for 12 on field-goal tries in a 111-95 victory over L.A. on Thursday night. ""They had an off-shooting night,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said, ""but we participated in that."" Ball, who had 10 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, finished the night shooting 29.2 percent so far in the pros. That's the second-worst through a player's first 12 games in the shot-clock era, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Asked about people constantly analyzing his unusual shooting motion -- it looks something like a right-handed shot put released from the left side of his head -- the No. 2 overall draft pick said: ""I really don't even care, to be honest. I know I've got to just keep shooting and just improve it every game."" Lakers coach Luke Walton's take? ""He's an incredible player. He's 20 years old. He almost had a triple-double tonight. But any time you turn on any sports show, all they talk about is his shot,"" Walton said. ""Is it extra pressure? One hundred percent. He's a rook who ... gets dissected by everybody."" Washington's Otto Porter Jr. finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds, while Markieff Morris scored 16 points, including a pair of 3s to open the third quarter. Coming off a home loss in which they never held a lead against the NBA-worst Dallas Mavericks, the Wizards went up by as many as 21 against the Lakers, at 91-70 on Porter's turnaround fadeaway jumper with about 75 seconds remaining in the third quarter. When these teams played each other in Los Angeles last month in the fourth game of the season for each, the Wizards led by 10 points entering the fourth quarter before the Lakers wound up winning 102-99 in overtime. This time, L.A. pulled to 93-84 on Julius Randle's two-handed slam with about 8 minutes left. But a 3 by Beal soon built the hosts' advantage back to 15. Defense has seemed to optional at times for the Wizards this season. But they held the Lakers to 36 percent Thursday. ""That's been one of our downfalls -- ball-watching too much and trying to steal it in the backcourt and leaving our transition at risk of getting scored on,"" Beal said. ""It was definitely a demand of Coach's: Get back in transition. Make sure we're defending our guy. Take pride in it."" TIP-INS Lakers: Seven players scored at least 10 points apiece, including Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle and Brook Lopez. ... Came in averaging an NBA-high 56 points in the paint and 16 of their first 20 points came that way Thursday. L.A. finished with 48. Wizards: Centers Marcin Gortat and Ian Mahinmi combined for 10 points and 11 personal fouls in 44 minutes. REMATCH There was plenty of Wall vs. Ball hype leading into that one -- initially fueled, not surprisingly, by Ball's father, LaVar -- although their matchup never become the game's focus. WALL DOES ALL Wall's night included a resounding lefty dunk over Lopez that Wall said showed his recently sprained left shoulder -- which had strips of black tape on it -- is doing OK. ""That was my testimony to say it's cool,"" Wall said. At the defensive end, he had a couple of his trademark chase-down blocks, including one on Ingram that drew a roar from the sellout crowd of 20,356. ""He might be the best ever at doing that,"" Brooks said. BIG MO Morris was playing in only his fourth game of the season because of offseason surgery and a suspension and left after 3 1/2 minutes because his knee tightened up. But after riding a stationary bike, he returned, finishing 6 for 7 on field-goal attempts. ""It's good to see him back to somewhat of his old self,"" Brooks said. ""It's only going to get better from here.""","400974915"
"TORONTO --  As he drove to the basket late in the fourth quarter, DeMar DeRozan lost his footing and fell onto his backside. While going down, the All-Star guard managed to toss the ball to the 3-point line, where teammate Kyle Lowry stepped up and drained a go-ahead jumper. It was a huge play for the Toronto Raptors, and indicative of the kind of night it was for the New Orleans Pelicans. DeRozan scored 33 points, Serge Ibaka had 19 and the Raptors beat New Orleans 122-118 on Thursday for their fifth straight win over the Pelicans. ""We didn't come up with any of the 50-50 balls,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""I thought the biggest play of the game was DeRozan's drive to the basket. He falls in the lane and in some kind of way gets it to Kyle for a 3-point shot. That's a possession that we should have had, at worst, a jump ball."" Lowry scored six of his 18 points in the fourth quarter and Jonas Valanciunas grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds as the Raptors won for the 13th time in 16 meetings with New Orleans. Jrue Holiday had a season-high 34 points and 11 assists, and DeMarcus Cousins added 20 points and 15 rebounds for the Pelicans in the finale of a four-game road trip. New Orleans had won a season-best three straight. Anthony Davis scored 18 points, E'Twaun Moore had 13 and Dante Cunningham 11 for the Pelicans. Cousins and Davis each had 30-plus points and 10-plus rebounds in Tuesday's win at Indiana. DeRozan said it was important to keep the two big men in check. ""Those two guys are definitely a handful,"" DeRozan said. ""Our bigs did a great job. Every big that went in there tonight tried to make everything difficult for those guys. They didn't put up a monster game like they're accustomed to doing."" Toronto made a season-high 16 3-pointers, four by Lowry. His final 3 of the game came off DeRozan's pass with 3:21 remaining and put the Raptors up 109-107, a lead they did not relinquish. Despite the outcome, Toronto coach Dwane Casey wasn't pleased with his team's defensive effort. ""We have to give a better resistance,"" he said. Toronto had 10 offensive rebounds and 19 second-chance points. The Raptors also scored 19 points off 14 Pelicans turnovers. ""Off our turnovers and their second shots, they ended up with 38 points,"" Gentry said. ""That's a lot of points to give up in an NBA game."" DeRozan finished 11 for 13 at the free throw line, connecting on four of six attempts in the final 20 seconds. ""As a competitor, you want to be in those situations,"" he said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Cousins was called for a technical foul while sitting on the bench late in the second. ... All five New Orleans starters scored in double figures. ... Cousins had his NBA-best 11th double-double. Raptors: DeRozan attempted a team-high five 3s in the first, making two of them. ... Ibaka received a technical for sticking his tongue out at the New Orleans bench following a made basket in the third. ... C Lucas Nogueira picked up three fouls in 87 seconds of action in the first and did not play again.

"HOUSTON --  James Harden was quick to say yes when asked if he's playing at as high of a level as he ever has. The follow up question of why wasn't quite as easy for Houston's bearded star. ""I don't know,"" he said before letting out an awkward laugh and looking around before continuing. ""Work. Try to study the game and get better. Listen to people around me that push me and motivate me and try to be the best I can be. It's pretty simple."" Harden had a triple-double of 35 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists to help the Rockets beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 117-113 on Thursday night. Harden also had five steals and a block as Houston extended its winning streak to four games. LeBron James had 33 points for the Cavaliers, and Jeff Green added 27. Houston led by seven after a layup by James with about 10 minutes left. The Rockets scored the next six points, capped by a 3-pointer by P.J. Tucker to make it 111-98. The Cavaliers used a 13-1 run, with five points from James, to cut the lead to 112-111 with 90 seconds left. Harden missed a layup after that, but grabbed a rebound and threw an alley-oop to Clint Capela, who finished for Houston's first basket since Tucker's 3. He was fouled on the play and made the free throw to make it 115-11 with just over a minute remaining. James made a layup on the other end, but Capela made another basket after a grabbing the rebound on a miss by Harden to put Houston back up by 4 with 10.7 seconds left. Capela, who finished with 19 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks, blocked a shot by James in the final seconds to secure the win. ""We expect him to do that,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said about Capela's solid performance. ""He's 23 years old. There's no reason why he can't keep getting better."" The Cavaliers have lost six of their last eight games, leaving James to answer question about why they're struggling. ""We played a pretty good game, but I'm not here for moral victories,"" he said. ""That's not what I'm about."" Harden has scored 30 or more points in three of the last four games, highlighted by a 56-point performance in a win over the Jazz on Sunday. It's the second triple-double of the season for Harden and the 33rd of his career. ""I thought our guys really scrapped and competed,"" Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said. ""But Harden was Harden. He made some tough, contested 3s off the dribble, which we wanted. We contested all of them, but he made some big shots."" The Rockets made the first seven points of the second half thanks to a three-pointer by Eric Gordon and a four-point play by Trevor Ariza to take a 72-67 lead. Cleveland got going soon after that and a layup by Iman Shumpert got the Cavaliers within 1 point soon after that. But Harden made two 3-pointers to power an 8-2 run that extended Houston's lead to 81-74 lead with about 7 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. The Cavaliers scored five quick points, capped by a 3-pointer by Green, to tie it at 87-87 about three minutes later. A 3-point play by Gordon put Houston back on top and the Rockets had extended their lead to 100-93 entering the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Cavaliers: G Derrick Rose sat out because of soreness in his left ankle. Rose missed four straight games after spraining his ankle on Oct. 20 before returning to play the last two. But the ankle was still bothering him, forcing him to sit out again on Thursday night. ...  Shumpert started in his place and finished with seven points. .. Love had 17 points before fouling out in the fourth quarter. Rockets: F Luc Mbah a Moute missed because of a bruised left knee. ... Gordon added 20 points. ... Harden made 13 of 14 free throws. SPRINGER'S SHOT World Series MVP George Springer, who led the Houston Astros to their first championship last week, was at the Toyota Center Thursday to take part in the Rockets' First Shot promotion. Before the tipoff of each game, a local celebrity shoots a free throw for charity. A made shot gets a $5,000 donation from new owner Tilman Fertitta and the Clutch City Foundation, while a miss earns the shooter's charity $1,000. While Springer didn't miss too many balls while hitting .379 with five homers and seven RBI during the World Series, he wasn't nearly as good on the basketball court as he missed Thursday's shot. His shot earned some ribbing from Harden when Springer came into the locker room to meet him after the game. ""What was up with that shot,"" Harden asked laughing. Springer answered: ""I had zero touch."" NO SHOOTAROUND, NO PROBLEM The Rockets didn't have a shootaround Thursday morning as D'Antoni experiments with whether it's better for his team to rest before games instead of coming into the arena in the mornings. Teams often don't have shootaround on the second day of back-to-back games, but this different because Houston didn't play on Wednesday. They've skipped shootaround two other times this season, once in New York because of traffic and a second time against Utah. Both times Houston went on to blowout wins. ""Those were two of our better outings so it kind of leads to don't do it again ... if we don't (play well) then we'll go back and have shootaround,"" D'Antoni said.","400974917"
"De'Aaron Fox's late bucket wins it for the Kings over the 76ers. (0:28) SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Upset over being boxed out for a rebound by Joel Embiid with his team down by one in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, Sacramento center Willie Cauley-Stein immediately made up for it by blocking the Philadelphia big man's putback attempt. De'Aaron Fox took over from there and, after a failed try driving the lane, made a shot that was just as big as Cauley-Stein's block. Fox hit a 19-foot jumper with 13.4 seconds remaining to lift the Kings over Philadelphia 109-108 on Thursday night, ending a five-game winning streak for the 76ers that marked their longest in six years. ""We stuck together, because I thought it was going to get away from us, but we got some hustle plays and we hung onto some loose balls,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""We hope that we can get this every night, but we are going to enjoy this one."" Cauley-Stein's block on Embiid set it up. The Kings' 7-footer also defended Embiid when he missed a shot from the free throw line as time expired. ""My last thing was I had to block it,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""A score would have ended it. It was just instinctual."" Two nights after rallying from 17 points down to upset Oklahoma City and snap a seven-game skid, Sacramento (3-8) pulled off another stunner by closing with a 7-0 run. The Kings led for most of the second half but fell behind late in the fourth quarter when they went nearly four minutes without a field goal. Fox ended the drought with a short jumper and Garrett Temple hit a 3-pointer before Fox's game-winner gave Sacramento its second consecutive win. ""That's a shot that I'm extremely comfortable with,"" Fox said. ""That's what (they) gave me, so I took it."" Zach Randolph had 20 points and seven rebounds for the Kings. Justin Jackson scored 19, including 11 in the fourth quarter, and Fox finished with 11 points and seven assists. Embiid had 22 points and 15 rebounds on an uneven night. He shot 7 of 20 and struggled in the paint against Randolph and Kosta Koufos. ""We didn't deserve to win the game,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We poked ourselves in the eye. There are some things that you can spin and blame on youth. This isn't one of them."" Robert Covington scored 24 points and sank six 3-pointers for Philadelphia (6-5). Ben Simmons added 18 points and six assists. The 76ers trailed by as many as nine and looked out of rhythm most of the night before Simmons scored six straight points in the fourth quarter, including an emphatic, one-handed, driving dunk down the lane. Dario Saric followed with a 3 and Covington's sixth shot from beyond the arc followed by a three-point play extended Philadelphia's lead to 108-102 before the Kings made their decisive push. The game was close early on before Sacramento pulled away midway through the second quarter to lead 64-57 at halftime. LONG TIME COMING It was the first time Cauley-Stein and Embiid matched up as starters. The two 7-footers squared off last season when Cauley-Stein was a backup to DeMarcus Cousins. ""He's a great player and I've been wanting to see this matchup for a while,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""I'm happy I could just play with him. We both had a really good game and made it interesting."" TIP-INS 76ers: Simmons failed to have a double-double for only the fourth time in 11 games. ... Philadelphia has made 10 or more 3-pointers in seven consecutive games. ... Jerryd Bayless remained sidelined with a bruised left wrist. Kings: Vince Carter was inactive because of a kidney stone.","400974918"
"DENVER --  In a tight game down the stretch, there was no letting up by Emmanuel Mudiay and the Denver Nuggets. Mudiay scored 10 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, including the go-ahead 3-pointer midway through the period, and the Nuggets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 102-94 on Thursday night. ""What I like about our team tonight, when we were up in that fourth quarter, we didn't play not to lose,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We stayed aggressive. We kept the pressure on. That's really big because I think when you get tentative down the stretch, that's when things kind of fall apart. And I think Emmanuel was a big part of that attack, him, Paul (Milsap), Gary (Harris), Nikola (Jokic), they were terrific on both ends of the floor."" Milsap added 17 points and Jokic had 15 points to go with 11 rebounds for Denver. The Nuggets snapped a five-game losing streak at home to the Thunder, including a 106-105 setback April 9 on a last-second 3-pointer by Russell Westbrook that eliminated Denver from playoff contention. ""We had a hard time beating that team last year and we all know that,"" Malone said. ""So to pull a close game out against a talented team -- they're struggling right now but they're a talented team -- I don't know if we win that game last year. It was just a heck of a win with great defense."" Carmelo Anthony, who spent his first 7 1-2 years in the league in Denver before being traded to the New York Knicks in 2011, had 28 points to lead the Thunder, who acquired Anthony in a pre-season trade. Paul George and Westbrook each added 13 points for the Thunder, who lost their fourth in a row. ""Every season you go through adversity and right now we're going through ours,"" Westbrook said. Neither the Thunder nor the Nuggets were able to gain separation on the other in a tightly contested third quarter and the teams went into the final period tied at 75. The game was tied at 82 when Mudiay connected on a 3-pointer with 7:35 remaining, triggering a 7-0 burst by Denver. Oklahoma City fought back to within 93-90 but Milsap answered by converting a three-point play with 2:09 left to rebuild Denver's lead to six. The Thunder got no closer than four points the rest of the way. ""They did a good job of keeping us off the boards in the first half,"" Harris said. ""But we picked it up and we didn't turn the ball over as much in the second half and we were able to close out the game. Emmanuel came off the bench and he made some key shots in that second half that definitely pushed us over the edge."" Trailing by as many as 11 points earlier, the Nuggets closed to within 53-51 at the half on a driving layup by Milsap in the final seconds of the second quarter. Anthony had 15 of his points in the first half to help the Thunder maintain their early edge. ROUGH START The Thunder dropped to 0-6 against Western Conference teams this season. It's the longest drought against conference teams to start a season in the team's history. Said Anthony: ""It could go two ways: We could let this sit in our heads and think about it or put it behind and move forward. That's the beauty of this league and having so many games. I know we complain about back-to-backs but sometimes the back-to-backs are in our favor as players because you get to put that game behind you."" ON THE RISE The Nuggets have won six of their last eight games and improved to 7-5 on the year. It's the first time in six years they're at least two games over .500 in the first 12 games of a season. They opened 8-4 in 2011-12. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook was treated for a facial cut early in the game after taking an elbow to the face while guarding Jokic. The injury did not prevent him from continuing to play. ... Beyond his impact on the floor, Anthony has proven to be a steadying influence in the locker room. ""He's got a world of experience and a world of wisdom to share with our guys,"" coach Billy Donovan said prior to the game. Nuggets: F Juancho Hernangomez remains sidelined indefinitely because of a bout of mononucleosis. He has missed the last 10 games.","400974919"
"DETROIT --  It has been over a decade since the Detroit Pistons started a season like this, and the question now is how they will handle their early success. Coach Stan Van Gundy has his concerns, but even a poor second half couldn't keep Detroit from another victory. Andre Drummond had 16 points, 20 rebounds and a career-high seven assists, and Reggie Jackson made a pair of 3-pointers in the final minute to lift the Pistons to a 111-104 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night. Detroit let a 19-point second-quarter lead slip away but recovered in time to earn its seventh win in eight games. ""I don't want to sit here and just beat up on my guys to death, but I'm answering questions about the game. I can't sugarcoat the second half,"" Van Gundy said. ""We totally got outplayed in the second half."" The Central Division-leading Pistons (9-3) are off to their best start since 2005-06, when they went 10-2 to begin the season and ended up winning 64 games. Detroit outscored Atlanta 31-19 in the second quarter and led 57-41 at halftime, but couldn't shake the Hawks. Atlanta rallied and finally tied it at 94 when Kent Bazemore made back-to-back 3-pointers. It was tight the rest of the way, and Jackson's 3-pointer with 52.5 seconds remaining put the Pistons up 103-100. He connected again from beyond the arc with 21.3 seconds left to make it 107-100 and help Detroit close out the win after an uneven performance. ""I think the goal is to always learn, whether you're victorious or in a loss,"" Jackson said. ""Regardless of what our record is right now, playing well, we've been trying to go back to the drawing board each and every game just to be better than we were the day before."" Dennis Schroder had 17 points and 11 assists for Atlanta (2-10), which has the worst record in the Eastern Conference. ""We've just got to smarten up,"" Bazemore said. ""They are a team that's been together for a while and they made some huge plays down the stretch and you've got to give them credit."" Drummond surpassed his previous career high of five assists by halftime, and he calmly made two free throws with 1:28 remaining to put the Pistons up 100-98. Drummond's foul shooting has improved noticeably this season, and he was 4 for 6 against the Hawks. CONSISTENT Drummond has had at least 12 rebounds in each of his first 12 games this season, matching Kevin Love's streak to start the 2011-12 season. The last player with a longer streak to start a season was Moses Malone with 16 games in 1978-79. BAD TREND The Hawks have allowed at least 110 points in six straight games. It looked as if they might end that streak when they held Detroit to 19 in the third quarter, but the Pistons scored 35 in the fourth. ""Hopefully we can build on the second half, the way we played,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It's really how we need to play for the whole game. Not good enough in the first half and dug ourselves a hole."" TIP-INS Hawks: Mike Muscala (sprained left ankle), DeAndre' Bembry (fractured right wrist), Miles Plumlee (strained right quad) and Ersan Ilyasova (bruised left knee) missed the game. ... Bazemore scored a team-high 22 points. Pistons: Detroit was without Stanley Johnson (strained right hip flexor) and Jon Leuer (left ankle sprain). ...

"BOSTON -- Another game, another injury, another win for the Boston Celtics. Jayson Tatum had 16 points, Shane Larkin added 16 off the bench and the Celtics overcame an injury to Kyrie Irving and a 12-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Charlotte Hornets 90-87 on Friday night. Terry Rozier finished with 15 points, seven rebounds and four assists, playing an increased role after Irving left the game in the first quarter after taking an elbow to the face. Jaylen Brown added 10 points and 13 rebounds. The Celtics extended their win streak to 11 games. Charlotte has lost four straight. ""We just got a lot of fighters, a lot of resilient guys,"" Larkin said of a team that's now seen Gordon Hayward, Al Horford and now Irving beset by injuries. He said his teammates' misfortunes have underlined the necessity of staying ready. ""I'm always locked it. That's my job. I don't know when my opportunity's gonna be there,"" Larkin said. ""Tonight I hit some shots early, coach kept rocking with me, so I tried to throw my best."" Celtics center Aron Baynes' elbow inadvertently struck Irving when Baynes was landing after a rebound attempt. Irving fell to the floor and was bleeding from the nose as he was escorted back to the locker room. Irving was ruled out for the rest of the game while he was monitored for possible concussion symptoms. Larkin said Irving spoke to the team at halftime and texted them all congratulations on the win. Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 20 points and 11 assists. Celtics trailed by 12 after three quarters, but opened the fourth on a 16-3 run and took the lead with 4:05 to play on a basket by Brown. The lead grew to five before Walker's three-point play got the Hornets back within 86-85. Marcus Morris connected on a jumper, but Walker responded with a driving layup to get it back to a point. Boston called timeout, but Rozier accidently stepped out of bounds on the ensuing inbounds play. Walker dribbled the clock down, but his jumper bounced off the back of the rim and was rebounded by Rozier. He was fouled and sank two free throws with 3.6 seconds left. Charlotte struggled throughout the final period, going 4 of 20 from the field and committing six turnovers. ""We're giving up huge leads. We're not maintaining our game,"" Walker said. ""We've got to be better as a whole."" With Irving out, Charlotte took advantage against Boston's reserves early, stretching its lead to as many as 18 in the second quarter and taking a 16-point lead into halftime. BANGED UP Irving's injury is the latest stroke of bad luck for a Boston starter. Horford missed his second straight game with a concussion. And, of course, Hayward is out for the season after a gruesome leg injury on opening night. SLOW START The Celtics opened just 1 of 11 from the floor, and that first made field goal never made it through the hoop. Brown was credited with a basket when Howard was called for goaltending with 8:58 left in the first quarter, cutting Charlotte's lead to 9-2. Boston's first field goal to actually fall through the basket came from Morris more than halfway through the quarter. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte's 57 points in the first half were the second most the Celtics have allowed in the first half this season, one fewer than Milwaukee scored in the opening half of a 108-100 win on Oct. 18. ... Nicolas Batum (sprained left elbow) and Treveon Graham (right quad contusion) both sat out. Celtics: Shot just 33 percent (14 of 43) in the first half. ... Coach Brad Stevens said Horford is ""doing way better"" but wouldn't speculate about his availability.","400974921"
"CHICAGO --  Indiana's July trade that sent All-Star Paul George to Oklahoma City looks pretty good for the Pacers at the moment. Oladipo scored 25 points, and Indiana snapped a four-game losing streak with a 105-87 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Friday night. ""This was huge, just to kind of get our mojo back a little bit,"" Oladipo said. The 25-year-old Oladipo was 11 of 20 from the field and finished with six assists, six rebounds and two steals, continuing his strong start. The Pacers also got Domantas Sabonis in the deal with the Thunder. ""Great road win for us,"" Oladipo said. ""There are some things we still need to get better at. We need to learn each other. This was the first time we had everybody healthy. That's big too. We took steps in the right direction today."" After giving up an average of 115 points during its losing streak, Indiana held Chicago to 39.8 percent shooting in one of its stingiest defensive performance of the season. Bojan Bogdanovic made six 3-pointers and scored 22 points for the Pacers, and Thaddeus Young finished with 13 points and eight rebounds. ""One of our goals tonight was to defend the paint,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We thought we did a much better job. We held Chicago to 38 points in the paint. We executed the game plan and did a much better job on the defensive end."" Bobby Portis led Chicago with 20 points and 11 rebounds in his second game of the season. Kris Dunn scored 16 points on 8-for-14 shooting, and rookie Lauri Markkanen had 12 points and 10 boards. Portis had 21 points and 13 rebounds in Tuesday night's 119-114 loss at Toronto. He was suspended for the first eight games of the season after he punched teammate Nikola Mirotic during a preseason practice. ""I put a lot of work in over the summer,"" Portis said. ""On my jump shot, my low post game and everything and feel like I've tuned everything to get it to be an NBA player. This is a big year for me.""

Silver was in Chicago for Friday's announcement that the city will host the 2020 All-Star game. ... Sabonis (calf) returned from a two-game absence with eight points and nine rebounds. It was just the fifth time this season Sabonis and Myles Turner were active in the same game. McMillan said he plans to continue to put the two centers on the floor together. Bulls: Robin Lopez followed his 10-for-11 showing in Toronto by missing his first six shots against the Pacers. He finished with three points on 1-of-7 shooting. PROPER PUNISHMENT Silver said the Bulls handled Portis' suspension for injuring Mirotic ""the right way,"" and the league did not need to step in as a result. ENDORSEMENT FOR HOIBERG In a rare conversation with reporters following the All-Star game announcement, team president Michael Reinsdorf said he was happy with the direction of the Bulls' rebuild under coach Fred Hoiberg despite the team's 2-7 record coming into the day. ""So far we're happy,"" Reinsdorf said. ""When Zach (LaVine) comes back, that's going to be a big indication. Kris just came back from an injury. We have to see, but right now we're happy.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  This was the Paul George that Thunder fans had been waiting for. George scored 42 points and Oklahoma City snapped a four-game losing streak with a 120-111 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night. It was George's highest scoring performance since joining the Thunder in an offseason trade with Indiana. He said his new teammates are starting to figure out how his game works. ""It really is just chemistry,"" he said. ""When I got here, one of the talks we had about what was best with offense was the movement. Coach (Billy) Donovan was happy that he could utilize me in that situation of moving and getting some flow in offense, so I'm comfortable with that. It's good for me to get going and move around a little bit."" Russell Westbrook had 22 points and eight assists in the Thunder's highest-scoring game of the season. Carmelo Anthony and Alex Abrines each scored 14 points. Westbrook and Anthony made it tough for Los Angeles to deal with George. ""It's hard because they have so many options,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""A lot of times you have the one-two option, they've got the one-two-three option. It's tough."" George made 13 of 22 shots and had nine rebounds and seven assists. ""I was just trying to stay in attack mode,"" he said. ""If plays opened up and there was opportunities to find guys, I was trying to, but it just seems that a lot of the plays just ended up me one on one with a big at the rim."" Lou Williams scored 35 points for the Clippers, and Blake Griffin had 17 points on 5-for-19 shooting. Los Angeles has lost four straight. The Thunder led 63-55 at halftime behind 21 points by George. ""All of the sudden, he got it going,"" Rivers said. ""I thought that changed the game when he got it going. That stretched the floor some more."" The Thunder continued their surge early in the third quarter. A 3-pointer by Anthony pushed Oklahoma City's lead to 15. The Thunder increased their advantage to 20 before the Clippers chipped away late in the quarter to close to 94-86 at the end of the period. A 3-pointer by Austin Rivers tied it at 105 midway through the fourth, but the Thunder held the Clippers to one field goal in the final three minutes to regain control.

"SAN ANTONIO --  Eric Bledsoe made life easier on Giannis Antetokounmpo on Friday night. It was a great first impression. Antetokounmpo had 28 points and 12 rebounds, and Milwaukee snapped a four-game skid with a 94-87 victory over San Antonio in Bledsoe's debut with the Bucks. Bledsoe had not practiced with Milwaukee aside from a morning shootaround, but he quickly adapted to the talent around him. He finished with 13 points on 6-for-15 shooting. ""It was good,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It's really easy to play with him because you know he's going to find you. He's going to make the right play, so it's fun to play with him."" Bledsoe got the start after he came over in a trade with Phoenix on Tuesday. The 6-foot-1 point guard had not played in nearly three weeks since being sent home by the Suns after posting on Twitter that he didn't want to remain with the team following the firing of then-coach Earl Watson. ""I think he was just excited to be back playing,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""I thought his leadership, talking on the floor to his teammates is something that we needed and I thought he did a great job. He wasn't bashful talking to his teammates."" Bledsoe made his first attempt, a runner from 13 feet. He also had seven assists. ""It's easy playing with these guys,"" Bledsoe said. ""All I've got to do is give them the ball. I got the easy job."" Led by Antetokounmpo and Bledsoe, Milwaukee won for the first time in November and snapped San Antonio's three-game winning streak. Manu Ginobili's hanging, left-handed bank shot led to a three-point play that got the Spurs within 89-87 with 2:26 remaining, but the Bucks extended their lead on jumpers by Bledsoe and Khris Middleton. ""This is how we want to play,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We want to play with an edge. Eric helped a lot in that, but everybody stepped up. Everybody stepped up. They played hard defensively and offensively."" Antetokounmpo and LaMarcus Aldridge played to an early stalemate in a battle of star forwards. Aldridge muscled his way to the basket and scored 20 points on 8-for-14 shooting, but had only two attempts in the fourth quarter. ""We forgot a little bit about L.A.,"" said Ginobili, who had a season-high 18 points. ""We couldn't feed him. We should have used him way more."" The Bucks' length and quickness, especially Antetokounmpo's, created havoc for the Spurs. San Antonio had 18 turnovers, two short of its season worst. ""We can't turn the ball over the way we're constituted right now,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Every time we have a high turnover game, we are going to have problems."" TIP-INS Bucks: Middleton had 13 points. He averaged 26.3 points, 8.3 assists and 6.3 rebounds in his previous three games.  ... Despite having scored 20 points in three straight games, Malcolm Brogdon came off the bench for the first time this season after starting nine games. He finished with nine points and seven rebounds. ... Mirza Teletovic missed his first game, sitting out after experiencing soreness in his left knee. Spurs: San Antonio continued to play without Kawhi Leonard (right quadriceps), Tony Parker (left quadriceps) and Joffrey Lauvergne (sprained right ankle).

"PHOENIX --  Forward Aaron Gordon has added shooting range to his abundant athleticism, and his strong start has gone hand in hand with Orlando's. Gordon had 22 points and seven rebounds, and he made both his 3-point attempts to take over the NBA league in 3-point percentage in the Magic's 128-112 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Friday night. Gordon, 6-foot-9, has made 25 of 42 3s, 59.5 percent. He shot 28.8 percent from distance last season, his career percentage. ""It's still early. Just shooting the ball the way I know I can,"" said Gordon, averaging 19.6 points a game. ""Confidently. Looking for the right looks, and continue to shoot the ball. ""It's just making the right basketball plays. They are leaving me open and I am stepping up and knocking it down."" Among players who have made at least 25 threes, Portland's CJ McCollum is second at 54.4 percent. ""I'm happy for him, because that has been the knock on him throughout his career,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""He seems to have turned that around."" Nikola Vucevic added 19 points, reserve Jonathon Simmons and Terrence Ross scored 17 points apiece and Evan Fournier had 14 for the Magic. They have won two straight to reach 8-4, their best start in five seasons. The Magic led 64-63 at halftime but outscored the Suns by 15 after a halftime talk from Vogel. Orlando led by as many as 25 in the fourth quarter. ""I did raise my voice about our transition defense,"" Vogel said about his halftime message. ""There are some things we are supposed to execute that have nothing to do with urgency. It just has to do with being smart, which we weren't doing."" TJ Warren had 20 points and rookie forward Josh Jackson had a career-high 18 points for the Suns. They have lost five straight to drop to 4-9. ""We said to our guys at halftime, first team that platys defense is going to win this game,"" Suns coach Frank Vogel said. Gordon also impressed Vogel with his extra pass to Shelvin Mack that resulted in a 3-pointer. ""He played a wonderful basketball game,"" Vogel said. ""Not just making shots when the ball swings to him. His lack of forcing, which has also been an issue early in his career. He had opportunities to take some heat-check shots and he made that extra pass to the corner. That was one of the best plays of our season."" Gordon: ""I love passing. Assisting is fun. Assisting and scoring are on the same level to me. Making that pass it just as rewarding as getting a bucket."" Suns scoring leader Devin Booker, covered most of the game by Ross, scored nine points on 3-of-10 shooting, tying a season low in scoring. He was averaging 22.3 points. ""Trying to make him uncomfortable,"" Ross said. ""Be a little physical with him. Try to be there when he gets the ball in his hands and try to limit his touches. Just take him out of his rhythm. It was a team effort."" Alex Len had 21 points and 13 rebounds, and Michael James scored 18 points for Phoenix. TIP-INS Magic: A pass-first approach has helped the Magic to 40.6 percent shooting from three-point range entering the game, second in the NBA and a huge jump from 32.8 percent last season.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Dion Waiters struggled with his shot for most of the game. He found his stroke just in time for the Miami Heat. Waiters scored 12 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, and the Heat rallied to beat the Utah Jazz 84-74 on Friday. ""I'd rather go 0 for 30 than go 0 for 9 because if you stop shooting, that means you lost your confidence,"" he said. ""So that's my mindset right there, is just sticking with that, you can't ever lose confidence no matter what the situation is."" Goran Dragic had 18 points for Miami, and Tyler Johnson finished with 11 on an ugly night for each team on the offensive end. Hassan Whiteside had 20 rebounds and blocked three shots. Waiters took over down the stretch, scoring 10 points during a 13-0 run that made it 84-74 with 31.6 seconds remaining. He was 3 for 15 from the field heading into the fourth quarter, but he made four of his five shots in the final period. ""He just couldn't get them to go down,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""But I don't think he even notices if he's missing or not once we get to the last three or four minutes. He lives for those times and he stepped up and made some big plays, obviously."" The Heat (5-6) outscored the Jazz 20-8 in the third quarter after trailing by 12 at halftime. Miami put together runs of 11-0 and 7-0 during the period, and the Jazz had just one field goal in the 12 minutes. Utah was held to 25 second-half points in its lowest scoring game of the season. It was 1 for 18 in the third and made just four field goals in the second half. The Jazz (5-6) have dropped four in a row. ""There were a lot of open looks that we didn't make,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Whether it's confidence, or continuity or connectivity or whatever the case is, we've just got to grind through it. There isn't a magic bullet right now. ""It wasn't just one thing. There were a multitude of plays where we either missed a shot, made the wrong decision, should've passed when we shot, should've shot when we passed. At some point there's a mental component where we've got to settle in and continue to play with confidence."" Jazz center Rudy Gobert went down late in the third quarter with a right knee contusion after a Heat defender fell into his legs. He returned to start the fourth quarter and finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds. Rookie Donovan Mitchell started in place of Rodney Hood as the Jazz searched for more offense. Hood responded with 19 points and Mitchell had 12. ""I feel like we played way better offensively than we did against the Sixers (on Tuesday),"" Gobert said. ""We just didn't hit shots. Had a few turnovers, at times. ""Waiters hit some pretty tough shots at the end. ... We've just got to keep believing."" TIP-INS Heat: Miami shot just 15.8 percent from the field in the second quarter. Jazz: Joe Johnson will be evaluated in a couple days after missing the last five games with wrist tendon instability. HELPING VETS In Miami, the Heat celebrated their Veteran's Day tradition by helping repair and rebuild the homes of two former U.S. soldiers in need. The two homes that the Heat group -- including Alonzo Mourning and Glen Rice -- worked on Friday were both damaged by Hurricane Irma. The Heat provided things like roof repairs, appliances, painting and landscaping. In addition, Heat President Pat Riley and his wife Chris donated $25,000 to both soldiers. THE SWITCH UP Mitchell for Hood in the starting lineup was the first major change Snyder has made this season. The Jazz continue to search for the right rotations at the right moments as they learn to play without Gordon Hayward and George Hill. The losses of Dante Exum (shoulder) and Joe Johnson haven't helped the process. ""We are in the information gathering phase and we'll probably be there for a little while,"" Snyder said. ""That's the reality.""","400974926"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  D'Angelo Russell knew that the difference for Brooklyn against Portland's duo of Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum was going to be the defense. ""Honestly, I think we played defense for all 48 minutes,"" he said. ""We had maybe a minute-and-a-half lapse. For 48 minutes, everybody played their part."" Russell had 21 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter, and the Nets snapped a four-game losing streak to the Blazers with a 101-97 victory Friday night. He also had nine assists. DeMarre Carroll added 16 points and Allen Crabbe had 12 in his first trip back to Portland since he was traded to the Nets in the offseason. Jusuf Nurkic led Portland with 21 points but played just under one minute in the fourth quarter, and Damian Lillard added 19. The Nets led 77-70 to start the final quarter, but Portland pulled in front 86-84 on Evan Turner's jumper with 6:14 left.  After Russell's running 3-pointer for the Nets tied it at 89, he added a free throw and another basket to push Brooklyn's lead to 92-89. Lillard gave the Blazers a brief 95-94 lead on a pull-up jumper with 2:36 left, but Brooklyn reclaimed it with Rondae Hollis-Jefferson's layup and padded it with Russell's jumper. CJ McCollum's layup pulled Portland to 98-97 with 33 seconds left, but it was as close as the Blazers could get and Russell added a layup with 11.4 seconds to go that would all but seal it. ""Not a good loss, not a good loss,"" said McCollum, who finished with 17. ""It's a game we should have won. No offense to the Brooklyn Nets, but that's a game we should have won."" Crabbe played for the Blazers from 2013-17. Well-liked by the local fans, he was greeted with warm applause during player introductions. ""I feel like it was a great team effort. I think our defense tonight was on point where it needed to be,"" he said afterward. ""We made the stops that we needed to make and then we made the plays we needed to make on the offensive end."" Crabbe was traded to Brooklyn over the summer. He is among the young players the Nets hope to build around, but he was slowed at the start of the season by an ankle injury in camp. The Nets have been hampered by injuries of late. Trevor Booker (back), Hollis-Jefferson (hip) and Jarret Allen (foot) were all sidelined for the last game, a 112-104 loss at Denver on Tuesday night.  Brooklyn has been without Jeremy Lin since the first game of the season because of a ruptured patellar tendon. Hollis-Jefferson started Friday and had 11 points. Pat Connaughton hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to end the first quarter, giving the Blazers an early 28-21 lead. Portland stayed out in front through the half, leading 52-46 at the break. Nurkic led all players with 15 points in the half. He did not speak to reporters after the game about his fourth-quarter absence. ""I thought with their small lineup, I thought defensively we were giving up too much when he was in the game and I liked Ed's athleticism,""  Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. The Nets went on a 10-0 run midway through the third quarter, pulling within 65-62 on Quincy Acy's 3-pointer. Carroll's 3 tied it at 65 and he added a dunk to give Brooklyn the lead. Turner's 3-pointer and McCollum's long jumper got Portland within 80-79 with 9:12 left in the game. Shabazz Napier had a 3 for Portland that tied it at 82.

"WASHINGTON --  Even with John Wall struggling through migraine symptoms, the Washington Wizards continued their renewed commitment to defense. Bradley Beal scored 19 points on a day when Wall skipped the morning shootaround and most of pregame warm-ups, and the Wizards forced the Atlanta Hawks into a season-worst 24 turnovers in a 113-94 victory on Saturday night. ""I didn't have the same burst or energy,"" said Wall, who had 13 points and five assists in 24 minutes. ""One of my migraines came back and I had a cold on top of it. I didn't get to warm up before the game. I had to get two IVs, so I could have some type of energy."" Markieff Morris scored 18 points, his most since returning from sports hernia surgery earlier this month, and Kelly Oubre added 18 off the bench. That was enough to guide the Wizards to a second straight win while keeping a visiting opponent under 100 points. They'd allowed 110 or more in their first five games at Capital One Arena. ""We emphasized that the last couple of days,"" Morris said. ""We had a couple of bad losses by not playing D. That has to be our identity."" The Wizards shot 54 percent from the floor. Taurean Prince scored 19 points and Marco Belinelli had 15 for Atlanta, which failed to keep it close despite turning Washington's season-high 23 turnovers into 37 points. Hawks leading scorer Dennis Schroeder had seven points on 2 of 16 shooting. He missed all eight of his first-half attempts. ""Nothing is going to change for me,"" said Schroder, who was held to single digits for the first time this season. ""I've just got to stay aggressive. Even if I've got a game like that, I've got to come out there ready next time."" It was an 11-point game before Washington's second unit began the fourth quarter on an 18-2 run. That allowed coach Scott Brooks to keep rest his starters for the remainder of the game. ""Lots of good play off the bench,"" Brooks said. ""Guys were moving the ball and looking for each other. That's progress and hopefully we can continue to build off a game like tonight."" TIP-INS: Hawks: Have allowed at least 110 points in seven consecutive games. ...

"Jrue Holiday tosses it up for an Anthony Davis alley-oop. (0:26) NEW ORLEANS --  Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers summed up DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis before the New Orleans big men overpowered his Clippers. ""Their versatility, their size, their skill level. Two bigs that are that skilled, who can handle the ball, shoot the ball, pass the ball, dribble the ball, you know, block shots,"" Rivers before the game. ""Other than that, there's not much that's impressive."" And impressive they were. Cousins had 35 points and 15 rebounds and Davis added 25 points and 10 rebounds to help the Pelicans beat the Clippers 111-103 on Saturday night. Jrue Holiday had eight assists for New Orleans, half of the total assists generated by the entire Clippers team. The Pelicans also overcame 23 turnovers. Cousins lost the ball eight times -- two on offensive fouls -- and Holiday had seven turnovers. Blake Griffin led the Clippers with 27 points, but it came on 9-of-27 shooting. DeAndre Jordan has 12 points and 14 rebounds. The Clippers were held to 41 percent from the floor, while the Pelicans shot 54 percent. ""We tried to keep DeAndre off the board and keep Blake Griffin off the paint,"" Davis. By and large, the Pelicans succeeded. The game would likely have been a blowout were it not for the Pelicans turnovers, which kept the Clippers within striking distance until the final minutes. ""What's that stuff? Stickum,"" said Cousins when asked what he wanted to do to curb his turnovers. ""I am the main culprit of the turnovers right now. I had eight of them. I have to do a better job of taking care of the ball, make better decisions. Luckily the turnovers didn't affect us tonight because we got the win. It shows what kind of team we can be if we would take care of the ball"" Cousins and Davis were too much for the Clippers, particularly an artful fadeaway jumper by Cousins from 15 feet with 8 minutes left that put the Pelicans up by 10. Almost 2 minutes later, Cousins ripped down a rebound and launched a coast-to-coast pass to Davis for a dunk. ""We the amigos,"" cracked Cousins after the game. Austin Rivers managed to keep the Clippers in the game with 11 fourth-quarter points. ""It was in reach. We didn't execute down the stretch,"" Doc Rivers said. ""We came out of a timeout and had horrible execution."" RONDO'S RETURN Point guard Rajon Rondo, the Pelicans' major offseason free-agent acquisition, is a week to 10 days from making his regular season debut. ""He's close to doing it and everything seems to be going along fine,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We're not trying to push the issue at all."" DOC'S DIAGNOSIS Clippers coach Doc Rivers said his view that too many fouls are being called this year is, in essence, a structural issue with the league. ""This day and time, they look at each other wrong, it's a foul. I don't know how they even play against each other anymore. It's so difficult,"" he said. ""I don't even blame the officials.

"NEW YORK -- Back after a one-game absence to rest, Kristaps Porzingis picked up where he left off in his last game and helped the New York Knicks get another big win at home. Porzingis scored 34 points, Courtney Lee added a season-high 20 and the Knicks beat the Sacramento Kings 118-91 Saturday night for their fourth straight home victory. After reaching the 40-point mark for the first time in his career last Sunday, Porzingis missed New York's loss at Orlando on Wednesday night due to ankle and elbow injuries. His elbow swelled up again after crashing to the color on a couple of plays and he was pulled with the Knicks leading 88-60 with 2:53 left in the third. ""It has been a long time since we got a win like this,"" Porzingis said. ""Other guys can get some minutes and get their rhythm. Obviously, I wanted to be on the floor, I don't want to sit out.

Skal Labissiere scored 19 points and Buddy Hield chipped in 17 for the Kings, whose two-game winning streak was snapped after building a double-digit lead early in the first quarter.

The Kings got within one point on three occasions in the second period, the last coming with 6:54 remaining when Hield's jumper made it 43-42. New York then took off on a 21-7 run, capped by four straight points from Porzingis, and led 64-49 at halftime. The 22-year-old Porzingis, who is averaging 30.4 points per game, went 11 of 21 from the field, including 3-for-4 from 3-point range. He strung together six straight points to put the Knicks ahead 74-53 with 8:38 left in the third quarter as fans serenaded him with ""MVP"" chants. Porzingis has eight 30-point performances this season and has scored in double-digits in every game so far. ""He's really versatile for his height.

"HOUSTON --  After beating Houston in the first two meetings this season, Memphis Grizzlies coach David Fizdale said he expected the Rockets to come out swinging on Saturday night. Sure enough, the Rockets jumped out to a 9-0 lead by draining three straight 3s in the first two minutes of the game and never looked back in their 111-96 win over Memphis. James Harden scored 38 points, and Houston hit 16 of 45 (35.6 percent) from beyond the arc, including 6 of 14 from Harden, who added eight assists and four rebounds. Eric Gordon added 26 points on 6 of 11 3-point shooting for Houston. ""They had an edge tonight, which I expected,"" Fizdale said.

Harden insisted Houston's intensity had nothing to do with their previous two losses against Memphis. ""That's every game for us,"" Harden said. ""Offensively, we want to be aggressive, defensively, we want to be aggressive and create opportunities."" In their previous two meetings, Memphis held the Rockets to 90 and 89 points, the only two times the Rockets have been held under 100 points this season, and Houston's lowest two scoring efforts ever under head coach Mike D'Antoni.

In their 98-90 loss at home to Memphis on Oct. 23, the Rockets were outscored 20-2 in the final six minutes. On Saturday night, they were much more proactive about answering any upswing in Memphis' momentum. ""It's not going to happen overnight, but as long as we're consistent and we know what the long-term goal is, we'll be all right,"" Harden said. ""There's going to be times when we get up big and let it slip away, but tonight was a really good job of, when they went on a run, we sustained it and built it back up."" Tyreke Evans led Memphis with 22 points in 29 minutes off the bench. Marc Gasol and Mike Conley struggled from the floor, scoring 15 and 12, respectively.

MARWINNING For the third straight home Rockets game since the Houston Astros won their first World Series, an Astros player was in attendance. This time, Astros utility player Marwin Gonzalez sat courtside next to Astros owner Jim Crane. When announced on the videoboard, Gonzalez received what sounded like the loudest ovation from the Toyota Center crowd of the night.","400974931"
"DALLAS --  Not much has come easy for the Cleveland Cavaliers this season. Facing one of the worst teams in the league, the Cavs needed a big fourth quarter to hold off the Dallas Mavericks. Kevin Love had 29 points and 15 rebounds and Kyle Korver scored all 13 of his points in the final period to help the Cavaliers beat the Mavericks 111-104 Saturday night. Cleveland took control of the game in third quarter and led by as many as 11 in the fourth, then saw the Mavericks twice cut the deficit to one point. Dallas could never break through, though, missing three shots that would have given them the lead. With the American Airlines Center crowd standing for most of the game's final four minutes, Harrison Barnes missed a 3-pointer with 39 seconds left that would have put Dallas up by one. Korver -- who hit three 3s in the quarter -- was fouled on the rebound as he crashed to the floor, then made both free throws to put the Cavs up 106-102. Cleveland made seven of its final eight from the line to clinch the game. LeBron James, averaging 36 points in the Cavs' first five games in November, had just 19 Saturday, but two came on an emphatic dunk with 1:08 to play that put Cleveland up 104-100. He also had 11 rebounds. ""We're just really resilient,"" James said. ""We relied on our championship habits from our guys on the floor, but also trying to get back to our mental toughness and figuring out how to win."" Barnes finished with a team-leading 23 points and 12 rebounds, and Dennis Smith, Jr. had 21 for Dallas, which is tied with Atlanta for the NBA's worst record at 2-11. Dirk Nowitzki scored 14 for the Mavericks. ""It's never usually what happens in those last few minutes that dictates the game,"" Barnes said. ""It's what you did earlier. Unfortunately, that deficit we built -- we couldn't really get past it."" The Cavaliers outscored the Mavericks 34-22 in the third quarter to erase a three-point halftime deficit. Love scored 13 points in the first 5:38 of the quarter, and J.R. Smith's long 3-pointer keyed a 15-2 run and forced a Dallas timeout. ""They just found me all night, especially in that third quarter,"" Love said. ""They kept feeding me the ball. They knew I had a little rhythm going and that set the tone for us."" TIED FOR 13TH J.R. Smith's four 3-pointers gave him 1,797 for his career, tying him for 13th place all-time with Nowitzki, who had two 3s of his own in the game. NO MINUTES FOR NOEL Center Nerlens Noel did not play at all Saturday as the Mavericks turned to Dwight Powell and Salah Mejri to back up Dirk Nowitzki at center. Noel played just five minutes Tuesday against Washington and has seen his minutes slowly decline. Carlisle explained the decision by saying, ""Minutes are earned -- that's all I can tell you."" Noel said he was disappointed by the lack of minutes but not frustrated: ""(Carlisle) knows my number is ready when he calls it and I'll give force to a winning effort."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Smith had 17 points and Jae Crowder had 15. Starting point guard Derrick Rose missed his second consecutive game with a left ankle sprain. Iman Shumpert started in Rose's place. The team set no timetable for Rose's return. ... Tristan Thompson missed his fifth straight game with a left calf strain. Despite missing Thompson's presence on the boards, Cleveland outrebounded the Mavericks 53-42. Mavericks: Dallas set a franchise record by making at least nine 3s in their 13th straight game, but they shot just 29 percent from deep on Saturday, making 10-of-34. . Guard Devin Harris left the game in the third quarter with bruised ribs and probably won't play on Sunday.","400974932"
"MILWAUKEE --  Fatigued after a hard-fought road win the previous night, Giannis Antetokounmpo recognized the importance of following up with a win at home. ""It was tough. A lot of us were tired,"" Antetokounmpo said after the Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 98-90 on Saturday night. The Bucks won in San Antonio 94-87 on Friday night. ""We played hard last night, but to validate last night's win we needed to win tonight,"" Antetokounmpo said. Antetokounmpo scored 33 points and had a season-high 15 rebounds to help Milwaukee overcome Lonzo Ball's historic triple-double. Ball became the youngest player in NBA history to record a triple-double when he had 17 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds. At 20 years and 15 days, he bested LeBron James by four days to become the youngest to accomplish the feat. The accomplishment meant little to Ball, given the outcome. ""I really don't care,"" Ball said. ""I just wanted to win tonight. I thought we put ourselves in a good position to get it, but it didn't happen."" Ball had struggled mightily in the early going this season getting shots to fall until finding a groove against the Bucks. ""He was really good tonight,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""Obviously, it helps when you get some of those shots to go in. I thought he did a great job of playing at a pace, creating for others, constantly being the aggressor on the offensive end, keeping the defense on their heels."" Milwaukee used a 9-2 run at the end of the third quarter to grab a 77-67 lead. The Bucks maintained a double-digit lead throughout most of the fourth. After the Lakers pulled within seven with just over five minutes left, Antetokounmpo threw down a dunk while being fouled. He made the free throw to grow the Bucks' lead back to 10 points. He followed with a twisting layup on the next possession as the Bucks gained control. Bucks coach Jason Kidd credited his team's effort. ""Guys were tired there at the end, but it just showed the maturity of us understanding what was at stake,"" Kidd said. Ball had 11 points, 10 assists and six rebounds in the first half. He made just three of 12 shots in a loss at Washington on Thursday, but finished 7-for-12 and made 3-of-5 shots from three-point range against the Bucks. ""I told you, I am going to keep shooting,"" Ball said. ""They fell tonight."" KIDD ON BALL Kidd, who had a storied career as a point guard, had high praise for Ball's performance. ""He got off to a great start shooting the ball,"" Kidd said. ""His strengths are finding his teammates and rebounding the ball, making the game easy for his teammates. He did that at a very high level tonight."" SLOW START After an impressive game on Friday night, Eric Bledsoe's home debut got off to a rough start. Acquired from Phoenix earlier in the week, the 6-foot-1 guard missed his first four shots. He finished with 11 points on 4-for-13 shooting. Kidd likes the added dimension Bledsoe brings to the Bucks offense.  ""He brings a dynamic we haven't had since Brandon Knight, and that's speed,"" he said. STIFLING DEFENSE After surrendering 124 points in a loss to Cleveland on Nov. 7, the Bucks have held their last two opponents to 90 points or less. ""Defense wins games,"" Kidd said. ""I thought the guys did a great job of focusing on the defensive end, rebounding the ball, taking care of the ball."" TIP-INS Lakers: Coming off a game in which he made just one of seven three-point attempts, Ball began by draining both of his 3-point attempts in the first quarter. ... The near-capacity crowd booed Ball nearly every time he touched the ball early in the game. ... G Vander Blue, last year's D-League MVP, entered the game in the second quarter, seeing action at the Bradley Center for the first time since playing for Marquette University in the 2012-13 season. Bucks: Mirza Teletovic missed a second consecutive game with left knee soreness. Coach Jason Kidd said he doesn't expect Teletovic to return to practice until Wednesday. .Milwaukee played its third set of back-to-back games this season.","400974933"
"SAN ANTONIO -- Pau Gasol had 21 points and 10 rebounds and the short-handed San Antonio Spurs beat the Chicago Bulls 133-94, setting a season-high in points despite missing a third of their roster Saturday night. Dejounte Murray added 17 points and Davis Bertans had 16 points in 18 minutes for San Antonio. Chicago lost rookie forward Lauri Markkanen to a sprained left ankle late in the first half. The severity of the injury is unknown. The Spurs were without six players, including three starters. In addition to Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker, who have yet to play this season due to quadriceps injuries, San Antonio was also without Danny Green. Manu Ginobili rested on the second night of a back-to-back. The Spurs still had the depth to hand the rebuilding Bulls their fourth straight loss. San Antonio had eight players in double figures. Rudy Gay and Brandon Paul each had 15 points as San Antonio closed out a six-game homestand with four victories. Bryn Forbes, who was making his first career start, had 13 points on 3-for-5 shooting from 3. San Antonio was also almost without Gay, who was ""50/50"" with an ailing back, but the veteran forward played 18 minutes. San Antonio raced to a 30-8 lead in the opening quarter, extending the margin to 22 points at the close of the period. The Bulls closed the gap by scoring on 10 straight possessions in the second quarter, but the Spurs regained their dominance in the third. Robin Lopez and Bobby Portis each had 17 points to lead Chicago. TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago had nine steals after averaging 10.3 in its previous three games. ... The Bulls trailed by 22 points after the first quarter. It was the Spurs' largest margin after the opening period since leading by 24 in Chicago in 2014. ... Justin Holiday was 1 for 4 on 3-pointers, snapping a 15-game streak in which me made at least two 3s. ... The Bulls have lost four straight in San Antonio. Chicago's last victory at the AT&amp;T Center was Jan. 29, 2014. Spurs: Forbes is the third undrafted player under 6-foot-4 player to start a game in franchise history, joining Avery Johnson and Anthony Carter. ... Gay has 10-plus points in 10 of 13 games this season. Ginobili is the only Spurs reserve with more double-digit scoring through 13 games in the past 30 years. Ginobili had 10-plus points in all 13 games in 2008, when he won the Sixth Man of the Year. ... The Spurs had two back-to-back games at home in the same month for the first time in franchise history.","400974934"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Nah, that slow start didn't last long for the defending NBA champions. Draymond Green knew they'd be just fine. ""We know what we're capable of,"" he said, ""we just needed to lock in and focus."" And Golden State is getting better by the game -- balanced, getting better on both ends, doing all the little things that were discussed all summer. Kevin Durant returned from missing one game with a leg injury to finish with 29 points, leading the Warriors past the Philadelphia 76ers 135-114 on Saturday night for their sixth straight win. Green did his usual thing: 10 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, five blocks and two steals. Stephen Curry took a knee to his right quad muscle -- similar to what Durant dealt with -- but added 22 points and nine assists to surpass the 4,000-assist mark for his career and Klay Thompson scored 23 as the Warriors pulled away in the second half. ""It's been great to have so many guys contribute so many guys contribute in different ways,"" Green said. ""That's what we've talked about early on was our depth and guys have stepped up."" Durant sat out Wednesday's win against the Timberwolves with a bruised left thigh but hardly showed any signs of an issue. Curry, sporting new twisties in his hair, briefly went to the locker room early in the second but returned. JJ Redick scored 17 points to lead the Sixers, who hung around for a half. ""You realize that there is zero margin of error,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""There is so much firepower on that team."" The Warriors have won by 17 or more points in each game of this winning streak, averaging 122.8 points. Golden State built its first double-digit lead of the night at 86-76 on Nick Young's 3-pointer with 4:14 left in the third, and rolled from there getting another quick 3 by Young, one from Curry and a Durant jumper. The Warriors won their ninth straight against the Sixers and sixth in a row at Oracle Arena. MCADOO'S RING 76ers two-way player James Michael McAdoo received his Warriors championship ring in a pregame ceremony. He was cheered when he checked in for the first time midway through the fourth. Coach Steve Kerr texted with him leading up to the game. ""I'm thrilled that he was here, and I thought it was a great gesture by the Sixers to make sure he was here,"" Kerr said. ""I know he'll get a huge ovation from the crowd tonight, he deserves it."" CURRY'S WORDS Curry made clear ""I care about our veterans deeply"" in a piece he wrote for The Players' Tribune that published Saturday for Veterans Day expressing his support for the troops and explaining his stance -- even if he didn't want to visit the Trump White House. The two-time MVP said: ""... When someone tells me that my stances, or athlete stances in general, are `disrespecting the military' -- which has become a popular thing to accuse peaceful protesters of -- it's something that I'm going to take very, very seriously. One of the beliefs that I hold most dear is how proud I am to be an American -- and how incredibly thankful I am for our troops. I know how fortunate I am to live in this country, and to do what I do for a living, and to raise my daughters in peace and prosperity. But I also hear from plenty of people who don't have it nearly as good as I do. Plenty of people who are genuinely struggling in this country. Especially our veterans. ""And every single veteran I've spoken to, they've all said pretty much the exact same thing: That this conversation we've started to have in the world of sports ... whether it's been Colin (Kaepernick) kneeling, or entire NFL teams finding their own ways to show unity, or me saying that I didn't want to go to the White House -- it's the opposite of disrespectful to them."" Kerr applauded his superstar again. ""I thought it was beautiful,"" Kerr said. ""He's very thoughtful, he's very compassionate, very smart and he's humble. I've made the comment before that he is incredibly arrogant on the floor and humble off the court. I think that's a really powerful combination. ... When he speaks it's from the heart."" TIP-INS 76ers: The Sixers forced Golden State into eight first-quarter turnovers. ... Philadelphia shot 51.9 percent in the first half to stay within 65-64 at the break. Warriors: Andre Iguodala, who started in Durant's place Wednesday, was out for rest. ... Curry moved into a tie with Guy Rodgers for 10th place on the franchise list for all-time games played at 587. These two are the only Warriors to reach 4,000 assists, Rodgers with 4,855. ... The Warriors blocked 11 shots, their 12th time in 13 games with at least seven blocks.","400974935"
"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets were determined to finish their homestand strong. Jamal Murray made sure they did. Murray scored a career-high 32 points, Will Barton had 26 points and nine rebounds -- both season bests -- and Denver beat the Orlando Magic 125-107 on Saturday night. Nikola Jokic had 12 points and 17 rebounds for his eighth double-double of the season and also added eight assists for Denver. Six Nuggets scored in double figures. It was the first time in five games Murray scored in double figures after averaging 23.3 points in his previous three. The coaching staff urged him to be selfish when the opportunity was there and he responded. Murray had 22 points in the first half to help Denver take a 70-47 lead and hit a basket late in the fourth to set his career high. ""I was just playing basketball,"" Murray said. ""Coach told me to be aggressive. Tonight I was hitting and they kept finding me."" Denver finished its season-long six-game homestand 5-1 and benefited from a shorthanded Magic team. Guards Elfrid Payton and D.J. Augustin didn't play due to left hamstring injuries, and the Nuggets took advantage of their absence to score 70 points from their backcourt. The Nuggets were 22-19 at home last season, which was a big reason they missed the playoffs by one game. They are 6-2 at home to start this season. ""If you want to be a playoff team you have to win at home,"" coach Michael Malone said. Marreese Speights led the Magic with 19 points. Evan Fournier and Jonathon Simmons scored 18 apiece. The Nuggets took control with a 13-0 run late in the first quarter. Murray scored nine of his 16 points in the period during the run that gave Denver a 35-19 lead. The Nuggets put it away in the second quarter when Orlando went cold. The Magic had just one field goal for the first 6 minutes of the period when Denver built a 26-point lead. The lead grew to 30 in the third quarter but the Magic battled back to make it a 13-point game but never got closer. ""To have a good team you need a bench who will come in and do all the gritty work,"" Speights said. ""We wanted to come back and get the win. The group out there was playing hard. We just came up short."" TIP-INS Magic: F Jonathan Isaac sprained his right ankle in the fourth quarter and didn't return. He left the arena in a walking boot. ... Payton didn't play to protect against him aggravating the left hamstring that kept him out of eight games this season. ""One thing he hasn't done since he's been back is playing in a back-to-back,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""Traveling, arriving late at night, if he still has some tightness in there this is a concern. It's not a setback, we're just being smart with it."" ... Augustin missed his fifth consecutive game. Nuggets: Jokic outrebounded Orlando's starters 17-12. ... G Gary Harris did not play because of a shoulder injury. Malone would not say if Harris would miss more than one game. ... Denver's 70 points in the first half were its most for any half this season. PASSING FANCY Jokic and Kenneth Faried hooked up for a highlight play in the second quarter. Jokic threw a halfcourt lob to Faried, who had to reach high to get it with one hand and slam it home to give the Nuggets an 18-point lead. ""He can jump high,"" Jokic said. ""I thought it was too strong -- not too high, too strong. He caught it. It was a nice play."" The play brought back memories for Malone. ""It reminded me of Bobby Hurley's pass to Grant Hill back in the day,"" he said, referring to the Duke teammates in the Blue Devils' win over Kansas in the 1991 NCAA title game.","400974936"
"PHOENIX --  The two players counted on most by the young Phoenix Suns both had their game in high gear on Saturday night. The result was an end to the Suns' five-game losing streak. Devin Booker and T.J. Warren scored 35 points apiece and the Suns pulled away over the final four minutes to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-110. ""When they're both rolling, it's going to be a good night for us,"" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. Booker scored nine in the Suns' decisive 21-7 run over the final 3:50. Just past his 21st birthday, Booker loves to have the ball down the stretch of a close one. ""Winning time, that's what we called it at Kentucky,"" he said, ""time to lock in defensively, help each other out. And we did that."" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau called Booker and Warren ""tough matchups."" ""We've got to give the appropriate help, step behind them,"" he said, ""and you can't give guys like that room, and we did."" Andrew Wiggins scored 27 points and Jimmy Butler had 25 in Minnesota's second straight loss after a five-game winning streak. ""We scored, we just couldn't stop them,"" Thibodeau said. ""We just kept on trading buckets. Then we got the lead, then we gave it away."" In a back-and-forth second half, Phoenix took control with a late 14-0 burst. Booker scored seven points in the streak and capped the outburst with a pass to Marquese Chriss, who sank a 3-pointer from the corner to give the Suns a 111-103 lead with 51.2 seconds to go. Booker scored just nine points of 3-of-10 shooting in Phoenix's loss to Orlando on Friday night but came back strong. ""He is such a gifted player,"" Triano said. ""We're just trying to create different ways for him to have the ball. We know he's good enough to make plays for other people, he's good enough to score. I think the biggest thing that we've been preaching is how well he defends."" Chriss was the only other Phoenix scorer in double figures with 13 and blocked five shots. His most memorable block came on Wiggins' dunk attempt midway through the fourth quarter. ""It kind of sticks in people's heads,"" Chriss said of the impact of his shot-blocking ability. ""It's not going to be an easy layup this time."" A 19-4 run to end the third quarter and start the fourth gave the Timberwolves a 94-87 lead on Shabazz Muhammad's basket with 9:47 to play. But the Suns scored the next 10 to go up 97-94 after Warren's 17-footer with 6:53 left. Minnesota responded with a 9-0 spurt and Jeff Teague's 3-pointer put the Timberwolves up 103-97 with 4:46 to go. Minnesota went four minutes before its next score. Neither team had a double-digit lead all night with the Timberwolves, who never trailed in the first half, up 60-57 at the break. Chriss sank a 3-pointer in the opening minutes of the second half to tie it at 61 and, after Chriss' block of Karl Anthony-Townes' shot led to Warren's breakaway dunk, Phoenix led 83-75 with 4:06 to play in the third. Minnesota called a timeout, then went on a 13-2 run to end the quarter to lead 88-85 entering the fourth. BUDDIES Anthony-Towns and Booker are friends and former teammates at Kentucky. They also are the top two scorers out of the 2010 draft. It's one of four draft classes in NBA history where the top two scorers were college teammates. Towns had 17 points and 12 rebounds on Saturday. Towns was not surprised by Booker's late-game heroics. ""We knew he was going to come aggressive after last night,"" Towns said, ""and he was hitting shots. That's what he does."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota hadn't played since a loss at Golden State on Wednesday while Phoenix was playing on back-to-back nights. ... The Timberwolves swept the three-game series with Phoenix last season. ... Minnesota lost despite a 19-7 advantage on the offensive boards. Suns: Tyson Chandler played after missing the previous two games with back spasms. ...  Phoenix improved to 1/3 on a season-long six-game homestand. ...

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell made the most of his opportunity in place of the injured Rudy Gobert. Mitchell scored 26 points, including four in the final minute, to lead the Utah Jazz to a 114-106 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night. ""I didn't want to settle for the shots I can get any time I want,"" the rookie said. ""I wanted to get to the basket and get in a groove. When you get to the basket, it opens up your outside shot and you can find guys."" Without Gobert, who sat with a bruised knee, Derrick Favors had season highs of 24 points and 12 rebounds and the Jazz snapped their four-game losing streak. Favors himself played with a balky knee last season but feels like he's fully healthy now. ""I got my explosiveness back and my quickness,"" he said. ""I can move laterally better and I just feel good."" After trailing by 12 with 3:52 to play, DeMarre Carroll led a last-gasp comeback with six quick points to pull Brooklyn to 108-104, but Mitchell hit two free throws and had a sensational tip-in to clinch the victory. ""My first intention was to dunk it but the defender backed up a bit and I had to tip it in. I didn't even know it went in at first,"" Mitchell said, although the roar of the crowd told him all he needed to know. The Jazz have been one of the few holdouts in the new small-ball era in the NBA, as they usually feature two non-stretch big players. With Gobert sidelined, Utah often had just one interior player on the floor and it worked. It also didn't hurt that the Nets were finishing a five-game road trip and a back-to-back. D'Angelo Russell scored 26 points for the Nets but limped to the locker room with 2:35 to play and did not return. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 19 points and Carroll finished with 15. ""I felt like in the second half we came out more together, focused, more locked in. It showed in our play. Obviously, we're hurt about the loss, but on a good note we competed and were more locked in at the end,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. The Nets led 25-20 in first quarter before the Jazz went on the kind of burst they've seldom managed this season. Hood broke out of a recent shooting slump with 14 points in a Utah's 25-4 run. Hood, who had shot just 27 percent in his last five games, made a 3-pointer with 7:58 before halftime that gave the Jazz a 45-29 advantage. Mitchell also bounced back from going 8 for 35 in his last two games to shoot 10 for 18 and come up big in the clutch. The Nets lost three of five on their trip. TIP-INS Nets: Trevor Booker returned after missing four games with a sore lower back and supplied his typical intensity, scoring 12 points and picking up a technical in the second quarter. ... Coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game, ""We've won a couple of road games, and now the next step is, can we perform better on a back-to-back. We'll see."" ... The Nets still haven't won consecutive road games since the 2015-16 season. Jazz: After Friday's game, Gobert tweeted a video of the play, saying, ""Dove for the ball right..."" and also told reporters he thought Dion Waiters crashing into his knee was a dirty play. ... The Jazz haven't topped the 50-percent mark for field goal percentage in a game since the opener against Denver but came close with 48.2 percent. QUOTABLE ""Gritty effort, with Rudy out, in particular and on a back-to-back,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""We came out with a lot of chutzpah. It was good to see. The effort got rewarded with shots going in."" INJURY WATCH With Jeremy Lin out for the season and Spencer Dinwiddie hampered with hamstring issues, an extended absence for Russell would be a big blow to the Nets. The team's leading scorer at 20.9 points a game landed awkwardly on a drive to the hoop. He went to the sideline and paused there for a bit before slowly walking to the locker room. The Nets say Russell will be evaluated on Sunday.","400974938"
"BOSTON --  Al Horford turned back the clock in his return from a two-game absence with a concussion. Horford scored 21 points on 8-of-9 shooting to help the Boston Celtics hang on to beat the Toronto Raptors 95-94 on Sunday for their 12th straight victory. ""He's playing young again,"" teammate Terry Rozier said. Horford had 15 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists against his former team in Atlanta on Monday night, the same day an elbow to the head from Kent Bazemore sent him into the NBA's concussion protocol. Horford also missed nine games last season with a concussion. Horford disagreed with Rozier's assessment, thinking he's playing even better. ""I don't know if young Al Horford played like this, to be honest,"" the former four-time All-Star said. ""You know, it's been years of just working on my game and try to play this new way."" Boston (12-2) was playing without Kyrie Irving after he took an inadvertent elbow to the face from teammate Aron Baynes on Friday night against Charlotte. Irving has a minor facial fracture but has not been diagnosed with a concussion as initially feared. Jaylen Brown added 18 points, and Rozier helped fill in for Irving with 16 points off the bench. Boston shot just 40.2 percent from the field. DeMar DeRozan scored 24 points, and Kyle Lowry had 19 points and seven assists for Toronto. The Raptors dropped to 7-5 after winning two straight. ""They are the best team in the NBA right now, 12 in a row,"" Lowry said. ""They're playing unbelievable, everyone is picking up slack."" Jayson Tatum's acrobatic layup with 1:26 remaining in the fourth quarter put the Celtics up 95-90. DeRozan missed a potential go-ahead stepback jumper with 19 seconds remaining. Tatum got the rebound, but elbowed Fred VanVleet in the face for an offensive foul that was confirmed by video review. DeRozan had another look to give Toronto the win, but missed a turnaround jumper with 2 seconds left. Serge Ibaka scooped up the rebound, but lost the ball as time expired. ""He shook him, he was wide open, vaulted up, and I'll take that shot 999 times out of 1,000,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said about DeRozan's effort. Brown, who was guarding DeRozan on the final possession, was a bit surprised himself that the shot didn't go down. ""That's a shot that DeMar DeRozan probably hits nine times out of ten,"" Brown said. ""I got a late contest, but he missed this one so we'll take the win."" STREAKING Boston's 12-game winning streak is tied for its third-longest in the last 30 years. The Celtics also won 12 straight from Jan. 11-Feb. 3, 2009. Toronto has never snapped an opponent's winning streak of 10 or more games in franchise history, according to Elias Sports Bureau. MASKED KYRIE Irving visited a facial specialist Sunday and was fitted for a mask after being injured Friday. The last time Irving played in a mask was on Dec. 15, 2012, when he scored a then-career-high 41 points versus New York with Cleveland. PASSING BARGNANI Lowry's 3-pointer with 5:32 left in the first quarter moved him past Andrea Bargnani (6,581 points) into fourth place on Toronto's scoring list. Vince Carter is third with 9,420 points. TIP-INS Raptors: DeRozan had 20 or more points for the seventh straight regular season game in Boston and is averaging 22 points in that stretch. ... Norman Powell left the game with a right hip pointer. Celtics: Boston held an opponent under 100 points for the 11th time in its last 12 games.

"DETROIT --  Detroit Pistons rookie Luke Kennard took advantage of his opportunity to play clutch minutes for coach Stan Van Gundy. Kennard finished with 14 points off the bench, shooting 6 of 11 from the field, including 2 of 5 from 3-point range, helping the Pistons to a 112-103 victory over the Miami Heat on Sunday. At 10-3, Detroit is second behind Boston in the Eastern Conference and off to its best start since going 15-3 in 2005-06. The Pistons swept a five-game homestand. ""We really stayed poised,"" said Kennard, who has been in and out of the rotation this season. ""We stayed together, stayed connected and guys made plays all around the court. Everybody made an impact."" Tobias Harris had 25 points, Avery Bradley scored 24, Reggie Jackson had 17 points and Andre Drummond added eight points and 17 rebounds for the Pistons. Detroit used a 10-0 run midway through the fourth quarter to pull away. ""Our guys got down in the second half and just kept playing, kept fighting,"" Van Gundy said. ""I was really proud of our guys."" Hassan Whiteside had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and Dion Waiters added 16 points and five assists for Miami. ""We were not able to dictate and impose our style on this game, pretty much all across the board,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""You have to credit them, they flattened us out."" The Pistons led 58-55 at halftime and 83-81 entering the final quarter. They opened a 91-86 edge after Kennard's jumper. Later, after a 6-0 run got Miami to 93-92, Kennard hit consecutive shots -- a runner and a 3-pointer -- to make it 98-92 with 7 minutes left. Kennard's layup made it 107-97 with 2:24 left. ""As a rookie, his composure and the way he plays the game, it's awesome to see,"" Harris said. ""The lift he gave us coming off the bench, in big minutes, too, I'm proud of him."" CONNECTIONS Van Gundy was an assistant with the Heat from 1995-03 and the team's head coach from 2003-06. Pistons assistant Tim Hardaway played for the Heat from 1996-01 and his No. 10 Miami jersey was retired. ... Heat assistant Juwan Howard played college basketball at Michigan. LONG-RANGE START Miami's first four made shots to open the game were 3-pointers, giving the Heat a 12-7 lead, before Whiteside's short jumper broke the string. Miami started 4 of 7 from 3-point range and finished the first quarter 7 of 16 from beyond the arc and 11 of 22 overall from the field. The Pistons made 4 of 8 3-pointers in the first quarter and led 31-29. TIP-INS Heat: Former Michigan point point Derrick Walton Jr., now a rookie with Miami, attended Michigan's home basketball game Saturday night in Ann Arbor and was part of a pregame banner ceremony to recognize the Wolverines' Big Ten tournament title last season. He did not play in Sunday's game at Little Caesars Arena. ... G/F Rodney McGruder (left tibia) did not play. Pistons: Starting small forward Stanley Johnson (right hip flexor strain) missed Sunday's game, his third in a row. Van Gundy is hopeful Johnson will return for Detroit's game at Milwaukee on Wednesday. ... F/C Jon Leuer (left ankle) also did not play against the Heat.","400974940"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Houston Rockets scored early and often. James Harden had 26 points and a season-high 15 assists and the Rockets beat the Indiana Pacers 118-95 on Sunday night. ""We're preaching it. Getting off to better starts and not trying to fight our way back into games. We've been doing that as of late,"" Harden said. The Rockets improved to 11-3, never trailing and leading by as many as 23. The Rockets overwhelmed the Pacers from the start, jumping out to a 13-2 lead. Houston continued to pile it on early and often, outscoring the Pacers 24-9 during the first 6 minutes. Indianapolis native Eric Gordon had 21 points, and Clint Capela had 20 points and 17 rebounds for the Rockets on the way to Houston's sixth straight victory. Houston outscored Indiana 46-38 in the paint, but their most impressive work on the offensive end of the floor came beyond the 3-point line, making 17 3-pointers.  Houston's defense was also a high point for the Rockets with 10 of Indiana's 13 turnovers coming by way of a steal. ""It was a professional win,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""They came in and they took care of business right from the get go. We played well. We've been playing well. We're going to keep it going ... we just don't want to get too excited, we have another game Tuesday."" The lone bright spot of the game for the Pacers came in the second quarter when they managed to cut Houston's lead to 39-34. Victor Oladipo had 28 points, and Domantas Sabonis added 17 off the bench for Indiana, and Lance Stephenson had eight points and 10 assists. But the Rockets were simply too much for the Pacers. Houston went into halftime leading once again by double digits, 63-51 and put it away in the third quarter with the same offensive mindset that they started the game with. The Rockets led 87-71 at the start of the fourth and never looked back. Myles Turner finished with 13 points and eight rebounds for Indiana and a very clear understanding of how and when the game got away from the Pacers. ""The start,"" Turner said. ""We got off to a bad start and it's hard (to climb back) ... (Houston) cut out from the first play. They executed their stuff, got out and ran and our communication was really bad in transition."" ROCKET MAN Harden has at least 20 points and seven assists in all 14 games this season and has seven double-doubles and two triple-doubles. HOMEGROWN HOOPS Pacers fans still relishing in the excitement of the addition of former Indiana Hoosier Oladipo were happy to welcome back Houston guard Eric Gordon. Gordon, also a former Hoosier, was met with a warm reception during player introductions. Gordon returned to the arena where he played for a state championship in high school. The defending NBA 3-point competition champion averaged 29 points his senior year at North Central High School (Indianapolis) and 20.9 points during his lone year at Indiana. TIP-INS Rockets: The Rockets are 7-1 on the road, highlighted by their season opening win against Golden State. ... Five of Houston's next seven games will take place at the Toyota Center in Houston, capped off with a rematch against Indiana on Nov. 29. ... The Rockets have held opponents below 100 points six times this season and are 5-1 when doing so. . Clint Capela has eight double-doubles this season. . Houston has made 10 or more 3-pointers in 13 of the first 14 games this season. Pacers: Indiana has lost five of its last six games after a 5-3 start to the season. ... Houston's 35 points in the first quarter were the most allowed by Indiana this season. With 63 points at halftime, the Rockets also tied for the most first-half points allowed by the Pacers this season.","400974941"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  With Oklahoma City down a superstar and a second starter, the Thunder's other two superstars pushed aside the Dallas Mavericks. Paul George scored 37 points, Russell Westbrook added 27 points and the Thunder overcame the absence of Carmelo Anthony and Steven Adams to beat the Mavericks 112-99 on Sunday night. George was 7 of 12 from 3-point range. Anthony was ruled out about an hour before tipoff because of a sore lower back, and Adams, Oklahoma City's starting center, sat out a second straight game with a right calf contusion. Without Anthony, George and Westbrook carried the offensive load, fueling a 26-10 run in the third quarter that broke open what had been a tight game. Oklahoma City improved to 6-7, winning its second straight after four consecutive losses. ""I thought defensively, it was our best game from start to finish,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I thought we played a complete game defensively. Offensively, I thought we turned it over too much in the first half . but in the second half, offensively and defensively, we played really, really well. ... To come out and play the way they did, being down two starters, I thought they did a great job, all the way through, from top to bottom."" Harrison Barnes had 22 points and 13 rebounds, and Yogi Ferrell had 18 points for the Mavericks. They have dropped nine of their last 10 games to fall to 2-12. Dallas is in a particularly tough portion of its schedule, having lost both ends of a back-to-back against Cleveland and Oklahoma City, and with games against San Antonio and Minnesota looming. Oklahoma City led 44-42 after a subpar offensive first half for both teams. Westbrook and George combined to go 5 of 18 from the field in the half, but combined to score 32 of the Thunder's 39 points in the decisive third quarter. With the game tied 48-48 in the third quarter, Westbrook scored on a drive, and then George blew by Dirk NowitzkI for a dunk that led to a Dallas timeout. That started the Thunder's big run, which included three 3-pointers by Westbrook and another by George. Westbrook's final 3-pointer during that stretch put Oklahoma City up 74-58 with 3:35 left in the quarter. George's 3-pointer with 11:25 left in the game pushed the Thunder's advantage to 88-67. He deflected much of the praise for the win to the Thunder's younger players. ""We've got to be ready for anything,"" George said. ""When Steven went down, Dakari (Johnson) stepped up. Melo went down and it was a huge contribution from a bunch of guys. Josh (Huestis) stepped up, Jerami (Grant) stepped up. We've got to be that team. We're fortunate to have two other guys who can take the (scoring) load, but it's even better when we've got young guys who can step up and help the team."" A 9-2 run, capped by Ferrell's 3-pointer, pulled Dallas within 97-84 with 5:56 left but the Mavericks came no closer. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said the Mavericks have to improve how they play in the third quarter. ""We've got to fix it,"" he said. ""It's got to become a mentality. We have to just do better in all areas. We're suffering with turnovers, missed shots -- that's just going to happen in the NBA. You can't bellyache about missed shots, but your defense has to be consistent. You have to execute and take care of the ball. You have to be able to stop the other team. Tonight, giving up 39 in the third, that was the game."" TIP-INS: Mavericks: Devin Harris missed the game because of bruised ribs he suffered in a loss Saturday to Cleveland. ... The Mavericks went 11 of 37 from 3-point range and have had at least nine 3-pointers in all 14 of their games. ...Official Sean Corbin issued technical fouls to both Dirk Nowitzki (in the second quarter) and Carlisle (between the third and fourth quarters). Thunder: On his 29th birthday, Westbrook chose to wear a pair of neon orange Air Jordan shoes during the first half before switching to a pair of black-and-blue Air Jordans for the second half. ... The Thunder made a season-high 15 3-pointers, in 32 attempts. ... Jerami Grant was given his first start of the season in place of Anthony. ... Rookie Dakari Johnson started at center for the second straight game in place of Adams and matched up against NBA legend Nowitzki in the post to begin the game. HOT-HEADED NOWITZKI Nowitzki appeared to accidentally hit Grant in the face as Grant went up for a dunk midway through the second quarter. At first, officials ruled it a common foul, but the Thunder asked for a review and the play then was ruled as a flagrant foul. Nowitzki wasn't amused and uttered some choice words at Corbin, who slapped the 20-year veteran with a technical foul. Carlisle stepped in between Corbin and Nowitzki and guided his player back to the Mavericks' bench.","400974942"
"WASHINGTON --  Wizards point guard John Wall isn't known for his 3-point shooting. Don't tell that to the Sacramento Kings. Wall had 21 points and nine assists, Marcin Gortat scored 18 and Washington beat Sacramento 110-92 on Monday night for its third straight win. Wall shot 8 of 9 from the field, including 4 for 4 from 3-point range. In two games against the Kings, he has 40 points and is 9 for 10 from long distance. In his other 10 games, he is 5 for 32. ""I think I'm taking the same exact shots,"" Wall said. ""I'm just making them against them for some reason. Everybody else I be, clank."" Otto Porter Jr. and reserve Mike Scott chipped in 15 points apiece as six Wizards scored in double figures. After losing to the Mavericks 113-99 in the opener of a four-game homestand, the Wizards outscored the Lakers, Hawks and Kings by an average of 111-94. ""Intensity changed. We definitely locked in more defensively,"" Gortat said of Washington's turnaround after losing three straight home games overall. ""We really took it personally. We had teams like Phoenix and Dallas coming in here and punking us in front of our own crowd. It's not nice. It's definitely not nice. We all get a lot of fire from that."" George Hill led Sacramento with 16 points, while Zach Randolph and Buddy Hield each had 12. The Kings have lost the first two games on their three-game road trip. Washington led by six at halftime and hit its first five shots -- two by Bradley Beal -- in the third quarter to extend the lead to 70-56. The Wizards built the margin to 22 late in the period. ""We hung in there in the first half but in the second half they came out, they got in the paint, (and) we took a lot of jump shots,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""They ran out on us a lot in transition and kind of got away from us."" The Wizards (8-5) shot 51.8 percent (44 of 85), while the Kings made 40.5 percent (34 of 84). The Kings were 12 of 23 (52.3 percent) from 3-point range. ""We had a lot of possessions where we didn't communicate right or just didn't get in the right spot at the right time,"" Hill said after the Kings fell to 3-10. Washington outrebounded Sacramento 50-34. The Wizards had 30 assists and just 12 turnovers, while the Kings turned it over only 10 times. The Kings led 32-25 after one but the Wizards' reserves, paced by Scott and Kelly Oubre Jr., went on a 15-2 run to start the second quarter. Sacramento briefly regained the lead before Wall and the Wizards' starters returned and mounted a 17-8 run, good for a 57-51 halftime lead. TIP-INS Kings: Are 1-7 on the road. ...

"After a first-quarter altercation with Frank Ntilikina and Enes Kanter, LeBron James alongside Kyle Korver lead the Cavaliers in a fourth-quarter comeback. Korver scores 19 of his 21 points in the fourth, as Cleveland tops New York 104-101. (3:19) NEW YORK --  LeBron James got shoved by the Knicks and then benched by his coach. Neither could keep him down for good. James had 23 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, Kyle Korver scored 19 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter to spark a huge comeback, and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat New York 104-101 on Monday night. James also had a technical foul after a first-quarter altercation with Frank Ntilikina and Enes Kanter, which seemed to charge up the Knicks. But he didn't lose his poise then or midway through the third quarter, when Tyronn Lue yanked the five starters with the Knicks on their way to a 23-point lead. ""I knew we had another half,"" James said. ""Didn't know that I was going to get snatched like that early in the third, but I felt if I got back in I could still make some plays to help our team win."" He did, hitting two of the Cavaliers' nine 3-pointers in the fourth after they made just seven through three quarters and helping the Cavs charge back for their eighth straight victory at Madison Square Garden. Cleveland outscored New York 43-25 in the fourth, making more 3s than the Knicks had baskets (8). But the turnaround started late in the third with the second unit in. ""Now we just kept talking about chipping away, chipping away,"" Dwyane Wade said. ""And then as you saw Kyle Korver got going and then when you saw LeBron check back in, you knew, OK. You saw the waves coming."" Tim Hardaway Jr. had 28 points and 10 rebounds, and Kanter added 20 points and 16 boards. But Kristaps Porzingis shot only 7 for 21 while scoring 20 points as the Knicks blew their chance to beat the Cavs for the second time this season. The game was just two days after James, following a victory in Dallas, said Mavericks rookie Dennis Smith Jr. should be a Knick. The Knicks passed on Smith in the draft, taking Ntilikina one spot earlier at No. 8. James said he meant it as a shot at former president Phil Jackson, and he was angry that he thought Kanter overreacted in his defense of Ntilikina. So it wasn't surprising they were involved in an altercation late in the first quarter. James dunked and then wouldn't move out of the way as Ntilikina tried to take the ball back to the baseline to throw it in. Ntilikina pushed James, who then exchanged words with Kanter after he ran in. James shoved Kanter, and both were given technical fouls. ""I don't care ... what you call yourself. King, Queen, Princess, whatever you are. You know what, we're going to fight and nobody out there (is) going to punk us,"" Kanter said. James' response? ""I'm the King, my wife is the Queen and my daughter is the Princess,"" he said. ""So we got all three covered."" The Knicks got hot after that, hitting the Cavs with a 15-0 burst early in the second to open a 47-31 lead. Ntilikina and Hardaway both stole the ball from James during the run. Cleveland made a brief run early in the third before New York extended it back to 17, when Lue made his line change. Korver said even then he was still thinking the Cavs could win. ""Absolutely,"" he said. ""That's a lot of time and this is an amazing place to make a comeback in."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Derrick Rose, who played for the Knicks last season, remained out with a sprained left ankle. ... Cleveland started 2 for 15 behind the arc. Knicks: Former Knicks stars Bernard King and Latrell Sprewell were at the game. ... G Ron Baker was inactive, with coach Jeff Hornacek saying he hurt his shoulder playing for the Knicks' G League team over the weekend. TRAVEL-IERS Cavs players took the subway back to their hotel after their morning shootaround at MSG, rather than sit in traffic on the bus. James, in a video posted by the NBA , said it was his first time taking the subway in New York. ""When in Rome,"" Korver said. NO NOAH Joakim Noah was eligible to play after the completion of his 20-game suspension for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy last season, but the Knicks kept him on the inactive list. Hornacek said Noah is in shape -- he was allowed to practice during his suspension -- and a valued member of the team, but the Knicks' center tandem of Kanter and Kyle O'Quinn has been playing well.","400974944"
"MILWAUKEE --  After being torched for 65 points in the first half, the Milwaukee Bucks turned up the defensive pressure against the Memphis Grizzlies. Milwaukee held Memphis to 12 points in the third quarter to get back into the game and pulled away late in the fourth for a 110-103 victory. ""In the first half, it was a shoot-around,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""I thought in the second half we focused on the defensive end."" Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and nine rebounds to lead the Bucks. ""We want to be a defensive team,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Sometimes we make mistakes and forget who we are."" Memphis coach David Fizdale said the Grizzlies lacked intensity in the third quarter. ""We try to pride ourselves on our toughness and I didn't think we held up our end of the bargain tonight,"" Fizdale said. ""That third quarter, we just didn't come out ready to compete. That was the big difference in the game."" Khris Middleton and John Henson had 17 points apiece as Milwaukee won a season-high third straight. Henson made eight of 10 shots in his highest-scoring game this season. Tyreke Evans scored 14 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter for Memphis, and Dillon Brooks added 19 points. After the Bucks threatened to pull away late in the third, Evans scored nine consecutive points to pull Memphis into an 84-all tie early in the fourth quarter. Memphis pulled ahead on Dillon Brooks' 3-pointer with about nine minutes left. Milwaukee tied it on Tony Snell's corner 3. A soft drop-in by Antetokounmpo put the Bucks ahead 100-96 with just under five minutes remaining, a lead they wouldn't relinquish. ""Normally that game gets away from us,"" Kidd said. ""When we came back with the starters, we went on a run, but it started on the defensive end."" The Bucks got off to a strong start, shooting 65 percent from the field in the first quarter, including 6 for 6 on 3-pointers, to take a 34-29 lead. ""It was confidence boost to see shots go down,"" Middleton said. Memphis hit 10 of its first 11 shots in the second quarter to take a 10-point lead with 4:24 left in the half. Milwaukee made just one of six shots from long-range in the quarter, but pulled to 65-60 at the break, led by Antetokounmpo's 12 points in the period. POSITIVE ATTITUDE Fizdale said he is taking a positive approach with point guard Mike Conley, who has struggled with his shooting this season. He made 2 of 12 shots against the Bucks after entering the game shooting 40 percent from the field and 31 percent from 3-point range. ""Be positive. There's no beating the players up over struggles,"" Fizdale said. ""It's not the way to get them out of it, and it's never been my approach. Mike has had a nagging injury and can't control that."" BANG FOR THE BUCK Fizdale believes the Bucks improved considerably with the recent acquisition of Eric Bledsoe from the Phoenix Suns. ""You add Eric Bledsoe to anybody's team and you are going to be way more concerned,"" Fizdale said. ""Obviously, there's the pace and the speed that he brings to the game. His tenacity, his toughness, his ability to get to the rim. They are going to be something to reckon with this year with him."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Wrapped up a five-game trip with a 2/3 record. Chalmers fouled out with 2:19 remaining. Bucks: Middleton, who entered the game shooting 26 percent from 3-point range, hit his first three attempts from beyond the arc. ...

"NEW ORLEANS -- A couple of seasons overseas appears to have turned Darius Miller into the clutch jump shooter the Pelicans hoped they were getting when they made him a second-round draft choice in 2012. Miller hit four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, when he scored 14 of his career-high 21 points, and New Orleans overcame a sloppy performance to beat the struggling Atlanta Hawks 106-105 on Monday night. ""I feel like I'm finally getting into a shooting rhythm,"" Miller said. ""This is the best league in the world. To perform here, it feels really good."" DeMarcus Cousins had 22 points and 16 rebounds, and fellow All-Star big man Anthony Davis added 13 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots for the Pelicans, who have won five of six. E'Twaun Moore tied a career high with 24 points for New Orleans. Kent Bazemore scored 22 points for the Hawks, who led by 14 before fading to lose their fourth straight. ""There are a lot of positives, you know, the way the guys competed on the road against a good team,"" said Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer, whose team has won just two of its first 14 games. ""Just a play here or there, but I'm proud of the effort. I'm proud of the competitiveness of our group."" Bazemore missed a critical free throw with 37.1 seconds left. Atlanta still had a chance to take a late lead, but Dennis Schroder's errant pass toward Tyler Cavanaugh sailed out of bounds with 3.2 seconds to go. Davis' late turnover -- New Orleans' 19th of the game -- gave Atlanta one last desperation shot with about a second left, but Bazemore was unable to get a clean look at his 3-point attempt over Jrue Holiday. ""It's really tough, because we played hard and battled against two of the best bigs in the league,"" said Cavanaugh, a rookie who scored a career-best 16 points. ""We followed the game plan really well. We were right there."" Atlanta led 101-97 after Cavanaugh's fourth 3 of the game with 2:41 to go. Miller responded with the first of three 3s in the final 2:19, including two in the final minute. His last, from the left wing, came after Holiday's near turnover rolled right to the Pelicans small forward. ""That was lucky,"" Miller said. ""I don't know how it got to me, but I was ready to shoot it."" TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta took advantage of Pelicans mistakes to lead for much of the game and also hit 17 of 36 from 3-point range. Like Cavanaugh, Luke Babbitt and Marco Belinelli each made four 3s. Belinelli finished with 14 points and Babbitt 12. ... The Hawks raced to a 32-23 lead after one quarter, led 50-45 at halftime and 80-78 after three quarters. ... Atlanta had 10 offensive rebounds and 15 second-chance points. Pelicans: Rajon Rondo made his Pelicans debut following about a month of rehabilitation from surgery to repair a core muscle injury. He had two points and two assists in about five minutes in the first half. ""Adrenaline is still going, so of course I feel great. We'll see how my body responds"" Tuesday, Rondo said. ... Holiday finished with 13 points. ... Cousins committed seven turnovers and Davis five. MILLER'S MATURITY Miller spent much of the past two seasons playing in Germany before Pelicans general manager Dell Demps gave him a second shot in New Orleans, hoping his role as a go-to scorer in Europe would translate to timely scoring back in the NBA. Davis said Miller's performance reminded him of when the two were teammates on Kentucky's 2012 national title team, when Miller projected confidence as a senior leader. ""That's what we need from him,"" Davis said. ""Last time he was with (the Pelicans), he was always pump fake, pump fake, pass or wasn't as aggressive. Coming back, he had that two years in Germany where he played his butt off ... and the last couple games he's been playing very aggressive and he's been helping us."" HANDLING PROBLEMS Before the game, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said he was trying to emphasize better decision-making after a rash of turnovers this young season. His players did not respond particularly well in the first half, coughing it up 13 times. That helped the Hawks build a 45-31 lead before New Orleans stormed back to briefly tie it with a 14-0 surge fueled by 3s from Cousins and Moore, as well as Davis' fast-break layup and putback dunk.","400974946"
"PHOENIX --  Lonzo Ball could only watch from the bench as the Los Angeles Lakers pulled away late to beat the Phoenix Suns. Jordan Clarkson was just playing too well to come off the court. Clarkson scored a season-high 25 points in 26 minutes, and the Lakers beat the Suns 100-93 on Monday night. ""I just came in there aggressive like  I try to do every night,"" Clarkson said, ""score the ball for the same group and just win the game. It was a good win for us, to finish the road trip like this."" Devin Booker had 36 points, his second consecutive game of at least 35, for the Suns. Brook Lopez and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 15 apiece for the Lakers, who salvaged the finale of a four-game road trip and won in Phoenix for the second time this season. Ball, the Lakers rookie coming off his first career triple-double on Saturday night, did not play in the fourth quarter. He had seven points on 3-of-10 shooting, five rebounds, five assists and four turnovers in 28 minutes. Coach Luke Walton said he came close to putting Ball back in the game but couldn't pull reserves Clarkson and Corey Brewer. ""There were a couple of times where I was one play from putting him back in,"" Walton said, ""and one of those guys would make a play."" The Lakers had just two turnovers in the fourth quarter after committing 14 in the first three. ""I thought we did a great job taking care of the ball,"" Lopez said. ""And I thought we did a great number defensively as well."" Booker scored 22 in the first half en route to his sixth 30-point performance in the last 10 games. T.J.  Warren added 21 and Dragan Bender a career-high 15 for the Suns. ""I thought the 3-pointers were the difference in the game,"" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. ""They made seven more 3s than us, and that's a big part of the game, that's a big number. I thought our defense was decent enough to keep us in the game, but when they make 14 3s and you make seven, it's going to be a tough hill."" Los Angeles shot 14 of 33 on 3s to the Suns' 7-for-26 effort. The score was tied 81-81 after Bender's left-handed driving layup with 7:25 to play. Los Angeles took control from there with a 10-2 run to go up 91-83 on Brewer's 3-pointer with 5:02 remaining. Phoenix, loser of six of its last seven, never got closer than six after that and Clarkson's 3 made it 98-88 with 2:43 to go. Phoenix scored the first nine points of the game and that was the biggest lead for either team through three quarters. Neither team was up by more than five in the third. The Lakers scored the final six of the quarter, the last two on Clarkson's reverse layup with 3.6 seconds to go to lead 74-73 entering the fourth.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Minnesota has turned into an offensive machine. Facing a Utah team without its best defensive player made it much easier to keep the engine running full speed. Karl-Anthony Towns had 24 points and 13 rebounds as the Timberwolves beat the Jazz 109-98 on Monday night, setting a team record by scoring at least 100 points for the 12th consecutive game. Towns credited his team with setting the right tone on defense to keep the offense moving. The Timberwolves forced the Jazz to the outside and didn't give up much there until the game was out of reach in the fourth quarter. ""Our offense was created by our defense as well,"" Towns said. ""A lot of energy was being transferred, putting them on their heels after a missed shot. We played the game into our hands and we just kept the pace going our way. We didn't stop."" Jimmy Butler added 21 points and 10 assists, and Jeff Teague scored 22 for the Timberwolves. Taj Gibson had 15 points and 10 rebounds. Minnesota (8-5) snapped a two-game skid after shooting 52.1 percent (37 of 71) from the field. Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points and Rodney Hood added 16 to lead the Jazz (6-8), who lost for the fourth time in their last five home games and fell to 1-1 without injured center Rudy Gobert. ""We just didn't hit any shots,"" forward Derrick Favors said. ""We got the shots that we wanted. We just couldn't hit them. They played a good game."" Utah fell behind 33-14 heading into the second quarter after struggling to get stops in the paint or get on track offensively. Towns slammed down a pair of dunks to help Minnesota take its first double-digit lead at 13-3. His teammates took turns slashing to the rim for layups to keep the foot firmly planted on the gas pedal. The Jazz couldn't find an answer, going just 6 of 21 from the field in the first quarter. Their shooting improved in the second, when consecutive 3-pointers from Hood and a banked floater from Thabo Sefolosha allowed Utah to cut Minnesota's lead to 54-42 in the final minute before halftime. Things turned sour for the Jazz again after the break. Their defensive troubles resurfaced in the third quarter as Minnesota shot 11 of 16 and hit all four 3s it attempted. The Timberwolves led by 26 in the quarter, going up 86-60 after Gibson dunked the ball and Butler drained a pull-up jumper on back-to-back possessions. Utah made a charge late in the fourth and cut the deficit to 105-94 on a 3-pointer from Mitchell with 2:32 left. ""We haven't played for 48 minutes and that's still something we have to work on and we have to continue to try to improve in that area,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""But overall, I thought our defense was pretty good."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Attempted 29 free throws while limiting Utah to 11. ... Gibson has four double-doubles in six November starts. He's averaging 12.7 points and 10.0 rebounds during that stretch. ... Minnesota had a 40-31 edge on the glass. Jazz: F Jonas Jerebko made his first start this season and totaled 13 points and six rebounds in 25 minutes. ... Hood shot 50 percent from 3-point range for the second straight game, going 3 of 6 from long distance. ... Utah finished with a 49-16 advantage in bench points. MAJOR MILESTONE Towns joined Dwight Howard as the only NBA players to compile 3,000 points and 2,000 rebounds before age 22. Towns is averaging 21.2 points and 11.2 rebounds per game. He ranks in the top 20 among NBA players in scoring and in the top 10 in rebounding. If he has his way, he'll be making this sort of impact for a long time. ""I'm very blessed that I've found success early in my career and hoping to continue to find success for the next 17 years,"" Towns said. ""Hopefully, I get to play 21 and be one up on KG (Kevin Garnett)."" SHOOTING WOES FOR RUBIO In a few games, Ricky Rubio has gone from Utah's leading scorer to an offensive liability. Rubio can't get his shot to fall. He's shooting 31.8 percent from the field in November after going 1 for 7 against Minnesota in 22 minutes. Jazz coach Quin Snyder said he doesn't want to dwell too much on Rubio's shot selection. What he expects to see from Rubio are other essential qualities for a point guard. ""Ricky's value to our team, first and foremost, is his leadership and his mind and his ability to get other people involved,"" Snyder said. ""I don't want him to define himself by his shot. I want him to get people involved and, when he's got a shot, to make the right reads.""","400974948"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Trail Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic appeared to draw some motivation in facing his old team. ""He was aggressive,"" said former Denver Nuggets teammate Nikola Jokic, ""looking to score."" Nurkic had 17 points and Portland beat the Nuggets 99-82 on Monday night to snap a two-game losing streak. Portland built an 86-66 lead early in the fourth quarter on Noah Vonleh's dunk and cruised the rest of the way. CJ McCollum also had 17 and Damian Lillard finished with 15 points and seven assists. Portland led by as many as 23 points and found a way to shut down Jokic. ""We tried to show tonight that we're a good defensive team and hold them below 80. We did a great job and we tried to show that,"" Nurkic said. Paul Millsap led the Nuggets with 18 points, including a season-high five 3-pointers. The win was a boost for the Blazers, who were coming off two straight close -- and disheartening -- losses at home. They fell to Memphis 98-97 before losing to Brooklyn 101-97 on Friday night. The Nuggets were coming off a successful six-game home stand during which they went 5-1, including a 125-107 victory over Orlando on Saturday night. But they were cold against the Blazers, shooting just 35 percent for the game to snap a three-game winning streak. Denver was without starter Gary Harris because of right shoulder soreness. Will Barton got his second straight start in his place and had 12 points. Jokic, who has had double-doubles in eight of the last 10 games, finished with six points and seven rebounds -- well off his season averages of 17.2 points and 12 rebounds going into the game. ""He's a great player. He's had this year a lot of good games,"" Nurkic said. ""I know exactly what he's going to do. ... We stopped him really well."" Nurkic, who played just one minute in the fourth quarter of Friday night's loss to Brooklyn, played for the Nuggets for three seasons before he was traded to Portland in February. The Blazers were 14-6 with Nurkic in the lineup, a spark that helped propel the team into the playoffs. Nurkic, who was obviously energized against his former team, went into the game averaging 15.6 points and 7.3 rebounds this season. Blazers coach Terry Stotts tinkered with his starting lineup, giving rookie forward Caleb Swanigan his first career start, but he got into foul trouble early in the third quarter. Swanigan said he found out on Sunday he's start. ""Just come in and get a win,"" he said of his reaction. ""We had lost two in a row so the biggest thing for all of us was to come in focused and make sure we win this game."" Portland went on a 10-2 run for an early 35-25 lead. The Blazers went on to lead by as many as 14 points in the first half, led by Nurkic and Evan Turner with 10 points apiece. Portland's bench outscored Denver's 25-10. Trailing 54-59 at the break, the Nuggets closed within 54-51 on a pair of free throws from Wilson Chandler. But CJ McCollum answered with a 3-pointer for the Blazers. Portland pushed the lead to 82-66 on Vonleh's tip shot and Lillard added free throws to end the third quarter. ""Maybe I was not as aggressive, but they are a good defensive group,"" Jokic said. ""They are a good team. That's why they made the playoffs last year."" It was Portland's ninth straight win at home over the Nuggets. TIP-INS Nuggets: Starting guard Will Barton was drafted by Portland in 2012 with the 40th overall pick and played two-plus seasons with the Blazers. ...   Mason Plumlee was traded from Portland to Denver in the Nurkic deal. Both Plumlee and Barton were greeted with warm applause by fans at the Moda Center. Trail Blazers: Meyers Leonard was active after missing the last eight games with a right ankle sprain but he did not play. MORE TWEAKS In addition to inserting Swanigan into the starting lineup, Stotts did not go with Lillard and McCollum to start the second and fourth quarters. ""It was something I actually toyed around with going to the season, if we'd ever get to it or not,"" Stotts said. ""I wanted to give it a look, it worked out well tonight and we'll see how it does going forward.  ""","400974949"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  One night last week, Kevin Durant sat out. On Monday, it was Stephen Curry with the same bruised thigh muscle that sidelined the NBA Finals MVP. Both games, Golden State showed off its remarkable depth, withstanding the absence of a big star. Durant had 21 points, a season-high eight assists and seven rebounds, Shaun Livingston scored a season-best 16 points in place of the injure Curry, and the champion Warriors pulled away in the second half to beat the Orlando Magic 110-100 for their seventh straight win. Draymond Green had a season-high 20 points, five assists, four rebounds and two steals as the Warriors completed an unbeaten four-game homestand. Klay Thompson credited the front office for keeping the talented, loaded roster intact. ""It's what's been able to propel us to three straight Finals,"" Thompson said. ""Our depth's been incredible."" Nikola Vucevic scored 20 points, Evan Fournier had 16 and Aaron Gordon added 10 points and 10 rebounds in the Magic's fourth defeat over six games. Livingston also had six assists on a night they were without Curry as he nursed a bruised right thigh from where he took a knee Saturday night. Durant sat out with the same injury to his left leg last Wednesday against Minnesota. Coach Steve Kerr called them similar injuries and is being cautious with two-time MVP Curry, who sat out on his bobblehead giveaway night and has only been receiving treatment on the leg without any on-court work. ""If it was a playoff game he would play, but he's pretty sore,"" Kerr said. ""We've got two days before our next game so this gives us the chance to really get him healthy and right. ... It's a no-brainer to rest him."" Thompson contributed 15 points, five assists and four rebounds in Golden State's ninth straight victory against the Magic and fifth in a row at Oracle Arena. David West added 11 rebounds and five of the Warriors' 35 assists. ""This is good for us, honestly,"" Livingston said. ""All I know is that we're really, really lucky to have the talent that we do,"" Kerr said. ""We can win games without Steph or KD or Draymond or Klay because we've got a lot of guys and a lot of guys who can really play. It's an incredible roster and we should be able to win games when some of our stars are down. Golden State held the Magic to 19 points in the third while scoring 32 to take control, leading 88-75 going into the final 12 minutes. ""They cause you to do some unique things with your defensive scheme,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""When they switch everything they force you into one-on-one basketball and we took the bait."" GQ COVER Durant was named GQ's ""Champion of the Year"" and shared a cover with quarterback Colin Kaepernick, the magazine's ""Citizen of the Year."" KD credits Kap for ""being courageous."" ""Kaepernick is just a guy who's standing up for what he believes in, standing up for people who don't really have a voice,"" Durant said. ""It was a tremendous honor to be on the cover with him, somebody that his words have started a conversation that's needed in this country. And his actions have started a conversation. It's an honor, it's a blessing and I'm definitely grateful to be on the cover and to be gracing it with some amazing people.""

"LOS ANGELES --  The 76ers had their eyes on the future Monday night, and it certainly looked bright. Their present wasn't too bad, either. Philadelphia has several talented young players and three of them -- center Joel Embiid, forward Robert Covington and guard Ben Simmons -- had it all working in a 109-105 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Embiid put up 32 points and 16 rebounds in a career-high 36 minutes and had his way with Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, a defensive standout. Robert Covington added 31 points, including a key 3-pointer that gave the Sixers the lead for good with 33 seconds remaining. Ben Simmons had 22 points and 12 rebounds. The 23-year-old Embiid and 21-year-old Simmons dominated for much of the night. ""They're two of the best players in the league already,"" Sixers guard JJ Redick said. ""They're both MVP-caliber players. They're fantastic and we're all along for the ride."" The Clippers lost their sixth straight despite getting 31 points off the bench from Lou Williams. Blake Griffin added 29 but failed to score in the fourth quarter, going 0 for 4. Los Angeles rallied from a 14-point deficit to lead by five with 2:11 to play, but the Sixers made all the key plays down the stretch. ""We took bad shots,"" Griffin said. ""I took bad shots. We got stagnant and just didn't trust our offense."" Simmons made all three of his shots for nine points in the fourth quarter and had four rebounds. ""He's a difference-maker,"" said Sixers coach Brett Brown. ""He is a game-changer at a 6-10 point guard position. Some of his passes tonight, some of his finishes tonight, some of his loose balls and 50-50 balls -- he's different. ""The thing I like the most and get excited the most is, he's barely scratched the surface. He has so much more to give and to improve on and knowledge to take in."" Embiid fouled out Jordan and his backup, Willie Reed. The 76ers' big man went to the line 16 times. ""That reflects a mentality way more than a statistic,"" Brown said. ""And his mentality tonight was dominant. ""I think there's more to give, even more dominance."" The Sixers outrebounded Los Angeles 51-34, helping them to overcome 20 turnovers. BAD FUNK After a 4-0 start, the Clippers have lost eight of nine. Asked when the losing streak starts to become a concern, Griffin said: ""With the first one."" Said coach Doc Rivers: ""Every loss concerns me, but I like this team. We just have to get right."" REDICK RETURNS It was the first game back at Staples Center for Redick, where he played the past four seasons for the Clippers. They gave him a video tribute during a timeout in the first quarter. ""I really didn't see it,"" he said. ""We were talking in the huddle. I just tried to stay in the moment. . I'll take a look at it later. It was obviously very touching."" TIP-INS 76ers: Injuries to Markelle Fultz, Jerryd Bayless and Nik Stauskas have made it difficult for Philadelphia to sustain an early rhythm, and players are going to have to get into shape during the season. Said Brown: ""This is not a normal pathway to bring somebody back, but that's the best we can do."" ... Philadelphia also was without Jahlil Okafor (respiratory infection). Clippers: Have also struggled with an abnormal amount of early injuries. Los Angeles continues to play without its starting backcourt (Patrick Beverley, Milos Teodosic) as well as starting forward Danilo Gallinari. Teodosic began the season as the replacement for departed point guard Chris Paul but injured his plantar fascia in the second game and has no specific return date.","400974951"
"NEW YORK --  Kyrie Irving really dislikes having to play in a mask. On the other hand, he loves what comes next: Boston putting its 13-game winning streak on the line against the NBA champions. ""It's definitely an incredible streak we're on, and now comes the whole media frenzy of will the streak end, and what's going to happen on Thursday and the Golden State Warriors coming to Boston,"" Irving said. ""So I'm looking forward to all that hoopla."" Irving returned to the lineup and scored 25 points while wearing the mask, and the Celtics beat the Brooklyn Nets 109-102 on Tuesday night to remain unbeaten since an 0-2 start. Marcus Morris added 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Jayson Tatum scored 19 points for the Celtics, who have the NBA's best record. Golden State is next at 11-3, and Boston got good preparation for the game against a persistent Brooklyn team. ""The way that they converted on us in transition after our mistakes tonight, you can't have that against Golden State. You just get blown out of the gym,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""We just have to play really solid on both ends and do what we do as well as we can and see where we stand."" Irving missed one game with a minor facial fracture after he was hit by teammate Aron Baynes on Friday. He fiddled with the mask frequently, but it didn't seem to affect his play much. He made a jumper with 3:40 left after the Nets had closed within four points and drove for another basket about 35 seconds later. ""Today, just finding his way and doing what he does, making big plays for us, coming through and sealing the game,"" said Celtics center Al Horford, who had 17 points and 11 rebounds. Boston then finally put it away with Jaylen Brown's alley-oop feed to Tatum before Irving hit two free throws to make it 106-96. Joe Harris scored 19 points and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 16 points and nine rebounds for the Nets, who are without leading scorer D'Angelo Russell because of a bruised left knee. Allen Crabbe and Caris LeVert added 15 points apiece. Irving has had to play in a mask before, and he's done it well. He scored a then career-high 41 points in a loss at New York on Dec. 15, 2012, while with Cleveland. But he described it like having foggy blinders, restricting his peripheral vision. The Celtics started 7 of 9 from the field to lead 17-4, but the Nets jumped ahead in the second quarter and countered every time Boston threated to pull away until the final minutes. ""I thought guys competed,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We just have to do it in long stretches."" TIP-INS Celtics: Irving was not announced as a starter when lineups were introduced, even though coach Brad Stevens had said he would start, after an apparent mix-up between the coach and scorer's table. ... The Celtics have won six straight in Brooklyn, where they were cheered loudly and Irving even heard ""MVP! MVP!"" chants. Nets: Atkinson didn't put a timetable on Russell's return, saying he was getting daily updates. ... Rookie center Jarrett Allen returned after missing six games with a strained left foot. NOT THE MAN IN BLACK Even some of Irving's teammates asked him if he would wear the black mask he sported in the 41-point game at Madison Square Garden. Instead, he wore a clear one and said that's lucky for them, because he said the black mask made it so hard to see that passing wasn't much of an option. ""They were like, `The masked man! The black mask!"" Irving said. ""I was like, `I scored that many because I just was looking at the basket."" HOME SWEET HOME It was the Nets' first home game in November, having been on the road out West all month. Brooklyn plays just four home games in November. Three are this week, and the Nets host Portland on Nov. 24 before going back on the road for three straight games. MEXICAN FANS Entertainers Diego Alfaro and Georgina Holguin from Mexico attended the game to help promote the Nets' upcoming games in Mexico City to their home fans. Brooklyn will play Miami and Oklahoma City in December.","400974952"
"HOUSTON --  The Toronto Raptors have struggled to close out games against good teams this season. They solved that Tuesday night, getting 27 points from DeMar DeRozan while holding off the Rockets 129-113 despite a couple late runs by Houston. Just as important, DeRozan thinks he knows the key for Toronto holding leads going forward. ""Liking this feeling,"" he said. ""You've got to love this feeling so you don't got to go out there having too many of them close games that you lost, feeling upset, got to wait until the next game. You've got to want to continue to have this feeling and that should work out everything else."" Toronto led by 12 at halftime and had to repeatedly shut down rally attempts from the Rockets. ""Consistency in this league is a hard thing to grab, and that's what we've got to reach for, grab for each and every night,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. ""If we could bottle tonight, the energy, the toughness, the togetherness we had tonight, it (would be) special."" James Harden had 38 points and made 19 of 19 foul shots for the Rockets, who ended a six-game winning streak. ""We weren't sharp,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Sometimes you let down and it's hard to turn it back on. We tried, we got close in the second half, but we just didn't have enough."" Houston scored six straight points, including three free throws from Harden, to make it 108-103 with about 7 1/2 minutes left. Delon Wright made a free throw for the Raptors soon after that, and OG Anunoby connected for Toronto's first field goal in more than three minutes on a 3-pointer with 6:25 remaining. After Wright's layup, Kyle Lowry stole the ball from Harden, and DeRozan finished on the other end with a dunk to make it 116-103. Harden got Houston going again with a four-point play. The free throw was his 19th, setting a franchise record for most foul shots without a miss in a game. DeRozan and Serge Ibaka had back-to-back dunks after Harden's big play to make it 120-107 with about three minutes left and send many of the home fans toward the exits. Harden had 11 assists and six rebounds. He has scored at least 20 points and had seven or more assists in every game this season. The Raptors scored the first five points of the second half to make it 81-64 and pushed their lead to 19 points midway through the third on Lowry's 3-pointer. Toronto led by 21 before Houston made five straight points, capped by a 3-point play by Tarik Black. That was the start of a nice run for the Rockets, and they used a 9-3 spurt after that to cut the lead to 97-87. Harden made four points in that span, and Eric Gordon capped it with a layup. Houston led by eight points during the first half, but the Raptors used a 45-point second quarter to take a 76-64 edge into halftime. TIP-INS Raptors: Norman Powell sat out after leaving Sunday's game at Boston with a hip pointer. ...  Lowry, a former Rocket, added 19 points and 10 assists. ... Anunoby scored 16 points. Rockets: Nene missed his second straight game with a sprained right foot. ... Harden received a technical after a shot in the first quarter when he complained about the lack of a foul call. ...

"DALLAS --  The hometown kid ensured that San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich would get a milestone victory in Dallas. LaMarcus Aldridge scored a season-high 32 points in his hometown and the Spurs beat the Mavericks 97-91 on Tuesday night. Popovich became the fastest NBA coach to 500 road wins. He got there in 835 away games, 41 fewer than Pat Riley. Those two and Don Nelson are the only coaches to win 500 on the road. Aldridge, a product of Dallas' Seagoville High School, scored eight points during a decisive stretch of the fourth quarter. He's averaging nearly 23 points per game this season while San Antonio has been without starters Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker. ""I think I'm definitely more confident and I'm playing my game more this year,"" Aldridge said. ""I think Pop definitely has tweaked some things where I can be myself more out there and play more confident, and it's working out for us."" Aldridge's coach notices the change in the forward's second year in San Antonio. ""He's been our most consistent player,"" Popovich said. ""His effort level every night has been off the charts. He's been a leader for us, helping the younger guys and new guys understand the system."" Patty Mills added a season-high 19 points for the Spurs. Rookie Dennis Smith Jr. led Dallas with a career-high 27 points, and J.J. Barea and Harrison Barnes had 16 each. The Mavericks are 2-13 for the second straight season and fifth time overall. Just like in a loss to Cleveland on Saturday, the Mavericks cut a double-digit second-half deficit to one point, but couldn't gain the lead. ""Every time we made a mental lapse, they got going,"" Barnes said. ""We know that is what they are going to do here and capitalize every time we made a mistake."" After Dallas got within 62-61 early in the fourth, Mills hit a long 3 and a driving layup, then Aldridge scored eight of his team's next 13 points to put the Spurs up 82-71 with 5:03 to play. Dallas never got closer than four points down the stretch. The Spurs led by 11 during the third quarter, but Barea made back-to-back 3s and fed Salah Mejri an alley-oop pass for a layup as Dallas closed the quarter on a 9-0 run to get within 62-60. Mills scored 13 points in the first six minutes of the second quarter, including three 3s. Aldridge was hit with a technical foul with 3:33 left in the second quarter for shoving the Mavericks' Salah Mejri after a scrap under the Mavericks basket. The Spurs led 44-39 at the break. TIP-INS Spurs: Popovich was asked before the game how he handles the rush of letters and emails responding to his political comments: ""I do read everything and I try to respond. It takes time because there's a lot of letters. The only ones I don't respond to are the ones are so courageous in their negativity that there's no address, just comments. That's hard to respond to. But there are people who disagree and say why, and it's erudite and intelligible and (I say), `Yeah, you've got a point.' Those people deserve to be responded to."" Mavericks: Dallas continues to play without guard Devin Harris, who missed his second straight game with bruised ribs, and Dorian Finney-Smith was also out Tuesday with left quad tendinitis.","400974954"
"ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Hawks didn't need to win by the most lopsided margin in franchise history to boost their spirits. They just needed any win. Dewayne Dedmon scored a career-high 20 points and had 14 rebounds, and the Hawks rode a dominant first half to a 126-80 win over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. Atlanta's 46-point margin of victory was two points better than its previous best. Atlanta took a 141-97 win over Detroit on Feb. 7, 1994, and the St. Louis Hawks beat Baltimore 144-100 on Feb. 12, 1965. For the Hawks (3-12), the margin was just a bonus. ""Right now we have the worst record in the NBA, so any win is a good win and we'll take it,"" said Taurean Prince, who had 14 points. Actually, Dallas (2-13) owned the league's worst record even before the Hawks' win, but that mattered little to Prince. The Hawks, who snapped a four-game losing streak and won for the first time at home, felt like they were looking up at the rest of the league. ""It's a great feeling,"" Dedmon said. ""We have to take this momentum, feed off of it and get ready for the next game."" Dennis Schroder had 21 points and eight assists for Atlanta. The Hawks' poor record only made the rout more painful for the Kings in the matchup of last-place teams. It was the sixth-worst loss in Kings history, their biggest defeat since a 48-point rout by Phoenix on Feb. 2, 2009. ""Forty-six points in the NBA, it's almost like you're laying down,"" said George Hill, who had 12 points. ""You gotta take it, you know? Own up to it. You can't back down from it. We got our butts kicked."" The Kings (3-11) completed a 0-3 trip while falling to 1-8 away from home. ""Losing's one thing but we've got to do a better job of competing,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Atlanta pulled away with two 12-0 runs in the second quarter and took a 64-35 lead into halftime. The Hawks made six 3-pointers in the quarter. Zach Randolph led the Kings with 16 points. Hill was Sacramento's only other scorer in double figures. The Hawks made 50 of 79 (63.3 percent) shots from the field and 16 of their 32 3-point attempts. The rout continued in the final period as back-to-back 3s by Price pushed the lead to 108-65. Rookie John Collins had 14 points. Isaiah Taylor had 12 points, and Marco Belinelli and Malcolm Delaney each had 10 as the Hawks had eight scorers in double figures. Dedmon's 14 rebounds set a season high. TIP-INS Kings: G-F Vince Carter (kidney stone) was inactive for the fourth straight game. ... Sacramento won its first road game at Dallas and has since lost eight straight away from home. ... The Kings were outrebounded 53-29 and had no player with more than four rebounds.

Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said Babbitt also had tightness in his back before the game and the injury is not believed to be serious. HOT START Atlanta made its first eight shots.

"MIAMI --  Everything was going wrong for the Washington Wizards. They were facing their biggest deficit of the night early in the fourth quarter and were showing signs of unraveling. And then John Wall restored order. Wall scored 27 points, Bradley Beal had 26 and the Wizards overcame a dreadful third quarter to beat Miami 102-93 on Wednesday night -- finishing the game on a 29-13 run that started when their point guard returned to the game with 9:47 left. ""It's all about the guys doing a little bit more,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. Wall didn't have a great shooting night -- 9 for 21 -- but he was dazzling. Behind-the-back dribbles to freeze defenders on the way to a layup, tapping the ball through Hassan Whiteside's legs to start a fast break, and getting a chasedown block of Tyler Johnson's dunk try in the final minutes were just some of the entries on Wall's highlight reel. ""We didn't get too rattled,"" Beal said. ""We stayed poised and stayed together as a team."" Markieff Morris scored 15 points and Otto Porter Jr. finished with 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Wizards. Goran Dragic scored 21 points for Miami. Dion Waiters finished with 19, Tyler Johnson had 15 and Hassan Whiteside scored 14 points and grabbed 21 rebounds for the Heat, who were 4-0 against the Wizards last season. Miami led by seven early in the fourth, but lost in large part because of 17 turnovers that led to 26 Washington points. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra wasn't thrilled about free-throw discrepancies -- Beal was 13 for 14 and the Wizards were 29 for 31, while Miami was 16 for 19 -- but insisted afterward that giving the ball away is a bigger problem. ""We can't control officiating and obviously that got to us at the end,"" Spoelstra said. ""That's the way it's always going to be until we earn it. We haven't earned anything yet. But we can control our decisions and responsibility with the ball. That has probably been more damaging than anything in our losses, our inability to take care of the basketball."" Beal put the game away with four free throws with 1:23 left, the first one coming after Johnson got called for a technical and the next three after getting hit by Waiters on a 3-point try. Down by as many as 13 in the first half, the Heat found their defense in the third quarter. Washington missed its first nine shots after intermission, Miami outscored the Wizards 25-10 in the third and the Heat took a 74-71 lead into the final 12 minutes -- only to the game slip away. ""Guys are upset,"" Whiteside said. TIP-INS Wizards: Beal shot 3 for 5 in that rough third quarter for Washington, and his teammates combined to shoot 1 for 14 in those 12 minutes. Porter and Morris were 9 for 11 in the first half, then 0 for 5 in the third. ... Morris fouled out with 5:04 left, then picked up his second technical foul of the quarter for good measure and was ejected as well. Heat: Whiteside had eight rebounds in the first quarter, then eight more rebounds in the third. ... Dragic has at least one 3-pointer in 15 consecutive games, tying the longest streak of his career. ... Miami started 10 for 10 from the line. ... James Johnson's struggles continued, and he was 1 for 5 in 27 minutes. WHITE OUT The Heat announced that forward Okaro White will have surgery Thursday to repair a fractured left foot. White was injured during practice on Tuesday. He's averaging 3.3 points in 13 minutes per game this season. No timetable has been set for his return, but White said he'll need at least 4-6 weeks before he can even put weight on the foot after surgery. WINNING QUARTERS Washington outscored Miami in each of the first two quarters, and that meant the Wizards were 13-1-1 in their last 15 quarters spanning parts of five games. The Heat outscored Washington by 15 in the third quarter.","400974956"
"NEW YORK --  Tim Hardaway Jr. and the New York Knicks expect opponents to bring a little extra at Madison Square Garden. A few nights after a deflating loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Hardaway made sure the Knicks held home court Wednesday night. Hardaway scored 26 points, including a key 3-pointer with 32.9 seconds left, to help the Knicks rally in the second half and beat the Utah Jazz 106-101. The Knicks tightened up on defense in the fourth quarter, unlike when they allowed 40 points in the fourth to the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers in a loss Monday. ""It says a lot, the desire to win, not taking no for an answer, no excuses,"" Hardaway said. ""Fighting through fatigue; fighting through adversity. We knew we were going to get their best shot. Any time a team comes to MSG, they want to show out and do their best."" Kristaps Porzingis scored 22 points, Courtney Lee had 19 and Enes Kanter added 13 for the Knicks. New York looked flat in the second quarter and trailed by 12 late in the third but got its third comeback victory in eight days. Hardaway's 3 made it 102-98, and he added four free throws after that. Over his last eight games, Hardaway is shooting 44.3 percent with 19.6 points a game. He signed a $71 million, four-year deal to return for a second stint with New York this offseason. ""Tim's doing a great job for us. He's one of the guys that can attack the basket for us,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""The way he's playing defense and scrambling and doing that stuff, a big reason why we're winning some of these games."" Rodney Hood scored 30 points off the bench and rookie Donovan Mitchell chipped in 19 for the Jazz, who dropped to 1-2 since losing star center Rudy Gobert for four weeks with a bone bruise in his right leg. Their last victory as a visiting team was April 8 at Golden State. Utah is 6-4 at home. ""I want us to play well and eventually we'll get a road win,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""It's harder to win on the road, especially with a younger team."" The Jazz shot 50 percent to lead 60-50 at halftime, a big start for the league's third-worst offense entering the game. Mitchell, the 13th overall pick in this year's draft, had 17 points in the first half. Mitchell is from Elmsfurd, right near the Knicks training facility in Greenburgh. The Knicks trailed 85-77 after a 3-pointer by Utah's Thabo Sefolosha in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter. After Alec Burks' missed shot, Lee grabbed the rebound and fed Hardaway in the open court for a layup, giving New York a 94-93 advantage with 4:04 left. That was the Knicks' first lead since the first quarter. An offensive foul by Hood led to five straight points from Porzingis, including a 3-pointer with 2:21 to go that put the Knicks ahead 99-93. Joe Ingles answered with a 3-pointer from the corner, and Ricky Rubio hit a jumper that cut it to 99-98 with 1:14 left. On the ensuing possession, Hardaway drove to the basket, but his shot was blocked by Derrick Favors. An alert Frank Ntilikina picked up the ball, setting up Hardaway's game-sealing 3. TIP-INS Jazz: Utah has not shot 50 percent from the field since opening night, when it hit 50.6 percent in a win over Denver. The Jazz managed to make 20 of 40 shots in the first half before cooling off. They finished at 43 percent.","400974957"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers made the plays they needed to extend their dominance of the Charlotte Hornets. The most significant ones came when the Hornets had the ball. ""Our defense was phenomenal,"" said James, who scored 31 points in Cleveland's 115-107 victory Wednesday night. ""We had a great game plan and we were just in tune. We executed it."" Five of the Hornets' 13 turnovers came in the fourth quarter, and Cleveland finally pulled away in a game that was tight for three quarters. ""They showed -- you can say whatever you want -- they're the best team in the East, when they want to (be),"" Hornets guard Nic Batum said. The Cavaliers have won seven straight against the Hornets and 11 of 12. James is 40-6 in the regular season against Charlotte. Kyle Korver's 3-pointer with 1:06 left in the third quarter put the Cavaliers ahead for good at 86-84. They extended the lead to 10 points three times in the fourth quarter, first when James drove into the lane and hit a stepback baseline jumper to make it 105-95. Cleveland's Kevin Love had 22 points and 10 rebounds, Jeff Green added 13, Korver had 11 and J.R. Smith 10. The Cavaliers have won three straight and four of five. The loss was Charlotte's fifth in a row since a five-point win at Milwaukee on Nov. 1. ""It's easy to hang your head and give up when things get hard, but that's not who we are as a team,"" said Hornets center Dwight Howard. ""The guys in this locker room are built better than that."" Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shot 10 of 14 from the field and led Charlotte with a season-high 22 points, three shy of his career best. Point guard Kemba Walker had 20. Batum played his first game of the season after a tearing a ligament in his left elbow last month. He started and scored 16 points in 32 minutes, including seven straight in the second half as the Hornets took a 58-52 lead. Jeremy Lamb added 13 points off the bench. Howard, who entered averaging 14.4 points and 13.1 rebounds, was limited by foul trouble and played just 23 minutes. He finished with eight points and five rebounds and fouled out with 24.5 seconds left. TIP INS: Cavaliers: Derrick Rose (left ankle sprain), Isaiah Thomas (right hip) and Tristan Thompson (left calf strain) did not play. ... James went to the bench with his fourth foul at the 3:31 mark of the third quarter after being called for two charges in less than a minute. Walker drew the first one, Kidd-Gilchrist the second. The Hornets led 82-79 at that juncture. ... James scored in double figures for the 806th straight game. It was his 404th career 30-point game. ... J.R. Smith hit his 1,800th career 3-pointer in the first half. Hornets: Charlotte's Treveon Graham (right quad) and Julyan Stone (strained hamstring) did not play. ... Carolina Panther players Devin Funchess and Thomas Davis and coach Ron Rivera were seated courtside. Former Hornet Muggsy Bogues also was in attendance. JAMES APPROVES James was on the bench when the Cavaliers took the lead for good and re-entered with the Cavaliers leading 95-88 with 8:58 to play. James said it was great feeling to see his teammates be successful. ""When I came back in, I just wanted to try to close it out for them, and I was able to do that,"" said James. ""They were exceptional. My teammates were unbelievable tonight."" ONE-ON-ONE Defensive switches left Howard guarding James on the perimeter numerous times. Howard was asked what goes through his mind in those moments. ""I have three trophies that say defensive player of the year,"" he said. ""So I'm not afraid to guard anybody, no matter if it's the best player in the world or my mom. I treat them the same way."" THROWBACK NIGHT: The Hornets wore their classic teal pinstriped uniforms for the first time in 15 years. The uniforms harken to the original days of the franchise and were worn from 1988 to 1997. The jerseys included blue, purple and green pinstripes, and the shorts included the original Hornets logo at the waist. Charlotte will also wear its classic uniforms in home games against Milwaukee on Dec. 23 and Oklahoma City Jan. 13.","400974958"
"Victor Oladipo receives an inbounds pass and takes it to the other end of the court for a jumper that beats the halftime buzzer. (0:17) MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Darren Collison scored a season-high 30 points, and the Indiana Pacers almost let them go to waste. After stretching their lead to 17 in the fourth quarter, the Pacers held on to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 116-113 on Wednesday night. Indiana could breathe easy only after Marc Gasol's 3-point attempt with 3 seconds left bounced off. Memphis couldn't get off another shot from the ensuing scramble. ""I think we've just got to do a better job of executing in the last five minutes if we want to be better,"" said Collison, who added eight assists. ""I don't know how much of it was them or more of us."" The Pacers seemed in control before Memphis ran off 10 straight points in the fourth. A 3-pointer from Bojan Bogdanovic stopped the string and ran the margin back to 10. From there Memphis chipped away, and a 3-point play from Gasol trimmed the Pacers' lead to 116-113 with 12.4 seconds left. After that, there was drama but no scoring. An out-of-bounds call was reviewed and overturned, giving the Grizzlies the ball with 9.1 seconds left. Gasol, who led Memphis with 35 points and 13 rebounds, missed his 3-point attempt near the top of the key, and Memphis dropped its third straight. ""I actually thought it was good,"" Collison said of Gasol's shot. ""I was preparing to go to overtime. He makes those shots, especially at the top of the key."" Victor Oladipo added 21 points for the Pacers, while Bogdanovic scored 16. Memphis played without starting point guard Mike Conley, who has a sore left Achilles tendon. Despite shooting well at times, Memphis' offense seemed in disarray and committed fifteen turnovers. Memphis coach David Fizdale said poor defense through three quarters put his team in a deep hole. ""The first three quarters, I just had no answers because we just weren't locked in defensively for whatever reason,"" Fizdale said. ""Our defense is plummeting because of our lack of focus and lack of effort."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana's 67 first-half points were the most allowed in a half by Memphis this season. Grizzlies: F JaMychal Green returned to action after missing 12 games for an ankle injury that occurred in the season opener. ... Memphis is winless in four games against the Eastern Conference this season. ... Reserve G Tyreke Evans finished with 18 points, snapping a string of six straight games scoring at least 20 off the bench. TURNER'S BIG BLOCK Grizzlies forward Brandan Wright was headed to the rim for a dunk with about 43 seconds left, but Pacers center Myles Turner blocked the shot. Tyreke Evans got the ball but missed in close, and Turner grabbed the rebound. ""That's a winning play,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. ""That's what I'm talking about as far as defensively getting stops and making plays to give ourselves a chance to win.""","400974959"
"MILWAUKEE --  For only the second time this season, NBA leading scorer Giannis Antetokounmpo did not have the most points in a game for the Milwaukee Bucks. Khris Middleton knew why after he finished with a team-high 27 points and eight assists in a 99-95 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. ""I'm just playing hard,"" Middleton said. ""That's what I've noticed over the first couple of games. I don't think I was playing hard enough. I've talked to some coaches, teammates, KG (Kevin Garnett) also came in, and the common thing that most of the guys were saying was I just need to play harder. And I think it was true. But now I feel like I'm just playing hard and not worrying about everything else and it's working out."" Antetokounmpo added 21 points in Milwaukee's fourth straight victory, and the Bucks blocked 16 shots -- two shy of the team record set in 1980 at Detroit. ""That's the game right there, absolutely,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""That's 16 opportunities you don't even get the ball up on the rim. When you look at the stat sheet, it's really hard to figure out how the game was close. ... It was a frustrating night. We really didn't do anything well. I couldn't find any offense to run to help us."" Recently acquired Eric Bledsoe had 12 points, all in the second half, to help the Bucks halt Detroit's five-game winning streak. The Pistons were led by Avery Bradley's season-high 28 points. Detroit, which shot just 35.3 percent, also got 13 points and 17 rebounds from Andre Drummond. Bledsoe, who missed his first six shots, drilled one from the right wing for a 95-93 lead with 42 seconds to go. ""He had a turnover earlier on a bounce pass to Giannis,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""He felt that everybody was going to run to Giannis on the same play and that he could get that shot. It just shows his maturity and his IQ. Playing for the moment, that was a big shot that helped us win."" Bradley turned the ball over in the right corner after he was double-teamed, and Milwaukee made it 97-93 thanks to two free throws from Bledsoe with 16 seconds remaining. Bradley's basket pulled Detroit to 97-95, but the Bucks regained their four-point advantage on two free throws by Tony Snell with 10 seconds left. Detroit called timeout, only to see Anthony Tolliver commit another turnover on the inbounds play in front of Milwaukee's bench. TIP-INS Pistons: F Stanley Johnson returned after missing the previous three games with a right hip flexor strain but had just two points on two shots in 18 minutes. ... Detroit allowed only four points in the first 7:16 of the second quarter. Bucks: Point guard Matthew Dellavedova missed his first game of the season because of left knee tendinitis, and forward Mirza Teletovic has not played in the last four games due to a sore left knee. REJECTED In the second quarter, Thon Maker swatted away Eric Moreland's shot. Eight seconds later, Antetokounmpo sent Ish Smith's shot into the first row of sideline seats. Smith thought it was goaltending and received a technical foul for complaining. START ME UP Before the game, Van Gundy was asked why his team seems to get off to slow starts. Detroit scored the first eight points against Milwaukee, but the Bucks responded with a 20-6 run. ""Right now, it hasn't developed into a major problem and one that we can't overcome,"" Van Gundy said. ""I'm not giving it undue attention, but it's certainly been true. We haven't jumped on anybody.""","400974960"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Happy birthday, Karl-Anthony Towns. Here's a brand-new win over the San Antonio Spurs. Towns had 26 points and 16 rebounds for Minnesota on the night he turned 22, and the Timberwolves stopped a 12-game losing streak to the Spurs with a 98-86 victory on Wednesday. ""The food will taste better tonight, and the laughter will be even more,"" said Towns, who vowed before the game in a conversation with coach Tom Thibodeau that the Wolves would finally stop their slide against the Spurs. Jeff Teague pitched in 16 points and six assists, and Nemanja Bjelica added 11 points off the bench as the Timberwolves put together one of their most complete performances with their fewest points allowed this season. ""They're good. They're athletic. They're skilled, from top to bottom,"" said Spurs star LaMarcus Aldridge. The Wolves used a 13-3 fast-break scoring advantage to stave off the Spurs despite a minimal contribution from stars Andrew Wiggins and Jimmy Butler, who shot a combined 6 for 24 from the floor. With strong on-the-ball pressure and quick recoveries and rotations on defense, the Wolves held the Spurs in check. Aldridge was in foul trouble after his 32-point game at Dallas the night before, finishing with a quiet 15 points and 10 rebounds. Rudy Gay shot just 3 for 8 off the bench for seven points. Pau Gasol finished with an efficient 13 points, eight rebounds and four assists, but he had trouble keeping Towns away from the rim. ""I couldn't be more proud of everyone, as a collective group. We went out there, we said we needed stops, and we got the stops. Not just one, but multiple,"" Towns said. ""That's just a sign of a team that's getting very far."" With stars Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker yet to play this season, both because of quadriceps injuries, and the Spurs on the second half of a back-to-back set of road games, this was a prime opportunity for the Wolves to finally beat them. Their body language suggested a determination to assert themselves in this long-lopsided series, displayed with a wince of disappointment or a look of agitation after a basket by the Spurs they felt could have been prevented. Even Teague, in his first season with the Wolves, had a 13-game losing streak to the Spurs, dating to his rookie year with Atlanta. The last time the Wolves beat the Spurs was on April 8, 2014. ""If we want to be the team we want to be, we've got to go against them and we've got to go past them in seven games,"" Towns said, alluding to the postseason. The Spurs in that month-ago season opener were the only previous opponent to hold Minnesota under 100 points this season, and the Wolves got off to a wobbly 7-for-26 shooting start before they caught fire. They knocked down 12 straight shots at one point, on their way to outscoring the Spurs 39-19 in the second period. Tyus Jones, part of another quality performance by the second team, assisted on three straight baskets by Towns during one stretch with their two-man game in a groove. ""I thought he made good reads. I thought he made good plays,"" Thibodeau said. ""We're seeing him make more and more plays now, which is a good sign for us."" Teague turned a steal into a 3-pointer for a 51-41 lead, their first double-digit edge of the game, and finished the first half with a runner at the buzzer that rolled off the front rim and in to make it 57-43. ""Guys competed and tried to give ourselves a chance, but I thought we had some key breakdowns at bad times,"" Aldridge said. The Spurs never came closer than five points after the 4 1/2-minute mark of the second quarter. Towns started the fourth period with a 3-pointer for a 78-65 advantage, and he sank another one from the top of the key with 4:17 remaining to push the lead back to double digits at 89-78. ""They're deep. Thibs is obviously great, and they're getting better and better, week by week,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""They're a tough matchup. So you better have all your wits about you, and you better execute well at both ends."" CATCH-22 Towns is in the top 10 in almost every statistical category in NBA history compiled prior to the player's 22nd birthday. He ranked eighth in points, third in rebounds and second in double-doubles (124), trailing only Dwight Howard (169). This was the eighth time in 14 games this season that Towns totaled at least 20 points and 10 rebounds . TIP-INS Spurs: This was a season-low in points and rebounds for the Spurs Timberwolves: Backup center Gorgui Dieng missed his third straight game with a sprained right index finger.","400974961"
"NEW ORLEANS --  The Toronto Raptors were pummeled in the paint and turned the ball over too often. The way DeMar DeRozan and crew were shooting, it didn't matter. DeRozan scored 25 points and the Raptors shot 59 percent from the floor to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 125-116 on Wednesday night. Toronto made 47 percent of its 3-point attempts, and seven Raptors had at least 10 points. Among them were Kyle Lowry with 22, Jonas Valanciunas with 21 and C.J. Miles at 17. ""Coaches are preaching, `When you've got open looks, take them and be aggressive in all the things you do,"" Lowry said. Miles made five 3-pointers and Lowry had four. DeRozan, Serge Ibaka and Fred VanVleet each had two. ""They were hot,"" Pelicans guard Jameer Nelson said. ""We had some breakdowns and they made us pay. On offense we're just as good as anyone, but on defense we have to get better."" DeMarcus Cousins scored 25 points for the Pelicans, and Anthony Davis had 19. New Orleans outscored Toronto 64-42 in the paint and won the turnover battle 21-14 but couldn't slow the Raptors' sharp-shooters. ""Our rotations were bad,"" Cousins said. ""Communication was pretty bad. We let guys that are known shooters get wide open shots, so that's on us. We were a bit limited tonight."" The Raptors won for the fourth time in five games. The Pelicans lost for the second time in their last seven games. Toronto turned a one-point halftime edge into a 98-86 lead after three quarters, boosted by DeRozan's 11 points. Lowry scored on an offensive rebound and Miles made a 3-pointer as Toronto extended the lead to 110-93 early in the fourth. ""I'm being assertive,"" said Miles, who has made 12 of 28 3-pointers in the last four games. ""Guys are looking for me and we're moving the basketball, which is creating openings. If (opponents) are going to give me space I'm going to make them pay."" The Pelicans led by 14 points in the first quarter. Pascal Siakam scored 10 points, all on layups, as Toronto took a 45-42 lead early in the second quarter. Jrue Holiday scored eight points as New Orleans regained the lead before Lowry made a 3-pointer that gave the Raptors a 64-63 halftime advantage.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Things are starting to click for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Russell Westbrook had 21 points and seven assists and the Thunder beat the Chicago Bulls 92-79 on Wednesday night for their third straight victory. Oklahoma City had high hopes coming into the season after trading for All-Stars Carmelo Anthony and Paul George, but the Thunder had lost four straight before getting things turned around to even their record at 7-7. ""From here, we're kind of gaining some momentum,"" George said. ""We're getting consistency from our level of play standpoint. I think we're starting to come together for the most part. Again, we're obviously not where we want to be. There's always going to be a level of improvement, but we're trending in the right direction."" Anthony returned to the lineup after missing the previous game with a sore lower back and finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds. Jerami Grant added 15 points and 11 rebounds. The Thunder led 27-7 at the end of the first quarter to match the fewest points they have allowed in a quarter since the franchise moved from Seattle in 2008. The Bulls made 2 of 16 field goals in the period. ""Just setting the tone,"" Westbrook said. ""Thought we did a good job of being aggressive, using our hands. That's how we win games."" Lauri Markkanen and Antonio Blakeney each scored 16 points for Chicago, and Denzel Valentine added 13. The Bulls shot 34.7 percent from the field. ""We fought from the second quarter on, but again, we're down 20 in the first quarter with a seven-point quarter,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""You're not breeding any confidence for yourselves. So it's a mindset. You've got to come out and see that thing go through the hoop. It's going to give you a little confidence. Right now, we don't have a lot, especially early in games."" The Thunder led 58-34 at halftime. Westbrook didn't score until 6:43 remained in the second quarter, but finished the half with 17 points. ""He does that to a lot of people,"" Hoiberg said. ""He's so explosive. There's a reason he was the MVP last season."" Though the Thunder were never threatened in the second half, they had hoped to finish better. They shot 22 percent after the break. ""In the second half, we never got into a rhythm,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Never played to an identity. I thought our defense, for the most part, was pretty good for the full 48. We had some lapses. But I thought offensively, that's where we got to really move the ball and make them work and find ways to break the defense down better than we did in the third and the fourth."" --- TIP-INS Bulls: Were coming off a 133-94 loss to San Antonio. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Shabazz Napier is clearly comfortable in his role this season. ""I think you just go out there and play with a free mind, and just enjoy it,"" said Portland's reserve guard, who had a season-high 19 points in the Trail Blazers' 99-94 victory over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night. Damian Lillard led the Blazers with 26 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists, but it was Napier who was the difference as Portland went to a three-guard lineup. Napier was 5 for 5 from 3-point range. ""He killed us. Five for five from the 3, played a terrific basketball game,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said about Napier. ""They went smaller than we were. They went small, but we went even smaller."" CJ McCollum added 24 points and Portland finished 4-2 on its six-game homestand. Evan Fournier had 22 points for the Magic, who lost their third straight. Nikola Vucevic had 11 points and 10 rebounds. The Magic trailed by 11 points during the third quarter, but Fournier's 3-pointer put the Magic up 81-80 with 6:52 left in the game. Portland reclaimed the lead on consecutive baskets from Jusuf Nurkic and Maurice Harkless. McCollum's 3-pointer extended the Blazers' lead to 87-83 with 4:30 to go. After Napier's 3-pointer, McCollum added another, and the Blazers led 95-86 with 1:43 left. Orlando couldn't catch up. The Magic were playing the last of a four-game road trip. Orlando went into the game with two straight losses, including 110-100 at Golden State on Monday. The Blazers were coming off a confidence-boosting 99-82 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Monday that snapped a two-game skid. Portland's offense had been stagnant, especially in close games. Blazers coach Terry Stotts tweaked the starting lineup, inserting rookie Caleb Swanigan, who made his second straight start. But after playing just five minutes in the first half, Pat Connaughton started the second and the Blazers found success with three guards. Napier took on the role in the fourth quarter as the Blazers went small. Napier, a first-round pick out of UConn in 2014 who has played for three different teams, averaged 4.1 points and 9.7 minutes last season. In the past four games for the Blazers, he's averaging 12.5 points and more than 20 minutes a game. Orlando was without J.J. Augustin (left hamstring) for the seventh straight game and Jonathan Isaac (right ankle) for the second game. The Magic stretched its lead to 38-26 early in the second quarter on Jonathan Simmons' layup. But the Blazers found their shot and ended the half on a 17-0 run, capped by McCollum's driving layup, to lead 51-47 at the break. McCollum led all scorers at halftime with 16 points. The two teams both scored 24 points in the third quarter, and Portland led 75-51 going into the final period. Shelvin Mack made consecutive baskets to pull the Magic within 79-78. TIP INS: Magic: Fournier has scored in double figures a team-high 14 times this season. ... Simmons went into the game ranked fourth in the NBA for scorers off the bench, averaging 15.1 points. He finished with 16 against the Blazers. ... Vucevic's double-double was his fifth this season. Trail Blazers: Lillard passed Mychal Thompson (9,215 points) for eighth on the team's all-time scoring list. ... Al-Farouq Aminu missed his sixth game with a right ankle injury. MORE SHABAZZ: Napier is just the third Blazer to make five 3-pointers off the bench when making all of his attempts. He's the only reserve to do it in the league this season. UP  NEXT Magic: Returns home to host Utah on Saturday night. Blazers: Visits Sacramento on Friday night.","400974964"
"LOS ANGELES --  In a matchup of teams with rising young stars, Joel Embiid stood out above the rest. The 7-foot center scored a career-high 46 points -- the most by a Philadelphia player in 11 years -- and grabbed 15 rebounds to lead the 76ers past the Los Angeles Lakers 115-109 on Wednesday night. And that was only part of his night. Embiid also had seven assists and seven blocked shots, making him the first NBA player with 40 points, seven assists and seven blocks in a game since Julius Erving did it for the 76ers against Detroit in 1982, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Info. ""Tonight we realized we had Joel Embiid, and he was just dominant,"" said Sixers coach Brett Brown. Philadelphia also got an outstanding game from rookie guard Ben Simmons, who barely missed a triple-double with 18 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. Yet it was Embiid who was simply unstoppable. The Lakers tried three different defenders on him to no avail, but seldom double-teamed him. ""I was just playing basketball and being aggressive, just like I was against the Clippers,"" said Embiid, who played 31 games last season and averaged 20.2 points in his NBA debut. The 23-year-old Embiid, who missed his first two seasons due to injury, set a career high with 16 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers in the same building Sunday, when he had 32 points in a 109-105 victory. ""I love LA,"" Embiid said. ""I love the Staples Center. I wanted to come out here and put on a show."" That he did. Embiid shot 14 for 20 from the field and 16 of 19 at the free throw line Wednesday, giving him the most points by a Sixers player since Allen Iverson scored 46 against Chicago on Nov. 24, 2006. In fact, prior to Embiid's dazzling performance, the previous 35 times someone scored at least 44 for the 76ers it was Iverson, according to ESPN. Brandon Ingram led Los Angeles with 26 points and 11 rebounds. Lakers rookie Kyle Kuzma added a career-best 24 points, and Jordan Clarkson scored 20 off the bench. For the second consecutive game, however, point guard Lonzo Ball spent the entire fourth quarter on the bench. The prized rookie played just 21 minutes, going 1 for 9 from the floor and missing all six 3-point attempts while being completely outplayed by Simmons. Ball finished with two points, five rebounds and two assists. ""Why do I think he had an off night?"" answered Lakers coach Luke Walton. ""I don't know, because he's 20 years old and plays the toughest position in the NBA? Someone else will have an off night tomorrow. Tonight it didn't seem like he had it."" The Lakers have lost four of five. PHILLY IMPRESSED Though almost all the accolades went to Embiid and Simmons, Brown liked what he saw of Ingram and Kuzma. ""I give Kuzma and Ingram a lot of credit,"" he said. ""The Lakers are on a similar path that we were on, trying to identify keepers, trying to identify franchise-type players. And those two guys tonight were excellent. They kept them in the game."" TIP-INS 76ers: Jahlil Okafor, who had been out with a respiratory infection, was available but did not play. ... Brown before the game on the composure displayed by Simmons: ""He really doesn't get rattled. There's a poise internally that's really impressive."" Lakers: Ball entered shooting just 31.3 percent from the field, including 25 percent from 3-point range. The No. 2 pick in this year's draft has a strange jump shot, but Walton said the team has no current plans to change it. ""We're not even talking about changing it during the season. We may not change it at all ever. He's been a good shooter his whole life and he's going to start making shots. That'll come with time,"" Walton said.","400974965"
"BOSTON --  Hours before the Celtics took the court Thursday night to protect their winning streak against the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors, Jaylen Brown was walking around in a fog. Boston's second-year forward was not even thinking about basketball after learning about the sudden death of his childhood best friend, Trevin Steede, on Wednesday night. ""It was tough to kind of accept it,"" Brown said. ""Everybody was kind of in shock."" But after talking to his family and having conversations with Celtics coach Brad Stevens, Brown looked to the basketball court to find solace. The 21-year-old ended up playing one of the best games of his young career. Brown had 22 points and seven rebounds, Kyrie Irving had 11 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, including two free throws that put Boston ahead in the closing seconds, and the Celtics beat the Warriors 92-88 on Thursday night for their 14th straight victory. ""He inspired me to come out and play and I played in his spirit,"" Brown said about Steede. They met after Brown transferred to Joseph Wheeler High School in Marietta, Georgia. ""I remember I didn't have any friends,"" Brown said. ""The first few days I sat at the lunch table by myself -- I'm super quiet and didn't know anybody."" Steede noticed Brown sitting alone one day and told him he could sit with him. ""Ever since then we've been best friends. ... He's been my brother."" Brown said. He said the circumstances of Steede's death are still being determined and he declined further comment out of respect for his family.  After the final buzzer, Irving walked over and embraced Brown. ""Ky gave me the game ball and said, `This one was for Trevin,"" Brown said. Kevin Durant had 24 points for Golden State. The Warriors had won seven in a row. Playing his second game since suffering a facial fracture, Irving shed his protective mask in the second quarter. Then, with the game tied at 88, he was fouled on his layup attempt and calmly made a pair of free throws. Durant then came up empty on his jumper on the other end. Golden State led by as many as 17, but had to lean heavily on its reserves as its trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Durant struggled offensively. Curry, who returned to action after missing a game with a bruised right thigh, was the most ineffective. He was 3 of 14 from the field -- 2 of 9 from the 3-point line -- and had nine points. ""It was just one of those nights,"" Curry said. ""We had control of the game despite how bad we all were shooting. We just didn't sustain ourselves defensively."" Curry sat for a long stretch after picking up his fourth foul early in the third quarter. ""We kind of fell out of our rotation in the third quarter,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""They were just tougher and smarter than we were tonight Boston came in limiting opponents to just 94.5 points per game, the stingiest mark in the NBA this season. It did even better against a Warriors team that entered the night averaging an NBA-best 119.6 points. TIP-INS Warriors: Their 88 points was a season-low. Had seven turnovers in third. Celtics: Horford registered a double-double in consecutive games for the second time this season. He failed to record back-to-back double-doubles at any point last season. QUOTABLE ""I asked our trainer if he can officially play without that and the response was, `Yes, but it's not recommended."" -- Celtics coach Brad Stevens on Irving taking off mask. BIG RUNS The Warriors went without a point from Durant's 20-foot pull-up with 4:49 left in the third quarter until Omri Casspi's floater with 34.5 left tied it at 68 -- a 19-2 Celtics' run. Curry, Durant and Thompson were just 7 of 26 combined from the field in the first half. But the Warriors were able to maintain their lead thanks to 14 fast-break points. Durant was the only one of the three to score during a 12-0 Warriors run late in the second quarter. Boston trailed by just 47-42 at the half, closing the quarter with a 13-2 spurt. HAYWARD'S SUPPORT Celtics guard Gordon Hayward, who has been sidelined since suffering a broken ankle on opening night, was on hand for Thursday's game. He sat behind the Celtics' bench and received a loud ovation from the Garden crowd when he was shown on the jumbotron.","400974966"
"PHOENIX --  James Harden looked up at the halftime totals Thursday night and couldn't believe what he saw, despite how well he and the Houston Rockets had shot the ball. ""I thought there was something wrong with the score,"" he said. There wasn't. Harden scored 23 of his 48 points in the second quarter and the Rockets put up 90 in the first half on the way to a 142-116 rout of the Phoenix Suns. Houston dominated with Chris Paul back in the lineup after he missed 14 games because of a knee injury. The Rockets made 61 percent of their first-half shots to match the second-most points in a first half in NBA history. ""Everybody was psyched up to get Chris back,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Just one of those nights where we played well offensively. ... Chris played really well."" Houston finished 14 points shy of the franchise record for points in a game and improved to 8-1 on the road this season. The Rockets knocked down 21 of 44 3-point attempts, and Harden made all 18 of his free throws. He is 37 for 37 from the foul line over the past two games, an NBA record. Harden, the league's leading scorer, had 33 points at halftime. Houston used a 13-1 run over the final 3:08 of the first quarter to take control and was never threatened after that, leading 45-23 going into the second. Paul, who hadn't played since the season opener, got the start and didn't miss a beat, scoring 11 points and handing out 10 assists in limited action. ""I know I was gassed, especially early, but it was fun to get back out there with the guys,"" he said. D'Antoni said before the game that getting the two stars, Harden and Paul, in sync will ""take care of itself over the next week or so."" D'Antoni planned to play Paul for 20 minutes -- the point guard got 21 minutes of action and sat out most of the fourth quarter. ""The 20-minute restriction, first and foremost, I hate it,"" Paul said, ""but I know they're trying to protect me."" Ryan Anderson added 24 points for the Rockets, who have won seven of eight. The Suns also shot well in the first half, getting 65 points before the break. They got the lead down to 14 with one of Troy Daniels' six 3-pointers in the second quarter, but the Rockets repeatedly scored with ease at the other end. Daniels tied a Suns record for 3s in a quarter and led Phoenix with 23 points. Devin Booker added 18 points and 10 assists. ""I felt like it was a good experience for us to see what a high-caliber team looks like up close and personal,"" Booker said. ""But we were on the wrong end of that."" The Suns have lost seven of eight. FABULOUS FIRSTS The Denver Nuggets scored 90 points in the first half of a game against San Antonio on Nov. 7, 1990. Three days later, they gave up 107 in the first half against Phoenix, the most ever. FAN INTERACTION As the first half came to a close, a fan yelled at D'Antoni from the stands. ""Sit down Mike, you're up 40!"" D'Antoni, a former Suns coach, turned and deadpanned, ""It's 25. You can't count."" MONROE DEBUTS Phoenix center Greg Monroe made his Suns debut, starting and playing 26 minutes. Monroe, acquired from Milwaukee in the trade for guard Eric Bledsoe on Nov. 7, was dealing with a left calf strain when he arrived. Monroe finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds. He played amid speculation that he could be traded or have his contract bought out. ""The only guy in our lineup with four years of experience, and he just knows how to play the game and lets the game come to him,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  With a huge deficit to make up, the Indiana Pacers started letting it fly from long range. Reserve guard Lance Stephenson scored all 13 of his points in the fourth quarter, including a key 3-pointer in the final few minutes, and the Pacers rallied from 22 down to defeat the Detroit Pistons 107-100 on Friday night. The shot clock was about to expire when Stephenson launched from well beyond the arc to give Indiana a 101-97 lead with 2:03 remaining. ""He was huge for us,"" Pacers leading scorer Victor Oladipo said. ""He was everywhere."" It was one of six 3s the Pacers made in seven fourth-quarter attempts as Indiana outscored Detroit 36-19 over the final 12 minutes. ""I just wanted to win so bad,"" Stephenson said. The Pistons (10-5) led 78-56 in the third after a 20-2 run and were still ahead by 10 entering the final period. ""We didn't play well down the stretch,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""The whole game turned in the last 18 minutes."" The Pacers (8-8) have won six consecutive home games against the Pistons. ""We're a resilient group,"" said Oladipo, who scored 21 points. ""We've got to continue to build on it."" Pistons guards Reggie Jackson and Avery Bradley had 16 points apiece. TIP-INS Pistons: Off to their best start since opening 12-2 in 2005-06. Only seven teams in franchise history have started 10-3 or better. ... Detroit is 7-1 at home and 3-4 on the road. ... Bradley averaged 24 points in the previous three games. Pacers: C Myles Turner has scored in double figures in six of eight games since returning from the NBA's concussion protocol. ... Point guard Darren Collison ranks fourth in the league with a 4.5 assists-per-turnover ratio. ... Oladipo has scored 20 or more points in 12 of 16 games. RELYING ON 3 The Pistons have hit a franchise-record 12 or more 3-pointers in six consecutive games, including 14 on Friday. They've reached double digits in 3s in 10 of 15 games overall and are 6-4 in those games. MOVE OVER, RODMAN Pistons center Andre Drummond, the NBA's leading rebounder at 15.8 per game, is the first player to grab at least 200 rebounds in the first 13 games of two different seasons since Dennis Rodman did it three times for three different teams in the 1990s: the Pistons in 1992-93, the San Antonio Spurs in 1993-94 and the Chicago Bulls in 1996-97. Drummond, who reached 200 rebounds in his 13th game this season, needed just 11 games to eclipse that total in 2015-16.","400974968"
"WASHINGTON --  For all the good Erik Spoelstra saw from his Miami Heat at the defensive end -- building a 25-point edge, holding the Washington Wizards to 29 for a half, shutting out a hobbling John Wall until there were 5 1/2 minutes left in the game -- they still barely held on for a victory. ""It was pretty harrowing,"" the coach said. The Heat let their lead dwindle all the way down to one before holding on for a 91-88 victory over the Wizards on Friday night, led by Hassan Whiteside's 22 points and 16 rebounds and one very key 3-pointer with under a minute to go from an ill Dion Waiters. ""We probably won't be one of those teams that's scoring 130, 140 when you look at the scores at night,"" Spoelstra said, ""but we can be a team that can make it very tough on you defensively."" James Johnson scored 20 points for Miami, and Waiters had 13, most importantly the late shot from behind the arc that made it 89-83. ""You know what time it is around that time. You know I want them shots,"" said Waiters, who explained that he needed IV fluids before the game. ""When you've got all the trust in the world from your teammates it makes the shot easier. Make or miss, you got to live with it."" That was how Washington's Bradley Beal felt. He answered Waiters with a 3 of his own, then had a chance to win the game or tie it, holding the ball as Washington trailed 90-88 in the closing seconds. Beal appeared to have an open 3, but he instead took a 17-footer that missed. ""Still debating in my head if I should have shot the 3 or if I should have went to my step-back or whatever,"" said Beal, who finished with 26 points and 10 rebounds. ""I will have another opportunity to be able to be in that situation again,"" Beal added. ""It will be a different result."" The Wizards entered with a four-game winning streak, including a victory at Miami on Wednesday night. But they go as Wall goes, and the All-Star point guard wound up with only eight points on 3-for-12 shooting. He said his left knee was sore, and he was limping in the locker room afterward. Wall wasn't 100 percent certain he'll be able to play in Washington's next game. ""I could barely move out there. I couldn't get the team going,"" Wall said. ""That kind of hurt us."" Overall, the Wizards made 38.1 percent of their field-goal attempts. Still, the hosts got within 89-88 on a pair of free throws by Otto Porter Jr. Johnson then made one foul shot with 6.5 seconds left. After Beal's miss, Miami tacked on a free throw. Washington entered Friday averaging 110.7 points, fourth-best in the 30-team NBA, but this one was different right from the get-go. The Heat led 26-17 after the first quarter, when Washington made only 6 of 20 field-goal attempts, including 0 for 6 on 3s. The go-go attack steered by Wall was outscored 9-0 by Miami on fast breaks in that period, when Wall, Beal and Porter combined to shoot 0 for 8. In contrast, that trio provided 65 points and 24 rebounds in Washington's victory at Miami the other night. This time, Wall said of the Heat, ""They slapped us in the face in the first half."" TIP-INS Heat: Spoelstra pulled F Justise Winslow just a minute into the game after the man he was guarding, Markieff Morris, scored two quick baskets. Wizards: Still have not defeated the same opponent in consecutive games in nearly four full years; the last time was Dec. 28-30, 2013, against the Detroit Pistons. WAITERS' NIGHT Other than his important 3, Waiters shot only 3 for 12, including 2 for 7 from beyond the arc. He said there was a 50-50 chance he wasn't going to play, but ""I had to keep my big boy pants on and tough it out.""","400974969"
"NEW YORK --  With D'Angelo Russell sidelined indefinitely after knee surgery, Spencer Dinwiddie stepped up for the Brooklyn Nets. Dinwiddie scored a career-high 25 points hours after Russell's operation, and the Nets beat the Utah Jazz 118-107 on Friday night. ""I think as a starter, and as a point guard in my position, you try to lead,"" Dinwiddie said. ""I didn't do anything different because of the surgery. I'd like to think that we won for him though, because our hearts go out to him as our teammate and our brother."" Allen Crabbe had 18 points and DeMarre Carroll added 17 for the Nets, who snapped a two-game losing streak. The starting point guard role now belongs to Dinwiddie after Russell was hurt during Brooklyn's recent road trip. He had successful arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Friday with no timetable for a return. Raul Neto scored 22 points and Rodney Hood had 17 points for the Jazz, who have lost seven of eight games. ""It's obviously tough right now,"" Jazz forward Joe Ingles said. ""We're missing some pretty big pieces of our team. It's frustrating. No one is out there not trying. It's just frustrating. We've just got to stick together."" Utah cut the deficit to 89-80 entering the fourth quarter, but couldn't draw closer. ""I think we showed great resiliency in that moment because sometimes young teams, teams that are `not as good' fold in those situations under good defensive teams like Utah,"" Dinwiddie said. Brooklyn took a 73-51 lead in the third quarter. The 22-point lead was the largest for Brooklyn at any point this season. Dinwiddie led Brooklyn with 13 points at the half as the Nets took a 65-49 lead into the locker room. Brooklyn's 65 points marked the team's highest scoring first half of the season. Rookie Donovan Mitchell led Utah with 10 points at the half. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell made his first start at the point guard position this season. ... Ricky Rubio (sore right Achilles), Thabo Sefolosha (sore right knee), Joe Johnson (right wrist tendon instability), Rudy Gobert (right tibia contusion) and Dante Exum (left shoulder surgery) were out. Nets: General manager Sean Marks expects Russell to return this season and Marks said he will probably apply for a disabled player exception with Jeremy Lin out for the season. Lin ruptured his right patella tendon in the season opener. STRONG START Brooklyn scored 39 points in the first quarter, its most in any quarter this season.","400974970"
"CLEVELAND --  LeBron James knows about the narrative bouncing around the NBA that Cleveland can be dethroned in the East. He's ignoring it, and slowly changing it. ""You know I could care less what people say,"" James said. ""I'm so far beyond that. I don't care what people say."" Just to make sure everyone understood him, James asked his two sons waiting for him in Cleveland's locker room to chime in on whether he was concerned about outside voices. The boys had dad's back. James had another of those games that he only seems capable of, scoring 39 points with 14 rebounds in 46 minutes as the Cavaliers continued to improve from a shaky start with their fourth straight win, 118-113 in overtime on Friday night over the skidding Los Angeles Clippers, who dropped their seventh in a row. Kevin Love scored 25 and drained a pair of 3-pointers in OT, when the Cavs, who didn't take the lead until the first minute of the extra session, outscored the Clippers 13-8. Dwyane Wade gave Cleveland a huge spark, scoring 23 points with 11 rebounds in 37 minutes. The Cavs' win wasn't eye-pleasing, but it was another step in the right direction for the three-time defending conference champions, who went 3-1 on a just-completed road trip. On Thursday night, James said he watched Boston beat Golden State to improve to 14-2, a stunning start that has prompted discussion about Cleveland's vulnerability. James dismissed any concern about the Celtics' early burst. ""I've got too much to worry about around here right now trying to get our ship going in the right direction,"" he said. The Clippers' ship is taking on water fast. Los Angeles has lost nine of 10 since a 4-0 start. Blake Griffin scored 23 and DeAndre Jordan had 20 points and 22 rebounds for Los Angeles, which didn't give up the lead until the first minute of overtime. The Clippers had chances to put the Cavs away in regulation, but they didn't execute down the stretch and then had defensive breakdowns in overtime. ""They made some big 3s,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""You have to give them credit. That's why they've been in a lot of Finals."" The Cavs spent all night chasing the Clippers and caught them at 105-all when Love grabbed an offensive rebound and fed James, who dropped an uncontested 3-pointer with 47 seconds left. Griffin missed tough shots on consecutive possessions, giving Cleveland one last chance in regulation but James missed an off-balance left-hander just before the horn. James made a free throw to open OT -- he went 1 of 5 at the line -- and give Cleveland its first lead. Then, after Love made his two 3s, James sealed the Cavs' fifth win in six games with a jumper. ""Well defended,"" Rivers said. ""It's LeBron James."" TIP-INS Clippers: Jordan made his first eight shots, three on dunks. ... G Patrick Beverely (sore right knee) missed his fourth straight game.  ... Rivers is ""amazed"" by James, who just over a month shy of his 33rd birthday, hasn't slowed physically. ""Most players when they get to his age are smart enough now they see everything,"" he said. ""But usually when they get to that age, they're too old to do anything about it. He has both going for him. He can beat you with his brain. He can beat you with his power. It's a daunting task when you watch him on film.""

Down 10 points, Cleveland chipped away and despite some defensive lapses, the Cavs somehow tied the Clippers 56-all at halftime. Wade scored 17 in the quarter, 11 on free throws, as he was able to draw fouls with drives and extra-effort plays. ""He continues to play the same way and that's what you need from vets and future Hall of Famers,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Guys like that who understand the game and when it gets tough, don't panic and continue to play the same way.""","400974971"
"TORONTO -- The New York Knicks let a poor shooting performance contribute to a dismal defensive effort. It all added up to their eighth consecutive loss to the Toronto Raptors. Kyle Lowry matched his season high with 22 points and added 10 assists, DeMar DeRozan also scored 22 and the short-handed Raptors beat New York 107-84 on Friday night. New York's Kristaps Porzingis shot 3 for 13 while Tim Hardaway Jr. finished 5 for 11. The Knicks went 30 for 92 overall, their lowest field goal percentage of the season. ""It was us missing a lot of good shots,"" Porzingis said. ""Just not in our rhythm. As the game went on, we still were struggling finding our rhythm and finding the best positions to attack from. It was just a rough night for us."" Hardaway and Porzingis each scored 13 points and Enes Kanter had 12 for the Knicks, who fell behind by double-digits in a poor-shooting first half and couldn't recover. ""We let our offense affect us on the defensive end,"" Kanter said. ""We're not going to shoot the ball well every night, but it can't affect us defensively."" DeRozan scored 16 in the second half and Lowry finished with eight rebounds as Toronto won its third straight and improved to 5-1 at home. ""Those guys are great players,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said of Lowry and DeRozan. ""When they're rolling and they're going, all of a sudden the other guys get open looks."" Toronto played without two injured starters in forward Serge Ibaka (swollen left knee) and guard Norman Powell (right hip). Reserve guard Delon Wright (dislocated right shoulder) also was unavailable. C.J. Miles scored 14 points for Toronto. Pressed into the starting lineup, second-year forward Pascal Siakam scored 13 points and rookie forward OG Anunoby had 11. Raptors coach Dwane Casey was pleased with his team's defense, especially Siakam's effort on Porzingis. ""I thought he did as good a job as you can do against Porzingis, who is a very dynamic offensive player,"" Casey said. Porzingis agreed that Siakam had presented challenges for him. ""He's long and he was able to stab at the ball pretty good when I was playing in the post,"" Porzingis said. ""He did a really good job of that."" Jarrett Jack made all three of his shots in the first but the rest of the Knicks endured a difficult quarter, making just three of 23 attempts. Porzingis went 0 for 6 in the opening quarter and Hardaway missed a dunk. Lowry and Anunoby each scored seven points for the Raptors, who led 30-18 after one. Lowry had nine points and three assists in the second as Toronto led 54-36 at halftime.

""It's been amazing, man,"" Holiday said. ""I'm just thankful and blessed to be able to have a child that's healthy and still have this job at the end of the day. I'm good."" Holiday finished two points shy of his career high, helping the Bulls pick up a rare win on a night when Walker simply dazzled for the Hornets. The 2017 All-Star nearly matched his personal best of 52 points but missed a driving layup with Charlotte trailing by one in the closing seconds. Lauri Markkanen then hit two free throws to make it 123-120 with 2.6 seconds left, securing the Bulls' third win in 13 games this season. Charlotte has dropped six straight. ""I feel bad for Coach (Steve Clifford),"" Walker said. ""He's constantly taking the blame for a lot of our losses and it has nothing to do with him, man. He's doing the best job he can to put us in position to win games with his schemes and stuff. We're just messing everything up. It's bad. And you know, it starts with me. I have to be better defensively as well. I have to find a way to get my teammates going defensively and find a way for us to put together a full 48-minute game. It's been a while since we've done that."" Last in the NBA in scoring and field goal percentage, Chicago shot 52 percent and hit 17 of 34 3-pointers. Holiday and Denzel Valentine, who had 18 points, each sank four from long range. Kris Dunn scored a career-high 22, Markkanen added 16 and the Bulls came out on top after a tense finish. ""For the team, it does a lot,"" Dunn said. ""If we keep going out there playing hard together, keep building that chemistry ... I think we're going to carry it on to the next game."" LAST CHANCE Charlotte's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist rebounded a missed shot by Chicago's Robin Lopez with about 10 seconds left. After a timeout, Walker beat Dunn off a pick and got by Cristiano Felicio only to miss a driving layup as a rotating Markkanen bothered the shot . ""I just missed,"" Walker said. ""Had a good look. Kind of lost the ball a little bit. But I mean, I got what I wanted, just came up short."" SUPER RESPONSE Call that a super response from Superman. Dwight Howard had an emphatic answer in the first quarter when a fan near the baseline yelled, ""Dwight Howard, you (stink)!"" He dunked, turned and winked at the guy. TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum had nine points in 27 minutes after scoring 16 over 32 minutes in his season debut against Cleveland on Wednesday night. Batum missed the first 13 games because of a torn ligament in his left elbow. Clifford wanted to hold Batum to about 28 minutes in this one after he carried a heavier load than anticipated against the Cavaliers. ... Howard had 11 points and nine rebounds. ... Marvin Williams scored 13. Bulls: Coach Fred Hoiberg on Houston scoring 90 points in the first half against Phoenix on Thursday: ""I'd pray to get 90 in a game."" ... C David Nwaba (sprained right ankle) missed his fifth consecutive game. He participated in the shootaround and the Bulls hope to have him practice on Saturday. ... Markkanen led the Bulls with seven rebounds. ... Holiday also had three steals.","400974973"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Thunder don't believe they blew another big lead, the Spurs simply took it away. LaMarcus Aldridge had 26 points and San Antonio overcame a 23-point deficit to beat Oklahoma City 104-101 on Friday night. ""The team showed a lot of heart, lot of character by not giving up,"" Spurs center Pau Gasol said. ""By not just saying we're down by 20 and it's one of those nights."" Danny Green added 17 points and Gasol had 14 points to help San Antonio end Oklahoma City's three-game winning streak. The Thunder were outscored 89-69 in the final three quarters after holding the Spurs to a season-low 15 points in the opening period. ""I knew they were going to make a run, but I really didn't feel like it was because we got comfortable, we got relaxed,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""These guys have been around for a long time, they're on the road, they know it's going to be a challenge."" The Thunder have blown several double-digit leads this season, including an 18-point advantage against Boston in a 101-94 home loss Nov. 3. Aldridge put back of Green's missed 3-pointer gave the Spurs a 102-99 lead with 24.2 seconds remaining. The Thunder missed two 3-pointers on the ensuing possession, but Carmelo Anthony tracked down a second offensive rebound and made a 25-footer with his foot on the 3-point line to cut the lead to 102-101. Gasol made two free throws, and Russell Westbrook stumbled to the court and threw up an airball on a 3-point attempt as the game ended. ""We gave ourselves a chance,"" Donovan said. ""That last situation was tough just from the standpoint, 2.3 (seconds) and everybody knows we're taking a 3."" Anthony had 20 points to lead the Thunder. Westbrook was held to 15 points after scoring 10 in the opening period. He was 5 for 22 from the field. ""They just played faster and they just did a good job of getting themselves back in the game,"" Westbrook said. The Spurs rallied behind their usual formula of hounding defense and 3-point shooting. Davis Bertans hit three consecutive 3-pointers in the third quarter, tying it at 78 with 38 seconds remaining with his final 3 of the run. The 3-pointer also closed a 58-35 run after the Spurs trailed 43-20. ""It was a fine win,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""The guys really dug deep. Pounding the rock. Kept a great attitude, just kept their minds on playing basic basketball and things turned their way."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City entered the game leading the league in steals (10.4) and opponent turnovers (19.0). The Spurs had 13 turnovers, most coming in the first quarter. The Thunder have never finished in the top five in either category since leaving Seattle. ... Westbrook, Anthony and George have split game-high scoring honors throughout the season. George has led six times and Westbrook and Anthony have done so on five occasions each. ... Nick Collison did not play for the 14th time this season. The 15-year veteran played five minutes in his only appearance of the season. Spurs: Kawhi Leonard, who has not played this season, remained out with right quadriceps tendinopathy. There is no timeline on his return. ... Tony Parker worked out with Spurs shooting guru Chip Engelland during morning workouts as he rehabilitates from quadriceps surgery. ... Kyle Anderson stayed in the lineup after getting hit in the jaw while battling for a rebound under the Thunder's basket with three minutes remaining in the game. ... San Antonio's previous low in the opening quarter was 17 points at Dallas on Nov. 14. SIMPLE Westbrook had a quick response when asked what the Thunder must do to avoid giving up big leads. ""Just play the same way (for) 48 minutes,"" he said. ALDRIDGE REBOUNDING Aldridge continued his resurgent season after being the subject of trade talks in the offseason following two disappointing seasons with the Spurs. The 12-year veteran has become San Antonio's top scorer and primary leader with Leonard and Parker sidelined. ""LaMarcus is showing great competitiveness and great heart and great leadership this season,"" Gasol said. ""I just love what I'm seeing from him. He's not just settling for jumpers. He's just going after balls, going after rebounds, making key plays on both ends of the floor."" NO PITY PARTY The Spurs have played the entire season without two of their leading players in Leonard and Parker, but they are not hanging their heads about it. ""Pop doesn't let you feel sorry for yourself,"" Aldridge said. ""It's about playing hard out there and playing smart.""","400974974"
"DALLAS --  Cross another Texas losing streak off the list for the surging Minnesota Timberwolves. Jimmy Butler led a balanced set of starters with 21 points and the Timberwolves ended a five-game skid in Dallas with a 111-87 victory over the Mavericks on Friday night. Andrew Wiggins added 19 points for the Timberwolves. They won in Dallas for the first time since March 19, 2014, two nights after getting their first win over San Antonio since just about the same time -- April 8, 2014. The losing streak against the Spurs was 12 games. Northwest Division-leading Minnesota rallied from 14 points down early in the third quarter, outscoring lowly Dallas 68-32 in the second half to win for the eighth time in 10 games. Naturally, Butler was asked what the halftime message was from coach Tom Thibodeau. ""You want it quote for quote?"" Butler asked, before relaying some of the expletive-laden speech. ""For the most part, we already knew what we had to do,"" said Butler, who was 3 of 5 from 3-point range and had eight rebounds. ""He came in here and he let us have it a little bit, but when we go out and play with energy like we're supposed to, we'll win."" The Mavericks allowed a season-low 43 points in the first half, but then had a season low in scoring for a half themselves after halftime. The 68 points allowed in the second half matched a season high for Dallas. Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 18 points, but had just three after halftime as Dallas shot 31 percent in the second half in falling to an NBA-worst 2-14. Dirk Nowitzki, the 39-year-old in his 20th season for Dallas, had 15 points while being joined in the starting lineup by another native of Wurzburg, Germany, in Maxi Kleber. The 25-year-old rookie went scoreless in his first start. The Timberwolves got back in the game in the third quarter with a 27-6 run capped by a four-point play from Butler for a 70-63 lead after he was fouled on a 3-pointer by Wesley Matthews. ""I need to look at the film and see what happened in the third,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We just can't allow that to happen. I know we are stronger than that."" A 23-2 run in the fourth quarter put the game out of reach as Karl Anthony-Towns and Taj Gibson had matching double-doubles -- 15 points and 11 rebounds for Towns, 10 points and 11 rebounds for Gibson. Jeff Teague, the other starter, had 15 points and 10 assists. The Mavericks held the Timberwolves to 32 percent shooting while taking a 55-43 halftime lead. But Minnesota made 11 of its first 13 shots in the second half and shot 63 percent after halftime. TIP-INS Timberwolves: On the same night that Wiggins (22) became the eighth-youngest NBA player to reach 5,000 career points Wednesday against San Antonio, Jamal Crawford (37) became the fourth-oldest player to appear in a game for Minnesota. ... Crawford was the sixth double-figure scorer against the Mavericks with 12. ... The Wolves have shot more free throws than the opponent in all 15 games. They were 20 of 23 to 15 of 17 for Dallas. Mavericks: Signed guard/forward Antonius Cleveland to a two-way contract. Cleveland played for Golden State's G League team, averaging 14.2 points. He made his NBA debut in the final seconds of the third quarter, preventing Wiggins from getting the final shot. ... The Mavericks waived G Gian Clavell. ... G Devin Harris returned after missing two games with bruised ribs. ... Nowitzki passed Hakeem Olajuwon for eighth on the career field goals list when he hit No. 10,750 in the first half. QUOTABLE THIBS Thibodeau's version of his halftime message started with one word: ""Try."" But he did elaborate. ""The biggest adjustment wasn't schematic. It was bringing the right intensity to the game. We got energy into our defense, which led to energy into our offense."" BOUNCING BACK Wiggins was coming off a poor shooting night against the Spurs and was 2 of 8 before halftime against the Mavericks. But the fourth-year guard made 5 of 7 in the second half, scoring 13 of his points. He was 2 of 3 from 3-point range. STRUGGLING DALLAS GUARDS Rookie Dennis Smith Jr. and Matthews had eight points apiece while making just six of 23 from the field (26 percent). They combined for just two points after halftime on 1-of-10 shooting with four assists and three turnovers. The 19-year-old Smith had a solid first half but opened the second half with a couple of ill-advised drives when the Timberwolves were on their run to take the lead.","400974975"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Willie Cauley-Stein was very comfortable coming off the bench for the first time this season. Sacramento's 7-foot center was just as happy playing out of position, too. Maybe coach Dave Joerger is onto something. Cauley-Stein scored 13 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter while playing power forward in Joerger's new-look lineup, and the Kings bounced back from an embarrassing loss earlier in the week to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 86-82 on Friday night. ""Coming off the bench and playing the 4 is good for me, playing in space and not being so claustrophobic in the lane all the time,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""I'm starting to unlock something in the game that I've been working on for a long time, the drive-and-kicks, getting in space and shooting jumpers now that the spacing on the floor is right."" Cauley-Stein had started every game at center for Sacramento this season before Joerger shuffled his lineup and put veteran Zach Randolph in. That didn't seem to bother Cauley-Stein, who came on strong at the end. He scored 10 of the Kings' first 12 points in the fourth, including a pair of alley-oop dunks -- the first coming when Frank Mason got tangled up and found Cauley-Stein cutting down the lane. ""Getting those easy buckets is key just to get in a rhythm,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""Everything else kind of goes from there."" Portland stayed close and pulled to 82-80 on a pair of free throws from C.J. McCollum, but De'Aaron Fox's 3-pointer helped Sacramento hold on. The teams play again Saturday in Portland. ""At the end of the day, I'm happy we have them tomorrow,"" Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic said. ""We're going to show them what we have."" George Hill and Garrett Temple added 14 points apiece, and Kosta Koufos had 10 points and seven rebounds to help the Kings to their third straight home win over a team with legitimate playoff hopes. Neither team managed more than 23 points in any of the first three quarters, and the Kings didn't secure the victory until Cauley-Stein made one of two free throws with 3.4 seconds remaining. ""We were playing against one of the top two or three rebounding teams in the league and we did a great job hustling down and coming down to get rebounds,"" Joerger said. ""All 11 guys who played got a defensive rebound, which is what we needed."" Damian Lillard had 29 points on 9-of-25 shooting and four assists but missed a 3-pointer in the final moments for Portland. McCollum added 19 points. Two days after losing by 46 points in Atlanta, the Kings held off the Blazers with one of their best defensive efforts of the season. Portland committed 18 turnovers and set a season low in scoring. ""They played with desperation defensively, they were aggressive (and) we didn't handle that very well,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""It's hard to win a game shooting 37 percent. There are a lot of areas we could have played better, offensively and defensively."" The Kings led by eight early in the second before Lillard brought the Blazers back within 42-41 at halftime. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: McCollum made at least three 3-pointers in each of his previous six games -- the longest streak of his career -- but went 0 for 4 from beyond the arc against Sacramento. ... Portland shot 34.6 percent (8 of 20) in the first quarter. Kings: Sacramento won for the second time in the last 10 games against Portland. . Buddy Hield limped off the court midway through the fourth with a sprained right ankle and did not return. ... Vince Carter (kidney stone) remains sidelined. TWIN TOWERS Part of Joerger's plan had Cauley-Stein and fellow 7-footer Koufos on the floor together. That made it tough on Portland's big men and kept Lillard and McCollum from getting to the basket freely. ""Crazy defensive lineup right there,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""That second lineup is key for us coming off the bench with that energy. That defensive effort was big-time."" SHUT OUT Portland failed to score a single fast-break point to the chagrin of Stotts. ""We didn't push it as much,"" he said. ""I guess that's part of our identity, that we're not a fast-break team.""","400974976"
"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets followed their worst offensive performance of the season with one that will certainly be hard to top. Jamal Murray scored 31 points and the Nuggets had the NBA's highest-scoring game of the season in a 146-114 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. Denver surpassed the 142 points Houston scored against Phoenix just one night earlier for the highest total in the league this season. It was also Denver's most points in a regulation game since it had 168 in a win over the Seattle SuperSonics in March of 2008. ""If we're moving the ball like that and everybody touches it -- and we're cutting, moving and finding the open guy and making shots -- we could do that every night,"" said Murray, whose team looked far different from its 99-82 loss to Portland on Monday. Nikola Jokic added 13 points and 11 rebounds for his eighth double-double of the season as the Nuggets improved to 7-2 at the Pepsi Center. Gary Harris had 22 points in his return after a two-game absence with right shoulder soreness. Anthony Davis had 17 points and five rebounds for New Orleans before he left the game with a concussion in the opening minute of the third quarter. Davis was inadvertently hit in the face by Jokic's head as the Nuggets center was backing him down with the ball. ""I don't want (anybody) to get injured because of me,"" Jokic said. ""I hope he's good. I didn't do it on purpose."" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry couldn't provide any details of Davis' injury after the game. ""I don't know yet,"" Gentry said. ""I have to check with doctors."" The Pelicans trailed by as many as 27 points in the opening quarter but pulled within 66-58 on Davis' jumper seconds before he went down with the injury. The Nuggets took advantage of the Pelicans without their All-Star big man and outscored them 40-22 the rest of the way in the third. Emmanuel Mudiay's 3-pointer before the buzzer made it 106-80. ""You just got to keep playing no matter who's in there,"" Pelicans guard E'Twaun Moore said. ""AD here or not here, (DeMarcus Cousins), anybody. We've got to keep playing. Today we didn't and that's something we've got to work on."" Denver hit nine consecutive shots to jump out to a 25-4 lead. Three of its starters were in double figures by the end of the quarter: Murray had 11 points while Harris and Paul Millsap each had 10. The Pelicans answered, outscoring Denver 48-29 in the final 14:19 of the half. Rajon Rondo raced the length of the court for a layup at the buzzer to pull New Orleans within eight. TIP-INS Pelicans: Cousins had 14 points, while Rondo and G Jrue Holiday each had 13. Moore had 16 off the bench. ... Rondo made his second consecutive start of the season after returning from surgery to repair a core muscle injury earlier in the week. ... G Tony Allen missed his fourth straight game with soreness in his left knee. Nuggets: C Mason Plumlee (core strain) was cleared to play after undergoing an MRI earlier in the day. ... Millsap had 20 points and Mudiay had 19. ... Denver Broncos linebackers Von Miller and Brandon Marshall sat courtside. QUOTABLE Gentry was candid about his team's performance after the game. ""It sucked. It sucked. That's my thoughts on the game. We didn't do anything right, and everything was terrible, coaching included. It was an embarrassment. We embarrassed our franchise, and that includes everyone."" 3-POINT HAVEN Eight players hit at least one 3 as the Nuggets finished 18 of 35 from outside the arc. ""If you have a shot, shoot it. If you got a pass, make that pass,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""When we're moving the ball like that, we're generating shots. Now the challenge is to make shots and we made 18 out of 35 3s. ""Great offense, great ball movement.""","400974977"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Phoenix Suns weren't about to go down for the third time without a fight against the Los Angeles Lakers. Devin Booker hit six 3-pointers while scoring 33 points, and the Suns beat the Lakers for the first time in three meetings this season, 122-113 on Friday night. Tyler Ulis scored 16 points for the Suns, and the diminutive point guard also got into an aggressive shoving match with Lakers guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope near the Phoenix bench with 3:17 to play. Ulis, Caldwell-Pope and Suns rookie Josh Jackson were given technical fouls following the fracas. According to Ulis, the Suns' strong effort was all about payback for two previous losses to the Lakers in the past month. ""We understand that those were two games that we definitely should have had, definitely should have won,"" Ulis said. ""You know we wanted to come out tonight and prove that we should have won both of those games and win the next matchup as well."" These two young teams have had extracurricular altercations in each of their meetings this season. After this one, the Suns calmed down and pushed on to avenge their home loss to the Lakers on Monday. ""We've played three times in such a short amount of time, and it's like the same idea behind a playoff series,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""By Game 3, 4, 5, it starts to get chippy."" Jackson eagerly rushed in to confront Caldwell-Pope, while Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball created yet another immediate viral online sensation when he walked away from the drama. ""It's the NBA. People ain't really going to fight,"" Ball said. ""I ain't trying to get no tech."" Alex Len had 17 points and 18 rebounds for the Suns, who won for just the second time in eight games. Phoenix bounced back impressively after giving up 142 points in a home loss to Houston one night earlier. ""After dropping the first two games, we knew we were going in with a must-win mentality, that we want to punch first and win,"" Booker said. ""I think we did that."" Rookie forward Kyle Kuzma scored 28 of his career-high 30 points in the second half for the Lakers, who committed 20 turnovers while losing for the fifth time in six games. Brook Lopez had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Los Angeles. Ball had a quiet six points, six assists and six rebounds in 38 minutes. ""Just a lack of focus,"" Ball said of the Lakers' effort. ""We probably came in complacent. We beat them twice, so we thought it was going to be easier, I guess."" TIP-INS Suns: Big man Dragan Bender celebrated his 20th birthday with 10 points and five rebounds. ... Greg Monroe had six points and one rebound in his second appearance with the Suns. ... Big man Tyson Chandler missed his second straight game with a respiratory illness. Lakers: Larry Nance Jr. has been cleared to return to practice earlier than expected. The forward broke his left hand Nov. 2 and was expected to be sidelined four to six weeks. ... Kuzma's sixth 20-point game is the most among NBA rookies. BIG GAME BOOK Booker scored 36 points in the Suns' home loss to the Lakers on Monday, and he kept up his history of torrid performances against LA. Perhaps motivated by a verbal altercation near the Lakers' bench in Phoenix four days earlier, Booker hit all six of his 3-pointers in the first half at Staples Center. ""With Devin playing the way he is, getting another 30, you have to pay attention to him, and it creates space for everyone else,"" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. ""Seems like some of our guys really stepped up and made tough shots when they had to, or got to the free throw line."" KUUUUZ Kuzma, who also had 10 rebounds, set a new career high in points for the second straight game with a dynamite second half. The rookie from the University of Utah became the first Lakers rookie to get 30 points and 10 rebounds in a game since Magic Johnson did it in 1980. STRONGER START One night after giving up 90 points in the first half to Houston, the Suns yielded a measly 53 first-half points to the Lakers while jumping out to a 12-point lead. Booker nailed two 3-pointers in the final 14 seconds, with Ball's first field goal on a layup sandwiched between them.","400974978"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker exhaled loudly as he pulled up a chair and sat down in front of his locker. ""We really needed that win,"" Walker said. Walker had 26 points, Dwight Howard added 16 points and 16 rebounds and the Charlotte Hornets snapped a six-game losing streak with a 102-87 victory over the struggling Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night. Walker, who was coming off a 47-point performance in a loss to the Chicago Bulls on Friday night, was 8 of 17 from the field and 6 of 9 from 3-point range despite a sprained wrist. He has made 11 of 17 3-pointers over the past two games. He said he's finally regaining his stroke. ""I have been struggling to start the season with shooting the 3, but I am trying to stay positive and confident in my shot,"" Walker said. ""I just want to continue to be consistent."" Jeremy Lamb added 17 points for Charlotte. Meanwhile, the misery continues for the Clippers, who've lost eight straight games. Lou Williams had 25 points, and Blake Griffin added 19, but the Clippers seemed to run out of gas in the fourth quarter on the second night of a back-to-back. ""I thought we were a little worn down tonight to be honest with you,"" said Clippers point guard Austin Rivers. ""Our effort could've been better but guys were just tired."" Coach Doc Rivers said the Clippers are still trying to find their identity. The Hornets led 73-71 entering the fourth quarter, but limited the Clippers to 6-of-20 shooting in the fourth quarter while forcing five turnovers. The Hornets began to pull away midway through the fourth quarter. Walker extended the lead to eight when knocked down a 3-pointer from the left wing with 3 minutes to play. TIP INS Clippers: DeAndre Jordan had 10 points and 14 rebounds. ... Shot 8 of 29 from 3-point range. Hornets: Jeremy Lamb left the game with a right hamstring strain. ... Only had one turnover in the first half. BEVERLY EXPECTED BACK: Austin Rivers said he's hoping that getting Patrick Beverly back for the team's next game will give a shot in the arm to a team in need of one. ""It will help because it's another guard in there, but we'll figure it out. We're about 15 games in now, so we've got to get this going."" CHECKING IT OUT: After committing a foul in the second quarter against Jordan, an unhappy Howard grabbed a television monitor located underneath the basket in hands waiting for the replay. Displeased with the call, Howard shook his head and returned to the court to line up for Jordan's foul shots. Howard had a funny moment earlier in the game when he accounted for Charlotte's only first half turnover when he inadvertently passed the ball to a wide open coach Steve Clifford. Clifford didn't seem to be expecting the rock. CARTER-WILLIAMS PLAYS MORE: Michael Carter-Williams returned after not playing in the last two games and logged 14 minutes. That came at the expense of rookie Malik Monk, who did not play. ""We've been waiting for him to get his conditioning up and get up to speed on everything,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""You lose six in a row, the defense has been bad -- and it's not Malik's fault -- it's just that's his position and you could see tonight he's a difference maker defensively, that's his strength. We've struggled with ball pressure."" Monk could see more time in Lamb can't play against the Timberwolves.","400974979"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Rodney Hood doesn't care whether he starts or comes off the bench. He just wants to play. Hood scored 31 points, Derrick Favors had 25 points and 11 rebounds and the Utah Jazz routed the Orlando Magic 125-85 on Saturday night. The 25-year-old Hood was 12 for 21 from the field in his highest-scoring game of the season. He has made 10 starts in 15 games, but he gave Utah a big lift while coming off the bench against Orlando. ""I just like playing,"" said Hood, who had a career-high seven 3-pointers. ""I'm just playing within the flow and just having fun right now."" The Jazz had lost three in a row and seven of eight. It was their first road win of the season. Hood had 19 straight points for Utah over one stretch that went from the end of the third through early in the fourth. ""I felt good,"" he said of his scoring spree. ""I got an easy one for the layup and my teammates were just finding me and I was able to get shots to go down. ""I give a lot of credit to my teammates setting screens and finding me. It was a team effort."" Aaron Gordon had 18 points and nine rebounds for Orlando, and Terrence Ross finished with 12 points. The 40-point margin matched the Magic's worst home loss in team history. Orlando has dropped four in a row and six of eight. After a strong start to the season, the Magic have been hurt by poor spacing, lack of rhythm and subpar defensive play -- the same issues they dealt with last year. ""Just played our worst game of the season,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""They played desperate, they hadn't won a game on the road yet and they played a terrific game. We did not."" Orlando shot 39 percent from the field, compared to 48 percent for Utah. The Magic also had only 13 assists on 31 baskets, while the Jazz finished with 31 assists. Utah coach Quin Snyder didn't want to make too much of his team's first road win, but he also recognized the potential significance of the performance. ""We haven't won on the road and that's the reality of what's going on,"" he said. ""In spite of that reality we have to keep talking about getting better. We're going to lose another game, but that can't be, from this group, what defines them. It's how we play and the way we play."" Utah has struggled with injuries during the early part of the season, but starting point guard Ricky Rubio and forward Thabo Sefolosha returned after missing Friday's 118-107 loss to Brooklyn. Rubio was out with a sore Achilles, and Sefolosha was sidelined by a sore right knee. The Jazz took advantage of the Magic's lack of ball movement and poor defensive play to jump out to a 63-48 lead at halftime. Favors had 17 points on 7-of-7 shooting in the first half. Hood had 10 points at the break. TIP-INS Jazz: Joe Johnson (right wrist tendon instability), Rudy Gobert (right tibia contusion) and Dante Exum (left shoulder surgery) were out. ... The Jazz went 9 for 9 at the free-throw line in the first half. Magic: Backup point guard D.J. Augustin returned after missing the previous seven games with a left hamstring injury. ...

"ATLANTA --  Kyrie Irving appreciates what he calls ""the innocence of the game"" during Boston's 15-game winning streak. In his first season with the Celtics after demanding a trade from Cleveland, Irving is enjoying the torrid start because everything feels so new. ""Most of us have never been on a winning streak like this,"" he said. ""I don't know if we even know how to pay attention to all the hoopla that goes on in terms of the excitement of it. I just think that every single game we take it as a challenge."" Irving scored 30 points, Jaylen Brown added a career-high 27 and the Celtics beat the Atlanta Hawks 110-99 on Saturday night. At 15-2, Boston leads the NBA and has matched the best start in franchise history through 17 games. The winning streak is the club's fifth-longest, four behind the 2008-09 team that set the franchise mark. Dennis Schroder had 23 points, and Kent Bazemore added 19 for Atlanta. The Hawks are an Eastern Conference-worst 3-13, but they still had plenty of adrenaline following a 46-point victory over Sacramento -- the biggest in franchise history -- two nights ago. ""I still feel like we can make some big things happen this season,"" Schroder said. ""We just have to stay together as a team."" The Celtics erased a 16-point deficit to take their first lead on Brown's 3-pointer midway through the third. It marked Boston's fourth win when trailing by at least 16 during the streak. It's been a tough week for Brown, a 21-year-old whose best friend Trevin Steede passed away this week in metro Atlanta. Brown and Streede went to Wheeler High School together in nearby Marietta. He spoke publicly about Steede a couple of days ago and skipped talking to reporters after beating the Hawks. ""He's not alone,"" Irving said. ""That's the spirit in the truest form. (Brown) may not say much but he knows we're all here for him."" Irving, playing with a protective mask to protect a minor facial fracture, ended the game with a right-handed finger-roll layup, delighting a few thousand Boston fans who were chanting ""MVP! MVP!"" in the fourth quarter. In 31 minutes, Irving made 10 of 12 shots, including five 3-pointers, and hit all five of his free throws. Irving, frustrated that the mask was affecting his peripheral vision two nights ago, took it off to help Boston beat defending NBA champion Golden State by four points. He scored 16 points, but was just 4 for 16 from the field. ""I could see just a little bit more of the crowd tonight,"" Irving said. ""The eye holes were a little bit bigger. The basket looked a little bit better. I was told to kind of keep it on, so it was a better fit."" The Celtics lead NBA in scoring defense, but they gave up 35 points in the first quarter and trailed by 15 entering the second. ""I think the biggest thing is that we can't keep digging these holes,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""We need to put an emphasis on playing with pace and getting the ball to the other side of the floor."" Atlanta used a 16-0 run in the first to take a 15-point lead. But fueled by Marcus Smart and other reserves, Boston pulled within four twice in the second and cut the lead to six in the closing minutes on Brown's 3. Marcus Morris and Jayson Tatum each had 14 points for Boston. John Collins scored 18 and Taurean Prince added 14 for Atlanta TIP-INS Celtics: Tatum was scoreless until he stole the ball and dunked to cut the lead to four in the third. The 19-year-old former Duke standout followed with an acrobatic, one-handed dunk on a fast break to make it 75-72 and had another dunk to put Boston up 78-77 near the end of the period. Tatum had all 14 of his points in the third. Hawks: Prince is developing into a solid option on offense, spinning for a layup against Shane Larkin and floating a soft assist on Collins' dunk that put Atlanta up 84-82. But Prince has a substandard reputation as a defender, and coach Mike Budenholzer gave him an earful after calling timeout in the third. Prince had just missed an assignment that left Brown open to hit the big 3 from the left corner.","400974981"
"PHILADELPHIA --  A 22-point halftime deficit was no big deal for the defending NBA champions. Stephen Curry scored 35 points, Kevin Durant had 27 and the Golden State Warriors rallied for a 124-116 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. ""We take everybody's best shot every night but they fight and fortunately we turned it around,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Joel Embiid scored 21 points and Ben Simmons had 23 points and 12 assists for Philadelphia, which led 47-28 after one quarter and 74-52 at the half. But the Warriors erased that large deficit with a furious rally in the third quarter. Curry's 3-pointer got them within one point. He then made a pair of free throws to give Golden State a 90-89 lead. The two-time NBA MVP hit another 3 and Draymond Green blew past a defender for a dunk to make it 99-89 going into the fourth. ""I was extremely aggressive in the first quarter, just didn't make the shots,"" Curry said. ""We were more calculated in the third quarter."" A raucous, sellout crowd that chanted ""Trust the Process"" most of the night went silent while the Warriors put on a shooting clinic in the second half. Even veteran David West came off the bench and made big shots in the fourth quarter to give the Warriors distance. He finished with 14 points. Klay Thompson had 16. ""We weren't locked in, we weren't focused in the first half,"" Kerr said. ""It took the embarrassment of being blown off the floor to get us going."" Embiid was coming off a career-best performance -- 46 points, 15 rebounds, seven blocks, seven assists -- in a 115-109 win at the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday. It looked as if he was on his way to another monster game in the first quarter. Embiid embraced the frenzied fans and slapped hands with a guy sitting courtside after a dunk. But the Warriors showed why they're the best by stifling Philadelphia in the second half to improve to 12-4. The Sixers, who lost 135-114 at Golden State one week ago, fell to 8-7. ""We have to play for 48 minutes,"" Embiid said. Playing his first game since receiving a lucrative contract extension, Robert Covington had 20 points for Philly. Back home for the first time following a five-game road trip to the West Coast, the Sixers showed no jet lag in the first half. They jumped ahead 15-4 following a 3-pointer by Embiid. Covington stripped Durant and hit a 3 to make it 37-18, electrifying the crowd. Durant's dunk off Green's alley-oop pass got the Warriors within 70-51 late in the second. But Embiid finished off the half with a dunk that sent the Sixers into the locker room up 74-52. ""We have to focus, we have to take care of the ball and handle our defensive assignments,"" Simmons said. TIME-OUT TIMES TWO Kerr called a pair of timeouts minutes apart in the first half. The second one came after the play he designed wasn't run the way he drew it up. Curry took the blame for that one. ""I forgot the play,"" he said. ""Four dribbles in, I didn't know what I was supposed to do with the ball."" RESPECT THE PROCESS Embiid, Simmons and the rest of the young Sixers left an impression on the Warriors. ""They're gonna be a load coming up for years,"" Durant said. ""You're seeing a team that you should start following."" Kerr praised Philadelphia's dynamic 1-2 punch. ""Embiid and Simmons are different,"" he said. ""You don't see that anymore. Simmons is incredibly gifted. The two of them together are difficult to cover."" TIP-INS Warriors: The 47 points allowed in the first quarter was their most given up in any quarter since Portland had 48 in the fourth quarter of a game on Nov. 14, 1992. 76ers: J.J. Redick scored 20 points, and Dario Saric had 13 points and 10 rebounds.","400974982"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Chris Paul is back, and the Houston Rockets are rolling. James Harden scored 29 points, Clint Capela had 17 points and 13 rebounds and the Rockets beat the Memphis Grizzlies 105-83 on Saturday night for their eighth win in nine games. Paul added 17 points and six assists in his second game since returning from a left knee injury. Paul and Harden combined for 10-of-19 shooting from beyond the arc, and the Rockets were 18 for 43 from 3-point range overall. ""We've got everybody healthy now,"" Harden said. ""We're more versatile and more active."" Memphis played without point guard Mike Conley, who missed his second game with left Achilles tenderness. Brandan Wright left in the second quarter with a right groin injury. The Grizzlies have dropped four in a row, and Marc Gasol called their play ""embarrassing and sad."" ""There's no consistency,"" said Gasol, who had 15 points. ""It's going to be really hard to win consistently. You might win games every now and then, you might even stay at .500, but that's not enough. That's not what we built here for 10 years. That's not it. That's not what we stood for."" Chandler Parsons led Memphis with 17 points on 7-for-9 shooting, and JaMychal Green also scored 15. Houston (13-4) was in control the entire game. Memphis led only once, by one point in the first quarter. The Rockets used their normal 3-point shooting prowess to build an 18-point lead in the first half. Houston went 11 of 24 from long range in the half. Memphis pulled within two late in the second quarter, but Houston led 59-50 at the break. The Rockets continued to pull away after halftime, limiting the Grizzlies to just 33 points in the last two quarters. ""We all know that the only way we're going to go far in the playoffs is defensively,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""You've got to be a bear. Tonight, we were.""

SEE YOU NEXT YEAR The Rockets and Grizzlies split their four-game season series. They have split the season series the last five years. FRUSTRATION Gasol spent a good amount of time after the game explaining his feelings about the Grizzlies' play. He said it took him 20 minutes to gather his thoughts before addressing the media. ""The only thing I can say is (I) apologize because that's not what our fans are used to seeing,"" he said. ""We've got to figure it out, and the only way I know to do that is working.""","400974983"
"DALLAS --  The Dallas Mavericks' first win in a couple weeks was quite a relief for Wesley Matthews and company. Matthews scored a season-high 22 points, and the Mavericks stopped a four-game slide with a 111-79 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday night. ""It rejuvenates you,"" Matthews said. ""Everybody feels good. Aches don't hurt as much, you just feel better about everything you've done. You don't need moral victories, you've got the real one and you can actually see everything we're trying to bring together."" Matthews also had eight assists while helping Dallas (3-14) to its first win since Nov. 7 at Washington. He had six of the Mavericks' franchise record-tying 19 3-pointers. ""We were playing basketball, and one of the hardest things to guard is random movement,"" he said. ""That's when I'm at my best, when we're just playing and stay in a rhythm."" J.J. Barea had 20 points for the Mavericks, and Harrison Barnes finished with 18. Yogi Ferrell had 16 points and Dwight Powell grabbed 13 rebounds. Milwaukee had won four in a row. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24 points and 17 rebounds for the Bucks (8-7), and Khris Middleton added 23 points. It was Milwaukee's first loss since it acquired Eric Bledsoe in a trade with the Phoenix Suns on Nov. 7. ""I think the ball was just stuck,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""The ball got sticky and we were afraid to let go of it to a teammate."" The Mavericks never trailed after Matthews' 3-pointer made it 22-20 with 3:07 left in the first quarter. Dallas went 19 for 38 from beyond the arc, including a shot clock-beating 3 from near midcourt by Barea that made it 88-64 in the fourth quarter. ""I had to shoot that one,"" Barea said. ""You don't see a lot of those."" Kidd said his team should have been ready for the 3-point barrage. ""Coming into the game we had talked about how they are second in the league in attempts,"" Kidd said. ""They just haven't made them. But tonight they made up for all those misses."" Milwaukee went 6 of 25 from 3-point range. TERRY RETURNS Jason Terry played the final couple minutes for Milwaukee and got a standing ovation from the crowd. The 40-year-old Terry played for Dallas from 2004 to 2012 and helped the Mavs win the NBA title in 2011. Terry scored on his only field-goal attempt, leading to a large roar from the crowd. ""I knew he was gonna score,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""I was gonna clap, I wasn't sure how appropriate that was.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  It didn't take the Portland Trail Blazers long to lose the bad taste of a road loss to Sacramento. C.J. McCollum scored 25 points, Damian Lillard had 22 and the Trail Blazers handed the Kings their ninth consecutive road loss, 102-90 on Saturday night. Portland, which lost 86-82 at Sacramento on Friday night, turned it around by improving at the offensive end. The Blazers shot a season-high 54 percent (38 of 70) from the floor, a significant improvement over their 38 percent performance the previous night. Blazers coach Terry Stotts said he sensed things were headed in a better direction at the outset, when Portland had assists on its first five baskets. ""I liked our demeanor. After being disappointed last night and struggling with the offense, I liked the way we set the tone,"" Stotts said. ""To come back and have this type of game was encouraging."" To Lillard, the combination of a fresh loss to Sacramento and an upcoming five-game road trip, this was as close as it gets to a regular-season must win in the NBA. ""It was a great win for us. After a tough loss last night on the road we knew that we had to have this one,"" Lillard said. McCollum hit four 3-pointers and shot 9 of 16, while Lillard had six assists. Portland's Jusuf Nurkic, bouncing back from a season-low four-point performance Friday, had 14 points and seven rebounds. Meyers Leonard, in his second game back after missing four weeks with a right ankle injury, hit three 3-pointers and had a season-high 11 points for the Blazers. Shabazz Napier also had 11 on 5-of-6 shooting. Stotts thought the Blazers' roster contributed to the uptick in offensive performance. ""C.J., he shot the ball better. I thought it was good by everybody. I thought Damian did a good job managing the game. . Our bench, they struggled last night and they were the difference tonight,"" Stotts said. Meanwhile, the Kings struggled from the floor, making just 38 percent (34 of 89) of their shots. ""I thought it was a good offensive night, but more importantly, it was another really good defensive night,"" Lillard said. Willie Cauley-Stein had 18 points and nine rebounds to lead Sacramento, and Zach Randolph had 17. Sacramento coach Dave Joerger felt the Kings didn't come up short in effort despite the loss. ""I'm really, really proud of our team because last night was an emotional game for us,"" Joerger said. Neither team had a significant advantage for most of the first half. But Portland, trailing 33-32 midway through the second quarter, finished the half by hitting four 3-pointers during a 21-8 run to grab a 53-41 lead at the break. ""We had a little bit of a fight on our hands at the start of the game. They had a lot of confidence,"" Lillard said. Portland widened its lead to 22 points during the third quarter. During a nine-minute stretch, only Randolph scored for the Kings. Lillard scored nine points that fueled an 11-3 run as Portland took a 78-56 lead late in the third quarter. Sacramento never got closer than 12 points the rest of the game. TIP-INS Kings: Buddy Hield, who sprained his ankle in Friday's game against the Blazers, did not make the trip to Portland. ... Vince Carter (kidney stones) missed his sixth consecutive game. ... Randolph, scoreless against Portland on Friday, scored the Kings first four points Saturday. ....

"MIAMI --  Myles Turner made almost every shot he took in Indiana's biggest win of the season, and even got a chance for a brief postgame chat with actor Matthew McConaughey. Everything went great for the Pacers. Everything went wrong for the Miami Heat. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 26 points, Turner added 25 on 11 of 14 shooting and the Pacers embarrassed the Heat in the second half on the way to a 120-95 rout Sunday night. ""We moved the ball and guys were knocking down shots,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. He made it sound so easy. What awaits the Heat at practice Monday is going to be very difficult. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had no answers and would have probably preferred no questions after the game, making it very clear that what went on Sunday -- and has gone on from time to time this season -- is going to end. ""One way or another, we're going to get down to the bottom of it,"" Spoelstra said. ""I need to look at the film, assess and find some solutions. I don't have answers right now for why we give up 120 points and have an uninspiring play. ... We'll find a solution. We'll find a way to play Miami Heat basketball, one way or another."" Heat players offered similar sentiment. ""It sucks,"" center Hassan Whiteside said. ""Terrible game, from the first minute to the last,"" point guard Goran Dragic said. ""Embarrassing performance by us,"" said shooting guard Wayne Ellington, who led Miami with 21 points on seven 3-pointers. Turner made 11 of 14 shots for the Pacers, who won their third straight game overall and got their first win in Miami since Nov. 12, 2014. Each of the last 11 regular-season games in the series were won by the home team, until the Pacers emphatically changed that in this one. ""I definitely haven't won here before,"" said Turner, who played in four previous games in Miami -- all losses. ""Maybe it's the weather."" Victor Oladipo scored 15, Darren Collison had 12 points and 10 assists and Thaddeus Young added 12 for Indiana. The Pacers outscored Miami 69-40 in the game's final 25 minutes and shot 60 percent for the game. ""We needed to come out and have a great start at the beginning of the second half,"" Oladipo said. ""We did a good job of that."" Whiteside and Josh Richardson each scored 15 and James Johnson added 10 for the Heat. Dion Waiters was scoreless for Miami, missing all 10 of his shots. Miami's starters were outscored by Indiana's 90-44 --  a huge disappointment on the heels of a road win in Washington two nights earlier. ""Look, I don't have an answer to our unreliability right now,"" Spoelstra said. TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana improved to 18-37 all-time in regular-season games at Miami. Home teams always have a huge edge in this series; the Pacers are 44-9 in regular season games against the Heat in Indianapolis. ... This was the start of the fifth back-to-back for Indiana this season, and the Pacers now have a chance for their second sweep. ... Indiana led by as many as 30, its largest lead of the season. Heat: Udonis Haslem played the final 3:26, his first appearance of the season -- and officially making him a 15-year member of the Heat. ... The shooting woes weren't exclusive to Waiters. Dragic and James Johnson were both 3 for 8. BEST AND WORST The 25-point margin was Indiana's largest win of the season (previous best being 23 at Minnesota on Oct. 24), and the biggest Miami loss of the season (previous worst being 17 twice, most recently at Golden State on Nov. 6). SCHEDULING QUIRK Both of Indiana's trips to Miami this season are now out of the way. In a weird quirk, six of the last seven Pacers-Heat games have been played in Miami. The Heat go to Indianapolis on Jan. 10 and March 25.","400974986"
"NEW YORK --  Stephen Curry knew he needed to start aggressively to make up for the absence of Kevin Durant. Then the Warriors had to finish the job without Curry after foul trouble ended his best game of the season. Curry had season highs with 39 points and 11 rebounds, and Golden State held on after he fouled out to beat the Brooklyn Nets 118-111 on Sunday night. Curry also had seven assists but committed seven turnovers and his last two fouls came on charging calls. ""Obviously, he was brilliant I mean in terms of his scoring and shot-making but I thought in the second half he got a little wild,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""He kind of had his way out there for a while and he got so excited that he probably went over the top and started making some mistakes."" A night after erasing a 22-point halftime deficit in Philadelphia, the Warriors built a 22-point cushion after two quarters behind 22 points from Curry. Playing without Durant, they led by 28 in the third quarter but Brooklyn cut it all the way to four after Curry picked up his sixth foul with three minutes remaining. Klay Thompson then scored seven of his 23 points in the final two minutes. ""You like to see those guys out there,"" Draymond Green said of Durant and Curry. ""But obviously we have other guys that can step up."" Durant was out with a sprained left ankle, giving him extra rest before Golden State wraps up its four-game trip at Oklahoma City on Wednesday night in his former home arena. Omri Casspi started in his place and had 12 points and eight rebounds. The Warriors trailed 74-52 at halftime in Philadelphia on Saturday before scoring 47 points in the third quarter and winning 124-116. Curry appeared determined to get Golden State going quickly in Durant's absence, scoring 13 points while playing all 12 minutes in the first quarter. ""For sure,"" Curry said. ""It's 25, 26 points that are missing and you've got to try to put pressure on the defense to kind of honor your scoring threat and open up the floor for everyone else."" Allen Crabbe scored 25 points, and Spencer Dinwiddie had 21 points and eight assists for the Nets. ""I thought we were taken by the moment a little bit,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""You know, these guys play a lot of big games, but I felt like were frozen for some reason."" It was 64-42 at halftime and the Warriors extended the lead to 28 in the third, though the Nets cut that in half by period's end, scoring 42 points to trim it to 98-84. TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said center Zaza Pachulia's two sons are serving as the Warriors' ball boys during their trip. ""Zaza told me last night that after losing in Boston and then we were down 20 at halftime last night, he said if we didn't win this game he was going to FedEx his kids back to the Bay Area,"" Kerr said. ""So I'm glad we won so he didn't have the stuff the kids into a FedEx box."" Nets: Atkinson said the Warriors' offense might be the best of all time. ""Think about Steve's Kerr kind of background,"" Atkinson said, ""playing for Phil Jackson and playing in the Spurs system and then obviously with the Suns as the GM he was with (Mike) D'Antoni and it's kind of like he's got all areas covered."" ... Trevor Booker started at center but played just nine minutes because of a sprained left ankle. TALKING TRUMP'S TWEET Kerr, who has been critical of President Donald Trump, on Trump's tweet that should have left LiAngelo Ball and two other UCLA basketball players accused of shoplifting in China in jail, after LaVar Ball minimized Trump's involvement in comments to ESPN. ""Two people seeking attention and they're both getting it, so I'm sure both guys are really happy,"" Kerr said. ""You know what would help? If all of you just stopped covering both of them. Is that possible? You could probably stop covering LaVar. I don't think you can stop covering the president. I don't think that will work."" ROUGH ROAD The Nets opened November with five road games in the West, returned to Brooklyn for a three-game stint that featured Boston and Golden State, the NBA's two top teams, and now go back on the road to face Cleveland, where they have lost eight in a row.

DeRozan scored 33 points, C.J. Miles had 12 and the Raptors beat the Wizards 100-91 on Sunday to avenge their only home loss of the season. ""That man is one of the best players in the NBA,"" teammate Kyle Lowry said about DeRozan. ""It don't matter if he shoots threes or not, he's still going to get you buckets. That's what he does, he's a natural bucket-getter."" Among DeRozan's 15 field goals were two 3-pointers, one shy of his season high. He also had eight rebounds and six assists. Toronto shot 10 for 39 from 3-point range. their fourth-lowest percentage of the season. They went a season-worst 5 for 24 in a Nov. 5 loss to Washington, their only home defeat of the season. ""You're going to have nights where some of them look ugly and you're going to have to win ugly,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""That's where DeMar's game comes in.

The Wizards lost their second straight following a season-best four-game winning streak. Otto Porter Jr. scored 15 points for the Wizards. Beal scored 23 points in the first half but made just two of eight attempts in the second half. ""They were aggressive,"" Beal said. ""They put Kyle on me to, I guess, kind of face-guard me. He didn't help, he was running next to me up and down the floor. He didn't leave my side."" A 3 by Porter made it 95-90 with 1:29 left but VanVleet answered with a 3 for the Raptors.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Detroit got a bit of everything down the stretch. A gutty performance from Andre Drummond after hurting his elbow. A tough shot from Reggie Jackson over Karl-Anthony Towns. Two big free throws from Tobias Harris. But Stan Van Gundy knew his Pistons needed just a tiny bit more to outlast Minnesota on Sunday night. ""You've still got to get lucky,"" the coach said. That luck came in the closing seconds when Jimmy Butler missed the third of three free throws and a 3-point attempt as time expired, and the Pistons escaped Minnesota with a 100-97 victory. Drummond had 20 points and 16 rebounds, Harris and Avery Bradley added 18 points each and the Pistons snapped their two-game skid and Minnesota's three-game streak. ""I didn't want to lose,"" Drummond said. ""I mean, I have that mentality every night. But this game, I didn't want to go 0-3 on the road. We were trying to get this one and we needed it going into tomorrow. We fought hard."" The Pistons trailed by as many as 11, and Minnesota led 93-92 with 1:45 to go after Wiggins went 1 for 2 from the line. But Jackson hit a floater and a layup to give Detroit the lead for good. Jackson hit a 19-footer with 7-footer Towns in his face to make it 98-95 with 19.7 seconds to play. But the Wolves found hope when Bradley fouled Butler from the 3-point line with 6.2 to go. He made the first two, but then Jackson appeared to mess with Butler's rhythm by yelling to his teammates and delaying the final shot. Butler missed it. ""He had nothing to do with that, I just missed one,"" Butler said. To Detroit's surprise. ""Not going to lie. ... He's one of the closers in this league and everybody knows it,"" Jackson said. ""The ball bounced our way fortunately tonight, but I definitely expected him to make it."" Harris's free throws finished off Detroit's final 16-7 run, and Butler's last-second 3-point attempt rattled out to draw a loud groan from the crowd. Butler led the Wolves with 26 points and 10 rebounds, and Andrew Wiggins had 24. JACKSON SHINES Jackson scored nine of his 16 points in the fourth, and had two rebounds and an assist to Drummond in the final two minutes. Van Gundy credited Jackson's decision making and passes. ""To me, that's his best finish of the year,"" Van Gundy said. ""He got a lot of credit in the Atlanta game, he made some good shots. That was great point guard play down the stretch."" Jackson finished the night 7 of 11 from the floor and led the Pistons with eight assists. ""Reggie Jackson was being Reggie Jackson,"" Drummond said. ""Under five minutes, just get that man the basketball and let him play. He did an amazing job of getting guys open. ... He got me a hook shot in the paint, and he scored the rest of the way. You couldn't ask for a better momentum swing."" WOLVES WOES IN THE FOURTH Detroit outscored Minnesota 29-17 in the fourth quarter, and Butler's last-second three was officially his only attempt of the period. Towns, meanwhile, went 1 of 4 from the floor, and the Wolves went 6 of 17 as a team. Still, players insisted they ran the offense they wanted. ""We executed them pretty well, we just missed some shots,"" Towns said. TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond had his 12th double-double of the season. He briefly sat out midway through the third after coming down hard on his left elbow, and had to be helped to the bench. ... Detroit had 25 assists on 39 field goals. ... Jon Leuer missed his seventh straight game, and Van Gundy said the forward would have another MRI on Monday to evaluate his sprained left ankle. ""Just hasn't progressed the way we thought,"" Van Gundy said. :We certainly thought he'd be back, even at the beginning of this trip, and it just hasn't materialized. So we'll get in there and see what's going on and see if there's anything major, or if he just needs some more time."" Timberwolves: Towns had 16 points. ... Butler hit a season-high 10 field goals, and had his sixth 20-point game of the season. He has scored 20 in four of his last five games. ... Wiggins had his ninth 20-point night of the season.","400974989"
"PHOENIX --  The Phoenix Suns -- the starters and the guys off the bench -- piled up the assists against Chicago and sent the Bulls to another loss. T.J. Warren scored 27 points to lead six Phoenix players in double figures and the Suns handed the Bulls their sixth loss in seven games, 113-105 on Sunday night. Rookie Lauri Markkanen, the former University of Arizona standout, scored a career-best 26 points for the Bulls in a matchup of the NBA's youngest teams. The Suns had a season-high 32 assists on 45 baskets. Their season best had been 28 in each of the previous two games. ""We're moving from side to side and everybody's touching the ball,"" Warren said. ""Everybody's getting the ball."" Devin Booker and Mike James added 15 points apiece for Phoenix. Eight of James' points came in the final 10 minutes. James, who is coming off the bench after starting most of the young season, said the team's chemistry is getting better. ""I think it's really high,"" he said. ""It shows in our assists and how we're sharing the ball, and how we're playing defense, how we're helping each other."" Troy Daniels added 14 for the Suns, including four of seven 3s. Centers Greg Monroe and Alex Len had 10 apiece. Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano stuck with bench players, including James at point guard, down the stretch. Reserves scored 24 consecutive points for the Suns in an 8:24 stretch in the third and fourth quarter. ""I think we're getting better, we're getting more familiar with each other,"" he said, ""and I think our guys are understanding that it could be a variety of players in there. ... I think everybody is starting to figure out where they're supposed to be, therefore we're passing the ball a whole lot better."" Kris Dunn scored 17 points and Robin Lopez 16 for the Bulls. They were coming off a Friday night victory over Charlotte that snapped a five-game losing streak. Markkanen made 10 of 18 shots, 4 of 9 from 3-point range, and grabbed 13 rebounds. ""I thought Lauri was phenomenal,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""But when he is open, we got to get him the ball. When he has got it rolling like he did tonight, guys were switching and we had him a couple of times with the point guard buried in his back and we didn't get him the ball."" The Suns scored the first seven of the second quarter to tie it at 37 and neither team led by more than six the rest of the half. Warren's basket capped a 10-0 run that gave Phoenix a 54-48 lead with 2:42 left in the half and the Suns led 61-56 at the break. Chicago outscored Phoenix 16-5 over a five-minute span to take an 84-79 lead with 2:17 left in the third. But the Bulls didn't score again in the quarter while Daniels and Josh Jackson each sank 3-pointers to put the Suns up 85-84 entering the fourth. Phoenix took the lead for good 87-85 on Len's dunk. James scored six and Warren the final four in a decisive 15-5 surge that put the Suns up 106-95 with 3:37 to go. Chicago cut it to 108-103 on Markkanen's fourth 3 with 1:37 to play and got the ball back. But Dunn threw it away and the Suns held on for the win. ""It was a two-possession game with a minute 20 left and we throw a behind the back pass. That can't happen with two guys open, two of our better shooters and we throw it out of bounds,"" Hoiberg said. ""Then next possession down we throw the ball away. We had two key turnovers late that just can't happen if you want to win a game on the road."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago has not won two in a row yet this season. ... Bulls opened a four-game road trip. ... Ex-Sun Lopez had 10 points and five rebounds in the first quarter, six points and five rebounds the rest of the way. ... Teams have split their series each of the previous three seasons. Suns: Booker had six assists, James five. ... Phoenix won consecutive games for the third time this season. ... Booker, who has seven 30-point games this season, was just 5 of 15 from the field. ... Phoenix is in midst of stretch when nine of 10 games are at home.","400974990"
"LOS ANGELES --  Lonzo Ball's haircuts are headline news around LA and the NBA. His father already draws more attention than most politicians, and LaVar Ball is even currently engaged in a public argument with the president. Through all of this extraordinary attention on a 20-year-old point guard and his family, Lonzo has managed to remain focused on his rookie season with the Los Angeles Lakers. He broke through the distractions with another beautiful game against Denver. Ball had his second career triple-double and Julius Randle scored 24 points in the Lakers' 127-109 victory over the short-handed Nuggets on Sunday night. With 11 points, a career-high 16 rebounds and 11 assists, Ball reached the milestone at 20 years and 23 days -- the exact age at which LeBron James became the youngest player to record his second triple-double in 2005. Ball became the youngest player in NBA history with a first triple-double eight days earlier in a loss at Milwaukee. ""This one was a lot better,"" Ball said. ""I actually like this one. Just keep building on it."" Ball and Magic Johnson are the only Lakers with multiple triple-doubles in their rookie seasons. Johnson had seven, and his new point guard has two in his first 17 games. ""You should always play better in front of your fans, so I'm just trying to put on a good show for them and win at the same time,"" Ball said. Ball had another big game at another turbulent moment in his family life. With his father beefing with Donald Trump over the president's role in resolving brother LiAngelo's legal issues during a UCLA basketball trip to China, Lonzo Ball put together an outstanding floor game to boost the Lakers to just their second win in seven games. ""Never with a young man like this, his age, have I seen it,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said of the circus surrounding Ball's every move. ""I mean, he got a haircut and fielded three questions on game day about his haircut. One, it's impressive how he is able to maintain and handle it, and two, I think it's a little bit nuts. But that's the way it's going to be."" Brook Lopez scored 21 points and Jordan Clarkson added 18 for the Lakers, who surged to a 24-point lead in the first half and won easily. Denver coach Mike Malone and top scorer Nikola Jokic were ejected in the second quarter after Malone stepped onto the court during play to argue a no-call on a play by Jokic around the basket. Malone furiously confronted referee Rodney Mott, who swiftly ejected the coach and his best player when Jokic joined in the argument. ""I'll be honest, I deserved to get tossed, but Nikola Jokic did nothing to warrant an ejection,"" Malone said. ""That's something that we'll try to look into if we can."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Jamal Murray got a technical foul for gesturing at Mott after a no-call shortly after the two ejections. ... Two nights after Denver scored 146 points in a win over New Orleans, the Nuggets mustered just 48 points in the first half while committing 13 turnovers. Lakers: The 6-foot-6 Ball's 16 rebounds are the most in the NBA by a rookie this season. ... Los Angeles had a season-high 36 assists. ... Randle scored 17 points before halftime. ... Josh Hart and Ivica Zubac were recalled from the South Bay Lakers before the game. Hart scored three points, and Zubac played two minutes. TOSSED Malone was infuriated when Mott didn't call a foul on the Lakers for contact while Jokic battled underneath the basket. When the teams headed upcourt, Malone took two steps onto the hardwood and blocked Mott's path. Jokic had barely joined the argument when Mott tossed him as well, prompting a profane response. Malone's assistants had to calm him down. ""I just want to apologize to the Denver Nuggets,"" Jokic said. ""I feel bad. I left my teammates alone there."" JULIUS EARNING Randle went 11 of 18 from the field and added seven points and five assists in a stellar game off the bench. Walton would love to see a similar effort from Randle every night. ""I'm trying to figure that out,"" Walton said. ""Because when he plays like he did tonight, he's as good as anyone in this league."" HURTING Denver forward Paul Millsap left with a sprained left wrist in the second quarter of a miserable night for the Nuggets, who lost for just the second time in six games. Millsap had X-rays, but Malone didn't yet know the results.","400974991"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Dwight Howard is doing anything he can to eliminate the pressure he feels shooting free throws -- even if that means thinking about the Unabomber. Howard said he let his mind wander Monday night to a recent show he's been watching on Netflix about the hunt for the Unabomber. The big man went 9 of 14 at the foul line and finished with 25 points and 20 rebounds in the Charlotte Hornets' 118-102 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""I guess it works,"" Howard said. ""I just stay away from my own brain."" Free throw shooting has been an adventure for Howard this season. He was making only 40.3 percent coming into the game, but shot 6 of 10 in the fourth quarter when the Timberwolves were intentionally fouling him in an attempt to erase a double-digit deficit. Howard said he shoots about 200 foul shots every day and swears he makes more than 90 percent of them on a consistent basis in practice. But he added that he tends to freeze up during games -- even after 13 seasons in the NBA -- and worries about being taken out down the stretch because of his failure to convert them. He said now he is taking a ""who cares"" approach. ""That's what I have been focusing on is not being so tense at the line,"" Howard said. ""I'm so passionate in the game that when I step up to the line my emotions are still running so high that I don't know how to bring my shoulders down. ... I have to deflate my shoulders and make my shots."" Howard, acquired in an offseason trade from Atlanta, was 8 for 10 from the field and added four blocks. It was his 49th 20-20 game, the most among active NBA players. He outplayed Timberwolves big man Karl-Anthony Towns, who had 18 points and 12 rebounds as Minnesota lost on back-to-back nights. ""He controlled the paint at both ends of the floor, so he was a force in the paint on offense and his pick-and-roll defense,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""His team defense was terrific. He controlled the game."" Said Timberwolves forward Taj Gibson: ""We tried to get a body on him but he was real active tonight. We tried to match it, but their whole group collectively did well moving the ball and had us strung out."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Andrew Wiggins got a technical foul after disputing a charge call against him in the third quarter. Hornets: Came in having committed the fewest turnovers in the league but gave the ball away 11 times in the first half. ... Howard was charged with a flagrant foul when he threw a high elbow toward the upper body of Towns in the third quarter. KAMINSKY STEPS UP Charlotte forward Frank Kaminsky provided a huge spark off the bench, scoring nine of his 24 points in the fourth quarter. He shot 9 of 15 overall, including 4 of 5 from beyond the arc. The Hornets led by four entering the fourth before Kaminsky took over and helped build a double-digit advantage with a pair of 3-pointers. ""The ball was going in,"" Kaminsky said. ""Just wanted to attack. We've had some lulls in energy in the second half so I just want to come out and play with some heart."" BALL WON'T FALL The Timberwolves shot 6 of 27 from 3-point range, including 1 of 14 in the first half. Jamal Crawford led Minnesota with 19 points, and Jeff Teague added 18. Wiggins struggled from the field, going 5 of 14 and finishing with 11 points. Playing its third game in four nights might have contributed to Minnesota's poor shooting. ""You don't ever want to make excuses and obviously we have work to do and we're still a work in progress,"" Crawford said. ""We're a long way from being where we will be, but I think that's a good thing. We have something to work toward."" ZELLER LAUNCHES ONE Cody Zeller capped the scoring with a 3-pointer from the top of the key -- his first attempt of the season. ""I think I'm leading the league in 3-point percentage,"" Zeller joked.","400974992"
"DETROIT --  An emphatic win over a first-place opponent had LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers talking confidently again. ""We haven't had a win like that in a very long time,"" James said. ""That's what happens when we don't let up."" James scored 16 of his 18 points in the first quarter and the Cavaliers made 11 3-pointers in the first half on the way to a 116-88 rout of the Detroit Pistons on Monday night. Cleveland led 73-46 at halftime thanks to an overwhelming shooting performance, an indication that Detroit's stay atop the Central Division might not last much longer. The Pistons still lead the Cavs by a game, but Cleveland has won five straight and scored at least 110 points in eight of its last nine. ""That was 48 minutes of game planning and execution right from the beginning,"" James said. ""They've been playing extremely good basketball. They were coming off a great win (Sunday) night in Minnesota, so we knew that they were going to come out here and try to give us their best shot, and had to be ready for that."" The Cavaliers led 27-22 when James went to the bench late in the first quarter. By the time he came back in, it was 50-30. Cleveland's reserves ended up outscoring Detroit's 26-8 in the first half. The Cavs shot 62 percent from the field in the first two quarters and 11 of 17 from 3-point range. They finished the game 16 of 33 from beyond the arc. ""I'm not upset at our guys. I didn't see our guys quitting or anything like that,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We got a little bit shell shocked."" This had the feel of a big game before it started. Although there were still some empty seats at Little Caesars Arena, the Pistons' new home seemed closer to full than on previous nights, and the attendance was announced as a sellout. The team played well on offense at the start. A 3-pointer by Avery Bradley put Detroit ahead 18-17. James, however, answered with two 3s and a turnaround jumper, and the Pistons weren't able to keep up with Cleveland's torrid shooting. ""He definitely did set the tone,"" Detroit's Tobias Harris said. ""Made some really tough, contested shots -- 3s. Got himself going, got his team going, and then they were able to just pretty much fuel off that."" It was 36-23 after the first quarter, and the Cavs broke the game open at the start of the second. Channing Frye made back-to-back 3-pointers to make it 46-28. Harris led Detroit with 11 points. Kevin Love had 19 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland. ANOTHER BLOWOUT The previous matchup between these teams wasn't much different. The Cavs beat Detroit 128-96 on March 14 in Cleveland. That was the largest margin of victory by the Cavs against the Pistons -- although Cleveland nearly broke that mark Monday. A BREATHER Cleveland led 101-62 after three, and the top players for both teams sat out the final period. James ended up playing only 27:17 after surpassing 40 minutes in three of his previous five games. ""I played with Michael Jordan when he was 39; he played 37 minutes a night. Karl Malone was 37 and played 38 minutes a night,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Everybody's built different and if you're one of the greats sometimes you've got to play and sometimes you get rest like tonight."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland still isn't close to full strength. The Cavs were without Isaiah Thomas (right hip), Derrick Rose (left ankle sprain), Iman Shumpert (left knee effusion) and Tristan Thompson (left calf strain). Pistons: Jon Leuer (left ankle sprain) did not play. ... Detroit's six-game home winning streak was snapped. This was also the first time all season the Pistons lost the latter half of a back-to-back. They had been 3-0. ...

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  It might have been Victor Oladipo's best all-around game at the arena where he played his first three NBA seasons. Oladipo had 29 points, nine rebounds and seven steals to lead the Indiana Pacers to their fourth straight win, 105-97 over the Orlando Magic on Monday night. The venue and the opponent had very little to do with it, according to the Pacers guard. ""Honestly, this year every night fuels me,"" Oladipo said. ""We've got to go out and compete in the NBA against the best of the best. That competitive juice, that competitive edge is already running through my veins."" Oladipo and Bojan Bogdanovic combined for 40 points in the second half, 14 of them during a 16-3 third-quarter run that put the Pacers in command. Oladipo's seven steals were a season-high and he also had five assists. ""He's taking that leader role,"" teammate Lance Stephenson said. ""He's bringing it every night and being that guy that we need him to be."" Bogdanovic scored 24 of his 26 points in the second half, making five of six 3-pointers. ""He was red-hot for us,"" said coach Nate McMillan. ""Part of the reason we've gone to an eight-man rotation is to try to get him minutes at the four position."" Nikola Vucevic had 25 points and 13 rebounds for the Magic, who lost their fifth straight. The Magic finished with 22 turnovers and shot 33 percent in the second half to fall below .500 for the first time this season. After a dunk by Aaron Gordon late in the first quarter, the Magic were down 23-22 despite making nine of their first 12 shots, including four of five 3-pointers. They never regained their shooting touch. ""Somewhere in the third quarter we lost our rhythm, started over-dribbling, got stagnant,"" Vucevic said. ""I don't know why because it was working so well for us (in the first half). Then we started forcing stuff."" Two straight Orlando turnovers helped Indiana take a six-point lead before the Magic closed the first half with 11 straight points for a 55-50 advantage. Oladipo and Bogdanovic scored 22 points in the third quarter. A 3-pointer by Bogdanovic gave Indiana its first double-digit lead with 4:11 left in the game. A couple of 3-pointers by Evan Fournier and a 12-foot bank by Gordon pulled the Magic to within three in the final minute, but Oladipo set up Bogdanovic for a 3-pointer that put the Pacers up by six with 16.8 seconds left. DOWNWARD TREND The Magic's five straight losses have been by an average of 16 points. ""We're trying,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""Nobody's happy with how we're playing, and we know we've got to dig ourselves a little bit out of a rut here."" TIP-INS Pacers: After making 11 of 23 attempts at Miami on Sunday, Indiana came into the game as the NBA's best 3-point shooting team (.404). They made 8 of 20 Monday night.

The Magic outrebounded the Pacers 50-48 after coming into the game with the NBA's worst rebounding percentage.","400974994"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid was missing shots and upset with his play. That all changed with a theatrical, crowd-pleasing and game-changing flop. Ben Simmons had a career-high 27 points and 10 rebounds, a fired-up Embiid added 15 points and 11 rebounds despite a sore knee, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the cold-shooting Utah Jazz 107-86 on Monday night. The injury-prone Embiid skipped the morning shootaround because of pain his surgically-repaired left knee. But he posted his seventh double-double and got under Utah's skin at a decisive time in the fourth quarter. ""The whole game I thought I was kind of flat,"" Embiid said. ""I was kind of going through the motions. I needed that, getting the crowd going."" The Jazz had cut a 21-point deficit to 11 and were down 92-79 with 4:13 left when rookie Donovan Mitchell drove the lane and Embiid emphatically swatted away his shot. After Mitchell fell underneath the basket, Embiid turned and jawed at him. While the 6-foot-3 Mitchell claimed he couldn't hear what he said, he got up and lightly shoved Embiid. The 7-foot-2 Embiid crashed to the floor. ""He just got up kind of fake-shouldered and I flopped and he got a technical for it,"" Embiid said with a grin. As Mitchell drew the technical foul, Embiid got up and motioned to the fans, who started to chant ""MVP"" and ""Trust the Process,"" the team's mantra during a lengthy rebuild. ""The young kid in me kind of showed,"" Mitchell said. ""Inexperience right there in that moment, because I think we were down (13) and we ended up losing by 21."" Embiid later hit a jumper to make it 95-82. When he exited to a standing ovation with 1:50 left, the Sixers were up 18 and had secured their second win in five games. ""It was all fun after the game. We shook hands,"" Embiid said of Mitchell. ""It was just about having fun."" Mitchell scored 17 points on 6 of 19 shooting, Rodney Hood added 13 while making 5 of 17 shots, and the Jazz shot 35.3 percent from the field in losing for the eighth time in 10 games. After blowing a 22-point halftime lead Saturday against Golden State, Simmons hit 11 of 15 shots after halftime and the Sixers pulled away this time. J.J. Redick shook off a scoreless first half to finish with 20 points, and Amir Johnson grabbed 13 rebounds. The Sixers didn't know they'd have Embiid until about 45 minutes before the game after he successfully tested the knee in warmups. Embiid sat out a win at Utah two weeks ago for what the Sixers called ""load management"" as they try to keep him healthy after a number of injuries. He made just 7 of 16 shots, but again proved the team's emotional leader. ""I like our guys playing with an edge. I like them having some level of swagger and feeling good about themselves,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""That was a big play. It certainly got the crowd involved."" The Jazz, at the end of a four-game trip, have been struggling as they deal with injuries to four key players. But even without Rudy Gobert, they were coming off a 40-point rout of Orlando on Saturday for their first road win. The offense remained stuck in Florida early, and Utah couldn't contain the 6-foot-10 Simmons, who scored on a variety of drives and pull-ups while facing several defenders. ""They were driving us, particularly in the open floor. And we didn't do a good job of staying in front of them,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""When you get guys like Simmons downhill with his size, they're going to finish down there."" TIP-INS Jazz: Alec Burks was 1 of 10 from the field. . Utah hasn't won consecutive games since Nov. 1. 76ers: G Jerryd Bayless (wrist) had five points in his return from a six-game absence. ...

"Kristaps Porzingis rejects Blake Griffin with ease as Griffin attempts a layup. (0:17) NEW YORK --  Things are going so poorly for the Clippers that they can't even beat the Knicks anymore. Kristaps Porzingis scored 25 points and New York extended Los Angeles' losing streak to nine games with a 107-85 victory Monday night. Porzingis outplayed a frustrated Blake Griffin and helped the Knicks snap a 10-game skid in the series with their first victory over the Clippers in more than five years. ""Bottom line, we just can't sustain anything,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Right now we get it going a little bit and one thing happens and it just implodes."" Doug McDermott added 16 points for the Knicks, including a 3-pointer that swung the momentum for good midway through the third quarter. ""I got in there, had to bring some energy because we got off to a little slow start to start the third quarter,"" McDermott said. Griffin scored 21 points but shot just 6 for 18, picked up a technical foul and fouled out with 4:46 remaining. The Clippers (5-11) still haven't won since Nov. 1 at Dallas, when they improved to 5-2. ""Tonight was not a good showing,"" Griffin said. ""We have to put together 48 minutes rather than playing in spurts. We know as a team that this is not going to be the end."" Patrick Beverley returned after missing five games with a sore right knee and had nine points and six rebounds. But the Clippers are still without fellow guard Milos Teodosic and the rest of their backcourt play was mostly dismal. The Clippers fell behind by 17 early in the third quarter before running off 15 straight to cut it to 66-64 midway through the period. But McDermott hit a 3-pointer in transition and added another during a 12-0 response by the Knicks that gave them a 78-64 advantage with 4:11 remaining in the period. ""I thought that was disheartening,"" Rivers said. ""I thought that took the spirit away but it shouldn't and that's where we're at right now. When you lose nine games in a row, you're in a losing streak, you start feeling sorry for yourself when things don't go right and you can't do that."" New York then led by 26 in the fourth quarter. The game was tied at 20 after one quarter, but the Knicks opened a double-digit lead late in the half after a 9-2 spurt and were ahead 56-44 at the break. ""In the first half we weren't moving the ball. One pass or no passes and the guys were shooting it,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""Once we got into passing the ball and moving it from side to side, then we ended up with 20 assists in the final 32 minutes and that's pretty good."" The Clippers traded Chris Paul in the offseason and the search for reliable guard play remains. Austin Rivers was 1 for 9 for two points, Lou Williams came off the bench to shoot 2 for 8, and rookie Jawun Evans shot 2 for 8.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Portland is clamping down on defense and the effort is leading to recent success for the Trail Blazers. The team has held seven of the last eight opponents under 100 points, including Memphis on Monday night as the Trail Blazers pulled away from the Grizzlies for a 100-92 win. C. J. McCollum scored 24 points and Damian Lillard added 21 points as Portland sent Memphis to its fifth straight loss. ""Defensively we were able to get some stops down the stretch,"" McCollum said of Portland's ability to pull away after the game was tied at 80 with 6:41 remaining.

""The other team was just missing a lot of shots, and I was just having a nose for the ball,"" Vonleh said. ""Boxing my guy out and going after it, that was my mindset."" Vonleh's rebounds were part of the Trail Blazers controlling the boards, outrebounding Memphis 60-35. ""Crushed us on the glass,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said. ""We finally got our defense activated again, and I felt like we were back somewhat looking like our early season self. But the glass just really killed us."" Mario Chalmers led Memphis with a season-high 21 points, while Tyreke Evans finished with 20.

The teams were tied at 80 with 6:47 left after Gasol split a pair of free throws. But Jusuf Nurkic, who had 10 points, converted a 3-point play and put the Trail Blazers ahead for good. ""It's always difficult, it seems, to play here,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""Seems like the games are always a grind it out, low possession, low field goal percentage game."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: The game was the first of a five-game road trip for Portland. . Portland lost to Grizzlies 98-97 earlier this month. .Vonleh's 18 rebounds were one short of his career-high 19 on April 12 last season against New Orleans. It was Vonleh's first double-double of the season. ... Napier, who was shooting 58 percent in his last six games, was 5 of 13 from the field. Grizzlies: C/F Brandan Wright, who injured his right groin in Saturday's game against Houston, sat out, along with G Mike Conley, who continues to nurse a sore left Achilles tendon. ... Memphis has allowed 100 points in nine of the last 10 games. .Evans recorded at least 20 points off the bench for the seventh time this season. LILLARD LIMPING Lillard turned his ankle with just under 3 minutes left before halftime after stepping on Gasol's foot. The Portland guard went down under the Trail Blazers basket, but eventually hobbled to the bench. He returned to start the second half. ""I knew if there was some way he could play, he's going to play,"" Stotts said. ""What he does, doesn't surprise me."" Lillard was noticeably limping in the Trail Blazers locker room. He said trainers ""did all kinds of different tape jobs on it,"" at halftime, ""then we went back out there and tried it. I was able to, at least, get something done."" CLOSE, BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH Memphis' losing streak has reflected the signs of a struggling team, particularly without Conley. While the Grizzlies were in the game midway through the fourth quarter, they were consistently trying to catch up throughout the game because of poor shooting. ""I do think if we could have made some of our open shots, it would have at least helped momentum and it also helps energize your defense when you make a couple of those,"" Fizdale said. ""But, ultimately, we've just got to keep plugging away.","400974997"
"MILWAUKEE --  Despite playing on back-to-back days for the first time this season and having two starters banged up, the Washington Wizards were better in the second half than their rested opponent Monday night. Bradley Beal scored 23 points, John Wall returned from a one-game absence and the Wizards pulled away in the fourth quarter for a 99-88 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. ""Defensively, we locked into the game plan,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""We were aggressive, we were physical. We played with an IQ. We made them take the shots that we wanted them to take."" Beal helped the Wizards separate from the Bucks with a personal 7-0 run late in the third quarter. Washington then outscored Milwaukee 13-4 to start the fourth, building an 86-70 advantage. The win snapped a two-game skid for the Wizards, who lost 100-91 to Toronto on Sunday with Wall out of the lineup. Milwaukee has lost two consecutive games to fall back to .500 at 8-8 after rattling off a four-game winning streak following the trade for Eric Bledsoe. The Bucks had scored at least 90 points in 13 of their first 14 games but managed just 79 in a loss to Dallas on Sunday and 88 against the Wizards. Both opponents were playing on the second day of a back-to-back while the Bucks were rested. ""We know that we're a better team than how we've played,"" said acting head coach Joe Prunty, who filled in for Jason Kidd. Kelly Oubre Jr. added 18 points off the bench for the Wizards, and Wall scored 15 after missing a game with knee pain. Otto Porter Jr. had 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Marcin Gortat finished with 10 points with 15 rebounds. Washington led 27-19 after the first quarter, but Milwaukee used a 10-0 run capped by Giannis Antetokounmpo blocking a shot attempt by Wall and finishing on the other end to take 41-39 lead with 3:07 left in the half. After trailing 47-46 at halftime, the Bucks led 55-50 before the Wizards scored eight straight points to take the lead back for good. Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 23 points but was 8 for 21 from the field. ""(Giannis) is playing like an MVP,"" Brooks said. ""Hard player to stop. You try different guys on him so that he doesn't get a consistent feel with the same player."" The Bucks went just 4 of 22 from beyond the arc and missed 20 shots in the paint. TIP-INS Wizards: Beal became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 700 made 3-pointers. ... Washington held a 46-33 rebounding advantage and outscored Milwaukee 15-2 on second-chance points. Bucks: Matthew Dellavedova (left knee tendinitis) and Mirza Teletovic (left knee soreness) each missed a third straight game due to injury. ... Bucks guard Gary Payton II made his third appearance of the season. On a two-way contract, Payton scored a career-high eight points in 15 minutes. KIDD AWAY FROM TEAM Kidd missed the game following the birth of his daughter. Kidd's wife, Porschla, gave birth to Cooper Anne Kidd on Sunday. PLAYING THROUGH PAIN Wall returned to the starting lineup after missing Sunday's loss to Toronto with a sore left knee. Porter was in the starting lineup after an MRI on his right hand came back negative. ""When I first went out there and shot today, it was perfectly fine,"" Wall said. ""If you saw me warming up the last couple games, you could tell that we had to take time to warm up. ""I was great. I was cool. I missed some easy early shots, but other than that I was fine.""","400974998"
"NEW ORLEANS --  When DeMarcus Cousins got tossed, Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday and the rest of the New Orleans Pelicans locked in. Davis had 36 points and 15 rebounds, Holiday added 18 points, and New Orleans rallied after Cousins' ejection to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 114-107 on Monday night. ""We didn't think it was that fair. He doesn't do anything intentional,"" Holiday said of Cousins, who was assessed a flagrant foul for swinging an elbow near Thunder star Russell Westbrook's head. ""We just wanted to win for him."" Cousins had 18 points and nine rebounds before his ejection with five minutes remaining in the third quarter and did not speak with reporters after the game. Cousins raised his elbow near Westbrook's face after grabbing a rebound, and the Thunder guard dropped to the floor holding his head. Westbrook remained in the game and finished with 22 points, 16 rebounds, 12 assists and three steals. However, Westbrook also missed 13 of 19 shots. Westbrook also did not discuss Cousins' foul, but did lament ""mental errors"" that plagued Oklahoma City while they were losing a lead that was 19 points in the first quarter. ""Guys got to take personal pride and understand how important it is to go out and compete and not take it for granted,"" Westbrook said. ""As players, you go out on the floor, and sometimes you take it for granted and don't realize how important it is to embrace the moment. Each individual guy has to do that every night."" New Orleans trailed 76-72 when Cousins was ejected, but surged ahead soon after with an 11-3 run during which Jameer Nelson, E'Twaun Moore and Darius Miller each hit 3s. Nelson banked in his 3 from near half-court as the shot clock expired. Davis helped New Orleans end a two-game skid with his typical array of dunks, layups and clutch mid-range shots. He also hit 18 of 22 free throws. ""It was tough losing (Cousins), being one of our star players, but anything is liable to happen in a game,"" Davis said. ""So guys stepped up and were ready to play."" Paul George hit six 3s en route to 26 points and Carmelo Anthony scored 19 for Oklahoma City, which lost its second straight in similar fashion, having blown a 23-point lead in San Antonio on Friday night. ""We're too good of a team to allow a team to tie it up after we go up 20,"" George said. ""Games are built on runs. That's going to happen. But we've got to eliminate how much of a run we allow."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City led 25-6 on Alex Abrines' 3 in the first quarter, but the Thunder fell into a tie early in the second quarter before going back up by eight at halftime after George's 3 made it 65-57. .... Steven Adams had 15 points and Jerami Grant 10 points. Pelicans: The 6-foot-4 Moore, normally a reserve shooting guard, started at small forward and scored 12 points. ... Miller had 11 points for New Orleans, hitting three of four 3-point shots. ... Davis had seven turnovers. ... Guard Tony Allen returned from a four-game absence cause by left knee swelling. He had six points and six rebounds in nearly 19 minutes. COUSINS' EXIT From video replays displayed on the arena scoreboard, it appeared Cousins made contact with Westbrook, but it was difficult to discern whether contact was made with the Thunder star's head or shoulder, or whether the impact was significant. Officials did not eject Cousins from the game until after viewing replays on a TV at the scorers' table, after which they called a flagrant two. Hard contact is not required for a flagrant two -- only an act deemed ""unnecessary and excessive."" Allen said Cousins' ""emotions got the best of him,"" and that his history of outbursts seems to be held against him in such situations. Allen also asserted that Westbrook ""definitely"" flopped. Westbrook ""took advantage of Cousins' history. He was going to get the best of that call,"" said Allen, a 14-year veteran. ""You saw him get right back up and miss the free throw.""","400974999"
"DALLAS --  Double-digit deficits are becoming just a minor annoyance to the Boston Celtics as they continue their winning ways. Kyrie Irving scored 10 of his season-high 47 points in overtime as the Celtics rallied from 13 points down in the fourth quarter to beat the Dallas Mavericks 110-102 on Monday night and extend their winning streak to 16 games. The winning streak ties the fourth-longest in franchise history, and for the third game in a row, Boston trailed by double digits. In contrast to recent wins over Golden State and Atlanta, this one required a fourth quarter comeback. For that, the Celtics turned to Irving, who delivered his best performance for his new team after Dallas had taken an 87-74 lead with 7:47 to play. ""For us it's just about battling back when teams get a comfortable rhythm, whether it'd be in the first half or the second half,"" Irving said. ""As a group we continue just to stick together throughout anything and everything."" Irving stole the ball from Dirk Nowitzki and fed Jayson Tatum for an alley-oop lay-up that hung on the rim for a full second before dropping through with 1:01 to play to tie the score at 96. In the extra period, Irving scored his team's first six points. Then after Jaylen Brown gave Boston a 104-102 lead with a jumper with 1:39 to play, Irving went to work on Yogi Ferrell, backing him down and drawing contact on a lay-up with 48.5 seconds to play. Though Irving missed the free throw to keep the score 106-102, Dallas never got closer. ""I don't really see it as a pressure situation,"" Irving said of his late-game play. ""It's just like playing basketball, man. It's just like being in a park 7-7 and game is eight."" Harrison Barnes scored 31 points and Wesley Matthews had 18 for Dallas, which came back from an early double-digit deficit as the Celtics went cold for much of the second and third quarters. Barnes missed a jumper with less than a second to go in regulation that could have won it for Dallas, which fell to 3-15. ""We just needed to make a couple more plays at key times,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Probably just one more key play in the last minute or minute and a half. That would have been the difference."" Brown finished with 22 for Boston. He and Irving combined to go 24-for-35 while the rest of the Celtics went 14-for-49. The Mavericks fell behind by as many as 15 points in the first half, outscoring the Celtics 55-35 over the second and third quarters. NO MORAL VICTORIES Similar to recent home games against Cleveland and San Antonio, the Mavericks fought one of the NBA's best teams until the end, getting their home crowd into it. But the Mavericks have three close losses to show for those efforts and perhaps are unfairly saddled with the league's worst record. ""At the end of the day, it's got to show up in wins and losses,"" Barnes said. ""There are no moral victories around here. Tonight was playing against a great team, and a great opportunity to win here in front of our home fans. We let it slip away."" TIP-INS Celtics: Marcus Smart came into the game shooting just 27 percent from the field, worst among NBA players with at least 10 attempts per game. And he shot 3-for-15 Monday as the Mavericks backed off and dared him to shoot. But Smart's 3 with 1:24 to play in the game put Boston within 96-94. . Boston shot just 10-for-34 over the two middle quarters after building the early lead. ... The game was a homecoming for Boston rookie Semi Ojeleye, who played college basketball at SMU in Dallas. Mavericks: Guard J.J. Barea won the NBA Cares Community Assist Award for October for the relief work he did in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in his native Puerto Rico. He was presented with the award at halftime. Barea has provided more than 100,000 pounds of supplies to the island, and he has raised nearly $750,000 in funds through his own efforts and a YouCaring.com fund drive.","400975000"
"LaMarcus Aldridge comes up with a block on defense, runs the floor and gets a dunk at the other. (0:30) SAN ANTONIO --  LaMarcus Aldridge and Kyle Anderson are keeping the short-handed San Antonio Spurs going. Aldridge had 22 points and 11 rebounds, Anderson had another solid game in place of Kawhi Leonard and the Spurs held off the Atlanta Hawks 96-85 on Monday night. ""LaMarcus kind of took his game to another level,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. The Hawks lost their 20th straight game in San Antonio, a skid spanning 20 years. Aldridge fueled the Spurs in the second half, but Anderson had another methodical all-around game. ""He's been ready for the moment,"" Aldridge said. ""He's been playing really confident, making plays for us, being the other guy to be a ball-handler and been just saving us in games, basically."" Anderson had 13 points, 10 assists and six rebounds in his 17th start in place of injured All-Star Leonard. The 6-foot-9 forward out of UCLA has taken advantage of playing 27 minutes per game this season after averaging less than 14 in his previous three. Nicknamed ""Slow Mo"" for his lack of foot speed, Anderson patiently worked his way to 5-of -8 shooting and had just two turnovers in 30 minutes. ""He gets to handle the ball more and that's his game, too,"" said San Antonio veteran Manu Ginobili, who had 16 points. ""He's playing as a point power forward. He's a tough matchup because of his size and his handles."" Anderson didn't score any points in the fourth but had four assists in the quarter to help Aldridge push the Spurs past the pesky Hawks. Aldridge, who is averaging a team-high 22.3 points, had 12 points with six rebounds in the fourth quarter. Danny Green followed that by hitting consecutive 3-pointers to stretch the lead to 90-79 with 3 minutes remaining. Reserve forward John Collins led Atlanta with 21 points and Taurean Prince added 18. Former Spurs center Dewayne Dedmon had 11 points, including nine in the opening quarter. TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta's last victory in San Antonio was Feb. 15, 1997. ... Hawks center Miles Plumlee did not play after being listed as probable with a strained right quadriceps. ... Atlanta has nine players with one year of NBA experience or less. ... The Hawks entered third in the league with 9.1 steals per game. They had seven against the Spurs. ... Budenholzer, a former San Antonio assistant, and Dedmon both received warm ovations during pre-game introductions. Spurs: San Antonio has already missed 52 games due to injury, including the season-long absences of Leonard and Tony Parker. Coach Gregg Popovich did not offer a timeline for either to return from quadriceps injuries. ... Anderson has scored in double figures in eight of 17 games this season after doing so just four times in 72 games last season. FAREWELL, LEE Former All-Star David Lee announced his retirement after playing with the Spurs last season. Lee played 12 seasons in the NBA starting with New York before joining Golden State, Boston and finishing in San Antonio. MORE INJURIES Atlanta lost Luke Babbitt in the second quarter due to a lower-back injury. Babbitt's exit was precautionary. Budenholzer was unsure how long Babbitt will be out. ""We're a little short-handed,"" Budenholzer said. ""Luke went down, Musky (Mike Muscala) wasn't available. I'm assuming it's the most minutes John (Collins) has played."" Collins played 36 minutes.","400975001"
"Gary Harris knocks down a three on a second chance opportunity for the Nuggets. (0:23) SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Will Barton didn't know Mike Malone was suspended by the NBA until the Denver Nuggets coach informed him as Barton got on the team bus to head to the arena. ""I thought he was joking,"" Barton said. ""I told him we'd hold it down for him."" Minus their coach and two starters, the short-handed Nuggets did just that -- and only 24 hours after losing by 21 points to begin their three-game road trip. Barton and Trey Lyles made two 3-pointers apiece during a big run in the third quarter, and Denver pulled away to beat the Sacramento Kings 114-98 on Monday night. Barton finished with 25 points, six rebounds and five assists in his third start this season for Denver, which also was without injured starters Paul Millsap and Wilson Chandler. ""Given the circumstances, I'll take it,"" said Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., who coached the team while Malone stayed back at the team hotel. ""The minute (we) got in here from the team bus they knew it was a task at hand. We were under adverse circumstances and had no other option than to pull it together."" Malone served a one-game NBA suspension for making contact with a referee in Sunday's loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Denver also was missing Millsap, who sprained his left wrist against the Lakers, and Chandler (lower back pain). After a sluggish first half, Denver pulled away in the third quarter following a 19-7 run late in the third quarter sparked by the long-distance shooting of Barton and Lyles. The Nuggets shot 15 of 32 beyond the arc and led by as many as 22 in the final period. ""That third quarter we were real patient and sound, ran our sets and got going,"" Barton said. ""Anytime you're missing two starters, impact guys like that, it's going to take a while."" Nikola Jokic added 16 points and 14 rebounds, and Gary Harris scored 20 for the Nuggets. George Hill and Kosta Koufos scored 16 points apiece to lead six players in double figures for Sacramento. The Kings, who had won their three previous home games against the Thunder, 76ers and Trail Blazers, have lost five of six overall. ""Athletically, (the Nuggets) go and get balls and jumped over the top of us and did some of those kind of things,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We've got to be more physical. We were a step slow in the second half."" BARTON COMES UP BIG Barton shot 9 of 15 and made a season-high five 3-pointers on six attempts from beyond the arc. ""He wasn't an aggressive scorer but he was a playmaker for us,"" Unseld said. ""Down the stretch he controlled the game."" WHAT WENT WRONG Joerger thought his team played hard throughout the game but rookie guard De'Aaron Fox wasn't so sure. Asked if the Kings let up in the second half when the Nuggets got on their roll, Fox said: ""It felt that way. But it's happened before, we've got back before. It's just something if we go down, we've got to pick it up even more. You have to pick up your effort when things are going south."" TIP-INS Nuggets: With Millsap and Chandler out, Unseld went to a three-guard lineup but the offense sputtered in the first half with 11 turnovers. Denver did a much better job after the break and pulled away. . The Nuggets dominated the offensive rebounding (14-5) and converted that into a 19-6 advantage in second-chance points. Kings: Zach Randolph had 12 points and six rebounds in his third consecutive start at center. ... Buddy Hield missed his second straight game with a sore right ankle.","400975002"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Lakers' first half resembled many miserable stretches of the past four seasons. Although the Chicago Bulls have plenty of their own problems, they outworked, outshot and outsmarted the Lakers while taking a 14-point lead. Coach Luke Walton reminded his young team that 14 points aren't much in the NBA, and the Lakers proceeded to stage a rally that suggested the future might not be so miserable after all. Kyle Kuzma had 22 points, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 11 of his 21 in the fourth quarter and the Lakers roared back from a 19-point deficit in the second half for a 103-94 victory over the Bulls on Tuesday night. Brandon Ingram had 17 points, five rebounds and five assists as the Lakers won consecutive games for the second time this season, doing so in a thrilling fashion that had their still-faithful fans standing, cheering and recalling the 16-time champion franchise's better years. ""Anytime you go out there and compete, and you look to your right and your left and everybody is competing as hard as you are, that's a great feeling,"" said rookie Lonzo Ball, who had eight points, 13 rebounds and four assists. Los Angeles is off to an 8-10 start and sitting in eighth place in the Western Conference -- small achievements, but important steps for a young team just starting to believe it can compete. The Lakers weren't competitive in the first half while committing 13 turnovers, and they trailed 61-42 early in the second half. But they put together a 38-19 run spurred by an energetic third quarter from reserves Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart and Julius Randle, who finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds. Caldwell-Pope's layup with 3:08 to play gave the Lakers their first lead since the first quarter, and the veteran added back-to-back 3-pointers. The Lakers finished strong for their first win over the Bulls at Staples Center in three tries. ""I was shocked we were only down 14 at the half, to be honest,"" Walton said. ""It was a learning opportunity for the guys to be down 20 and realize you don't need hero shots. You just need to tighten down on what we are doing, and you can get back in the game."" Denzel Valentine scored 17 points and Antonio Blakeney added 15 -- all in the first half -- for the Bulls, who dropped to 3-12 with their seventh loss in eight games. ""They grabbed the momentum and ran with it,"" said Kris Dunn, who had 12 points and six assists in his second start of the season for Chicago. ""Caldwell-Pope, he hit some big shots. They were more aggressive than we were and started getting to the free throw line."" TIP-INS Bulls: Fred Hoiberg promoted Dunn to the starting lineup in place of Jerian Grant, and the coach expects it to be a long-term move. Dunn has been a steady force off Chicago's bench, and Hoiberg expects Grant to take a similar role with the reserves going forward. ... David Nwaba missed the game with a sprained ankle. The LA native became a steady bench contributor for the Lakers last season, but Chicago snatched him off waivers in July while the Lakers shuffled their roster. Lakers: Los Angeles visits Chicago on Jan. 26. ... F Larry Nance Jr. could be back with the team as early as next week. He had surgery on his broken left hand only three weeks ago, but has healed quicker than expected. TWINS Brook Lopez had four points on 2-for-10 shooting and nine rebounds for the Lakers against his twin brother, Robin, who had 14 points and three rebounds for the Bulls. The twins grew up in North Hollywood rooting for the Lakers, who acquired Brook Lopez in a trade with Brooklyn last summer. ""I don't want to sound selfish, but it was personally fun for me,"" Robin Lopez said. ""I don't know how much fun he had."" BALL'S GAME After posting his second career triple-double Sunday against Denver, Ball missed seven of his first eight shots against Chicago, but provided strong playmaking down the stretch. The point guard also has 29 rebounds in LA's last two games. STRETCH FADE The Bulls went 13 for 45 (28.9 percent) from the field in the second half, including 4 of 22 on 3-pointers. They committed seven turnovers and only forced one. ""We look at the first half, and we had a really good defensive effort against a high-scoring team,"" Hoiberg said. ""But you have to sustain it for 48 minutes.""","400975003"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  The Charlotte Hornets keep finding ways to win at home. Now if Dwight Howard and his teammates can figure out how to win away from Charlotte they might become a very dangerous team. Howard had 26 points and 13 rebounds, including a key block at the end of regulation and a crucial offensive rebound in overtime, in the Hornets' 129-124 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. The Hornets improved to 7-2 at home. But they're still below .500 overall because of a 1-7 road record. ""We love playing at home,"" Howard said. ""Thank you, Charlotte. That energy in the building is what keeps us going. But now we need that same energy on the road."" There was plenty of energy in the Spectrum Center as the Hornets rallied from a 9-point deficit with 3 1/2 minutes remaining in regulation to force overtime. Hornets coach Steve Clifford said ""nine points in this league -- as good as these guys are- is not that big of a deal."" The Hornets battled back behind the gritty play of Kemba Walker and Jeremy Lamb, who each finished with 24 points. Walker made a driving layup with 17 seconds left and then added two free throws with 2 seconds remaining to tie it. Howard blocked Beal's baseline jumper at the end of regulation to send the game into overtime. Charlotte carried the momentum into the extra period with Walker knocking down a leaning 3-pointer from the top of the key after a scramble for a loose ball. Lamb followed with a block and a coast-to-coast layup for a 5-point lead. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added a driving layup and Lamb buried a jumper from just beyond the foul line to push the lead to six with 1:24 remaining. But the big basket came when Howard grabbed air-ball from Lamb out of the air and laid it in to beat the shot clock. ""We had the game won,"" said John Wall, who had 31 points and 11 assists to lead the Wizards. ""Give them a lot of credit because they are a team that never stops fighting for sure. They just came and took the game from us."" TIP- INS Wizards: Shot 11 of 33 from 3-point range. ... Were outrebounded 31-19 after halftime. Hornets: Scored 129 points against a Wizards team that had allowed 100 points in just one of their previous seven games. ... Made 15 of 17 foul shots in the first half and 33 of 40 for the game. BATUM RE-INJURES ELBOW: Hornets guard Nic Batum left the game in the second quarter with a left elbow contusion and did not return. Batum missed the first 12 games of season with a torn ligament in the same elbow. Clifford offered no update on Batum's injury. If Batum is unable to go, Lamb would return to the starting lineup and rookie Malik Monk would likely see additional playing time. CAN'T SILENCE THE LAMB: Along with the steal and layup in overtime, Lamb made some big shots for the Hornets with Batum out of the game. That's become par for the course this year. Lamb is averaging 16 points per game this season, while shooting a career-best 41.3 percent from 3-point range. He's never averaged more than 10 points per game in his previous five seasons and never shot better than 35.6 percent from beyond the arc. ""I just try to make plays,"" Lamb said. ""Kemba has a lot on his shoulders the whole game so I try to help him on the offensive end at the end of the game because they trap him and I'm left open so I just try to knock down those shots.""","400975004"
"CLEVELAND --  LeBron James got stitches and then sliced Brooklyn open by himself. James scored 23 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter -- including 18 straight for Cleveland -- and the Cavaliers won their sixth straight, 119-109 over the Nets on Wednesday night. After he was accidentally ""head-butted"" by Brooklyn's Tyler Zeller in the third quarter, James went to the locker room, where Cleveland's medical staff closed the gash above his lip. James punched back in the fourth. ""Just trying to make plays, be assertive, help my team win,"" he said when asked what got into him. ""Blessed to be able to make a couple down the stretch."" He hardly missed, going 7 of 8 from the field in the final 12 minutes. Kevin Love broke a 99-all tie on a free throw with 4:50 left and James took over, delivering a one-man show with an assortment of shots, power moves and clutch jumpers. James began the dominating run with a pair of free throws and followed with a couple left-handed shots and then drained two 3-pointers -- the last a step-back with 55 seconds left to give Cleveland a 118-107 lead. James said it wasn't his intent to take over. It just happened. ""You can't force it,"" said James, who missed a wide-open dunk in the first half. ""You've got to let it come to you. It's times when you wish you can do it and sometimes the ball just doesn't go in. But I put a lot of work into my craft and I believe that every shot I take is going to go in."" The sublime solo performance enabled the Cavs to avenge a 112-107 loss in Brooklyn last month, an upset that began a four-game slide for Cleveland and led to questions about whether the Eastern Conference champions were finished. Love and Dwyane Wade added 18 points apiece for Cleveland, which moved four games over .500. When James gets in a zone like he did, Love said there's one thing to do. ""Sometimes it's being aggressive and picking your spots and other times it's, `Get the hell out of the way,"" he said. ""That was a special fourth-quarter performance, but it seems like he's always done that. But this year in particular he's done an incredible job of doing that for us."" Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 20 and Joe Harris 18 for the Nets, who could do nothing in the final 12 minutes to stop James. ""LeBron really took over,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""There's no other way to put it. We didn't ever find a solution to stop him in the fourth quarter. We were trying different stuff. I guess we could have trapped him, but he's such a great passer we didn't want to give up 3s. We tried different things. We tried playing our normal defense and then we tried switching. He kind of picks out the guy he wants to go at."" TIP-INS Nets: C Trevor Booker (sprained left ankle) did not play. He was injured Sunday against Golden State. ... G Spencer Dinwiddie started his fourth straight game in place of injured G D'Angelo Russell (left knee surgery). ... Brooklyn has lost nine straight in Cleveland. Cavaliers: When he left to get stitched up, James only had eight points and his streak of double-digit games appeared in jeopardy. But he scored on a layup in the third, giving him 809 straight regular-season games with at least 10s. Michael Jordan has the record with 866. ... Coach Tyronn Lue said the team is targeting Monday's game in Philadelphia for G Iman Shumpert (sore left knee) to return. He's missed the last two games. ... James became the 26th player to make 1,500 3-pointers. DUNK, FUNK Cleveland built a nine-point lead in the first quarter and seemed ready to build on it when James made a surprising mistake. Alone in the frontcourt for a dunk, James tried to showboat and rocketed the ball off the back of the rim, a miss that stunned him and 20,000-plus fans. James forced a long 3 on Cleveland's next possession and the Cavs went into an overall funk. Lue said the blow to James' face woke up the superstar. ""It was good because he was messing around,"" Lue said. THOMAS UPDATE The Isaiah Thomas comeback is getting closer. The All-Star point guard took some contact during a rigorous workout at the team's morning shootaround. Thomas has been ramping up his activity, running harder and appears to be ahead of schedule to make his debut with Cleveland. Originally, the Cavs forecast he would be playing in games by the end of December but there's a sense it could be sooner.","400975005"
"PHILADELPHIA --  It was anything but ""a regular block."" Joel Embiid punctuated the Philadelphia 76ers' 101-81 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night by spiking Damian Lillard's layup attempt out of bounds, volleyball style. It capped a game-changing stretch by the Philadelphia center. Philadelphia scored the game's first 16 points, led by 13 at halftime and again by 16 early in the third. After Lillard got the Blazers within nine late in the quarter, Embiid answered with a basket, block, slam, jumper -- and then the exclamation point. The emphatic rejection caused the frenzied crowd at the packed Wells Fargo Center to erupt. ""It was just a regular block,"" said Embiid, who finished with 28 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks. Embiid's modest answer followed a bold claim. ""Not to be cocky, but I think I'm the best defensive player in the league right now,"" he said. ""I just want to keep on growing. I'm still getting better. My blocks are a little bit down, but I'm a better rebounder this year. ... I'm doing a lot of things to help the team win, and the guys around me do a lot of things to help me, too. I just want to keep on growing defensively and be the best defensive player in the league. Hopefully, this year I can win Defensive Player of the Year."" Portland missed its first 13 shots before Shabazz Napier came off the bench and hit a jumper with 5:01 left in the first quarter. The Blazers never got closer than eight. It was the Blazers' lowest point total of the season and the fewest that Philadelphia has allowed. ""I would give us an A on defense and like a C-minus on offense,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""Turnovers (Philadelphia had 18), at times ratty shots. I thought we could have put them down a little bit earlier."" Portland shot just 33.7 percent from the field and 58.3 percent from the line. ""I don't know if it was anything they did. We couldn't buy a basket early,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. Lillard finished with 30 points, hitting six 3s, but CJ McCollum had just five on 1-for-14 shooting. ""I think we defended hard. I think it was just another case of us struggling on the offensive end,"" Lillard said. ""We just weren't able to put up points."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: After scoring Portland's first points, Napier followed with a 3 and two free throws to account for the Blazers' first seven points. ... The crowd greeted former Sixer Evan Turner with a loud round of boos. The 76ers drafted Turner second overall in 2010. ... The Blazers had held seven of their last eight opponents under 100 points. ... Forward Al-Farouq Aminu (ankle) missed his ninth straight game. 76ers: The last time the Sixers took a 16-0 lead was Oct. 30, 2013, against Miami. They scored the game's first 19 points that night. ... Ben Simmons had three steals and has 35 on the season. Simmons finished with 16 points and nine assists. LILLARD UPSET Lillard attempted just three free throws, making two. ""I go to the rim a lot,"" he said. ""I'm getting smacked in my head, smacked on my shooting hand when I'm going to the basket. Guys knocking me to the ground every other play -- like hard. And they know I'm trying to score man. It's impossible for me to shoot two or three free throws. It's impossible."" WE WANT OKAFOR? In the game's final minute, the fans chanted ""We want Okafor!"" Seldom used big man Jahlil Okafor, the third overall pick in the 2015 draft, didn't get in the game and has played only two games this season.","400975006"
"Blake Griffin grabs the steal and hands it off to Austin Rivers, who completes the play with a two-hand slam. (0:21) ATLANTA --  After the Clippers lost games for more than three weeks and lost a player Wednesday, Blake Griffin had seen enough. ""The best part about tonight was just how we got the win,"" he said. ""We were banged up. We got awful news today, but guys just focused and did the little things we needed to do to get a win."" Griffin had 26 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, Wesley Johnson scored a season-high 24 points and Los Angeles snapped a nine-game skid with a 116-103 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. The Clippers had dropped 11 of 12 and learned before the game that starting guard Patrick Beverley is likely to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. But they overcame a monthlong struggle of closing out opponents, taking the lead for good on a pair of free throws by Lou Williams with 4:11 left in the third quarter. Los Angeles handed out a season-high 30 assists. ""I loved it -- 30 assists,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""We talked about it before the game. Without a point guard the team had the spirit of the pass. The ball was finding the open guy. I thought they did it all night."" Atlanta matched its biggest lead at seven on Dennis Schroder's 3-pointer with 7:49 left in the third. But the Hawks fell apart against the more talented Clippers, losing their third straight to drop to 3-15, worst in the Eastern Conference. Marco Belinelli finished with 20 points and Schroder added 19. ""A lot of their guys played well, but we have to do more to be disruptive, more to make it difficult for them,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We have to do a better job on that end of the court."" Johnson hit six of his first seven 3-point attempts and went 8 for 10 from the field. Williams finished with 20 points, and Austin Rivers added 18. DeAndre Jordan had 14 points and 16 rebounds. The closest Atlanta got in the fourth was within five points on Dewayne Dedmon's 3 with 5:53 remaining. Less than 3 minutes later, Griffin hit a 3 to put the Clippers up by 15. Johnson has stepped up his performance over the last four games, but he credited this outing to the team's collective energy in looking for the open man. ""I think that was the main thing,"" Johnson said. ""The ball was moving. I think we started out defensively the way we wanted to, but I think we picked it up in the second half."" TIP-INS Clippers: G Lou Williams, a productive sixth man for most of his career, made just his second start since he played for the Lakers in 2015-16. In 13 seasons, Williams has scored 8,599 points as a reserve, second only to Jamal Crawford among active players. Hawks: Rookie F John Collins, the 19th overall draft pick, made his first career start and finished with 14 points and team highs with 10 rebounds and 38 minutes. Collins got the nod with back tightness still bothering Luke Babbitt, but he could hold the job the rest of the season given that he's shooting over 58 percent from the field and consistently plays above the rim. BIG BLOW Beverley underwent a procedure Wednesday in Houston to repair a lateral meniscus. Beverley appeared in 11 games since arriving in the Chris Paul trade, averaging 12.2 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.73 steals and 30.3 minutes. ""It's a tough blow for the team, but it's worse for Patrick,"" Rivers said. ""We thought it would probably be just meniscus, but it turns out to be a lot more.""","400975007"
"MIAMI --  Dion Waiters watched his 3-point try bounce off the rim, ricochet off the top of the backboard, then hit the rim again and somehow drop through the net. It was a huge shot in the final moments, and a lucky one. That's what it took to end Boston's 16-game winning streak. Goran Dragic scored 27 points, Waiters had 26 with a pair of big 3-pointers in the final minutes and the Miami Heat held on to beat Boston 104-98 on Wednesday night and become the first team to beat the Celtics since Oct. 18. ""You can tell they were locked into this game,"" Celtics star Kyrie Irving said. ""They wanted it and proved it."" Boston trailed by as many as 18, and was down by 14 midway through the fourth quarter. Rallies were a hallmark throughout Boston's winning streak -- the Comeback Celtics had overcome 18-point deficits against Oklahoma City and Charlotte, a 17-point hole against Golden State, a 16-pointer against Atlanta and rallied from 13 down to win in Dallas earlier this week. They almost did it again. A 13-0 run got Boston to 91-90 with 3:14 left, and that's when Waiters took over. The next six points were his -- first the 3-pointer that bounced three times before falling, then another one from the left corner when the words of Heat coach Erik Spoelstra were echoing in his head. When Waiters drives and a bigger defender comes his way, he likes to go airborne for a pass or some sort of acrobatic layup. Spoelstra has tried to break him of that habit, and Waiters kept going all the way to the corner with the Celtics' Al Horford forced to cover him. Waiters created space, then let fly with a 3-pointer for a 97-90 lead. ""I knew I had what I wanted,"" Waiters said. For a change, so did the Heat. An up-and-down start to the season is on an upswing again, and Spoelstra -- who put Miami through two training-camp-type practices Monday and Tuesday after a 25-point home loss Sunday to Indiana -- moved on quickly after the win. ""Our identity is to be tough and we haven't shown that consistently enough,"" Spoelstra said. ""Pockets, here and there. It's that kind of effort to get a six-point win. Nothing is guaranteed, but that has to be what we embrace all the time. So, good. How about next game?"" Tyler Johnson scored 16 points for Miami, which shot 49 percent and outrebounded the Celtics 48-37. Irving scored 23 points for Boston. Jayson Tatum added 18, and Jaylen Brown and Marcus Morris each had 14. The Celtics started 0-2, and hadn't lost since. But coach Brad Stevens has insisted throughout that he hasn't spent any time thinking about the streak, keeping eyes instead on a bigger picture. ""Like I said, 16 straight is a little bit of a mirage,"" Stevens said. TIP-INS Celtics: Aron Baynes started for Morris, who wanted to test his problematic knee. Morris played 21 minutes off the bench. ... Boston turned Miami's first eight turnovers into exactly zero points. The Celtics wound up getting nine points off 16 Miami giveaways. ... Shane Larkin was shaken up briefly after taking a hard foul near the rim by Miami's Kelly Olynyk early in the fourth. Heat: Olynyk tried to shoot one over the backboard with 7:26 left after being forced to the baseline on a dribble. The shot wasn't close. ... A weird quirk: The Heat have played on all six Wednesdays so far this season -- and play on the next four as well. They won't get a Wednesday off until Dec. 27. ... The Miami Hurricanes, the No. 2 team in both the AP Top 25 and the College Football Playoff rankings, were at the game. STREAK ENDS The 16-game winning streak ended tied for the fourth-longest in Celtics history. Boston won 19 in a row in the 2008-09 season, 18 straight in 1981-82 and 17 straight in 1959-60. The other 16-game run was in 1964-65. In NBA history, 21 streaks have lasted longer than 16 games. WIN THE THIRD Miami won the third quarter 25-22, which doesn't sound like much -- but was significant to the Heat. That three-point margin, somewhat unbelievably, is their fourth-best in a third quarter this season. Miami had been outscored 60-29 in its previous two third quarters.","400975008"
"Enes Kanter slams it home on Serge Ibaka. (0:20) NEW YORK --  An eight-minute stretch of the third quarter was all the Knicks needed to turn a double-digit deficit into an insurmountable lead. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored a career-high 38 points, including 12 during a 28-0 run in the third that sent New York to a 108-100 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night. Kristaps Porzingis added 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks, who outscored the Raptors 41-10 in the decisive period. ""At halftime we had some strong words for each other, we talked about stuff we wanted to do better and we came out in the second half looking like a different team,"" Porzingis said. Kyle Lowry scored 25 points and DeMar DeRozan had 18 for the Raptors, who had their four-game winning streak snapped. The Raptors shot 0 for 13 from the field during that stretch, which began with Enes Kanter's layup with 10:28 left and didn't end until CJ Miles hit a 3-pointer with 2:23 remaining. ""They came out and overcame our energy, lack of energy, with their energy, and just put us on our heels,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""We couldn't make a shot, short-arming it, missed a couple of layups. They're coming out, scored what, five straight baskets, and again, you let a team like that get momentum as hard as they're playing, you put yourself in a hole."" The Knicks trailed 59-48 at halftime and were down 62-52 after Lowry's two free throws with 10:47 left in the third quarter. Kanter added five more points during the run, while Courtney Lee contributed seven of his 15 points. New York took its biggest lead at 89-69 on Doug McDermott's jumper with two seconds left in the third quarter. The Knicks still led by 18 when the Raptors went on a 12-0 run of their own to cut the deficit to 94-88. But Porzingis converted a three-point play with 5:25 left to end the run and also hit the next bucket, and the Knicks put it away soon after when Hardaway made a 3-pointer. ""I'm just taking what the defense gives me,"" Hardaway said. ""If I see a lane I'm just penetrating as hard as I can and trying to make the right play at the basket. I'm just playing off the big fella (Porzingis). You've got to keep him happy."" Toronto led most of the first half and DeRozan's layup with a second left put the Raptors up by 11 at halftime. ""They came out aggressive in the third quarter. We came out in a funk,"" DeRozan said. ""We couldn't make a basket and couldn't get a stop, and they took advantage of it. It happens. It's the NBA. Some team, some nights, have to go through it."" Hardaway and Lee each had game highs of seven assists.

Ariza scored a season-high 25 points, making 7 of 10 from beyond the arc, in the Houston Rockets' 125-95 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night. ""Tonight was my night,"" Ariza said with a grin. ""If those guys are out, call on me. I get it, rightfully."" Anderson (illness) and Gordon (right calf tightness) average 17.8 3-point attempts per game, but Ariza was more than happy to pick up the slack. Chris Paul made 4 of 7 from 3 and had 23 points and 12 assists, while James Harden added 21 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. After missing a month because of a knee injury sustained in the season opener, Paul has re-entered Houston's rotation seamlessly. ""With the court open like that, we can get into the lane, but we've got options,"" Paul said. ""We've got lobs, we've got floaters, we've got whatever's there."" The Rockets have won nine of their last 10 games, and beat Denver for the fifth straight time after sweeping the series 4-0 last season. Houston led 75-40 at the half, the Rockets' largest halftime lead of the season. In a scary moment for Denver midway through the second quarter, Nikola Jokic fell to the ground following a tipped layup with a non-contact injury. He limped off the court to the locker room but returned later in the quarter. ""I was really worried,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""To see Nikola go down like that and have no idea how serious it was going to be, you can tell the competitor he is.

"Harrison Barnes hits a 3-pointer at the buzzer to lead the Mavericks to a 95-94 win over the Grizzlies. (0:33) MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Harrison Barnes admitted he didn't call glass. It didn't matter. Barnes banked a 30-footer as the horn sounded and the Dallas Mavericks escaped with a 95-94 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night. The shot -- reviewed by officials to make sure it was released in time -- came after Memphis had taken a 94-92 lead with a half-second left. ""The biggest thing on my mind was to just give it a chance, throw it at the rim,"" Barnes said about the shot after the inbounds pass from Dennis Smith.

"DeMarcus Cousins goes through the lane and finishes with a huge slam. (0:17) NEW ORLEANS -- DeMarcus Cousins remains very bullish on the Pelicans' potential. New Orleans' response to being down double digits early to normally steady San Antonio offered evidence to back up Cousins' forecast. Anthony Davis had 29 points and 11 rebounds, Cousins added 24 points and 15 rebounds, and the Pelicans turned an early 15-point hole into a 30-point lead before cruising to a 107-90 victory over the Spurs on Wednesday night. ""We'll be scary. This is basically a brand new team, a brand new identity,"" Cousins said, noting that starting point guard Rajon Rondo has only played in five games after missing the first 13 with a core muscle injury. ""With Rajon coming back ... now we've got to find a whole new way of playing -- not saying we're switching up our style but just getting him accustomed to playing with us and us playing with him."" Rondo played less than 23 minutes, scoring six points to go with five rebounds and four assists, but the Pelicans appeared more fluid and organized when he was in the game, particularly on the defensive end.

Gasol was called for three fouls in the second quarter and was subbed out with his team clinging to a 40-39 lead. By halftime, New Orleans led 50-42. The Pelicans ""played well for three quarters. They were the more aggressive team and they made shots, executed well,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""We played very unwisely in a lot of different situations for the last three quarters."" Rudy Gay scored 19 points for the Spurs, who led 17-2 on Patty Mills' 22-foot jumper about half way through the first quarter. New Orleans closed the first half on a 15-2 run during which Davis had six points on a 10-foot jumper, a finger roll and alley-oop dunk. The Pelicans blew the game open by closing the third quarter with a 26-6 run fueled largely by Davis, who scored 12 of his points in the period and also had a steal to set up one of Miller's 3s. ""They just picked up their intensity and we never picked up ours,"" Aldridge said. We had turnovers and did not move the ball as well, so they were able to take advantage of that. ... They outplayed us tonight."" TIP-INS Spurs: Dejounte Murray scored 14 points and Kyle Anderson had 12 points. ... Gasol was San Antonio's leading rebounder with nine. ... Gasol was 7 of 11 shooting, including 3 of 5 from 3-point range. ... The Spurs lost for just the third time in 10 games. Pelicans: Cousins received his fourth technical foul this season for criticizing officials after no foul was called when the ball was tipped away from him. ... Cousins attempted seven 3s, making one. He also turned the ball over six times. ... New Orleans outrebounded San Antonio 45-39 and outscored the Spurs 50-36 in the paint. MOVING UP Davis, now in his sixth NBA season, reached 7,938 career points with his last basket against the Spurs. That moved Davis into second in scoring in New Orleans franchise history ahead of Chris Paul, who had 7,936 in six seasons from 2005-06 to 2010-11. ""It's not even a full six years in and to be 24 and do it, it's great,"" Davis said. ""We want to bring championships here, and do way more.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook said in the buildup before playing ex-teammate Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors that it was just another game. His play said otherwise. The reigning MVP scored a season-high 34 points and added 10 rebounds and nine assists to help the Oklahoma City Thunder roll past the Warriors, 108-91 on Wednesday night. It was Oklahoma City's first win over Golden State since Durant left the Thunder to join the Warriors after the 2015-16 season. Golden State won all four meetings last season by an average of nearly 20 points. Westbrook, who usually is animated anyway, was more talkative on the court than usual. At one point in the third quarter, Westbrook and Durant went forehead to forehead and were called for double technicals. Westbrook downplayed the incident later. ""I play the same way every night if it's against Kevin or if it's against Detroit,"" he said. ""It don't matter who it is. On the court I have no friends. The only friend I have is the basketball. That's it. And obviously my teammates, but I go out to compete and to guard and play at a high level. I've been that way since day one and that's what I do."" Durant enjoyed the chatter. ""Man, it's just ball,"" Durant said. ""He's competitive, I'm competitive. We like to go at it, both of us, and that's just a part of the game."" Oklahoma City's fans are still sore over Durant's departure. They booed him nearly every time he touched the ball. He finished with 21 points on 8-for-17 shooting. Stephen Curry scored 24 points for the Warriors, who produced their second-lowest point total of the season. Westbrook's new All-Star teammates came through. Carmelo Anthony scored 22 points and Paul George added 20. ""They're amazing talents,"" Curry said. ""They've been playing at a high level in their careers all throughout. It's a little different. Obviously what Russ does is pretty much the same, but you've got to understand how they try to work off of each other and play solid one-on-one defense. For the most part, I don't think we did that well tonight, and you've got to be ready for that challenge because they do keep coming at you."" It was a much-needed victory for the Thunder, who have struggled to an 8-9 start. ""It's just great to get a win,"" Westbrook said. ""That's it. Just one game at a time."" The Thunder led 65-48 at halftime as Westbrook filled the stat sheet with 20 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Anthony had 16 points and George had 14 at the break. Oklahoma City held the Warriors to 42 percent shooting in the first half and forced them into 10 turnovers. The home crowd gave the Thunder a standing ovation as they walked off the floor. Early in the third quarter, Westbrook had a steal and dunk, then a steal and layup plus a foul that brought the crowd to its feet. He made the free throw to put the Thunder ahead 72-52. Oklahoma City led 94-71 at the end of the third and Warriors coach Steve Kerr pulled his starters with about eight minutes remaining. ""They got into a rhythm, the crowd got into the game, we turned the ball over and let them get off for easy layups,"" Durant said. --- TIP-INS Warriors: Klay Thompson scored just nine points. He entered the game averaging 20.1. ... Kerr was called for a technical with 5:59 left in the third quarter. Draymond Green got one with 5:06 left in the third. Thunder: Westbrook had 11 points, five rebounds and five assists in the first quarter. ... C Steven Adams had 14 points and 12 rebounds. ... Forced 22 turnovers.

The wins have been by an average of 17.8 points. The losses have been by an average of 5.7. QUOTABLE Durant: ""The story's about the game. They kicked our (expletive), they played a great game. You should give them credit for how they played and we should be better. It's not about who's in each other's faces. That stuff is not real, so please don't believe it.

"DeAndre Liggins knocks down the shot from the corner as the shot clock buzzes as the Bucks beat the Suns in overtime. (0:20) PHOENIX -- Eric Bledsoe expected the boos from Phoenix fans and he heard them. Amid the fans' wrath for the way his time with the Suns ended, the veteran guard went out and had his best game as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks. Khris Middleton scored 40 points and Bledsoe added 30 in his return to the desert 15 days after being traded, leading the short-handed Bucks to a 113-107 overtime victory over the Suns on Wednesday night. ""My teammates did a hell of a job. I couldn't credit them any more. As much as I wanted to win this game, they had my back,"" Bledsoe said. ""It is what it is. They're just cheering for their team, doing what they are supposed to do. You can't blame them for that."" Devin Booker led the Suns with 23 points and hit a long 3-pointer as time expired in the fourth quarter to force overtime. But the Suns had four of their season-high 29 turnovers in overtime and shot 1-for-8 in the extra period. Suns coach Jay Triano said the mistakes were the difference in the game, and Booker agreed. ""From the first half on they were just really physical,"" Booker said of the Bucks' defensive pressure. ""We had 29 turnovers, it's hard to win a game like that ... but we didn't execute down the stretch."" Booker missed a chance to tie it with 7.5 seconds left in the extra session, and Middleton made four free throws to seal the Bucks' ninth victory of the season. ""Playing hard, getting stats when we need to, and rebounding,"" Middleton said. ""On the offensive end it was just grind it out, try to get the best shot."" The teams played a back-and-forth final quarter with Phoenix leading by as many as four. Milwaukee tied it at 99 on Thon Maker's jumper with 1:11 to play. The Suns trailed by 15 points in the third quarter against a Milwaukee team missing leading scorer Giannis Antetokounmpo and four other players. Antetokounmpo was listed as having right knee soreness. The star forward, second in the NBA in scoring at 29.7 points per game, had played at least 35 minutes in each of his past five games. Bledsoe was traded to Milwaukee on Nov. 7 in the deal that brought center Greg Monroe to the Suns. Monroe had 22 points and 15 rebounds. ""I felt comfortable. I was just trying to be aggressive every time I touched the ball,"" Monroe said. T.J. Warren added 20 points with 11 rebounds for the Suns. Bledsoe scored 11 of his 17 first-half points in the second quarter, and Middleton had 18 at halftime. Milwaukee led 54-44 at the break. The Suns rallied and took a 70-69 lead on the second of back-to-back 3s from Dragan Bender at the 4:02 mark of the third quarter. But the Bucks went on a 15-5 run helped by a technical foul on Booker, who was unhappy with an offensive foul call for his fourth personal, and took an 84-75 lead into the fourth quarter. BOOS FOR 'BLED' Bledsoe was directed to stay away from the Suns in October after a tweet that seemed to indicate a desire to not be with the team, and he was eventually traded. Suns fans greeted Bledsoe with a mixture of cheers and boos when he was introduced in the starting lineup, and he received a round of boos when he touched the ball. Several fans sitting near courtside held large signs with messages that took shots at Bledsoe. ""I thought he did great,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""It's not easy to come back where you played so soon."" MONROE MAKES GOOD Monroe came off the bench for the Suns and said he felt he had an advantage inside against his former team. ""I think he felt he was pretty confident he could score inside against these guys,"" Triano said. ""We knew they would have a hard time stopping him.""

"SALT LAKE CITY --  When Utah gets the engine running on the perimeter, it doesn't take long to race away from an opponent. The Jazz beat the Chicago Bulls 110-80 on Wednesday night, winning by 30 or more for the second time in three games. Utah beat Orlando by 40 points on Saturday. In both cases, the Jazz carved out huge leads behind strong perimeter shooting. Against Chicago, the Jazz went 11 of 22 from the outside during the second and third quarters. ""The ball was pinging around,"" guard Rodney Hood said. ""We had them chasing us around by moving the ball. We drove close-outs, which is big, and we found the open guy. If we continue to do that, we make the game easier for us and it's just a matter of us making or missing."" Derrick Favors scored 23 points, Hood added 19 and Alec Burks chipped in 15 points for the Jazz. Utah (8-11) snapped a three-game losing streak to Chicago extending back to the 2015-16 season. Robin Lopez scored 15 points and Bobby Portis added 14 points and eight rebounds off the bench for the Bulls. Justin Holiday and Kris Dunn chipped in 12 points apiece. Chicago (3-13) dropped to 0-3 on its Western road trip. Utah initially carved out a 35-28 lead behind back-to-back 3-pointers from Hood and Thabo Sefolosha. Chicago answered with an 8-0 run and took a one-point lead on a backdoor layup from Dunn. The Jazz surged back in front on back-to-back 3-pointers from Joe Ingles and Raul Neto and an alley-oop dunk from Donovan Mitchell. Utah scored on four straight possessions before halftime. Hood hit a floater and banked in another jumper, while Favors scored back-to-back baskets to give the Jazz a 55-46 lead going into the break. ""They amped up their pressure, amped up their physicality and they just dominated us from that point forward,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""Really, at the start of the second quarter, took us out of anything we wanted to do. We weren't getting into bodies. We weren't getting ourselves open. They were getting whatever they wanted on the other end."" Once the Jazz found a rhythm outside, they kept it going through the third quarter. Back-to-back 3-pointers from Jonas Jerebko and Ingles extended Utah's lead to 67-53. Consecutive 3-pointers from Hood put the Jazz up 82-60 later in the quarter. Ball movement keyed it all. Utah had 23 assists on 40 field goals. ""I loved how we shared the ball the whole game,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""You could feel it."" TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago coughed up 16 turnovers, leading to 22 points for Utah. The Bulls forced just seven turnovers. . Forward Lauri Markkanen finished with just three points on 1-of-9 shooting. Markkanen is the only NBA rookie leading his team both in scoring and rebounding this season. Jazz: Mitchell shot just 1 of 10 from the field and finished with four points, but he also had five rebounds and seven assists. . Utah received 51 bench points. It is the second time in three games the Jazz second unit eclipsed the 50-point mark. HAVING FUN AGAIN With no lingering injuries setting him back this season, Favors is quietly emerging as a force on both ends of the court again. A knee injury to Rudy Gobert has forced Favors to shoulder a bigger load on both offense and defense. He has responded well to the challenge thus far. In his last four games, Favors is averaging 18.0 points and 8.0 rebounds. ""I was hurt last year,"" Favors said. ""It was miserable. Definitely I'm having a lot more fun. Appreciate being out there on the court more now since I couldn't do much last year. SHOOTING WOES Chicago shot 37 percent and has been held below 40 percent over the last three games. For the season, Chicago is last in the NBA at 41 percent. Utah held Chicago to just 31 second-half points. ""They were the more physical team tonight,"" Portis said. ""When we're not making shots, we need to lock in on the defensive end.""","400975016"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Squaring off against fellow rookie Lonzo Ball for the first time in the NBA didn't mean nearly as much to the Kings' De'Aaron Fox as beating the Lakers. Even though it's his first year in Sacramento, Fox is well aware of the long-standing rivalry between the two Pacific Division foes. Zach Randolph had 22 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, Willie Cauley-Stein added 26 points and the Kings beat the Los Angeles Lakers 113-102 on Wednesday night. Fox scored 13 points in his first game against Ball since both entered the NBA as top-five picks in June. ""It was more sweet for the city just beating the Lakers,"" Fox said. ""I know about the rivalry. We came out knowing that this is a game we had to get."" Buddy Hield added 10 points for Sacramento, including a pair of 3-pointers during a 15-5 run to open the fourth quarter. Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 14 and Frank Mason added 11. The Kings trailed briefly in the first quarter but took the lead on Randolph's up-and-under basket past Brook Lopez and slowly pulled away after that. Sacramento led by as many as 20 and dominated Los Angeles on the boards. That continued a strange pattern for the Kings, who are 1-9 on the road but 4-4 at home. Those four wins have come against Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Portland and Los Angeles. ""That's one of the more complete games we've played, from start to finish,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""We withstood their runs, we got some loose balls and we kept them off the glass pretty effectively."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 20 points, Kyle Kuzma had 17 and Ball had 11 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds for the Lakers. Los Angeles was playing the second half of a back-to-back after rallying from 19 down to beat the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday. ""When Sacramento started hitting some of their (shots) and made the little run they went on at the end of the first, it kind of felt like we fell apart and stopped trusting what we were doing,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""We were kind of scrambling to stay within striking distance."" The game was billed as a matchup between 19-year-old rookies Ball and Fox, the second and fifth overall picks who were playing against each other for the first time as pros after squaring off twice last season in college. Both had their moments, though Ball's one-handed alley-oop dunk in the second quarter clearly stood out. He also made a 3-pointer late in the fourth that brought the Lakers within 106-92. Ball finished 4 of 8 while Fox went 5 of 11. ""It was a lot of fun playing against him. It's always fun,"" Ball said. ""The crowd loves it and all the fans and stuff, so it's good for basketball. He played great tonight."" Randolph got the Kings off to a fast start with 11 points in the opening 7 1/2 minutes, while Bogdanovic and Mason added six points apiece as part of a 16-2 run to close out the first quarter that put Sacramento up 31-19. TIP-INS Lakers: Los Angeles was outrebounded 44-32. . Caldwell-Pope made 4 of 6 3-pointers. As a team the Lakers made 15 of 29 beyond the arc. Kings: Fox missed five of his first seven shots, including two airballs. . Hield returned from an ankle injury, while Vince Carter also played after missing seven games with a kidney stone. PULLING AWAY IN THE FOURTH Los Angeles made a final push and trimmed the lead to single digits going into the fourth before the Kings pulled away behind Cauley-Stein's big fourth quarter. Sacramento's 7-footer scored 13 points over the final 10  1/2 minutes, when he went 5 of 5 from the floor. ""I think that gives us the best chance of winning or being in games, is if I'm playing super aggressive, putting a lot of pressure on the rim,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""It's a lot of fun to watch and it's a lot more fun to play that way."" MISSED DUNK On a night when it seemed like everyone made a dunk, Kuzma missed his. The Lakers rookie looked to be headed for an easy breakaway dunk in the third quarter but the ball hit the back of the rim and ricocheted near midcourt.","400975017"
"NEW YORK -- Jusuf Nurkic apologized to Damian Lillard as they strolled back to their locker room, upset he had missed two free throws with less the three seconds left, giving the Brooklyn Nets a chance to either tie or win it at the buzzer. All Lillard could care about was Nurkic's heads up play a couple of seconds earlier that eventually served as the game-winner. Lillard scored 34, Nurkic added 29 and 15 rebounds, including eight in the fourth quarter, and the Portland Trail Blazers rallied from a six-point deficit late in the fourth quarter to edge the Nets 127-125 on Friday. ""After the game he was telling me, `Man, my bad I missed the free throws, I did this and I this that',"" Lillard recalled. ""I stopped in the hallway, I said, `I don't care about none of that, the most important thing is you made the biggest play of the game'."" Portland trailed 121-115 with 2:20 left after former Trail Blazers' guard Allen Crabbe floater. The Trail Blazers then scored the next eight points, capped by Shabbaz Nappier's three-point play with 55 seconds left. Brooklyn's Spencer Dinwiddie then evened it 123 with a putback layup after missing his own 15-foot pullup shot. Lillard then freed himself off Dinwiddie's tight defense as Nurkic set a pick at the 3-point arc, diving to the basket as the Portland point guard served him the ball. DeMarre Carroll then slid in to help on the coverage, blocking Nurkic right under the basket. Caris Levert briefly had control of the ball before the Trail Blazers' center snatched it away and put it through, drawing a foul and capping a three-point play with 27 seconds left to put his team ahead for good, 126-123. ""I learned never quit,"" said Nurkic, who had eight rebounds and two of his four blocks in the final period. ""There's no lost possession. I see an opportunity to steal the ball and try to make a play. It (went) in."" Despite Lillard's words of encouragement, he was still beating himself for making 5 of 10 free throws. ""I know I am a way better free throw (shooter) than I am showing,"" said Nurkic. CJ McCollum chipped in 26 for the Trail Blazers, who found themselves down by 11 in the first quarter in a post-Thanksgiving noon tip. The Trail Blazers' defense held the Nets 0 for 5 from the field during their key fourth quarter 8-0 run, two days after a disappointing 20-point loss at Philadelphia. ""We made some good defensive stops in the last minute and a half and were able to convert in the other direction,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. Dinwiddie had 23 for the Nets, who have lost three straight games -- the previous two to the defending champions, Golden State Warriors, and Cleveland Cavaliers. After cutting Portland's lead to 126-125 with 15.7 seconds, he had a chance to put the Nets ahead but missed a 3-pointer with 4:8 seconds left. ""I felt like it was a good look,"" Dinwiddie said. ""It bounced around the rim a couple of times but didn't go in."" Brooklyn had six other players score in double-figures, including Rondae-Hollis Jefferson had 17. Sean Kilpatrick added 14 and Joe Harris scored 14. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Reserve forward Al-Farouq Aminu remained out again with a sprained right ankle he suffered during a game Nov. 1. He's missed his last 10 games. Nets: DeMarre Carroll, Tyler Zeller and Trevor Booker each had 10 points for the Nets.

"ATLANTA --  Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer has been waiting for his young team to notch a signature home victory against a quality opponent. Now Budenholzer has a teaching point to use for the rest of a long season ahead. ""Of course we'd like to start better than giving up 39 in the first quarter,"" Budenholzer said. ""But defensively we found a way to get better. Guys played harder, competed better. The offense maintained itself throughout the game."" Dennis Schroder scored 26 points and the Hawks used a 30-point third quarter to snap a three-game losing streak and beat New York 116-104 on Friday night. The rebuilding Hawks, last in the Eastern Conference with a 4-15 record, earned just their second home win by outhustling New York with a 24-5 advantage in second-chance points. Kristaps Porzingis finished with 28 points and Courtney Lee added 26 for the Knicks, who led by 17 in the first quarter. New York's bench was outscored 37-16 as Marco Belinelli had 15 points and Ersan Ilyasova scored 10 for Atlanta. The Knicks, falling to 1-5 on the road, never led after Ilyasova's 3-pointer with 4:21 left in the third quarter. They were up by eight at halftime. ""Late in the second quarter and the entire second half, we kind of imposed our will, beat them to 50-50 balls,"" Atlanta guard Kent Bazemore said. ""Porzingis had a good night, but he was making some tough shots. Those things kind of catch up."" Lee, in his highest-scoring game in two years with the Knicks, hit his first eight shots and finished 11 for 14 from the field, but he took just one shot in the fourth, a layup that made it 98-93. What started as bad execution in allowing 35 points in the second quarter became a total breakdown for New York's defense in the third. Lee knows his team can't afford to slack off defensively. ""Just make the extra effort,"" Lee said. ""Compete, box out, rotate, help each other out. If we do those things and take away those open 3-point shots and roads to the basket and get some of those loose balls, we win this game."" New York struggled all night to contain Schroder, who easily weaved through the lane and around the baseline to keep the Hawks' passing game fluid. The fourth-year point guard finished with eight assists, and often whipped the ball around to set up assists. ""Schroder does a great job coming off those pick-and-rolls,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""And he's got a lot of hesitation and he's able to find their bigs. Other times, when we did help out properly and stop him, he made great passes."" Tim Hardaway Jr., in his first game back at Philips Arena since leaving Atlanta as a free agent last summer, scored 22 points. Dewayne Dedmon had 16 points and Taurean Prince and John Collins each scored 13 for the Hawks. Dedmon, at 7-foot is just three inches shorter than Porzingis, so the Atlanta center had no trouble getting physical inside. Porzingis got frustrated in the fourth, drawing a technical foul immediately after Bazemore fed Dedmon for a reverse layup that made it 102-95. ""That good start that we had in the game was actually a curse to us,"" Porzingis said. ""We were feeling good on offense, but our defense wasn't there. We relaxed a little bit. The shots weren't falling anymore."" TIP-INS Knicks: C Enes Kanter woke up with back spasms Friday and didn't play. Kanter, who averages 13.6 points and a team-high 10.2 rebounds, had started in all 17 of New York's games. Kyle O'Quinn started in Kanter's spot and had two points and six rebounds in 23 minutes. ... The Hawks showed a brief video tribute to Hardaway, who played the last two seasons with Atlanta, during a first-quarter timeout. Most of the resulting cheers came from several thousand Knicks fans in the building. Hawks: F Tyler Cavanaugh is proving worthy of extra minutes in a reserve role. The rookie from George Washington had eight points in 12 minutes. His putback against Willy Hernangomez put the Hawks up 93-89 in the fourth and then he added a left corner 3 to make it 98-89.","400975019"
"BOSTON --  Even as they won 16 games in a row, the Boston Celtics didn't make it easy on themselves. A 16-point deficit against Atlanta. Down 13 in the fourth to Dallas. Double-digit deficits in three straight games, in fact, that Boston erased en route to the fourth-longest winning streak in franchise history. The Celtics knew they couldn't continue to count on comebacks, and Friday night they didn't need one after opening with a blistering first quarter and coasting to a 118-103 victory over the Orlando Magic. ""Our guys came out focused, ready to play,"" said Al Horford, who had seven of his career high-tying 10 assists in the first quarter. ""We finally got a (first) half going. That first half was the key for us winning that game."" One game after their 16-game winning streak ended, the Celtics sent the Magic to their seventh straight loss. Kyrie Irving had 17 of his 30 points before halftime as Boston scored 40 points in the first quarter and 73 by the half to rebound from its first loss in more than a month. Still wearing a mask after breaking a bone in his face on Nov. 10, Irving was 9 for 15 from the floor and sank all 10 of his free throw attempts, many with the sold-out crowd chanting ""M-V-P!"" Jalen Brown scored 10 points in the first quarter, when Boston opened a 14-point lead. Aron Baynes finished with 13 points and 11 rebounds -- his first double-double with the Celtics -- and Terry Rozier had a career-high 23 points. Jonathon Simmons scored 14 points and Nikola Vucevic had 12 points and 11 rebounds for Orlando. Aaron Gordon, who was 2 for 10 from the field, said the Magic didn't play like they were eager to end their slide. ""We played like it was just another game,"" he said. ""We didn't play like they were the first in the East and we are on a losing streak."" Orlando scored the first four points of the game and trailed by just four with less than four minutes left in the first before Boston scored 16 of the next 20 points to take a 40-24 lead. Leading 42-30 early in the second, the Celtics went on an 11-2 run and later got back-to-back 3-pointers from Rozier to open a 28-point lead. ""We're not good enough defensively right now,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""And Boston was clicking on all cylinders."" ROSIE OUTLOOK Rozier said he wasn't keeping track of his career high, and he certainly didn't seem on the verge of a breakout after scoring 22 points in his previous five games combined. ""I'm not perfect,"" he said. ""I'm going to have tough games. (But) I'll have games like this."" THE FOURTH Trailing 99-69 after three, the Magic outscored Boston 34-19 in the fourth quarter, when four of the five Celtics starters remained on the bench. Vogel was unimpressed. ""You're talking about garbage time,"" he said. TIP-INS Magic: Guard Shelvin Mack played for Celtics coach Brad Stevens at Butler. ... The Magic have lost 14 in a row in Boston. Celtics: The Celtics wore their black jerseys for the first time this season. Marcus Morris got the start, which means he is likely to sit out Saturday night's game against the Pacers.

""I'm a little weird sometimes,"" he said. ""I wasn't playing well, to my standards. I wanted to try and make my second half better than my first half and I was able to make a couple of plays."" For Black Friday, the Cavaliers wore black uniforms. Cleveland also wore black jerseys when it won the first championship in franchise history, but the current edition is minus the sleeves from Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. James is 41-6 in the regular season against Charlotte and the Cavaliers have won 12 of 13, including eight straight against the Hornets. After Smith split a pair from the line, both teams missed 3-point attempts and Charlotte called time with 11.1 seconds left. Jeremy Lamb missed a 3-pointer after the Hornets inbounded at midcourt and the rebound was tapped out to Kemba Walker, but his 3-point attempt fell well short after James got a hand on the shot. James forced Walker to pass the ball on the inbounds play, but the Hornets had one last chance when after Marvin Williams batted the rebound toward midcourt. ""I looked up at the timer and there was still one second left,"" James said. ""I just tried to fly to get another contest. We were able to get the stop that we needed."" Smith had 16 points, while Kevin Love had 11 points and 13 rebounds for Cleveland. Dwight Howard had 20 points and 13 rebounds for Charlotte, which fell to 1-8 on the road. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marvin Williams scored 17 points for the Hornets, whose three-game winning streak ended. ""That's the way Cleveland plays. They're a battle-tested team with those guys,"" Williams said. ""That's why they've been to the Finals three straight years and LeBron has been there seven straight years."" Howard's two free throws and Kidd-Gilchrist's layup following James' turnover gave Charlotte a 98-93 lead. James made a foul shot and converted a three-point play, cutting the lead to one. Kidd-Gilchrist hit a free throw but James scored on a drive that tied the game with 1:48 left. Cavaliers point guard Derrick Rose left the team earlier this week to handle a personal matter. Coach Tyronn Lue expects Rose, who has played in just seven of Cleveland's 19 games this season because of a left ankle injury, to return to the team. TIP-INS Hornets: G Nicolas Batum (bruised left elbow) was unavailable after being re-injured Wednesday against Washington and is day to day. He has only played in five games because of elbow injuries. Lamb returned to the starting lineup in Batum's spot. ... Charlotte's only road win came against Memphis on Oct. 30. Cavaliers: Rose sustained his injury while driving to the basket on Oct. 20 in Milwaukee. He's averaging 14.3 points in his first season with Cleveland. ... G Iman Shumpert (sore left knee) could return Monday after missing his third straight game. LATE NUMBERS Howard missed all three of his field goal attempts in the fourth quarter, but was 5 of 6 at the free throw line. He was 6 of 9 for the game. ""They double-teamed me when I got the ball and didn't allow me to get into a good rhythm down the stretch,"" he said. BIG STOPS Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue was pleased with the Cavaliers' defense down the stretch ""The guys understand what we're doing and what we want,"" he said. ""In the second half we held them to 42 points, which was great.""","400975021"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  When Victor Oladipo went out, Lance Stephenson stepped up. Stephenson scored 13 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter to help the Indiana Pacers win their fifth straight, 107-104 over the Toronto Raptors on Friday night. Oladipo scored a team-high 21 points before exiting the game with a knee injury midway through the fourth quarter. He entered the game as Indiana's leading scorer with 22.9 points per game. Stephenson averaged 6.2 points through the first month of the season, ""It worked out,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said of the impromptu substitution. ""Victor's knee was bothering him and Lance was playing well. Victor wanted to go back in but he didn't seem confident. He was feeling soreness and wanted to give it a try, but Lance was playing good basketball so I decided to make that decision for him and stay with Lance."" Stephenson played sparingly throughout the first three quarters, but was extremely efficient, shooting 7 for 9 from the field, including 4 for 4 from 3-point range. He hit back-to-back 3-pointers to give Indiana a 103-92 lead with 4:06 remaining. ""Whatever the coach calls me to do, I am ready for the mission,"" Stephenson said. ""That's just being ready ... Just being patient and being ready at all times. Just be that spark off the bench."" Indiana outscored the Raptors 31-20 in the third quarter to take a one-point lead, and Stephenson took over from there. He connected on six of his final seven field goal attempts, including the back-to-back 3-pointers, which electrified the home crowd and gave Indiana its largest lead of the half. ""I get my energy from the crowd,"" Stephenson said. ""When the crowd tells me `let's go, get it going,' I just feel like the power is in me."" Kyle Lowry scored 12 of his 24 points in the second quarter as Toronto outscored Indiana 35-21, giving the Raptors a 60-50 halftime lead. Toronto coach Dwane Casey criticized the Raptors' slow start to the second half, which has plagued the team in recent weeks. ""The third quarter has been our Achilles heel and it was again tonight,"" Casey said. ""We have to figure out something to get started again. We played too well in the first half to not sustain it and for whatever reason we come out with that approach like we think the game is over and we can't do that."" Toronto had a chance to tie after Myles Turner missed the second of two free throw attempts with six seconds remaining, but Fred VanVleet's 3-pointer at the buzzer clanked off the backboard. Turner finished seven points and a team-best 10 rebounds, and VanVleet had a career-high 16 points to go with five rebounds and four assists in 29 minutes off the bench. Indiana opened the game shooting 9 for 13 from the field, including 5 for 8 from 3-point range, but a string of turnovers and poor transition defense allowed Toronto to close the quarter on an 11-2 run. Bojan Bogdonavic added 19 points for Indiana, which had six players reach double figures. TIP-INS Raptors: Forward CJ Miles did not travel with the team after his wife gave birth to a girl Thursday evening. ... Toronto outrebounded Indiana 42-41 and shot nearly 50 percent from the field, but struggled from 3-point range, making just 9 of 30 attempts... Pacers: Indiana entered the game leading the NBA in 3-point percentage, shooting 40.4 percent from behind the arc. ... Domantis Sobonis added 13 points and six rebounds despite a poor shooting night. Sabonis shot just 2 for 10 from the field, but was 9 for 12 from the free throw line. ... Indiana improved to 9-2 when making at least 10 3-pointers. The Pacers were 11 for 26 behind the arc.","400975022"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Miami had seen its early lead slip away in Minnesota after a nearly perfect start shooting the ball. A 14-point advantage had dwindled to one. Wayne Ellington came off the bench and hit a 3-pointer, then another, and the Heat found their spark. Ellington scored 21 points and made six 3-pointers off the bench, Goran Dragic added 20 points and the Miami rode a season-best shooting performance from behind the arc to a 109-97 victory over the Timberwolves on Friday night. ""He's ignitable and he always has been,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He hits two then he's going for three and the whole team is looking for him. He has that kind of feel, but he exudes that energy. It's hard to explain. Guys know and feel when somebody's ignitable and you look for him."" Dragic was 5 of 8 from 3 as Miami hit a season-high 19 3-pointers on a season-high 39 attempts. Dion Waiters added 17 points, including a 3-of-8 mark from deep. ""I feel like it's contagious kind of, you know?"" Ellington said. ""Once you see that ball go in there from long range, it's like guys want to join the party."" Jimmy Butler, Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns each had 18 points for Minnesota, which has lost three of its past four games. Even after holding on for a 124-118 win on Wednesday against Orlando, the defense troubled Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau. Friday was more of the same as Minnesota couldn't handle Miami's screens to get shooters open. The 19 3-pointers were the most allowed by the Wolves this season. ""We haven't guarded anybody all year long,"" Butler said, adding: ""We've got to eventually figure it out and want to play defense, stop trying to outscore the opposing team. That starts with me and goes all the way down the line."" With Hassan Whiteside controlling the paint, Miami has taken the rest of its offense out to the arc this season. The Heat entered the game fifth in the league with 31.6 3-point attempts per game and were tied for seventh in 11.1 made 3s per game. Miami is averaging its most points from 3-pointers in franchise history, entering play with 33.2 percent of its total coming from beyond the arc. ""We can live with those shots,"" Dragic said of the ball movement leading to open 3s on Friday. ""Even if you miss, it's a good, open shot. As long as we get the trigger on the pick-and-roll and try to move the ball, then those are good shots because your feet are set."" The Heat opened the game hitting 10 of their first 13 attempts from the floor, including 4 of 6 from 3. TIP-INS Heat: Six players hit 3-pointers. The Heat's previous season high was 15 3s against Denver on Nov. 3. ... Ellington's season and career high for 3s in a game is seven on Nov. 19. ... Whiteside had 16 points and 10 rebounds for his eighth double-double of the season. Wolves: Aaron Brooks started in place of PG Jeff Teague. It was Brooks' first start since April 5, 2015, for Chicago. Tyus Jones started the second half at point guard and played a career-high 32 minutes with eight points, six rebounds and six assists. ... The Wolves were also without reserve forward Nemanja Bjelica due to a left mid-foot sprain. TEAGUE MISSING Teague was ruled out minutes before the game with a right Achilles injury. Teague is averaging 14.0 points and 7.5 assists this season and is coming off playing 37 minutes on Wednesday. Thibodeau said Teague's status is day to day and he'll be re-evaluated Saturday. TOO LATE Towns finished with 18 points, but 16 came in the fourth quarter after Miami had pulled away. Instead of using the 7-foot Whiteside, Spoelstra had 6-foot-7 Justice Winslow defend the 7-foot Towns from the opening tip. Winslow's tenacity and movement made it difficult for Towns to find any room, with Winslow denying Towns the ball by fronting the big man. ""He'll battle,"" Spoelstra said of Winslow. ""He set the tone at the beginning with his speed, his quickness, his physicality. Getting him off the block but also pressuring him up top."" Towns was scoreless in the first half on 0-for-5 shooting. ""They're looking for him,"" Thibodeau said. ""If he stands stationary you're not going to get the ball. You've got to keep moving. And you have to execute. He scored some at the end, but it was meaningless.""","400975023"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Another second-half collapse, another round of questions about Oklahoma City's finishing power. After dominating defending NBA champion Golden State from start to finish two days earlier, the Thunder wasted a big lead in a 99-98 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. Oklahoma City had a 10-point lead at the half and was up 15 midway through the third quarter before the Pistons stormed back, led by center Andre Drummond and bench players Ish Smith and Langston Galloway. ""In the first half, (Drummond) was not good. That's one of the reasons we were getting crushed,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said about. ""In the second half, he was much better and we made some big shots."" Detroit grabbed the lead for good midway through the fourth quarter and the Thunder missed 14 of their last 20 shots, including a final 27-footer by Russell Westbrook in the final three seconds that left Oklahoma City a point short. ""We're going to live and die with Russ taking that shot,"" Oklahoma City's Paul George said. ""He had a good look but it just didn't go in."" Westbrook had his sixth triple-double of the season for Oklahoma City with 27 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds. He missed a long 3-point attempt on the final possession to finish 1 of 10 from 3-point range and 10 of 29 from the field. Oklahoma City had numerous chances, missing three shots on one possession in the final minute. It was the eighth double-digit lead given up by the Thunder this season on their way to a loss. Smith finished with 15 points. ""Going into these buildings is going to be tough on us, but as long as we stay together and keep picking each other up, then we got a good chance,"" Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson said. ""It is always great to get a win on the road."" Carmelo Anthony had 20 points for Oklahoma City, and Paul George had 16. IMPRESSIVE RESUME Since the start of 2009-10 season, the Thunder have the fourth best overall winning percentage among the Big Four professional sports, trailing only the New England Patriots (NFL), San Antonio Spurs (NBA) and Green Bay Packers (NFL). WELCOME BACK? Former Thunder guard Jackson made his first appearance in OKC after missing both meetings last season due to injury. Jackson was booed lustily in pregame introductions and in the first half of the game.  His last appearance at Chesapeake Arena included a verbal altercation with a fan at courtside.","400975024"
"DENVER -- Nikola Jokic scored 14 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and had 13 rebounds and eight assists to help the Denver Nuggets beat the Memphis Grizzlies 104-92 on Friday night. Gary Harris and Jamal Murray added 15 points apiece, and Kenneth Faried had 14. The Nuggets won their fifth straight at home. JaMychal Green had 21 points for the Grizzlies in their seventh loss in a row. It's the longest losing streak for the Grizzlies since a seven-game skid from Nov. 1-11, 2009. It also was Memphis' first loss in its last five games in Denver. Marc Gasol and Tyreke Evans scored 15 points apiece for the Grizzlies. Trailing by 16 at the half, the Grizzlies put together an 11-0 run capped by Dillon Brooks' driving reverse layup to pull to 74-69 and outscored Denver 5-2 over the last 90 seconds of the third quarter to get within two points. Jokic scored three consecutive baskets to start the fourth to help the Nuggets regain some separation. His jumper off a feed from Harris put Denver up 88-79 with 6:31 remaining. Jokic and Juan Hernangomez each connected from 3-point range over the next 1 1-2 minutes and just like that Denver was leading 95-81. Memphis fought back to 97-89 on a 3-pointer by Mario Chalmers but the Nuggets closed the door in the last 1:38, getting a three-point play from Jokic and a put-back dunk by Faried to fend off the Grizzlies. Denver opened a 61-45 lead at halftime, getting nine-point quarters in the first from Murray and the second from Jokic to help etablish a double-digit advantage. TIP-INS Grizzlies: A left Achilles' tendon injury has forced Mike Conley to miss a fifth consecutive game. No o fficial word yet on when he's expected to return. ... Friday's contest marked David Fizdale's 100th career game as the Grizzlies' head coach. He is 140-50 since being hired ahead of the 2016-17 season.

"PHOENIX --  When Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins are rolling and their teammates' shots are falling, it's a good night for the New Orleans Pelicans. Mix in a lack of effort by an opponent, and Friday night was a very good night for New Orleans. Davis had 23 points and nine rebounds, Cousins added 19 points and 10 boards and the Pelicans routed the Phoenix Suns 115-91. Davis and Cousins sat out the fourth quarter, watching from the bench long after the outcome had been decided in the Pelicans' most one-sided victory of the season. ""The best thing was that we started the game the right way,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We had a couple of questionable possessions but I thought for the most par we moved the basketball, we took advantage of what they gave u and we managed the turnovers, which has gotten us in trouble."" New Orleans, coming off consecutive home victories over Oklahoma City and San Antonio, won its third straight with ease. Phoenix never mounted any threat after the opening minutes. The Pelicans led by a dozen after one quarter and 30 at the half. Jrue Holliday scored 18 points for the Pelicans, whose 72 points in the first two quarters was their highest-scoring half of the season. ""Whoever is open, that is who we pass the ball to,"" Davis said. ""We passed up a lot of good shots, great shots and trusted our teammate is going to make the shot, make the right plays. We don't care who scores, as long as the ball goes in the basket."" T.J. Warren had 18 points, and Tyler Ulis 17 for Phoenix. ""I feel like from the jump we really weren't playing hard,"" Ulis said. ""`You know, as a young team, we really can't come out cool and playing through the motions."" New Orleans was up 72-42 at the break, shooting 58 percent against the listless Suns, who ended a stretch of nine of 10 games at home. Davis and Cousins scored 15 apiece in the first half. The Pelicans made 9 of 14 3s in the first half, led by Darius Miller's 3 of 5. By contrast, Phoenix was 2 of 13 from 3-point range in the first half and wound up 2 of 20. Devin Booker made just 4 of 13 shots for Phoenix, missed all five of his 3-point tries, and scored 13. Suns interim coach Jay Triano said the team's first-half woes were a combination of poor shooting and bad defense. He can tolerate a poor shooting game. Those things happen, he said. But there wasn't an excuse for the effort. ""We had more energy at shoot-around this morning,"" Triano said. ""There's no excuse. Our energy at shoot-around this morning was better than it was in the game, and I think a lot of that is our resolve."" Or lack thereof. The Suns led 13-9 after Ulis' 13-foot floater in the lane, then the Pelicans began their offensive onslaught. New Orleans scored on seven consecutive possessions in a 16-2 run to go on top 25-15 on Cousins' driving finger-roll layup with 3:17 left in the first quarter. The rout was on. That run reached 33-10 when Miller sank a 3 to make it 42-23 with 8:46 left in the half. The Pelicans outscored the Suns 30-19 the rest of the half. New Orleans led by as many as 36 in the third quarter. COLD &amp; COLDER For the first time in an NBA game in more than two years, neither team made a 3-pointer in the one half of a game. The Pelicans were 0 for 12 in the second half, the Suns 0 for 7. The last time two teams went without a 3 in an entire half came when Orlando played at Washington on Feb. 9, 2015. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans won three of four against the Suns last season. Two went to into OT, a win for each team. ... Pelicans matched their season best with their third straight win. Suns: Suns started a ""twin tower"" lineup of Greg Monroe and Tyson Chandler to try to combat the inside game of Cousins and Davis. ... Phoenix ended a stretch where nine of 10 games were at home. Suns were 2-7 in those home contests.","400975026"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Two All-Stars down, the Splash Brothers took charge. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson showed some patience coach Steve Kerr appreciated. They made the perfect pass. They were efficient. They lit it up from all spots on the floor. ""Kind of back to who we are, moving the ball,"" Curry proclaimed. Curry found his stroke from way back and breezed past a 7-footer in the paint with authority, putting on a thrilling display with 33 points Friday to lead the Golden State Warriors over the Chicago Bulls 143-94 on a night Kevin Durant and Draymond Green were out. Curry and Thompson came to play with their fellow All-Stars out. NBA Finals MVP Durant was sidelined the second time in three games with a sprained left ankle, while Green didn't play for rest. Two-time MVP Curry notched his seventh career 30-point half and 21st 20-point quarter, when he scored 26 in the second as the Warriors matched their biggest half of the season with a 74-53 lead at intermission. Steph was feeling it, all right, following up a deep 3 in the second quarter with a high-step shuffle and chest pat before waving his hands in the air for the crowd to join the fun. And with Green's muscle flexing absent on this night, Curry drove left and over 7-foot Robin Lopez for a layup late in the second and was fouled. On the floor beneath the basket, he flexed his biceps in celebration. ""I don't get that opportunity,"" Curry said of the flex to celebrate going over Lopez for an and-one. ""I've done that plenty of times before. I was actually looking for Draymond wherever he was. He was back in the locker room. Hopefully he was watching it on TV."" Curry shot 10 for 18 with four 3-pointers, while Thompson added 29 points on 12-of-17 shooting with five 3s. Big man Zaza Pachulia had a season-best 11 points and career-high six assists. Rookie Jordan Bell made his first career start and had a quick one-handed slam -- this after being inactive in four of the past five games. Omri Casspi also started for short-handed Golden State coming off a 108-91 loss at Oklahoma City on Wednesday night. Scurrying back on defense, Bell made a pretty block from behind against a driving Denzel Valentine midway through the third and finished with six blocked shots in 26 minutes. Jerian Grant scored 21 points off the bench, Lauri Markkanen scored 14, and Valentine added 10 in the Bulls' fourth straight defeat and ninth in 10 as Chicago concluded a winless four-game road swing out West. ""They were getting whatever they wanted,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""You have to find a way to fight through that. If we don't learn that soon, we're going to keep getting our (butts) kicked."" Pachulia stole the ball from Lopez and drove to the basket as Lopez took him down with 4:25 remaining in the third and Pachulia hit his head on the padded base of the basket. The play went to official review and Lopez received a Flagrant 1 foul. Both teams shot 54 percent in the first quarter, but the Bulls were outscored 45-21 in the second quarter as they went 8 for 25 from the floor. TIP-INS Bulls: Chicago is 2-10 in November. ... The Bulls last won at Oracle Arena 113-111 in overtime on Jan. 27, 2015, snapping Golden State's 19-game home winning streak. Warriors: Kerr plans to rest Green from time to time as he sees fit, and had made the decision about a week ago -- then briefly reconsidered with Durant sidelined before sticking with the plan. ""It's something I'm going to do periodically during the year. Last year during The Finals I thought there were games where Draymond, we were almost piecing him together,"" Kerr said. ""Because of how hard he plays and because the nature of his game we just need to give him a rest once in a while. I planned this one a week ago."" ... Bell played his most minutes, topping his previous best of 12. ... Golden State is 5-0 after losses this season. ... The Warriors are 8-2 against the Eastern Conference, 6-1 at home. ... Two-way G Quinn Cook was back with Golden State from the G League and got a nice look in the blowout.

"CJHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Gregg Popovich felt the San Antonio Spurs caught a scheduling break playing Charlotte on Saturday, one night after the Hornets played on the road at Cleveland. It led to an easy night for the Spurs. Pau Gasol and LaMarcus Aldridge each had 17 points and seven rebounds, and San Antonio held the Hornets to 37 percent shooting in a lopsided 106-86 victory. ""That was a very difficult trip for the Hornets,"" Popovich said. ""It's like, basically unfair. Coming back after being in Cleveland, getting back that late and then having to play a seven o'clock game, that's a very difficult turnaround. All of us hate that particular deal. We all have to go through it, but we caught a break tonight."" Hornets coach Steve Clifford agreed. Sensing the Hornets had a chance to beat the Cavaliers on Friday night, Clifford played his starters extensively in the second half. The Hornets lost 100-99 to the Cavs and it ultimately may have cost them the game against the Spurs, too. The energy the Hornets played with at Cleveland was not there, and it seemed to show early on as they missed a variety of open shots while shooting 22 percent in the first half. ""Obviously it took a lot out of us,"" Clifford said of the Cleveland game. ""I played those guys huge minutes. I thought to start the game tonight we had the right attitude. We had very little legs."" Rudy Gay added 15 points for the Spurs, who snapped Charlotte's three-game home win streak. The Hornets entered the game 7-2 at the Spectrum Center, but missed 35 of 45 shots in the first half and fell behind by 11 at the break. They could never make a serious run at the Spurs. Kemba Walker, who left the game briefly in the third quarter with a left shoulder injury, returned to finish with 18 points on 8-of-12 shooting. He didn't get much help as Charlotte's four other starters -- Nic Batum, Dwight Howard, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marvin Williams -- were a combined 6 of 29 from the field. The Hornets cut the lead to 50-42 in the third quarter, but the Spurs responded with a 9-0 run highlighted by Kyle Anderson's steal and dunk. Charlotte could never cut the lead to single digits after that point. ""Just ball movement, making the extra pass, trying to get to the rim and just finding the open guy,"" Aldridge said. TIP-INS Spurs: Anderson tied a career high with five steals. ... Outscored the Hornets 22-8 in the paint in the first half. ... Shot 6 of 25 from 3-point range. Hornets: Howard was fined $35,000 by the NBA earlier in the day after making an obscene gesture to a fan during Friday night's 100-99 loss at Cleveland. .... Howard has 244 rebounds, the most any Charlotte player has had through the first 19 games of a season. KEMBA SCARE There was a scary moment in the third quarter when Walker went down with a left shoulder injury after colliding with Aldridge on a screen. Walker remained on the floor in the fetal position for about a minute before being helped up and taken to the locker room. He was diagnosed with a bruised left shoulder and returned to the game later in the quarter, but the Hornets were already down by 15. Clifford said he breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Walker return to the bench. Gasol sensed the Hornets were a little down when Walker left for the locker room. ""It seemed like it was something that potentially could have been something serious, then he comes back and he shows no sign of anything,"" Gasol said. ""I don't know exactly what happened there but he's their starting point guard and their best player."" UGLY QUARTER The first quarter might have been one of the ugliest of the season for both teams. The Hornets led 15-14 after 12 minutes despite hitting just 5 of 23 shots from the field. The Spurs weren't much better, converting just 6 of 23.","400975028"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Filling in for the injured Ben Simmons at point guard, T.J. McConnell had a plan. ""Anytime you see JJ open, give him the ball,"" he said. Smart decision. JJ Redick hit eight 3-pointers and scored 29 points, and the Philadelphia 76ers cruised without Simmons to a 130-111 victory over the skidding Orlando Magic on Saturday night. ""He's a point guard's dream when it comes to shooters,"" said McConnell, who had 15 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds. ""He's the best I've ever played with."" Joel Embiid shook off an illness that left him in bed all day to score 18 points and grab 14 rebounds, and the Sixers didn't miss a beat with Simmons missing his first game of the season with swelling in his left elbow. Redick hit six first-half 3s, four coming in the final 3:10 of the second quarter, as the Sixers built a 70-55 halftime lead. ""I kind of blacked out there in the second quarter,"" Redick said, smiling. ""No, when you hit a couple shots in a row, the ball is like a magnet and your teammates are kind of looking for you. . T.J. did a great job seeking me out."" Elfrid Payton had 22 points, eight rebounds and nine assists in another miserable defensive performance for the Magic, who have lost eight straight. ""Just not a good enough defensive disposition,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""We're not going to beat anybody giving up 130 points."" The Sixers shot 51 percent in winning their third straight game to move to 11-7 as they try to finally turn the corner after years of losing. Philadelphia, thinking it could finally compete this season, signed Redick to a one-year, $23 million contract in July. Redick said watching the Sixers' unselfishness in previous seasons attracted him. ""Sometimes with the intention of sort of, maybe not trying to win at times, but I like how they played,"" Redick said in a wink to the Sixers' ""Process"" rebuild. Redick, drafted 11th overall by the Magic in 2006, was part of a humming offense without their star rookie. Redick hit 10 of 18 shots, 12 of them 3-point attempts. After missing his first NBA season with a broken right foot, Simmons had played in the Sixers' first 17 games and been one of the league's top rookies. Sixers coach Brett Brown said his team would continue to play fast even without Simmons because advanced metrics show the Magic struggle when opponents push the pace. And defense was Vogel's biggest worry before the game, when he called his team's transition in Friday's loss to Boston ""garbage."" Asked if he would be quick to pull players who make defensive mistakes, he said, ""I would hope that I wouldn't have to coach that way, but they're showing me that I do."" Before the game was 4 minutes old, Vogel had yanked Payton and Aaron Gordon. ""Trying to teach,"" Vogel said. The moves didn't work, as the Magic allowed 70 first-half points a night after giving up 73 in Boston. Gordon scored 16 points and Nikola Vucevic added 14 points and 14 rebounds.

"WASHINGTON --  C.J. McCollum shook off foul trouble and the memory of some recent late misses to prove his clutch ability again on Saturday night. McCollum scored 26 points, including seven straight during a 10-0 game-closing run, to lift the Portland Trail Blazers to a stunning 108-105 comeback victory over the short-handed Washington Wizards. ""I have all the confidence in the world,"" McCollum said. ""And I can live with missing shots, and I can live with people saying that I'm not clutch. Because I know who I am. So it doesn't faze me."" Damian Lillard led with 29 points for Portland, which trailed by 17 points early in the fourth quarter, a night after another dramatic 127-125 victory at Brooklyn on Friday. Jusuf Nurkick had 17 points and Noah Vonleh grabbed 10 rebounds for the Blazers. But after some late misses earlier this season, it was McCollum who scored 24 of his 26 points after halftime, and 13 in the fourth quarter, while playing the last 8:53 with five fouls. His contested 20-foot fadeaway gave the Blazers a 106-105 lead for good with 21 seconds left. Earlier this season, McCollum missed two of his last five free throws in a 104-103 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Oct. 26, and a potential game-winning jumper in a 98-97 loss to Memphis on Nov. 8. ""Check the numbers,"" McCollum said. ""I might miss free throws every now and then, but my body of work, dating back to when I was in high school, I hit big shots. And I miss them sometimes."" Bradley Beal scored 26 points and Otto Porter added 24 points and 10 rebounds for Washington in the first game of what the team expects to be a two-week stretch without All-Star John Wall. The point guard received injections to treat left knee inflammation earlier Saturday. Beal missed a jumper to give Washington back the lead with 6.5 seconds left and a potential game-tying 3-point attempt at the buzzer. ""I guess there was just a little guy sitting on top of the rim knocking the ball out of there,"" Beal said. ""I definitely put it on my shoulders."" The Wizards led 94-77 before Portland put together a 20-7 run to close within four, and still had a seven-point lead when Markieff Morris was called for a flagrant foul with 1:32 to play. Nurkic hit one of two free throws to make it 105-99. Then McCollum hit a 3-pointer, a runner, and then the fadeaway over Porter's outstretched arm, giving the Blazers their first lead since the first quarter. ""When he sees the ball go in and he's moving like he was moving, he'll make anything,"" Lillard said. ""There's no such thing as a bad shot at that point."" Pat Connaughton added two free throws with 2.6 seconds remaining. WALL-KING GINGERLY Wall, 27, received platelet-rich plasma and viscosupplementation injections earlier Saturday in the hope of reducing his knee inflammation. A team statement said the injury occurred when Wall made knee-to-knee contact with another player during a Nov. 7 loss to Dallas. Wall had previously said fluid on his knee built up after he received IV fluids to deal with illness and migraines before a win against Atlanta on Nov. 11. ONLY ONE PAIR With Wall out, Portland's backcourt of Lillard (25.2 points) and McCollum (21.8) is the only healthy NBA tandem with two players averaging more than 20 points. Beal (24.1) and Wall (20.3) were the other. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Coach Terry Stotts started Lillard, McCollum, Nurkic, Connaughton and Vonleh on back-to-back nights. They hadn't started together before Friday. ... McCollum picked up his third personal foul with 8:05 left and finished the first half with two points after playing only 12 minutes. ...

He finished with 11. ... Washington received two technical fouls in the third quarter.","400975030"
"ATLANTA --  Coach Dwane Casey loves those rare nights when the Toronto Raptors have such a big lead that the second team gets as many minutes as the starters. ""They're going to have nights when they don't look good, but the young guys came tonight and they were clicking,"" Casey said. ""They were playing together, screening for each other. The spacing was good. The passing was good."" Norman Powell scored 17 points, Jonas Valanciunas added 16 and the Raptors blew out the Atlanta Hawks 112-78 on Saturday night. Toronto dominated the game so completely that it needed just 28 minutes from DeMar DeRozan, one of the NBA's most prolific scorers. DeRozan handed out a game-high eight assists and finished with just two points on 1-for-5 shooting before sitting out the fourth quarter with the other starters. After the game he had his left knee iced in the locker room. DeRozan was hurt in the third quarter, but said he would've played if the game had been close. ""It's a little sore, just a little swelling,"" DeRozan said. ""I want to be all the way right when I play again."" Kyle Lowry had 15 points and a career-high 13 rebounds as the Raptors snapped a two-game skid. Seven players finished in double figures for the Raptors. Dennis Schroder scored 14 points and Taurean Prince and Marco Belinelli each had 10 for the Hawks. Atlanta was coming off Friday's rally to beat New York, but it had nothing left after leading by one point late in the first quarter. The Hawks dropped to 4-16, second-worst in the Eastern Conference. ""I felt like our defense -- not just in the paint but everywhere -- was not good enough for an NBA game tonight,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. Toronto, which improved to 12-7, scored 39 points in the second and faced no danger of another third-quarter meltdown that proved costly this week at New York and Indiana. The lead surged to 36 by the nine-minute mark of the third on Serge Ibaka's short jumper, and the Raptors went up a game-high 45 in the fourth. ""Coach challenged the team,"" Lowry said.  ""He specifically said for me and DeMar to come out with a little more assertiveness after the third quarters we've had the last couple of games."" Toronto's bench outscored the Hawks' reserves 43-14 by halftime as Powell, Jakob Poeltl and Pascal Siakam each scored in double figures. There were plenty of second-quarter highlights for Toronto, but the best came in the final minute when Lowry ripped the ball from John Collins and passed upcourt to DeRozan at the 3-point line. DeRozan immediately did a tip-pass for an alley-oop that Siakam slammed down for a 67-39 lead. The victory set the Raptors up for what could be an easy next three weeks, as they play just one opponent that's currently over .500. TIP-INS Raptors: DeRozan's streak of 113 consecutive games in double digits, one shy of Lowry's franchise-best mark, was snapped. ... In Friday's loss at Indiana, Lowry became the first Toronto player to have consecutive games in leading the team in points, rebounds and assists. ... F C.J. Miles missed his second straight game to stay home for his daughter's birth. Hawks: C Miles Plumlee, acquired in the offseason trade that shipped Dwight Howard to Charlotte, finally made his Atlanta debut late in the fourth and went scoreless with no rebounds in nine minutes. The Hawks would like to get something more from Plumlee, who's in the second season of a four-year, $52 million contract, but has been sidelined recently with a strained quadriceps.","400975031"
"Kyrie Irving dribbles up the court and puts a spin move on Darren Collison as he falls to the court, leaving Irving to attack the paint for two points. (0:21) INDIANAPOLIS --  Riding a five-game win streak and facing the team with the NBA's best record, the Indiana Pacers had a chance to make a statement. The Boston Celtics had other ideas. Kyrie Irving scored 25 points and Al Horford added 21 to lead the Celtics to a 108-98 victory Saturday night. ""We were just being resilient as usual,"" Irving said. ""We were able to limit some things (in the third quarter) and we made our push."" That's one way to put it. In a span of 10 minutes, Boston went from trailing 56-47 to leading 82-70. The Celtics outscored Indiana 37-16 in the third quarter and outrebounded the Pacers 11-3. Boston made nearly every facet of the game difficult for Indiana in the third quarter. And with Indiana center Myles Turner on the bench for much of the period in foul trouble, the Celtics exploited Indiana's defense both inside and out. After taking a 54-45 lead into the half, Indiana looked to be in position to push its win streak to six. Lance Stephenson, starting in place of leading scorer Victor Oladipo (bruised right knee), had 12 points in the first quarter to get Indiana off to a solid start. Domantas Sabonis, getting extra playing time with Turner in foul trouble, had seven points in the second along with Thaddeus Young. Each time the Celtics made a run, the Pacers had an answer. But after the break, the Pacers went cold, and Boston took advantage. Horford had 12 points in the third, when the Pacers had a pair of three-minute scoring droughts. Terry Rozier had eight points off the bench en route to a 17-point night. Stephenson had 16 points and eight rebounds, and Sabonis had 17 points and eight boards. ""For us, it's a night to learn. When you're playing at a certain level,"" coach Nate McMillan said, ""you realize you have to take it to another level when you play a team like (Boston)."" Oladipo did not play for the first time this season. He sat with a bruised right knee sustained in Friday's 107-104 win over Toronto and is day-to-day.

"HOUSTON --  James Harden said the Houston Rockets ""put on a show"" in the second half against the New York Knicks on Saturday night, but the show he was talking about surprisingly had nothing to do with Houston's potent offense. In Houston's 117-102 victory over the Knicks, Harden highlighted the Rockets' third-quarter defense where the Knicks scored just 13 points, a season-low for points in a quarter both for the Knicks as well as Rockets opponents. Along with Harden's 37 points and 10 assists, it was that defensive tenacity that helped the Rockets rally back from a sizeable early deficit. ""We couldn't get stops,"" Harden said. ""They were making everything, we didn't have any pressure defensively, and we couldn't get our rhythm offensively."" The Rockets erased New York's early 22-point lead by making 18 3-pointers and getting 44 points from their bench, led by 17 from Ryan Anderson. ""That's what a team is about -- the starters aren't always going to get it done,"" Harden said. ""The bench came in with that energy, we started trimming the deficit down, and in the second half, we put on a show, defensively, especially in the third quarter."" The Knicks rode hot shooting to build a 29-7 lead midway through the first quarter. The shots eventually stopped falling, turnovers mounted, and the Rockets shot their way back into the game, mostly from long range. The Knicks led 39-29 at the end of the first quarter, and Houston finally tied the game at 51 on a free throw by Chris Paul late in the second quarter. The Knicks led 61-58 at halftime. Houston pulled away in the third quarter, outscoring New York 37-13, capped off by a 3-pointer from Anderson at the buzzer to put the Rockets up 95-74 entering the fourth. New York starters Kristaps Porzingis and Enes Kanter sat out the game because of back ailments. Porzingis (lower back tightness) played 36 minutes Friday night in Atlanta, scoring 28 points. He entered Saturday fourth in the NBA at 27.3 points per game. ""Psychologically, sometimes when they're missing players like Porzingis and Kanter, you come out not quite ready to roll, and they've got guys that can really score,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We tried to let them off the hook a little bit."" In place of Porzingis and Kanter, Knicks reserves Michael Beasley and Kyle O'Quinn started. Beasley had a season-high 30 points, while O'Quinn had his first double-double of the season with 20 points and 15 rebounds. ""We have a gritty team and a young team that has to learn how to put it together for two halves,"" Beasley said. ""It's not the first time we've blown a big lead, but we are just learning, and I'm definitely proud of my fellas."" Houston has defeated New York in 24 of the past 26 meetings. The Rockets have won four straight and are 10-1 in November with home games against Brooklyn and Indiana remaining in the month. The Knicks lost consecutive games for the first time since starting the season 0-3. ""They can score in bunches, and we knew that we'd to have to play -- especially, without two of our starters -- almost a perfect game,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""I thought our guys played hard and good for a huge portion of the game, but that's a good team, and they know how to get those 3s off."" The Rockets have hit at least 18 3-pointers in four straight games, twice as long as any other streak of 18 3s in NBA history. Houston is 12-0 when hitting 15 or more 3s this season. Harden made 5 of 13 3-point attempts, while Anderson and Trevor Ariza both added four 3s. Paul had a season-high 13 assists. ""He finds you right in the sweet spot and lines the laces up,"" Anderson said of Paul. ""He's one of the better passers in the history of the NBA so to have him around makes the game easier for everyone else."" TIP-INS Knicks: Kanter missed his second straight game with back spasms that first occurred Friday. He's averaging 13.6 points and 10.2 rebounds. ... The Knicks also were missing center Joakim Noah, who isn't traveling with the team because of an illness. Rockets: Eric Gordon (calf) and Anderson (illness) returned after missing Houston's win over Denver on Wednesday. Gordon had eight points in 24 minutes. ... Clint Capela had 12 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks. HOT START At 15-4, the Rockets are off to their third-best start to a season in franchise history. Houston is off to its best 19-game start to a season since opening the 1996-97 season 17-2. That team would go on to finish 57-25 and lose to the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.

"DALLAS -- Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder didn't blow a lead this time. They barely had one. Dirk Nowitzki scored a season-high 19 points , rookie Dennis Smith held his own against Westbrook on the rookie Dallas guard's 20th birthday and the suddenly surging Mavericks beat the Thunder 97-81 on Saturday night. The Thunder fell behind for good in the first quarter a night after losing a 15-point lead in the second half of a one-point loss to Detroit that followed a dominant win over Kevin Durant and Golden State -- their only victory in the past five games. ""Everybody should be upset walking out of this locker room because you sure hate to lose,"" guard Raymond Felton said after the team with the Big Three of Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George fell to 8-11. ""I know I do and I'm pretty sure everybody else on this team does, so that's why you see the faces. That's why you see the looks. We're all upset, but we're the ones who got to figure it out."" Smith finished with 15 points and four assists while Westbrook had 28 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists a night after his sixth triple-double of the season. But the star guard had just 12 points after a dominant first quarter as the Mavericks won their third in the past four games following a 2-14 start. At 5-15, Dallas still has the worst record in the Western Conference. ""We are making small gains,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""It's the first time we have won two in a row. It is a little bit of momentum, and it is precious."" Anthony hit three of his four 3-pointers in the third quarter to help Oklahoma City close within 10, but got called for an offensive foul, his fourth, and then traveling the next time down. Yogi Ferrell's 3-pointer after the travel put Dallas up 70-53. Anthony finished with 16 points after sitting the entire fourth quarter, while George also sat the fourth and finished with just two points on 1-of-12 shooting with a game-high 10 assists for the Thunder, who shot 36 percent. It was the fewest points for George since the finale in 2014-15, when he missed all but the final six games after breaking his right leg with Team USA the previous summer. Nowitzki, the 39-year-old in his 20th season, hit his season high on a 3-pointer that gave the Mavericks their biggest lead at 26, 83-57, early in the fourth quarter. J.J. Barea had one of his six assists on that 3 as Dallas finished with 25 on 37 baskets. Harrison Barnes had 12 points and 12 rebounds in Dallas' first game since he banked in a 3-pointer at the buzzer off an inbounds pass with 0.5 seconds left, giving the Mavericks a 95-94 win in Memphis. TIP-INS Thunder: Held to 13 points in the second quarter, fewest in any quarter this season. The previous low was 14 in the second quarter of a 96-87 loss to Utah on Oct. 21. ... The Thunder were outscored 53-31 in the second and third quarters, shooting 28 percent (11 of 39). Mavericks: Nowitzki had a strange three-point play in the second quarter. Jerami Grant was given a technical for grabbing the rim when Nowitzki hit a layup. There was contact, and the Mavericks thought Nowitzki was fouled and would get three free throws. He made the one he got. ... The Mavericks weathered a 5-minute scoreless drought in the fourth quarter, with Ferrell hitting a 3 to get the lead back to 18. WHERE'S THE HELP Grant's two free throws with 50 seconds left in the third quarter were the first points by someone other than Westbrook or Anthony since a bucket by Steven Adams with 5:20 left in the second. Westbrook and Anthony were the only double-figure scorers, followed by Grant with nine. MARK YOUR CALENDAR Smith said he didn't notice he was facing Westbrook on his 20th birthday until he had to start planning what family might be around for the occasion. The ninth overall pick in the draft, Smith has drawn comparisons to Westbrook. ""I don't really try to compare myself,"" Smith said.","400975034"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry watched his first 10 shots miss. Even his 11th rattled around the rim a few times before falling in. On a night when Golden State's offense took nearly 20 minutes to get on track, Curry was determined to get his own game going. The two-time MVP did just that and the Warriors got another big lift from their bench while Kevin Durant sat out again. Curry scored 14 of his 27 points in the third quarter, Klay Thompson added 24 and Golden State held on to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 110-95 on Saturday. ""I never lose confidence,"" Curry said. ""I was probably feeling myself too much from last game. Just made the game harder than it should be. You have to block it out the best you can, have a sense of amnesia almost, and just rely on the repetitions and work you put into it."" Curry scored 26 of his 33 in the second quarter of a blowout against the Chicago Bulls on Friday but struggled for most of Saturday's game before finding his rhythm coming out of halftime, going 5 of 9 with two 3-pointers. The 0-for-10 start matched the worst of Curry's career and came as part of a first quarter when the Warriors were held to a season-low 17 points. Curry didn't make his first shot until 52.8 seconds left in the first half when his 19-foot jumper rolled around the rim three times before dropping in. ""It takes a special kind of confidence to do what Steph did tonight,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""I would have quit after four shots and said `It's not my night.' Guys like Steph, MVP-caliber players, they find a way to turn a bad night into a good one."" Draymond Green had six points, seven rebounds and eight assists for the Warriors. Andre Iguodala added 14 points and led a strong effort on the bench. ""The bench was the key,"" Kerr said. ""We were just rushing everything. They have a tendency to settle us down when we need it. We needed it tonight."" Golden State won its second in two nights without Durant, who sat out for the third time in four games with a sprained left ankle. Anthony Davis had 30 points and 15 rebounds for New Orleans, which had won three straight. Jrue Holiday added 24 points, including 17 in the first quarter. DeMarcus Cousins scored 15 points with seven rebounds. The Warriors pulled away behind Curry and led by as much as 16 before New Orleans cut the gap to 99-93 on Cousins' second 3-pointer. Curry responded with an 18-foot jumper and the Warriors finished with an 11-2 run. ""We were playing the way you have to play against that team if you have any chance at all of beating them,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""Then we started letting Steph and guys get separation. We got away from what got us the lead."" TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans committed 17 turnovers. . Omer Asik did not play after making his debut a night earlier. Asik is working himself back into shape after missing eight months with an illness and losing 30 pounds. ""It's going to be a while before he's going to be able to play any kind of extended minutes,"" Gentry said. Warriors: Omri Casspi started in place of Durant and had nine points on 4-of-8 shooting. . Golden State has won 10 consecutive home games against New Orleans. ... The Warriors have held every opponent under 50 percent shooting this season. COUSINS' ROUGH NIGHT New Orleans' 6-foot-11 center made a stellar play to block Iguodala's breakaway dunk attempt in the second quarter but had an otherwise forgettable night. Cousins was in foul trouble most of the night, was called for a three-second violation and picked up a technical foul late in the fourth quarter. The six technical fouls ties Cousins with Green for most in the NBA this season. CLARK GETS CHAMPIONSHIP RING Former Warrior and current Pelican Ian Clark received his NBA championship ring from Curry during a pregame ceremony. Clark spent two seasons with Golden State and was greeted with a loud ovation from the Oracle Arena crowd. ""I'm just going to see if his ring is bigger than mine,"" said Gentry, who was an assistant on Kerr's staff when the Warriors won the title in 2014.","400975035"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  When rookie Donovan Mitchell spun by Giannis Antetokounmpo and made a layup in the fourth quarter, he felt like he was walking on air. ""When I made that move on him, I started smirking just because he's an All-Star and it's cool to make that sort of play on a guy like that,"" Mitchell said. Mitchell scored 24 points and the Utah Jazz made a season-high 18 3-pointers in a 121-108 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday night. Mitchell, who made a career-high six 3s, had 10 points in the fourth quarter as the Jazz broke open the game and finished with a season-best 56.8 percent shooting from the field. When Antetokounmpo was announced in the starting lineup after he was questionable with a sore knee, Mitchell lit up because of the respect he has for the ""Greek Freak"". ""I was watching him when I was in college. He's been dominating and it's really impressive what he's been doing,"" Mitchell said. Mitchell has been impressing as well and made even difficult plays look easy against Milwaukee, including a desperation 28-foot jumper to beat the shot clock that kept Utah ahead by double digits midway through the final period. Rodney Hood scored 21 and Derrick Favors added 16 for the Jazz, who have defeated the Bucks seven times in a row. Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 13 rebounds after missing the last game, but showed frustration several times during the contest as the Bucks played from behind most of the game. ""We've just got to play harder, put more effort into it,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""If you get frustrated, there's no point."" Malcolm Brogdon scored 19 points, while Eric Bledsoe and Tony Snell each contributed 18 for the Bucks, who shot 53 percent but couldn't keep up with the quick Jazz passing on the perimeter. The Jazz closed the third quarter with eight straight points, including 3s by Thabo Sefolosha and Hood, to lead 95-85. ""When we play at our pace, it's very hard to guard,"" Hood said. ""We move the ball. We attack seams. We make the game easy for each other."" The Jazz reserves, who had 53 points, have posted more than 50 points in three of their last four games. Utah played without Rudy Gobert, who missed his eighth with a bruised knee, and the Bucks found little resistance on many drives to the basket. But they couldn't match Mitchell's six 3s and Joe Ingles' five makes from beyond the arc. The Jazz have won 16 consecutive games at home over the Bucks. TIP-INS Bucks: The Bucks shot 10 free throws before the Jazz took their first. ... Brogdon made 5 of 6 from 3-point range. ... After connecting on 13 of their first 14 free throws, the Bucks twice missed both free throws on trips in the fourth quarter. Jazz: For the first time, the Jazz wore bright gold uniforms with blue and green numbers and trim. ... Raul Neto got a technical with 8:30 left in the game. ... The Jazz are now 4-4 with Gobert out of the lineup. ATTACKING THE BLITZ Milwaukee's aggressive pick-and-roll defense backfired against the Jazz. ""When they come out and blitz, you make the first pass and the bigs are doing a great job finding the corners and the wings,"" Mitchell said. ""That's where I got a lot of my shots and Joe got his shots."" THE BUCKS STOPPED HERE Coach Jason Kidd on what his team lacked: ""Effort, energy and caring. Sprinkle in a little trying. We didn't do that tonight. We tried hard on the offensive end but we didn't do anything on the defensive end."" EXTRA PASS The Jazz tied their season high of 31 assists that was just set in a 125-85 win at Orlando on Nov. 18. ""I thought we were incredibly unselfish and offensively we were connected, trying to help each other,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""You've got to share the ball. I think our guys knew that and they really did it.""","400975036"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Blake Griffin sent the Clippers home happy. Griffin made a 10-foot jumper with 3.2 seconds remaining and had a season-high 33 points to lead Los Angeles over the Sacramento Kings, 97-95 on Saturday night. The Clippers squandered a 10-point, fourth-quarter lead, but Griffin gave them a second straight victory to end their five-game road trip. ""We'll take the wins however we can get them,"" said Griffin, who made 13 of 25 shots and added five assists. ""We can play with anyone, no matter how banged up we are."" It's been a difficult time for the Clippers in the post-Chris Paul era. After opening the season with four straight wins, injury-plagued LA has dropped 11 of 12 games before winning their last two. After Buddy Hield made consecutive 3-pointers to tie the game at 95, the Clippers called timeout and designed a play for their perennial All-Star forward. Griffin drove toward the basket, then pulled up for the jumper over Willie Cauley-Stein. ""It was the play we wanted, but it was too early,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""But he knew he had to take the shot."" On their final possession, the Kings went to Hield, who had 16 points in the fourth quarter. But DeAndre Jordan forced him to penetrate instead of taking a 3-pointer. Hield's wild left-handed runner at the buzzer wasn't even close. ""He could have blocked it? I don't know. I just couldn't get my right hand over the ball,"" Hield said. Lou Williams made four 3-poiners and had 18 points for the Clippers, who have beat the Kings 10 straight times in Sacramento. Austin Rivers added 14 points and Jordan had 16 rebounds. Hield had career highs of seven 3-pointers and 35 points. Zach Randolph added 17 points and seven rebounds, and Bogdan Bogdanovic and George Hill each had 10 points. Sacramento had won four of its previous five games at Golden 1 Arena and appeared to be headed for another win after leading by 18 points early in the third quarter. But the Clippers ran off 17 unanswered points, including three consecutive 3-pointers by Williams. ""The first four minutes of the third quarter, all we did is take jump shots,"" Kings coach Dave Joeger said. ""We were less aggressive and they were the aggressors. They came out and made shots, made plays, and got loose balls. That's why they got ahead and we had to chase them at the end."" Both Williams and Griffin had 12 points in the third, when the Clippers outscored the Kings 29-10. TIP-INS Clippers: Ex-Clipper Baron Davis was among the crowd. ... LA was again without injured starters Danilo Gallinari (sore hip) and Milos Teodosic (foot injury). Patrick Beverley underwent season-ending microfracture surgery on his right knee. Kings: Sacramento shot 4 of 19 in the third quarter and had eight turnovers. They shot 58.5 percent in the first half. ... Rookie DeAaron Fox struggled, hitting 2 of 9 shots and finishing with four points and three assists. HIELD A SPARK OFF THE BENCH Hield began the season as a starter, but has blossomed coming off the bench. He's a primary reason why the Kings second unit often outscores the starters. That was the case against the Clippers when the bench held a 51-44 edge. ""Buddy Hield is a scorer. We had trouble containing him. He does what he does,"" Rivers said. ---","400975037"
"CHICAGO --  Goran Dragic and the Miami Heat followed the lowest-scoring first quarter in team history with the highest-scoring one of the season to beat the Chicago Bulls. After scoring seven points in the first quarter, Miami had 38 in the second to take a 45-42 lead en route to a 100-93 victory Sunday. Dragic scored 24 points, Wayne Ellington had 19 points and five 3-pointers off the bench and the Heat's four reserves outscored their five starters. James Johnson added 15 points, seven rebounds and six assists, and fellow reserves Tyler Johnson and Kelly Olynyk scored 10 points apiece as the Heat bench produced 54 points to extend the team's winning streak to three. Jerian Grant led Chicago with a career-high 24 points. Denzel Valentine had 14 points and career highs of 13 rebounds and seven assists. ""They (the bench) inspired the whole team,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We were looking for some kind of energy, some kind of separation. We understand that it was going to be a 48-minute game and they played some inspiring basketball, not only in the fourth quarter but in that second quarter. That's what really changed the momentum and brought us back into it."" Ellington ignited the Heat after the 2-for-19 first-quarter from the field, scoring 10 points and hitting three 3-pointers as Miami shot 68.4 percent in the second quarter. The Heat started slow again in the third quarter, prompting Spoelstra to leave his second- and third-leading scorers, Dion Waiters (four points) and Hassan Whiteside (11 points, nine rebounds), on the bench down the stretch as the Heat pulled away after Chicago cut Miami's lead to 83-81 with five minutes, 40 seconds to play. ""I don't think we look at it like Dion or Whiteside or Dragic,"" James Johnson said. ""We have a lot of weapons on this team. We have a lot of guys who could do it. We're all trying to play our roles and master that."" Justin Holliday added 15 points for the Bulls, who lost their fifth in a row following an 0-4 West Coast trip. TIP-INS Heat: Whiteside (knee) was in the starting lineup after missing Saturday's practice to receive treatment. ... F James Johnson had at least five rebounds and five assists in a game for the fifth time this season. ... Miami (10-9) exceeded the .500 mark for the first time since winning two of three to open the season. Bulls: Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said he's ""hoping"" G David Nwaba will return to practice on Monday. Nwaba (sprained right ankle) missed his ninth consecutive game. ... The home game was just Chicago's seventh of the season, tied with Toronto for fewest in the NBA. ... Grant scored 62 points in Chicago's past three games. His single-game high was 13 prior to this stretch. FROSTY FIRST QUARTER The Heat shot 2-of-19 from the field in the first quarter but only trailed 13-7 because the Bulls managed to make just 4-of-24 shots, including 1-for-15 inside the 3-point arc. The 20 combined points were the fewest in any quarter in Bulls history. DESIGNATED SHOOTER Ellington continued his hot 3-point shooting, going 5-of-8 behind the arc. The veteran reserve made multiple 3-pointers in each of the Heat's past four games, going 20-for-35 in that stretch, and at least one in 11 straight. Ellington is shooting 44.2 percent for the season.","400975038"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- Karl-Anthony Towns' scoring actually meant something this time. Two days after his coach characterized his late points as ""meaningless"" in a listless loss to Miami, Towns led a balanced offensive attack for Minnesota with 32 points and 12 rebounds and the Timberwolves beat Phoenix 119-108 on Sunday. Alongside Jimmy Butler with 25 points and Andrew Wiggins with 21, Towns kept the Wolves from another bad loss, this one against a Phoenix team missing top scorer Devin Booker. ""Whatever the game plan is offensively, I try to go out there and execute as best as possible,"" Towns said. ""Whether it is shoot 30-plus shots, or shoot five shots."" The Wolves probably prefer the former, as long as he shoots the way he did Sunday. Towns went 12 of 26 from the floor, including two 3-pointers, and hit all six of his free-throw attempts. Coach Tom Thibodeau criticized Towns for not moving without the ball on Friday night, when his star big man got rolling too late. On Sunday, he scored 30 points for the third time this season and recorded his league-leading 16th double-double. ""I thought Karl had great activity today, so that was good,"" Thibodeau said. ""We need that from him."" The Suns announced shortly before the game that Booker -- who scored 35 points in Phoenix's home victory over Minnesota on Nov. 11 -- would sit out because of an injured big right toe. With Booker out, the Suns got another big game from their bench, led by Mike James with a career-high 26 points. But Minnesota started the third quarter with a 22-11 run, and Phoenix couldn't find an offensive spark to seriously threaten the rest of the way. ""He's one of our best scorers, so it's a big chunk offensively,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said about Booker. ""But at the same time we shot 50 percent. I thought our movement was pretty good. We shared the basketball, so I'm not disappointed with how we played at the offensive end without him. We weren't very good defensively."" The Wolves outscored the Suns 66-50 in the paint, and had 32 second-chance points to Phoenix's 12. T.J. Warren -- who also had 35 points in the first meeting with the Timberwolves -- had 18 points for the Suns, and Phoenix started its six-game trip with its third straight loss. Minnesota built an early 14-point lead before Phoenix's bench pulled the Suns back into it. James had eight second-quarter points to help spark a 25-15 run that gave the Suns a brief four-point lead before Wiggins got hot with three straight buckets to put the Wolves back in front. BOOKER'S STATUS Triano said he hoped Booker's status would be day-to-day, but that he still needed to speak with the trainers. ""They said if he sat out today it would give him a chance to rest a couple more days, so I'm hoping that means he gets to play."" Before the game, Triano said Booker's injury occurred Friday night in a home loss to New Orleans. TAJ'S TALLY Taj Gibson had 16 points and a season-high 14 rebounds for his seventh double-double of the season. He finished 8 of 12 from the floor, matching a career high for made field goals. While most of the attention on Minnesota's revamped roster has focused on Jimmy Butler, Gibson has emerged as a reliable inside presence. ""He adds a lot to the team, the way he plays,"" Thibodeau said. ""He's got great quickness, he's got great feet, but there's a toughness to him that makes him what we need, too."" TIP-INS Suns: Josh Jackson started in Booker's place and finished with five points. ... The Suns' bench scored 61 points. The unit entered the game averaging 45.4 points over its previous five games. ... Phoenix lost for the first time in four games when shooting 50 percent from the floor. ... The Suns went 13 of 26 from 3-point range, one off the team's season high for 3-pointers made. Timberwolves: The Wolves improved to 12-8 to equal their best 20-game start since the 2005-06 season. ... Starting point guard Jeff Teague (sore right Achilles) and reserve forward Nemanja Bjelica (sprained left foot) missed their second-consecutive games. Before the game, Thibodeau said both players were ""getting closer, but I'm not sure that they're there yet."" Bjelica's injury is the same foot that required surgery to repair a fracture last season, and Thibodeau said the team has consulted with the surgeon. ""I think he's good but we just want to make sure.""","400975039"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The misery remains for the Memphis Grizzlies, and friction seems to be building in the locker room. Memphis dropped its eighth straight on Sunday in a 98-88 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. The Grizzlies made a fourth-quarter dent in a Nets lead that stretched to 19, all while center Marc Gasol was in his warm-ups on the bench. Despite matching Tyreke Evans for the team lead with 18 points, Gasol, who leads the team in scoring, rebounds and assists, wasn't called on to play in the final period. And he wasn't pleased. ""I do not know the why,"" Gasol said of not playing down the stretch, later adding: ""It's a first for me, trust me, and I don't like it one bit. I'm more [ticked] than I can show and frustrated."" Speaking before Gasol, Memphis coach David Fizdale said his decision was based on the reserves playing well and cutting into the Brooklyn lead. He said not much has worked for the team during the skid, particularly Sunday, when the Grizzlies gave up the lead in a poor third quarter. Asked about Gasol's reaction about not playing down the stretch, Fizdale said: ""We'll address it if it needs to be addressed, but it was a pretty simple decision what I did. It's nothing against him. I'm trying to win a game. I'm desperate."" While the Grizzlies were grousing, the Nets were celebrating, at least for one night, after snapping a three-game losing streak. DeMarre Carroll scored a season-high 24 points and Trevor Booker added 16 points and 11 rebounds. Joe Harris finished with 13 points for the Nets, who used a third-quarter spurt to put away the Grizzlies. The teams were tied at 47 at the break, but the Nets opened the second half with a 22-6 run, looking much more fluid on offense than in the opening half. Brooklyn connected on nine of its first 15 shots to build the lead, outscoring the Grizzlies 32-18. ""We came out in the second half and got two big stops, scored,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We picked up our energy in the second half. The first part of the third quarter, that's where I thought the game turned."" Memphis was able to get back in the game to open the final period, composing a 12-3 run. Memphis got the deficit to five points, but the Brooklyn lead was too much to overcome. ""We wanted to get out in transition and make them run,"" Harris said, ""and I thought we did better at that in the second half."" TIP-INS Nets: Harris started in Allen Crabbe's place. ... Carroll's previous season high was 18 on Oct. 25 against Cleveland. ... The Nets shot 45 percent from the field, breaking a string of surpassing 50 percent the past two games and three of the previous four. ... The Nets had 19 assists, breaking a streak of at least 24 assists in their last five. Grizzlies: Memphis had not lost eight straight since a similar skid from Feb. 11 to March 3, 2009. ... The team announced that Chandler Parsons tweaked his knee and did not return in the second half. The team characterized it as a precautionary move. MORE INJURY TROUBLES The Nets, who already were without D'Angelo Russell and Jeremy Lin with long-term injuries, had more setbacks. Crabbe, who was going to start, was a late scratch with a sore lower back. Then in the second quarter, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson went down with a right ankle sprain. ""It's unfortunate that we have so many injuries right now, but that's why we have 15 guys on the team,"" Booker said. MORE MARC MUSINGS Gasol spent a lot of time answering questions about the fourth-quarter situation in the Grizzlies locker room. Even after the team's public relations staff asked if everyone was finished, Gasol said he was willing to keep talking, expressing his displeasure about the situation. ""I'm just as competitive as anybody,"" he said. ""I hate not playing. That's what I value the most. If I'm not on the floor, I'm not valued. I'm sure [the coaching staff] knew that would hurt me the most.""","400975040"
"INDIANAPOLIS -- When Victor Oladipo was asked about his return to the lineup after missing Indiana's previous game, he couldn't describe how tormenting it was to watch from the sidelines with a bruised right knee. So, when Oladipo was cleared for Monday night's matchup with the Orlando Magic, he made up for lost time with a performance that spoke for itself. Oladipo scored 26 points to help the Pacers beat the Magic 121-109, handing Orlando its ninth straight loss. ""He was anxious to play and just came out aggressive,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""He shot the ball with a great deal of confidence ... when a guy is playing with that type of confidence, we try to put the ball in his hands and let him make plays, and he did that tonight."" Oladipo made his first 11 shots before finishing the game 11-for-14. He also grabbed six rebounds -- all on the defensive end of the floor -- and added five assists. After his final bucket of the night -- an off-balance 3-pointer that banked in -- Oladipo turned and shrugged almost in disbelief that he had yet to miss a shot all night. ""Yeah, it was a little something,"" Oladipo said. ""At that point, when you're making stuff like that, you don't know where it comes from. It just went in. It was pretty cool."" And when Oladipo finally missed a shot, the Pacers picked up the slack to mount a 13-0 scoring run that lasted nearly three minutes, putting Indiana ahead by 17 with five minutes left in the game. It was the Pacers' fourth quarter surge on offense that ultimately proved to be the difference in a game where the Magic fought desperately to snap their losing streak. The Pacers had five players in double figures as Bojan Bogdanovic added 22 points, Domantas Sabonis scored 19 points and Myles Turner and Lance Stephenson each added 18. Orlando gave Indiana everything it could handle through the first three quarters. The Magic managed to fight back from 76-66 and close the deficit, trailing 85-84 heading into the fourth quarter. But the Pacers hit their stride during the final 12 minutes and outscored the Magic 36-25 in the fourth. Jonathon Simmons led Orlando with 21 points. ""We fought hard. We played hard. We played well in spurts a lot of the basketball game,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""Block out all the noise. Block out how many we lost and focus on trying to improve each day."" STEADY PACE Since losing 118-95 to Houston on Nov. 12, the Pacers are 6-1. During the same seven game stretch, Indiana has scored 100 or more points in each of its six wins. The Pacers -- who average 108 points per game -- are now 11-4 in games where they score 100 or more points. MAGIC SPELL Dating back to the 2012-13 season, the Pacers have won 17 of their last 19 regular season meetings with Orlando, including the last six matchups with the Magic, leaving former Pacers coach Frank Vogel winless against his old team.

James had 30 points, 13 rebounds and six assists to lead the Cleveland Cavaliers over the 76ers 113-91 on Monday night. The three-time defending conference champions won their eighth straight game. Dwyane Wade scored 15 points, and Jeff Green had 14 points and 10 rebounds. ""These guys are starting to turn the corner here,"" James said. ""They have some great wins this year. We had to come in with the mindset that this isn't the Sixers of three years ago, four years ago. They're starting to turn the corner and you have to be locked in from the onset."" James sure was. He scored the first nine points on his way to 22 in the first half, helping Cleveland to a 53-45 lead by draining a 3 in front of Cleveland's bench at the first-half buzzer. ""He got us off to a good start, making the shots, being aggressive, attacking the basket and everyone kind of followed,"" Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""We knew they were a good team, they've been playing well, playing hard. We knew it was going to be a tough place to play. I didn't expect this outcome, but we played well tonight."" Lue tried to downplay any significance of Cleveland beating a team on the rise. ""We're just trying to get better each day, each game,"" he said. ""We're finally figuring out who we are. We're getting better defensively, and offensively we're sharing the ball. We want to keep getting better."" Joel Embiid had 30 points and 11 rebounds to pace the 76ers, who had won three straight and five of six. ""We didn't make shots, we weren't aggressive defensively, and they got what they wanted,"" Embiid said. ""I hate losing, but I think that's actually good we got our (butt) kicked, so we can go back, learn and know that we can't take any days off."" The four-time MVP James had four points, including an emphatic dunk, and J.R. Smith hit three 3-pointers early in the third as the Cavaliers took a 14-point lead. Philadelphia got within five in the period, but the Cavaliers stretched the advantage to 86-73 entering the fourth. Kyle Korver's 3-pointer with 9:13 to play gave Cleveland a 94-77 lead. ""We will learn from this game,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""We need to pressure. We need to be more active and disruptive, and they need to feel us. And they didn't."" SIMMONS STRUGGLES Philadelphia's Ben Simmons entered leading all rookies in scoring (18.5 points), rebounding (9.1) and assists (7.7), but he was hounded all game by Jae Crowder and managed just 10 points before exiting in the fourth quarter with a right ankle sprain. Simmons, who has turned to James for career and life advice, missed all of last season with a broken right foot. Brown provided no update on Simmons' health, and Simmons wasn't available to the media. Crowder tried a different approach in guarding Simmons, crowding him on the perimeter and not giving him room. ""I wanted to guard him a little differently than how I've been watching other teams guard so far off him and let him get a head of steam and go downhill,"" he said. ""I feel pretty good. It was a good challenge."" SHOOTING BLANKS The 76ers were 3 for 28 from 3-point range, including 0 for 11 in the opening half.

"BOSTON --  Avery Bradley had his homecoming, but nobody on the Pistons enjoys a trip to Boston more than Andre Drummond. The Detroit center had season highs of 26 points and 22 rebounds on Monday night to lead Detroit to a 118-108 victory and send the Celtics to their first loss on the parquet floor since their home opener. Tobias Harris scored 31 in the matchup of old-school rivals who are once again the top teams in the Eastern Conference. ""They'll remember it. That's one of those memorable games,"" said Drummond, who went to high school and college in Connecticut. ""We came in, them being the No. 1 team and us getting a lot of points. Me being the hometown kid, having the night I did, that's something they'll have to remember."" Drummond had 10 rebounds in the first quarter and 11 points in the last 5:36 to help Detroit win for the third time in four games. In 10 games in Boston, he has averaged 16.2 rebounds; it was the third time he had grabbed 22 boards in the building. ""Andre was unbelievable tonight,"" Detroit guard Ish Smith said. ""He was special."" Reggie Jackson scored 20 points with seven assists for the Pistons, who opened an 11-point lead in the first quarter but needed consecutive three-point plays from Drummond down the stretch to pull away. Bradley, who played the first seven years of his career for the Celtics, received a standing ovation during pregame introductions, then scored 13 points. ""For them to show that respect to me means a lot to me,"" Bradley said. ""This will always be my second home."" Marcus Smart scored 23 points, making 6 of 9 from 3-point range, and Kyrie Irving had 18 with nine assists for the Celtics. Boston has lost two of four since a 16-game winning streak. ""They tried to take the ball out of Kyrie's hands, and they did so pretty successfully,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. It was tied 100-all with 5:36 left before the Pistons pulled away thanks to Drummond. With just over three minutes left, he stole a lazy inbound pass at midcourt and drove for the dunk, drawing a foul from Irving. The free throw made it 109-102. It was 114-108 when Smart's long, leaning 3-point attempt rimmed out with 34 seconds left. ""We had a chance to win, but we had too many mistakes,"" Celtics center Al Horford said. SLOW STARTS The Celtics fell behind 16-6 in the opening minutes, continuing a trend of early deficits. Detroit led 31-23 after the first quarter, but Boston scored the first eight points of the second to tie it. A seven-point Detroit lead in the third quarter was quickly erased, but then the Pistons responded with eight straight points and the Celtics matched that, too. FACE TIME Already wearing a mask because of a broken bone in his face, Irving had to check in with the trainer in the game's opening minutes after getting hit in the mouth.

"NEW YORK -- The Portland Trail Blazers already secured a winning trip even before reaching the final stop. They wanted better than that. Damian Lillard scored 32 points and the Trail Blazers wrapped up a strong five-game journey with their third straight victory, beating the New York Knicks 103-91 on Monday night. ""Tonight I was really happy how we didn't come out satisfied,"" Lillard said. ""Winning three out of the five games wasn't enough for us and everybody was on the same page as far as that."" Pat Connaughton added 17 for the Trail Blazers, who also won at Memphis, Brooklyn and Washington while losing only in Philadelphia. They needed to come from 17 down in the fourth quarter to beat the Wizards last time out but were in charge of this one most of the way. ""Overall if we would've said we could go and win four games, I would have told you I'll take it,"" Blazers guard CJ McCollum said. Kristaps Porzingis returned from a one-game absence and scored 22 points, but the Knicks were without starting center Enes Kanter for a third straight game because of back spasms. They lost all three, falling back to .500 at 10-10. The Knicks blew big early leads in the last two losses, in Atlanta and Houston, but mostly played from behind -- sometimes way behind -- Monday. New York never led by more than two and trailed by as much as 26. ""Any time you lose three in a row you raise your eyebrows to where we've got to stop it at some point,"" Knicks center Kyle O'Quinn said. ""We've had momentum at home and handling business at home, but it didn't work out for us tonight."" Lillard made the last basket of the third quarter and he won't have any easier ones all season. Shabazz Napier stole the ball while the Knicks were on the fast break and threw it down to Lillard, who had remained behind on the other end. He dunked the ball with no other players on that side of the court to make it 90-64. The Knicks couldn't guard him when they were close by, either. Lillard had 17 points in the third on 5-of-7 shooting. The Blazers led 30-23 after one and quickly opened a lead the Knicks never cut into. They scored the first nine of the second quarter to open a 16-point cushion, and that's right it was at halftime after Noah Vonleh's basket at the buzzer made it 53-37. ""The game was low energy from our guys,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""We're not the team that can just come out there and think we're just going to play and then step it up later. We have to do it from the tip-off and I don't think our energy was there for the first three quarters."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard moved past Rod Strickland -- also a former Knick -- into fourth place on Portland's career assists list. He now has 2,575 and joins Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter as the only players in franchise history in the top 10 in scoring and top five in assists. ... Portland has won nine of the last 11 meetings. Knicks: With Kanter out, the Knicks activated Joakim Noah and gave him his first playing time since last February, before he was injured and then hit with a 20-game suspension for violating the league's anti-drug policy. ... Tim Hardaway Jr. had 16 points. NOAH'S NIGHT Noah checked in to a nice cheer in the second quarter and had a decent three-minute stint, making his only shot attempt and grabbing a rebound. He had been inactive since his suspension ended earlier this month and didn't even make the two-game trip to Atlanta and Houston. DOING IT WITH DEFENSE Portland held an opponent below 100 points for the 12th time, improving to 9-3 in those contests. The Blazers came into the game tied for second in the league for most times holding teams below the century mark.","400975044"
"HOUSTON --  After rolling through the first quarter and building a sizeable lead over the Brooklyn Nets, James Harden said the Houston Rockets' momentum was interrupted by something they hadn't seen in a long time -- a zone defense. In Houston's 117-103 win over Brooklyn, Harden scored 20 of his 37 points in the first quarter. When he took a break with 1:28 remaining in the first quarter, he was outscoring the Nets 20-17 by himself, not to mention four assists at that point. He was 5-for-5 from 3-point range in the first quarter and finished 8-for-13. But when Brooklyn went to a zone defense for the first time all season, Harden said the Rockets had to make adjustments. ""They went zone, and it kind of threw us for a loop,"" Harden said. ""We weren't making shots. That zone kind of messed us up a little bit."" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson likened Houston's hot start to a hurricane and said the Rockets hit them with a one-two punch, going up 43-26 after the first. ""When they scored 43, it was like, `We've got to do something different, guys,"" Atkinson said. ""They still scored a lot of points, but it helped slow them down and at least made them pause and made them think a little."" Harden added 10 rebounds and eight assists to guide the Rockets to their fifth straight win. Despite the string of blowout victories, Harden said it's easy to stay self-critical and focus on improving, while Rockets head coach Mike D'Antoni said he's staying on top of his team. ""The mentality of, 'I'm going to play well all the time,' that's utopia, that's not possible,"" D'Antoni said. ""So I just cry around and moan around for a while, but I'll be all right. I'll get over it."" Clint Capela added 20 points for Houston, and Chris Paul had a season-high 14 assists on ""Chris Paul Bobblehead Night"" at the Toyota Center. ""We've got to keep getting better, especially, defensively,"" Paul said. ""We can't just always rely on our offense. But we'll take the wins. Every game is different, but right now, we're just trying to pile up the wins."" For the Nets, Isaiah Whitehead led scorers with 24 points, matching his career high. The Brooklyn native, who was called up from the G-League on Monday morning, shot 10 of 16 from the field. ""I was just staying ready to take opportunities and doing well with them,"" Whitehead said. ""I'll stay ready throughout the year, and hopefully, I'll get more chances."" Spencer Dinwiddie had 14 points, Caris LeVert had 13 and Sean Kilpatrick added 12. Coming off of a 98-88 win in Memphis on Sunday night, Brooklyn has lost four of its last five. Houston led 66-55 at halftime and entered the fourth quarter with a 16-point lead. TIP-INS Nets: Forwards DeMarre Carroll (upper respiratory condition) and Allen Crabbe (lower back soreness) were both out. ... Quincy Acy had seven points in 20 minutes after missing the previous two games by coach's decision. Rockets: Houston was without two of its big men -- veteran center Nene was inactive with a strained right shoulder, while rookie center Zhou Qi had a sore left calf. . The Rockets have won 10 of their last 11 meetings at home against Brooklyn. STICK TO BASEBALL Houston Astros pitcher Lance McCullers, who won Game 3 of the 2017 World Series on his way to earning a ring, was the celebrity guest as part of Houston's ""First Shot"" promotion featuring a local celebrity shooting a pregame free throw for a chance to earn a $5,000 donation from the Rockets to charity. Despite strong form, McCullers' shot rattled in and out, still earning a $1,000 donation to charity. DANGER ZONE On trying out a zone defense for the first time this season, Atkinson said it was an idea he's mulled before but never followed through. ""I've always thought about it, but I've never had the guts to try it."" ANOTHER ONE The Rockets hit 20 3-pointers against Brooklyn, marking their fifth straight game of recording 18 or more 3-pointers made. No other team in NBA history has such a streak that lasted longer than two games. Houston has shot 40 percent from 3-point range in four of its past five games. The Rockets are 26-1 when shooting 40 percent or better from beyond the arc under D'Antoni. CP3'S CLEAN PLAY Paul didn't have a turnover, marking the eighth time in his career he has recorded 14 or more assists without a turnover, all coming since the start of the 2008-09 season. No other player has more than five games of doing so.","400975045"
"Tony Parker talks about the emotional return back to the lineup in his season debut against the Mavericks. (0:31) SAN ANTONIO --  Tony Parker was an emotional wreck before his first game of the season. It was the point guard's 1,144th career game, and it wasn't clear he'd get to play it after a crushing injury in last year's playoffs. An overwhelmed Parker quickly settled into his familiar rhythm, though, and so did the San Antonio Spurs. LaMarcus Aldridge had a season-high 33 points and 10 rebounds and the Spurs celebrated Parker's return by beating the Dallas Mavericks 115-108 on Monday night. ""A little bit like my first game when I was rookie,"" Parker said, adding that he almost shed some tears. ""But when I saw the crowd getting excited when I got the ball just to bring it up, I got excited. It got me right away, (to be) motivated and be aggressive."" Parker had six points and four assists in 14 minutes in his first appearance since tearing his right quadriceps tendon May 3 against Houston in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals. The injury required surgery and led some to speculate Parker could miss significant time, if he came back at all. Instead, the 35-year-old returned quicker than expected to what he calls the ""game I love."" ""Our guys are just happy for him,"" Spurs guard Danny Green said. ""To see him go through that process, the injury first, then taking the process of taking six to seven months being out not being able to play. What he's been to this organization and what he's meant to us and this organization. For him to bounce back and come in and play pretty quality minutes and do it at an efficient rate? I'm just happy for him."" Parker moved confidently, driving to the basket and making hard cuts to get away from defenders while primarily playing in the first half. He made his first two shots on hard drives to the basket. ""It's funny because I was talking with Pop (San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich) before the game asking him `What do you want me to do?"" Parker said. ""He was like, just be aggressive, just be yourself, just penetrate and see what happens. So, I just went to the paint, that's what I do best."" Popovich watched much of Parker's return on television after being ejected with 7:25 remaining in the first half. Spurs assistant Ettore Messina assumed coaching duties. After falling behind by 13 points in the first half, the Spurs rallied behind their defense following Popovich's ejection. Gasol added a season-high 25 points for the Spurs. Anderson had 12 points, 10 rebounds and five rebounds. Dennis Smith Jr. and Wesley Matthews each had 19 points to lead the Mavericks, who had won two straight.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Without Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, the defending NBA champions went cold down the stretch. The defense didn't do its part, either. Bogdan Bogdanovic made a go-ahead bank shot with 12.6 seconds left, lifting the Sacramento Kings over the Golden State Warriors 110-106 on Monday night with Curry and Durant sitting out injured. The Kings won for just the second time on the road -- first since Oct. 20 at Dallas -- and ended an eight-game losing streak on Golden State's home floor. Klay Thompson missed a 3-point try from the top of the arc with 3.5 seconds left, his fourth straight miss, and Golden State went 0 for 7 from the floor after Thompson's 3 with 3:11 left. ""Overall our defensive energy just wasn't there tonight,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""We just didn't have the juice, we didn't have the energy that we needed to stop them."" Thompson finished with 21 points on 7-for-20 shooting with five 3s. Second-year guard Patrick McCaw took Curry's place in the starting lineup and scored a season-best 16 points with career highs of seven assists and four steals. Willie Cauley-Stein scored 19 points to lead six Kings in double figures and also had eight rebounds and six assists. George Hill had 16 points and Sacramento led 83-82 heading into the fourth. ""We couldn't get stops,"" McCaw said. ""When you don't get stops you can't convert."" Key Warriors backup Andre Iguodala, who was available with a sore left knee after beginning the day listed as doubtful, scored in double figures for a third straight game with 11 points. Curry has a bruised right hand and NBA Finals MVP Durant missed his fourth game in the last five because of a sprained left ankle. He played in a loss to the Thunder last Wednesday at his old Oklahoma City stomping grounds, though Kerr said afterward KD should have sat out that one, too. Reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year Draymond Green was available despite a bruised right foot he said he injured in the first quarter of Saturday's win against the Pelicans. He had 14 points and eight assists, including a lob to JaVale McGee for an alley-oop dunk late in the third. The Warriors had beaten Sacramento in 19 of 22 overall at Oracle Arena since a 105-98 defeat on March 27, 2013. Sacramento had lost the last two in the series after stunning the Warriors 109-106 in overtime Feb. 4 at the Golden 1 Center. RING FOR BARNES Former Warrior Matt Barnes chose to receive his championship ring while Golden State faced Sacramento, which released him last season. He went to high school in California's capital, too. Barnes signed with Golden State after an injury to Durant last season. He is staying busy away from basketball these days and enjoying time with his two sons, who also received rings Monday. ""It was an amazing opportunity, a tremendous blessing,"" Barnes said, honored on the 10-year anniversary of mother Ann's death from four types of cancer. ""I wasn't supposed to make it. I was one of those guys who wasn't supposed to make it in this league."" CARTER'S DUNK At age 40, former dunk champion Vince Carter made a spectacular dunk to inspire the Kings bench. ""I thought he was going to go between his legs,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""I was like, `Do it, man, do it, we all want to see it."" INJURIES It's unclear when Durant will return, though Kerr expects Curry to play Wednesday at the Lakers. ""KD it's just been lingering a little bit,"" Kerr said. ""It's not a huge level of concern. We'll just take it day by day."" Kerr didn't know until after Saturday's game about Curry's injury when head of physical performance and sports medicine Chelsea Lane let him know the two-time MVP's hand had become swollen. TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento committed 18 turnovers to 19 assists in a 97-95 loss to the Clippers on Saturday, and Joerger called for his team to be more careful with the ball. This game, the Kings had 13 turnovers. Warriors: Thompson has 511 career points against the Kings, his most against any opponent. That includes his 52-point performance on Jan. 23, 2015, in which he scored an NBA-record 37 in the third quarter. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  The Clippers' third win in a row for the first time since opening the season 4-0 came at a price. Blake Griffin fell down under the basket and clutched his left knee with 3:53 left in a 120-115 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night. The team said he's day-to-day and will be examined on Tuesday. A grim-faced Griffin dressed and left the locker room without speaking to reporters. ""It didn't look good, obviously,"" coach Doc Rivers said. Griffin was going for a loose ball in the paint with teammate Austin Rivers and Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball. It appeared Rivers fell on Griffin, whose knee got twisted as he landed on his back. Griffin got up, but soon left the game and the court. ""Lonzo knocked someone into Blake and it was a trigger effect,"" the elder Rivers said. ""Blake said he was OK. Then he just couldn't move. He's hoping it was just a bang."" The Clippers are already missing three key players, including guard Patrick Beverley, who is out for the season after having right knee surgery last week. Forward Danilo Gallinari and guard Milos Teodosic are hurt, too. Lou Williams scored a season-high 42 points, helping the Clippers rally from an eight-point deficit in the fourth quarter to earn their 11th straight home victory against their Staples Center co-tenant. ""He saved us,"" Rivers said. ""We needed every point Lou gave us."" Griffin added 26 points and 11 rebounds. The elder Rivers and Williams both thought Griffin got fouled on the play. ""The referees acknowledged he got hit,"" Williams said. ""But I guess there were some other things that went on during that play."" Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit an open 18-footer that left the Lakers trailing 116-115 with 48 seconds to go. Williams answered with a layup before Brandon Ingram missed a corner jumper for the Lakers. Williams got fouled and made both, completing a 14 of 14 free throw performance that closed out the game. ""That was a gutty win for us,"" Rivers said. Pope led the Lakers with 29 points. Ingram and Jordan Clarkson added 17 points each. Ball finished with three points on 1 of 7 shooting for the Lakers, who were coming off a four-day break after dropping six of nine games. Ball returned for the game's final five minutes, tossing the ball out of bounds and missing two 3-pointers. ""We didn't make enough shots,"" Ball said. ""We played hard enough to win the game. We just kind of beat ourselves."" The Lakers opened a 103-95 lead in the fourth, with Kyle Kuzma and Clarkson combining to score 12 of their first 14 points. The Clippers answered with a 15-2 run to take a 110-104 lead. Williams hit a 3-pointer and got fouled on another attempt, making three free throws, before Griffin's one-handed baseline jam. The Lakers have dropped seven of 10. Williams scored 15 points in the third quarter for the Clippers, who trailed 89-87 going into the fourth. Pope hit his fifth 3-pointer and Julius Randle followed with four straight points in a 7-0 run that gave the Lakers their largest lead, 86-80, of the third. Neither team led by more than nine points in the first half, when the Clippers shot 56 percent and trailed 62-60 at the break. DUNKING LOU Williams had a dunk and DeAndre Jordan noticed. ""We may not see that again until next year,"" he said. BACK TO THE BENCH Kuzma is back on the Lakers bench with the return of Larry Nance Jr. The forward had 30 points and 10 rebounds against Phoenix on Nov. 17, making him the first Lakers rookie with at least 30 and 10 since Magic Johnson in February 1980. Kuzma's double-double was a single-game high for an NBA rookie this season. During Nance's 11-game absence, Kuzma was the Lakers' leading scorer with a 16.8-point average. ""The total number of minutes won't be the same,"" Walton said. ""There's another player out there now that's going to be taking some of those minutes."" Nance said he has no problem with his left hand. ""For the past three weeks I've been dreaming of this, I missed it."" HE SAID IT ""He's not going to be good, he's going to be great."" -- Rivers on Ball. TIP-INS Lakers: F Larry Nance Jr. returned after missing 11 straight games with a broken bone in his left hand. ... LaVar Ball and youngest Ball brother LaMelo sat next to the Clippers bench.

"CLEVELAND -- LeBron James lost his cool. Kevin Love and Cavaliers stayed just as hot. Incensed at not getting a foul called on a drive to the basket, James was ejected for the first time in his illustrious career on Tuesday night, tossed in the third quarter of Cleveland's 108-97 win over the Miami Heat. Love scored 32 of his 38 points in the first half and James added 21 as the Cavaliers extended their winning streak to nine. With the Cavs leading by 23, James, who had attempted just one free throw at that point, drove the length of the floor and drew contact from Miami's James Johnson and Dion Waiters. When he didn't hear a whistle, James screamed and gestured toward referee Kane Fitzgerald, who quickly called a technical and pointed for the three-time champion to leave the floor. It was the first time James had been thrown out in 1,082 career NBA games, and he said it was a first since he started playing basketball as a boy in Akron. ""On that particular play I got fouled all the way up the court, from the time that I stripped him (Johnson) all the way until I got to the rim, and so that's what it's about,"" James said. ""I said what I had to say and I moved on, but he (Fitzgerald) thought that I should get two of them, so it is ... we got the win and that's most important."" James has long complained about not getting calls near the basket, and hinted that his eruption may have been caused by pent-up frustration. ""I'm one of the league leaders in points in the paint,"" he said. ""I drive just as much as anybody. At this point, it's almost like they're trying to turn me into a jump shooter. I can't be a jump shooter. I'm not a jump shooter. I watch games every single night and I see jump shooters going to the line multiple, double-digit times every night. ""I'm not a jump shooter and I get fouled just as much as everybody else, so it's going to the line one time, three times or four times, that's not what it's about."" Fitzgerald said he couldn't let James' actions go unpunished. ""It was a culmination of a couple different acts,"" he told a pool reporter. ""Immediately after the no-call, he turned and threw an air punch directly at me and then he aggressively charged at me and then he used vulgarity in my ear a few times."" Love had his way with every defender Miami put on him, finishing 10 of 16 from the field and 14 of 17 on free throws. He scored 22 in the first quarter and the Cavs opened a 27-point lead before halftime. Dwyane Wade added 17 points for Cleveland, which has shaken off a slow start and is again playing like the team to beat in the Eastern Conference. Wade said he has seen James that mad before. ""I just ain't never seen him get ejected,"" Wade said. ""But I've definitely seen him that mad before. He only got one ejection -- 15 years, that's pretty good."" Waiters scored 21 and Bam Adebayo had 19 for the Heat, who had won three in a row. Goran Dragic finished with just seven points -- 12 below his team-leading scoring average. The Heat closed to 93-76 early in the fourth, but Wade scored six straight points and fed Kyle Korver for a 3-pointer to give Cleveland a 102-79 lead. ""Felt that I needed to do something to help this team keep our lead,"" Wade said. ""Just got in an aggressive mindset, got a couple shots to fall and had a nice assist to Kyle for a long three-ball."" WHOLE LOTTA LOVE At the end of the first quarter, Miami had 24 points to Love's 22 and there didn't seem to be anything Heat coach Erik Spoelstra could do to stop Cleveland's All-Star center. Love was able to pull Heat shot-swatter Hassan Whiteside away from the basket, and he was too physical for Kelly Olynyk, who went to the bench with early foul trouble. ""I just like that he was aggressive,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. ""When they put smalls on him he posted up and got to the free-throw line. When he had 5s on him he was able to stretch out and make shots on the perimeter. All around big game to have 38 points and nine rebounds in 25 minutes. It's huge."" BASKETBALL BROTHERS Following the game, Wade swapped jerseys with Udonis Haslem, his long-time Miami teammate. ""I get a lot of credit for all the things I did in Miami, but No. 40 was right next to me along the way,"" Wade said. ""He talked me off the ledge a lot of times. I talked him off the ledge a lot. We're brothers away from the game of basketball and he was one of the first men that I told I love him."" TIP-INS Heat: Trailed by 34 in the first half. ... Spoelstra isn't surprised that Wade has embraced his role coming off the bench for Cleveland. ""Any role that has to do with winning suits him,"" Spoelstra said. ""That's what he's been about his whole career."" Cavaliers: Cleveland has made at least 10 3-pointers in 10 straight games. ... Lue said the next step for G Isaiah Thomas in his comeback from a serious hip injury is to play 2-on-2 and 3-on-3. That hasn't happened yet, and Lue does not know if Thomas will make his debut earlier than the team's original projection of the end of December. ...

"CHICAGO --  For all the big shots he hit, Devin Booker was most proud of the one he blocked. Booker scored 33 points, and the Phoenix Suns held off the Chicago Bulls for a 104-99 win on Tuesday night. Booker looked just fine after sitting out a game because of inflammation in his right big toe, nailing five 3-pointers and grabbing nine rebounds. But the play that most stood out to him came in the final minute. The Suns were leading by five with about 30 seconds left when Chicago's Kris Dunn stole the ball from Tyler Ulis and went for a layup. Booker raced back to block him. ""That's crunch time, so whatever I had to do to win,"" he said. T.J. Warren scored 25 for Phoenix. Alex Len had 13 points and tied a career high with 18 rebounds after not playing in two of the previous three games. The Suns dominated on the glass 57-41 while snapping a three-game losing streak. ""I'm proud of this team,"" Booker said. ""We fought hard tonight. A lot of energy, talking on defense. Things that we needed to be working on, we did today."" The rebuilding Bulls are a league-worst 3-16 after dropping their sixth straight. Justin Holiday made a career-high six 3-pointers on his way to 25 points for Chicago. Dunn added a personal-best 24 points, hitting all four from long range, and eight assists. ""It's tough on everybody,"" Dunn said. ""Everybody, from the coaching staff to the players, we all come from a winning mentality in high school and college, so it's definitely hard. As a group, we have to understand we're young and we have to look at the future. There's going to be something good at the near end."" HANGING ON Phoenix came out on top after Chicago cut a 15-point fourth-quarter lead to three in the final minute. Bulls rookie Lauri Markkanen hit a 3 to make it 102-99 with 22.5 seconds left. But Warren hit two free throws and blocked a 3 by Markkanen to help preserve the win. The Suns went on a 12-point run in the third to go up 63-49, with Ulis hitting a 3 and converting a three-point play and Booker nailing two from long range. The Bulls cut it to three heading into the fourth. But the Suns went on a 14-2 run to start the quarter, with Troy Daniels nailing a 3 to make it 87-72 with 8:22 left. QUOTABLE ""We hung in there when our shots were not going down (in the first half). We talked about making them call the first timeout. I'm sick and tired of calling the first timeout in quarters and they come out with a 7-0 run to take control and put it up to a double-digit game. Then in the fourth quarter, they get off to a 14-2 start. It's just so hard to continue to climb uphill, especially late in the game like that."" -- Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg. TIP-INS Suns: The Suns swept the Bulls for the first time since the 2007-08 season. ... Booker has eight 30-point games this season. Bulls: F Nikola Mirotic attended a game for the first time since a preseason altercation with teammate Bobby Portis left him with several broken bones in his face as well as a concussion.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  When John Wall is out for Washington, the Wizards are going to need contributions from a variety of players. Otto Porter Jr. stepped up Tuesday night. Porter scored 22 points, including a 22-foot jumper with 25 seconds remaining, and the Wizards held on for a 92-89 road win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""It's well-documented we've got to get more looks for him in the fourth quarter,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""He came up big."" Washington trailed for most of the final period. After Porter's jumper made it 91-89, Minnesota had two shots at the other end but couldn't convert. The Wizards got the ball back with 4.2 seconds remaining when the ball went out of bounds off Timberwolves forward Taj Gibson. Officials originally ruled that Minnesota maintained possession, but a review overturned the call and gave the ball to Washington. The Wizards' backups played a key role in the victory. Washington's reserves outscored Minnesota's 18-7 in the fourth quarter and 49-11 for the game. Kelly Oubre Jr. added 16 points for Washington, which played the opener of a back-to-back. Fellow reserves Jodie Meeks and Mike Scott each scored 12 points. ""They came in and played well for us. They gave us great energy,"" Porter said. ""We kind of fed off that energy in the second half."" Brooks felt comfortable leaving much of his second unit on the floor in the fourth. Oubre, Scott and center Ian Mahinmi all played more than 10 minutes in the final period. Starters Markieff Morris and Marcin Gortat didn't play at all in the fourth. ""The good thing about our team, we've got guys that are willing to sacrifice and they understand that just because you start doesn't mean you have to finish the game,"" Brooks said. Karl-Anthony Towns had 20 points and 15 rebounds for Minnesota for his league-leading 18th double-double. Jimmy Butler had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Gibson finished with 16 points and 11 boards. Point guard Tyus Jones, filling in for the injured Jeff Teague, had 12 points and tied a season high with seven assists. Minnesota led by as many as 12 in the first half before Washington responded with a 16-2 run for a brief 34-31 lead. The Timberwolves closed out the first half on an 11-4 surge for an eight-point lead at the break. The Timberwolves were without Teague and reserve forward Nemanja Bjelica, who were sidelined by injuries. With its depth depleted, Minnesota's second unit struggled. ""When you're short-handed and we're down two rotation players, we can't underestimate how hard we have to play the whole time to get that win,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""And if you get a lead you have to play tough with the lead. You can't play a loose game."" Towns had a brief scare in the first quarter when his knee collided with the knee of Porter. Towns remained on the ground briefly, holding his right knee, before returning to action. He was eventually replaced by Gorgui Dieng but returned later in the quarter. Porter scored 13 points in the third to keep the game within reach. That included a trio of 3-pointers for the fifth-year forward that helped trim Minnesota's lead to 71-68 after three. Wizards leading scorer Bradley Beal was held in check. Beal, who came into the game averaging 24.2 points, had eight points. It was just the second time this season he has been held to single digits. ""I trust my teammates to make shots,"" said Beal, who had six assists. ""Every time I got in the paint, it was clogged so I found guys open for 3s."" TIP-INS Wizards: Wall missed his second straight game with a sore left knee. ... Washington snapped a two-game losing streak. Timberwolves: Minnesota is 1/3 in the first game of back-to-backs this season. TOWNS REACHES 4,000-POINT MARK With a basket in the fourth quarter, Towns surpassed 4,000 points in his young career. The 22-year-old Towns needed 18 points coming into the day to reach the milestone.","400975051"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Derrick Favors hasn't been shy about wanting to prove himself to the world after injuries derailed his last two seasons. The Utah Jazz big man took advantage of a national television audience to do exactly that. Favors scored 24 points, and the Jazz used a dominant second half to pull away from the Denver Nuggets for a 106-77 victory Tuesday night. Rookie Donovan Mitchell added 16 points as Utah matched a season high with its third straight victory. Jonas Jerebko had 15 and Ricky Rubio finished with 13 points. ""I just wanted, basically, to come out and show everybody I'm back,"" Favors said. ""I'm 100 percent healthy now. Just come out and play my game. Be aggressive offensively and defensively. ""I know everybody was kind of basing my whole career off of last year when I was injured and wasn't moving right. I just want to show everybody I'm back to who I was before I got hurt."" The Jazz opened the third quarter with a 20-6 run, and Denver never recovered. The Nuggets got a little loose with the ball after halftime and turned over the ball seven times in the third. The Jazz defense was more active and the Nuggets went cold from the field while Utah shot 52.6 percent from the field in the quarter. The Jazz outscored the Nuggets 58-28 in the second half. ""That was a really good defensive effort for us, especially in the second half,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Our habits are getting better. That's a credit to the work that they've been doing and the focus they've been giving. ""The biggest thing defensively in the second half was we secured the defensive glass better. They had 10 offensive rebounds at halftime. It's tough when you work hard and you get a stop and they get an offensive rebound."" Favors outplayed Nikola Jokic on both ends of the floor and his aggressiveness on offense helped finish off the victory. He also had nine rebounds, five assists and three blocks. Without Rudy Gobert, Rodney Hood and Joe Johnson, the Jazz got a group effort, with Mitchell, Jerebko and Rubio also coming up with big plays. Gary Harris scored 14 of his 18 points for Denver in the first half, and Kenneth Faried had 11 points and eight rebounds. ""Got our (butt) kicked,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""It's simply put. They turned it up, they got into us, they were physical. They turned us over, they dominated the offensive glass. They did whatever they wanted. We were completely out played. ""For 20 games now turnovers have been an issue and not surprisingly an issue tonight. ... So just an awful embarrassing night for the Denver Nuggets."" Jokic added, ""They just turned it up to another level and we weren't even close."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Wilson Chandler did not play due to a lower back injury. Faried made his second start of the season in his place. Malone called Chandler day to day. Jazz: Hood did not play due to left ankle soreness. Snyder said the injury has been gradually getting worse and the team has been monitoring it. ... Mitchell became the second player in franchise history to score 300 points in his first 21 games. Darrell Griffith was the first in 1980-81. DIFFERENT LOOK Nuggets forward Paul Millsap is out after having surgery on his left wrist. Malone explained the difference of having Faried on the floor more with Jokic. ""He and Kenneth have such great chemistry because Kenneth runs the floor and puts pressure on the rim,"" Malone said. ""If he's not at the rim, he's working the baseline. Now you have Nikola up high post, elbow, making plays for everybody. ""That was the challenge early in the season with Paul Millsap and Nikola, we had five guys on the perimeter quite a bit. Didn't have anybody putting pressure on the rim. When you have somebody putting pressure on the rim, that forces somebody to account for that man. And therein lies an open man somewhere, and that's where Nikola's at his best.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Giannis Antetokounmpo wasn't the least bit surprised that Milwaukee's most lopsided win of the season coincided with one of the Bucks' best defensive games. The NBA's most improved player last year also issued a warning of sorts to his teammates. ""We can't hide now,"" Antetokounmpo said after scoring 19 of his 32 points in the third quarter of Millwaukee's 112-87 win over the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night. ""We did it today, we played really hard defensively so we have to keep doing that. No excuses as a team."" The Bucks have been erratic at times on both ends of the court this season and had dropped three of four before jumping on the Kings early. Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd credited his team's defense but also praised the offense. The Bucks shot 59 percent with 26 assists. ""There was nothing that was forced,"" Kidd said. ""The ball moved, we didn't hold it, we didn't back down, we didn't dribble 10 times to take a shot. Our guys trusted one another."" Eric Bledsoe had 21 points, five assists and five rebounds for the Bucks, who won for the second time in five games. Khris Middleton scored 12 points. Milwaukee led by as many as 36 and won despite not scoring a second-chance point. Antetokounmpo scored 11 points in the first quarter, but was at his best coming out of halftime. He went 6 for 8 from the field in the third, including a rare 3-pointer. It was Antetokounmpo's eighth 30-point game this season. ""When the ball moves everybody's got energy,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Whenever we move the ball like that as a team it's easy to find one another. It looks good and that's what we have to keep doing."" Milwaukee has won three straight against Sacramento. The Bucks were crisp early, but they didn't pull away until a 20-3 run midway through the second quarter. Bledsoe scored 11 during the run, and Middleton made two free throws to put Milwaukee up 61-34 at halftime. Garrett Temple scored 18 for the Kings, and Buddy Hield added 13 points. Willie Cauley-Stein had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Sacramento came out flat and never recovered, one day after rallying in the fourth quarter to beat the short-handed Golden State Warriors. Even after Jason Kidd emptied his bench in the fourth quarter, Sacramento struggled to get the lead under 30. The Kings committed 11 turnovers in the first half and repeatedly allowed Antetokounmpo to get into the paint for easy buckets. ""That was not a game,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""We struggled right from the jump. They are extremely athletic and they gave us problems with their length, and they made shots tonight."" Jason Terry, who spent a few brief moments with the Kings in 2014 before being traded to Houston, was booed every time he touched the ball. He made a 3-pointer that put the Bucks up 92-56. TIP-INS Bucks: Middleton was a game-time decision because of illness. ... Antetokounmpo `s 3-pointer was only his second make from beyond the arc in the past nine games. ... John Henson was charged with a technical foul after hanging onto the rim following a dunk in the first quarter. Kings: Sacramento missed seven of its first 12 free-throw attempts. ... The Kings are 0-4 on the second night of back-to-backs. ... Rookie De'Aaron Fox shot 2 of 10 and missed all three of his 3-point attempts. GETTING A REST The Bucks most lopsided win since beating Washington 123-96 on Dec. 23, 2016 allowed Kidd to get most of his starters plenty of rest. Tony Snell logged 29 minutes while Antetokounmpo played 26 and Middleton played 23. ""It's always good to see Giannis not at 38 and Khris at 40 or even Tony at 40,"" Kidd said. ""The guys were really professional, took care of business."" DEFENSIVE BREAKDOWN While Milwaukee was celebrating its defensive effort, Sacramento was grumbling about its defense which allowed the Bucks multiple uncontested shots. ""We didn't do the things we needed to do to make it a close game,"" Kings guard Frank Mason said. ""They got anywhere they wanted on the court, a lot of easy lay-ups, uncontested shots, things like that.""","400975053"
"DETROIT --  Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy was worried that his team might suffer a letdown after going to Boston and beating the first-place Celtics. It didn't take the Pistons long to end his worries. The Pistons led by as many as 33 points in the first half and went on to win their third straight game, beating the Phoenix Suns 131-107. Detroit beat the Celtics 118-108 on Monday night. ""I thought it was very impressive to come out and play the way we did tonight after a huge win on Monday,"" Van Gundy said. ""We were really on it from the start defensively, and we were moving the ball and playing with energy on offense."" Tobias Harris and Avery Bradley each scored 20 points, and Andre Drummond had 13 points and matched a career best with seven assists in Detroit's highest-scoring game of the season. The Pistons improved to 14-6 overall, 8-2 at home in their first season at Little Caesars Arena, and 7-1 against the Western Conference. ""It was easy to get fired up for our last two games, but we had to find a way to bring energy to ourselves tonight,"" Jackson said. ""We locked in and stayed with the game plan and our fans were amazing. We were more mature in our approach."" Devin Booker led the Suns with 22 points, and rookie Josh Jackson had a career-high 20. ""I definitely feel like I'm progressing,"" Josh Jackson said. ""It's a learning curve, and that takes times, but our team has nothing but time."" Phoenix has lost four out of five and is 1-2 on a six-game trip. The Suns were coming off a 104-99 victory in Chicago on Tuesday night, while Detroit had Tuesday off after the win in Boston. ""We weren't as sharp as we needed to be against that team,"" Phoenix coach Jay Triano said. ""They had a day to prepare and we didn't, and they went right past us and made every play they wanted to make."" Harris scored 14 points and the Pistons had a season-best 36 points in the first quarter. Detroit shot 62.5 percent in the period to build a 17-point lead. Phoenix continued to struggle in the second, falling behind by 32 points. Detroit led 69-41 at halftime, outshooting the Suns 63 percent to 44.7 percent. Harris had 16 points in the half, and Reggie Jackson added 15. ""We have a lot of guys who are making winning plays right now,"" Pistons rookie Luke Kennard said. ""Reggie is playing great basketball, and when he does that, we can be a really good team."" The Pistons led by as many as 36 in the second half. ""We didn't guard anyone in the second half, which you don't like to see, but they really never cut into the lead until the last few minutes,"" Van Gundy said. ""We were still playing well offensively until the end."" TIP INS Suns: Josh Jackson spent his first two years of high school at Consortium (now Voyageur) Prep, located four miles from Little Caesars Arena. . One night after using 7-footers Tyson Chandler and Dragan Bender as his starting center and power forward in Chicago, Suns coach Jay Triano changed things against the Pistons. Marquese Chriss and former Piston Greg Monroe started, while Chandler didn't play. Pistons: Drummond hit all three free-throw attempts against Phoenix, and is shooting 63 percent from the line this season. Drummond entered the season as the worst free-throw shooter in NBA history, having made 38.1 percent of his attempts over five seasons.","400975054"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Aaron Gordon never got out of control, and that made all the difference for the Magic. ""I think that's what was special about his night -- he wasn't out there trying to play superhero,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""He played within himself for the most part, and as a result he shot a high percentage."" Gordon had 40 points and 15 rebounds Wednesday to help Orlando end a nine-game losing streak with a 121-108 win over the struggling Oklahoma City Thunder. ""I was just aggressive, taking opportunities, not passing anything up. If the open pass presented itself, then I was making the right read,"" he said. Gordon made 13 of 23 shots (57 percent) and scored 20 points in each half. He played the entire second half. ""He played under control, that was the biggest thing,"" Magic guard D.J. Augustin said. ""It didn't even look like he had that many points because he wasn't forcing anything."" Russell Westbrook hit five 3-pointers and scored 20 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter for the Thunder, who lost for the fifth time in six games. Westbrook shot 7 for 10 on 3s and added 11 rebounds, five assists and five steals. ""It's my responsibility to make sure we're ready to play on both sides of the ball,"" Westbrook said. ""To get us out of this funk we've got to lock in. That starts with me and I'll take ownership because I've been here (and) I know the standards we set."" Elfrid Payton had 19 points and Evan Fournier added 16 for the Magic, who shot 59 percent in winning for the first time since Nov. 10. The Thunder went without a field goal for more than five minutes late in the third period, then went scoreless for the first 3 1/2 minutes of the fourth. They were outscored 28-5 during that span. ""When the ball moves and you generate assists ... you're going to shoot a relatively high percentage,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I thought in the second half we weren't really able to do that consistently."" Fournier's free throw with 4:22 left in the third quarter put Orlando ahead to stay. The Magic led 100-80 when Westbrook made the first of his fourth-quarter 3s, and his last one cut Orlando's lead to 109-99 with 4:01 remaining. But Nikola Vucevic hit an open jumper and Payton sank a free throw to turn back the Thunder's comeback attempt. Paul George scored 22 points for the Thunder, who went 0-7 on the road in November. TIP-INS Thunder: The game ended Westbrook's streak of three straight triple-doubles against Orlando, including his 57-point, 13-rebound, 11-assist performance in an overtime win here on March 29. Magic: G-F Terrence Ross left in the second quarter with a right knee injury. ... The Magic came in ranked 29th in total rebound percentage and defensive rebound percentage. ""We have guys that don't commit to boxing out, quite frankly,"" Vogel said.","400975055"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Ben Simmons foiled the Hack-a-Shaq strategy. Simmons scored 31 points, grabbed a career-high 18 rebounds and overcame several intentional fouls, leading the Philadelphia 76ers to a 118-113 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. After cutting a 22-point deficit to single digits with five minutes left, the Wizards started fouling Simmons, who entered the game shooting 56.6 percent from the line. He went 15 for 29, but made six of his last eight. His 24 attempts in the fourth were an NBA record for one quarter, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Info, and the 29 overall set a league mark for rookies. ""I have no fear of taking free throws,"" Simmons said. ""It's not going to happen for much longer."" Joel Embiid had 25 points and 14 rebounds, and Dario Saric added 24 points to help the Sixers (12-8) win for the sixth time in eight games. Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 22 points and Bradley Beal and Jodie Meeks each had 21 for the Wizards (11-10), who have lost five of seven. The Wizards cut the deficit to 14 when Meeks hit consecutive 3-pointers. It was 96-88 when Washington began to send Simmons to the foul line. He missed four of eight free throws as Philadelphia's lead dwindled to 100-97 with 3:35 to go. ""It's not my rule, it's an NBA rule,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said about fouling Simmons. ""Just trying to do whatever it takes to cut the lead. His free throw percentage is not good at the moment so it gave us a chance to shoot 3s while they hopefully miss free throws."" After Simmons made one and missed one, Embiid grabbed the rebound and got fouled. He made one of two. Beals then missed a jumper and Simmons again went to the line and made both, extending the lead to 104-97. ""It's frustrating, but I trust Ben to step up and he did a great job,"" Embiid said. Beal answered with a 3 before Simmons made two more free throws. Simmons then made one and missed one and Embiid fouled out, sending Beal to the line for three. He made all three. Tomas Satoransky's short jumper trimmed Philadelphia's lead to 116-113 with 11.4 seconds left, but Jerryd Bayless iced it at the foul line. Sixers coach Brett Brown said he considered removing Simmons from the game, but chose to let him work through it. ""We decided to roll with Ben and it's going to be part of his evolution,"" Brown said. ""He's going to have a long career and he has to navigate through this. It's going to be part of his growth."" Already playing without injured star John Wall, the Wizards lost Beal for the rest of the first half when he took a shot to the face from Bayless on a layup and sustained a bruise. Beal returned in the third quarter Embiid blocked two shots in a six-second span in the first half. He also swatted Tim Frazier's shot to start a fast break, took a pass from Simmons and threw down a dunk. Saric made the highlight reel by flipping a behind-the-back pass to Robert Covington driving for a layup a few minutes in. WARM WELCOME NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was in attendance and posed for pictures with fans in the third quarter as he walked through the crowd. One fan yelled: ""Take the NFL job."" TIP-INS Wizards: Wall missed his third straight game with a sore left knee. 76ers: Embiid will sit out against Boston on Thursday because the team isn't ready to have him play on back-to-back nights after he fought through injuries his first three seasons, missing the first two years. ... Point guard T.J. McConnell exited the game with a bruised left shoulder. X-rays were negative but Brown doesn't expect McConnell to play vs. the Celtics.","400975056"
"NEW YORK --  Enes Kanter was so good after coming back that it didn't matter that Kristaps Porzingis went out. Kanter had 22 points and 14 rebounds, and the New York Knicks beat the Miami Heat 115-86 on Wednesday night despite losing their leading scorer to a sprained right ankle after 2 1/2 minutes. Back after missing three games with back spasms, Kanter had his way against a Heat team missing starting center Hassan Whiteside because of left knee soreness, going 7 of 9 from the field. ""Enes was a monster today,"" Porzingis said. The Knicks lost all three games Kanter missed, their longest skid since starting 0-3, but shot 60 percent and led by as much as 30 points with their center back. ""I just didn't play three games. I was like so excited, just like so hungry,"" Kanter said. ""I just wanted to go out there and bite somebody's ear off."" Porzingis had started quickly, making his first two shots before he was hurt chasing the ball near the baseline by the Miami bench. Justise Winslow stepped on his foot, causing Porzingis' ankle to turn awkwardly, and he was helped to the locker room during a timeout. The Knicks said X-rays were negative and that their leading scorer was available to return, but they later ruled out a return in the third quarter. There was no need by then the way they were playing. ""He's a big part of our family, but when he goes down everybody just stepped up,"" Kanter said. ""Not just me. Everybody stepped up."" Courtney Lee added 17 points for the Knicks. Kelly Olynyk had 18 for the Heat, who lost in Cleveland on Tuesday and finished their trip 2-2. They had won six straight at Madison Square Garden. Point guard Goran Dragic said energy, especially defensively, was the team's biggest problem. ""I mean, the last two games we couldn't stop nobody,"" Dragic said. ""I feel like they're playing 5 on 0 right now. They can score at will."" New York made nearly 64 percent of its shots in taking a 33-22 lead after one, then extended it to 65-44 at halftime on one of their prettiest baskets of the season. Jarrett Jack got the ball after a Heat miss, fired it all the way down from the free throw line to the other end of the court, where Tim Hardaway Jr. leaped and threw it in in one motion from 21 feet to beat the buzzer. The lead ballooned to 84-54 in the third quarter. TIP-INS Heat: Bam Adebayo, who shot 7 for 7 in Cleveland, made his first four shots starting in place of Whiteside. ... Miami owned a 12-game winning streak in New York that was snapped. Besides their run at MSG that started nearly four years ago, the Heat have won six straight over the Nets in Brooklyn. Knicks: Rookie G Frank Ntilikina missed the game because of a sprained left ankle. ... Joakim Noah was inactive after playing for the Knicks' G League team earlier Wednesday. Noah, who played three minutes Monday in his only appearance since returning from a 20-game suspension for violating the anti-drug policy, had nine points, five rebounds, four assists and one block for Westchester. Rookie Damyean Dotson did play in both games, scoring 23 points in Westchester's loss and getting in this game in the fourth quarter. HASSAN HURTING Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Whiteside had been sore the last few weeks and had been using the day after games to rest. He said Whiteside would be evaluated Thursday when Miami is back home, though didn't believe an MRI would be necessary since Whiteside already had one. ""So this is just part of the process. We anticipated this,"" Spoelstra said. ""Hasn't gotten any worse necessarily, just the schedule hasn't let up and he really hasn't been able to do two days of work in a row for a while."" PORZINGIS' PAIN Porzingis said he thought his injury looked worse than it was and hoped he could return Sunday. He had hoped to even get back in Wednesday's game and told Kanter at halftime he was all right. ""He's a strong unicorn,"" Kanter said.","400975057"
"TORONTO --  The Charlotte Hornets came to Canada in search of their first road win in November. They left still without one thanks to Kyle Lowry and his Toronto teammates. He scored a season-high 36 points, DeMar DeRozan had 30 and the Raptors improved to 7-1 at home by beating the shorthanded Hornets 126-113 on Wednesday night. Lowry set a new career-high by hitting eight 3-pointers. ""He shoots it so effortlessly,"" DeRozan said of Lowry. ""It's great when you see him get it off the way he does when he's shooting it. Another Kyle night."" Jonas Valanciunas scored 12 points and Norman Powell had 10 for the Raptors, who never trailed in winning their second straight. Dwight Howard had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Hornets, who lost their seventh straight road game and dropped to 1-9 away from home. Jeremy Lamb and Frank Kaminksy each scored 18 points and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had 12. Toronto has won five straight at home. ""We always preach protecting home court,"" DeRozan said. ""It's always been our comfort zone when we come back home. It's always been big for us."" Kaminsky said the Hornets can't afford to fall behind by double digits in the first quarter the way they did against Toronto. ""We have to start games better than that, especially on the road,"" Kaminsky said. Hornets coach Steve Clifford said he was ""incredibly disappointed"" with his team's effort after having the past three days off. ""I'm shocked at the level of intensity and attention to detail we played with,"" Clifford said. ""That first half, there was no fight. DeRozan got whatever he wanted, Lowry got whatever he wanted. They took us apart."" Charlotte guard Kemba Walker did not play for the first time this season because of a bruised left shoulder.  An All-Star for the first time last season, Walker was injured in a collision with San Antonio's LaMarcus Aldridge in Saturday's home loss to the Spurs. Clifford said Walker will be re-evaluated after Thursday's practice in Miami, where Charlotte faces the Heat on Friday night, but sounded doubtful about Walker's hopes for a speedy return. ""He's still really sore,"" Clifford said. ""I would think that unless he gets a lot better tomorrow, Friday will be difficult."" Walker scored 115 points in four meetings with Toronto last season, his highest total against any opponent. Nicolas Batum cut it to 109-104 with a 3 with 4:43 left, capping a 7-0 run. DeRozan stopped the spurt with a layup, Serge Ibaka followed with a jumper before Lowry sealed it with his seventh 3-pointer. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte has not won away from home since beating Memphis on October 30. ... Michael Carter-Williams started in Walker's place. Raptors: C.J. Miles returned after missing the previous two games following the birth of his daughter. ... C Lucas Nogueira left in the fourth with a strained right calf. ... Fred VanVleet had a career-high nine assists. ... Toronto's eight home games are tied with Chicago for fewest in the NBA. The Bulls are 2-6 at home. DROWSY DINOSAURS Casey was furious at his team for allowing a 19-2 Hornets run to begin the third. ""That's totally unacceptable,"" Casey said. ""We're not going to win anything if we come out with that attitude."" DeRozan said Casey was still steamed about the sluggish start following the game. ""It was pretty loud,"" DeRozan said of Casey's post-game rant. ROCKY ROAD Chicago (1-10) is the only NBA team with double digit road defeats. Atlanta, Oklahoma City, Orlando, and Sacramento all have nine road losses. SPECIAL GUESTS Blue Jays pitcher Marcus Stroman attended the game, as did actress Elisabeth Moss.","400975058"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden had 29 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds and the Houston Rockets rolled past the Indiana Pacers 118-97 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight victory. Thaddeus Young cut the lead to 10 with a hook shot with about eight minutes left. The Rockets put it away with a 16-4 run that made it 110-88 with about four minutes left. Trevor Ariza made a 3-pointer in that stretch and Ryan Anderson added two finished with 19 points. The Pacers missed numerous shots, were called for defensive three seconds and committed an offensive foul to allow the Rockets to pad the lead. The Rockets improved to 12-1 this month, with the only loss coming on Nov. 14 against Toronto. Young finished with 23 points for the Pacers. They have won seven of their last 10 games. Houston led by 18 after three, but Indiana scored the first seven points of the fourth to get within 89-78. After a timeout, Chris Paul hit a 3-pointer right before the shot clock expired to give the Rockets their first points of the quarter before he found Ryan Anderson for a rare dunk to make it 94-80 with about nine minutes left. The Pacers tied it early in the third quarter before Houston used a 13-4 run to take a 67-58 lead with about seven minutes left in the quarter. Anderson and Trevor Ariza made consecutive 3-pointers to power that run and Ariza added a second 3 later in that span. Indiana got back on track after that, and used a 6-2 spurt, highlighted by a 3-pointer from Bojan Bogdanovic, to get to 69-64. But Houston scored the next eight points, with the last seven from Harden, to push the advantage to 77-66 with about 2 1/2 minutes left in the third. Victor Oladipo ended an almost 2 1/2 minute scoring drought with a 3-pointer after that. It was then that the Rockets got hot from long-range with P.J.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Andrew Wiggins wouldn't let fatigue from consecutive games be an excuse for a poor effort by his Minnesota teammates. So he did something about it. Wiggins scored 28 points to help the Timberwolves beat New Orleans 120-102 on Wednesday night in a game that saw Pelicans forward Anthony Davis ejected for the first time in his career. ""I actually thought I was in rhythm at the start of the game because we were coming off a tough game,"" he said. ""We were down a little bit physically early at times, but to this team's credit we fought through it. When you are playing back-to-back games you are going to have people that are sore and tired. We needed this win. Where we want this team to go in the future, we can't afford to lose two games in a row."" Jimmy Butler and Gorgui Dieng had 19 points each for the Timberwolves (13-9). ""I thought our guys were ready to go tonight,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We brought the right mindset to come in and win the ballgame. I thought they played tough and shared the ball well. When you play for each other good things are going to happen."" The turning point of the game came midway through the second quarter.  With Minnesota leading 45-43, Davis was called for a technical foul. Fifteen seconds later he picked up his second tech and was ejected for the first time in his six-year NBA career. Minnesota responded by finishing the half on a 17-6 run to take a 62-49 lead into the halftime locker room. ""That play was a hard play to officiate,"" Thibodeau said. ""Because of the size of DeMarcus, Anthony and Karl-Anthony Towns. It can get pretty physical in there. You can probably call a foul on any play when those guys are matched up against each other."" Davis finished with 17 points and five rebounds. ""You could feel the momentum shift (after Davis was tossed),"" Wiggins said. ""It helped ignite a big run that we were able to outscore them."" Davis' teammate DeMarcus Cousins was frustrated with the call after the game. ""`It's obvious, man,"" he said. ""It's a joke. It's a complete joke. What I don't understand is that players are punished for playing off emotion or showing their emotion... but other people are allowed to and it's totally fine."" New Orleans was led by Jrue Holiday, who finished with 27 points. Cousins added 17. Trailing 93-76 at the beginning of the fourth quarter, New Orleans would get as close as 98-88 on a 3-pointer by Holiday with 8:19 left, but the Timberwolves responded by scoring the next six points to push the advantage to 104-88. New Orleans (11-10) started the game hot, opening on a 10-2 run. Two free throws by Wiggins with 1:06 left in the opening quarter tied the game 26-26 and a bucket by Crawford cut the lead to 29-28 at the end of the quarter. Dieng's 3-pointer to open the second quarter gave Minnesota the lead for good at 31-29 with 11:30 in the first half.

"DALLAS --  Demarre Carroll wasn't happy about the way the Brooklyn Nets started the third quarter in a 109-104 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night. ""We looked lackadaisical,"" Carroll said. ""Nobody was being aggressive, so I just decided to be aggressive."" It worked. Carroll scored 15 of his 22 points in the third quarter, hitting three 3-pointers and shooting 5 of 6 from the floor. ""I just feel like a lot of guys look up to me and try to see what I'm going to do,"" Carroll said. ""So I just try to come out and do whatever I need to do to help this team win.""

Dallas responded with a 7-0 run, cutting it to 106-104, before the Nets finally iced it with a pair of rebounds in the final 10.5 seconds. Harris split a pair of free throws with 10.5 seconds remaining, but Brooklyn kept possession after the rebound went off a Mavericks player and out of bounds. Dinwiddie then missed a pair of free throws with 7.4 seconds left, but Booker grabbed a rebound, and Dinwiddie redeemed himself with a pair of free throws to complete the scoring with 5.2 seconds remaining. It was a missed opportunity for the Mavericks. ""It's lack of execution,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""It's on me, I had the wrong in the game. I've got to get guys in there that can go and get the ball. In the second half they beat us to multiple loose balls."" Brooklyn struggled at the free-throw line, going 14 of 25 attempts. ""It might be mental at this point,"" Carroll said.

""We play like this and our players get a day off. We've got a lot of thinking to do about how we want to finish this homestand."" BIG WIN The Nets won two of three games on their road trip, and had a strong showing in a loss to the Houston Rockets. For coach Kenny Atkinson it was a big step in the right direction after entering the trip with a 2-7 record on the road. ""You hate to say there are big games in an NBA season because it's so long, but we talked about getting two on this trip,"" Atkinson said. ""We knew it was going to be a tough trip.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs are glad to have Tony Parker back, especially LaMarcus Aldridge. Aldridge set his San Antonio high with 41 points and the Spurs spoiled J.B. Bickerstaff's debut as Memphis coach, beating the Grizzlies 104-95 on Wednesday night to hand them their ninth straight loss. Aldridge established a season best for the second consecutive game, topping his 33-point outing Monday against Dallas. It's not a coincidence that the 6-foot-11 forward has enjoyed two big games in a row since Parker returned. ""He's a big-time pick-and-roll player, and that's what I love to do,"" Aldridge said. ""I think he benefits from having me out there and vice versa. He got me going early, found me two or three easy ones and after that I was good to go."" Aldridge scored 17 of San Antonio's first 19 points, going 6 for 7 from the field and 3 of 3 on 3-pointers. He finished 17 for 24 from the floor while falling three points shy of the career high he set with Portland. ""LaMarcus was just hot. He had a great game,"" said Memphis' Tyreke Evans, who scored a team-high 22 points. Parker had 10 points and five assists while playing 18 minutes in his second game back since undergoing surgery to repair a torn left quadriceps tendon. The Spurs took their largest lead at 66-51 three minutes into the third quarter after Parker set up Aldridge for 19- and 20-foot jumpers. ""Tony's very knowledgeable,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""His IQ in the pick-and-roll is off the charts. He makes us a better team with pick-and-roll. It helps players and helps the bigs because they know where the ball is coming from and Tony knows how to deliver it."" San Antonio, which became the first NBA team with 10 home wins this season, has won three straight overall. The Grizzlies continued to play short-handed in their first game since coach David Fizdale was fired. Memphis was without Mike Conley, Chandler Parsons, Mario Chalmers and Brandan Wright. The Grizzlies have not won since beating Portland on Nov. 7, but they found some hope against the Spurs after a lackluster effort in a 98-88 loss Sunday against Brooklyn in their final game under Fizdale. ""I think (it was) something we can build on,"" Memphis veteran Marc Gasol said. ""Some of the mistakes that were made, now you can coach them. I thought in the previous games, a lot of the mistakes we were making were hard to coach. It's a lot of indecisive doubt among guys and when guys have doubt, it seems like they're not giving the effort. But tonight everybody was on the same page.""

The 11-year veteran has been out since Nov. 13. ... Parsons missed his third game of the season as part of a planned absence for treatment on his right knee. ... Chalmers sat out with an injured right ankle. Spurs: Parker went to the locker room with 6:04 left in the third and returned with 1:44 remaining in the quarter with his left knee wrapped in ice. He went inside with a trainer and was not followed by team doctors, who remained in their seat while Parker was in the back. ...

Aldridge has 32 3-pointers with the Spurs, two more than Tim Duncan had during his 19 seasons in San Antonio. NOT TO BLAME Gasol dismissed speculation that he played a part in Fizdale's firing because of a supposedly frosty relationship between the coach and veteran player. Gasol was upset he did not play the entire fourth quarter of Memphis' loss to Brooklyn, but said he had nothing to do with Fizdale's firing. ""Obviously, there is a huge gap from perception to reality,"" Gasol said about the speculation. ""But I can't control that and I'm not going to try to. So, I'm just going to focus on my job and the things I've got to do for this team to get back on track.""","400975062"
"LOS ANGELES --  Stephen Curry was having an off night. By the time the fourth quarter ended, he had hit only six of 17 shots -- and three of those misses were air balls. But when the game went into overtime, the two-time MVP showed again what makes him the NBA's best shooter. Curry hit two 3-pointers to open the extra period and the Warriors outlasted the pesky Los Angeles Lakers 127-123 on Wednesday. ""Obviously, he had a horrible start to the game, but what makes Steph, Steph, is on a night like tonight he can still make huge plays,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""It takes a special player to bounce back within the same game and be able to reverse that, and that's what he did."" Curry scored 28 points, 13 in overtime. Kevin Durant led the Warriors with 29 points and Klay Thompson added 20 as Golden State avoided losing consecutive games for the first time this season. The Lakers got a career-high 32 points from Brandon Ingram to push the defending champs into overtime. He and Durant dueled back-and-forth all night. It was the first meeting of the season between the division foes, also making it the first matchup between Curry and Lakers rookie point guard Lonzo Ball. Ball finished with 15 points and a game-high 10 assists. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Jordan Clarkson added 21 points each for the Lakers, with Julius Randle scoring 20. ""I love the way our guys competed defensively,"" Los Angeles coach Luke Walton said. ""We set a challenge for them -- let's be aggressive but smart. The Warriors are struggling with turnovers so far this year, so we wanted to use that to our advantage."" Golden State turned the ball over 22 times. ""Tonight was absolutely galling,"" Kerr said. ""There were some mind-boggling plays out there, and I don't know what to tell you. We've got to be able to take better care of the ball and make better decisions."" It helps when you have Curry, who despite struggling almost all night, can quickly step up when needed. ""It comes from experience and knowing how to deal with bad shooting nights, and stick with it,"" he said. ""Obviously, it happened. You try to play smarter and get yourself into a rhythm."" TIP-INS Warriors: Kerr said he's not currently concerned about the team's occasionally passive play: ""I think going to the Finals three years in a row and then trying to do it again a fourth time, you're just naturally not going to have quite as much of that killer instinct. It's just human nature. I know it's in there, so I'm not worried. It's still November. If this were happening in March, I'd be pretty concerned. But I understand what we're dealing with and going through. I went through this as a player in Chicago and understand it's a long race."" Lakers: F Kyle Kuzma experienced back spasms during warmups and did not play. ... Walton said he wasn't overly concerned by the team's tepid start: ""We're a lot further ahead right now than we were last year. And I anticipate with the players we have and the way they work, we'll be further ahead next year."" BRUISING GAME After scoring five consecutive points in the third quarter, Ball was in a scrape on the floor for a loose ball when his head slammed against the court. It opened up a small cut above his left eye. The Lakers closed it with a Steri-Strip and Ball returned to the game. MISSED OPPORTUNITY Los Angeles had a chance to win at the end of regulation when Randle rebounded Durant's miss with 5.3 seconds to play. The Lakers set up a play for Ingram, but he missed a driving 8-footer. KERR IMPRESSED Despite the Lakers' 8-13 record, Kerr sees positives in their rebuilding effort. ""The talent level has gone way up and their guys are getting better,"" he said. ""They were impressive tonight.""","400975063"
"ATLANTA --  LeBron James' unusual midgame defensive switch was the hot topic after he helped Cleveland extend its winning streak. James took command of a challenging defensive assignment and stuck around to see the end of the Cavaliers' 10th straight victory, 121-114 over the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night. James had 24 points and 12 assists, and Kevin Love finished with 25 points and 16 rebounds to help Cleveland hold off Atlanta to extend the NBA's longest active winning streak. It was James' 14th double-double in 22 games. James had frequent exchanges with the officials but avoided serious confrontations following his first ejection in 1,082 career games Tuesday night in a home victory over Miami. Dennis Schroder, who led Atlanta with 27 points, blew past Cavaliers guard Jose Calderon to score on three straight layups to give Atlanta a 67-58 lead late in the first half. James (6-foot-8, 250 pounds) then took over primary defensive duties on Schroder (6-1, 172) to close the half and continued covering the super-quick guard in the second half. ""He was kicking our butts in the first half,"" said James of Schroder. ""My teammates asked me to take the challenge. I wanted the challenge."" James seemed to relish the chance to test his skills against the point guard. ""I can't give that up,"" he said. Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said the defensive switch ""was big time for us."" Even though James also guarded Schroder at times in Atlanta's 117-115 win at Cleveland on Nov. 4, Schroder said the defensive switch was still a shock. ""It's amazing when the best player in the world tries to stop you and tries to guard you,"" Schroder said. ""I still tried to be aggressive. It doesn't mean that I have to stop playing. He's a big body and it's tough to just go past him."" Schroder was held to 10 points in the second half while being shadowed by James. ""I don't think anybody understands how tough that is,"" Cleveland's Dwyane Wade said about James' defensive challenge. ""But that's why LeBron's one of the greatest players to play the game."" The Cavaliers took the lead by outscoring the Hawks 36-23 in the third quarter. Love had 12 points while making three 3s in the period. Cleveland stretched its lead to double figures for the first time at 90-79 on a 3-pointer by James. The Cavaliers led 99-90 entering the final period. A basket by Ersan Ilyasova cut Cleveland's lead to 111-108. Cleveland's Jeff Green and Atlanta's Kent Bazemore traded jams before two free throws by Ilyasova cut it to 113-112. The Cavaliers survived the crisis when James sank a 3-pointer over Bazemore and Wade added a short floater. Ilyasova had 22 points while making four 3-pointers. Marco Belinelli had 18 points and rookie John Collins had 13. TIP-INS Cavaliers: G Isaiah Thomas (hip) participated in pregame shooting but is not yet ready for full-speed drills. ... Wade had 19 points. Jae Crowder had 15 points and Green had 12. ... The Cavaliers ended a streak of three straight losses in the series. ""They've just always been a tough matchup for us,"" said Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue. Hawks: G Isaiah Taylor returned after missing five games with a right retinal tear. Coach Mike Budenholzer said Taylor ""had a good practice"" after being cleared on Wednesday and would be Schroder's top backup barring more problems. ... F Luke Babbitt (lower back) started and scored eight points after missing three games. MORE 3s FOR CAVS Cleveland trailed 67-63 at halftime despite making 8 of 17 3-pointers. The Cavaliers made 18 of 39 3s overall, including four by Love, giving them 11 straight games with 10 or more long-range shots. SURGERY FOR SHUMPERT Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert was set to have arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Friday morning in Cleveland after he was reevaluated by team physicians Dr. Richard Parker and Dr. James Rosneck. Shumpert is averaging 4.8 points and 3.1 rebounds in 13 games.","400975064"
"BOSTON --  Isaiah Thomas developed a reputation in Boston for big performances late in games. It's quickly becoming apparent that the Celtics probably have an even more potent scoring weapon in Kyrie Irving. The star guard scored 36 points and Boston held off the weary and short-handed Philadelphia 76ers 108-97 on Thursday night to improve the NBA's best record to 19-4. It was Irving's fifth game this season with 30 or more points. Al Horford added 21 points and eight rebounds, and Marcus Morris had 17 points as the Celtics bounced back from Monday night's home loss to Detroit with their ninth victory in 11 games. ""It's go time, man,"" Irving said of his mindset in the fourth quarter. ""Especially when the game is in the balance. It's the best time to play. It's just ultimate freedom."" Boston led by five at the end of the third quarter but started the fourth by connecting on seven of its first 11 shots to increase the margin to 95-82. Irving had nine points in the final 12 minutes. ""It's a luxury. Not a lot of teams have that,"" Horford said of Irving's ability to take over games. ""His will to win and make those shots when we need them most -- it just keeps impressing me game by game."" Dario Saric led Philadelphia with 18 points. JJ Redick finished with 17 and Ben Simmons had 15. ""Kyrie is obviously amazing,"" Redick said. ""Horford doesn't get enough credit for how good he is offensively. As good as Kyrie is, Horford is the hub of everything they do."" It was the third game in four nights for the 76ers, who have lost two of three. Saturday's game against Detroit will conclude a week featuring matchups with the East's three top teams. Philadelphia played without center Joel Embiid, who continues to rest on the second night of back-to-backs. With Embiid out, Celtics coach Brad Stevens went with a bigger lineup, starting Aron Baynes in place of Morris. Philadelphia was able to keep the game tight by knocking down 16 3-pointers. TIP-INS 76ers: A night after taking 29 free throws, an NBA rookie record, Simmons went to the line only four times. ... Embiid, Markelle Fultz (right shoulder soreness), T.J. McConnell (sprained AC joint, left shoulder) and Jahlil Okafor (individualized training) were not with the team. Celtics: Marcus Smart left in the fourth quarter with pain in his right ankle. He got treatment in the locker room and said afterward that it was feeling better. ... Irving had five of Boston's 12 3-pointers. ... Boston outscored Philadelphia 44-36 in the paint. QUOTABLE ""He's certainly one of the most gifted scorers in the game. He can do things just with a tiny amount of space and make it look easy."" -- Stevens on Irving. RUNNING TIME The Celtics ended the second quarter on an 11-3 run and took a 54-44 lead into halftime. Boston shot 48 percent from the field and was 7 of 16 from beyond the 3-point line. Philadelphia erased a 12-point deficit and took a 67-65 lead in the third quarter, but Boston got hot again, ending that period on an 11-4 run that included six points by Morris. TOUGH SCHEDULE The Sixers have already played some of the league's top teams just 21 games into the season. Thursday was their second meeting with the Celtics, and they've also played Golden State and Houston twice, and Cleveland. But coach Brett Brown is thankful for the tough road they've plodded thus far. ""We're playing NBA royalty right now,"" Brown said. ""We're playing against the league's best. The analytics people tell us we've had the most difficult schedule to date in the NBA, and it feels like that. But I think it expedites learning. ... You're always learning from All-Stars.""","400975065"
"DENVER --  Will Barton provided the early spark, then delivered in the final moments to help the Denver Nuggets escape with a narrow victory. Barton capped a career-high 37 points with a driving layup with 3.2 seconds left and the Nuggets overcame the loss of Nikola Jokic to beat the Chicago Bulls 111-110 on Thursday night. Gary Harris added 21 points, and Kenneth Faried had 14 points and 13 rebounds for Denver, which lost another big man to injury when Jokic was hurt. He joins Paul Millsap (wrist surgery) and Wilson Chandler (back injury) on the sidelines. ""We were already without Paul and Wilson, Joke goes down, it was like, `Man, we just can't lose this game,"" Barton said. ""I just wanted to step it up. It was definitely one of my biggest games here."" Jokic went down with 44 seconds left in the second quarter when he drove to the basket and stepped on Jerian Grant's foot. Jokic hit two free throws before heading to the locker room with an obvious limp. He didn't return in the second half. Coach Michael Malone said after the game that Jokic would get treatment and his status for Saturday's game is unknown Lauri Markanen and Robin Lopez had 20 points each for Chicago, and Kris Dunn added 19. The Bulls have lost seven straight to finish 2-13 in November and drop to 3-17 overall. The Bulls, who led for most of the game, took advantage of Jokic's absence and led 108-105 in the final minute. Barton was fouled on a 3-point attempt and hit all three free throws to tie it, then made 1 of 2 to give Denver a one-point lead with 20 seconds left. Dunn gave Chicago the lead with a layup with 9.6 seconds left, and it came down to Barton with the ball. ""I dreamed of those moments when I was young, having the ball in my hands at crunch time and delivering,"" Barton said. ""I'm just thankful I could do that tonight."" He brought the ball up, put a move on Justin Holiday and drove to the basket and hit the reverse layup after the ball hung on the rim. The Bulls missed an opportunity to get a rare road win. ""I didn't do my job and I let my teammates down,"" Holiday said. ""I just didn't do what I was supposed to do in that situation, that's pretty much it. I am very disappointed. We have that game in the bag. It just hurts that I let my teammates down."" Chicago led 68-62 at halftime but Denver rallied to briefly take the lead in the third quarter. Grant hit a 3-pointer at the end of the third to put the Bulls ahead 92-91. ""We took a step in the right direction tonight and we went out there and competed for 48 minutes,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I thought we really had a competitive edge to our team. It's hard to get over big emotional wins and it's tough to get over devastating losses."" TIP-INS Bulls: F Nikola Mirotic has increased his practice load and is close to returning. ""He's really in training camp mode,"" Hoiberg said. ""He's had a lot of individual work but nothing simulates that playing up and down, 5-on-5 type action.

Zach LaVine (left ACL tear) will have a full practice Friday after going through individual drills Thursday. Nuggets: Chandler was out for the second straight game with low back soreness. Juancho Hernangomez again got the start in his place. ... Richard Jefferson played a season-high 12 minutes. VETERAN SAVVY When Jokic tried to walk to the locker room after getting hurt, Jefferson ran over and stopped him. The 16-year veteran told the 22-year-old center he needed to take his foul shots before leaving. ""It was chaotic. It was a timeout and he was saying he was done,"" Jefferson said. ""I was like, `Dude, if don't go and shoot the free throws, one, the other team gets to pick who shoots them and two, if you go back in the half and you start feeling a little better you can't come back.""","400975066"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Bucks tried to take 3-pointers away and contest every shot, a tactic that worked well against Portland. Khris Middleton had 26 points, Eric Bledsoe had 25 and Milwaukee beat the Trail Blazers 103-91 on Thursday night to snap Portland's three-game winning streak. Giannis Antetokounmpo added 20 points, nine rebounds and three blocked shots for the Bucks, who have won their last four games against the Blazers. ""I think it was our defense,"" Middleton said. ""(CJ) McCollum and Dame (Lillard), those are two dynamic scorers, especially from the 3-point line. We did a great job of keeping them off the line."" The Bucks led by 24 points in the third quarter and the Blazers struggled to keep up. Portland was also vexed by turnovers, with 19. Jusuf Nurkic led Portland with 25 points and 11 rebounds, while Damian Lillard added 18 points. Lillard's layup closed Portland within 94-81 with 5:52 left, and it appeared the Blazers may rally, but Middleton answered with an 11-foot jumper. Portland's frustration was clear when Nurkic and coach Terry Stotts both earned technicals for a foul call on Nurkic on a block. ""Tough game,"" Lillard said. ""They played physical, they played aggressive defensively. We know they like to load up and use their length, and they were allowed to play that way. So it is what it is."" Portland was coming off a 4-1 trip, including a 103-91 victory over the Knicks on Monday. The Blazers also saw the return of forward Al-Farouq Aminu, who missed 13 games with a right ankle injury. But they struggled with the Bucks from the start. Middleton hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Bucks a 33-21 lead at the end of the first quarter. Portland went on a 10-2 run to close within 35-31, but Middleton slowed the rally with a long jumper. John Henson's short jumper put the Bucks up 46-33 as the Trail Blazers struggled to find much offensive flow. Lillard went up for a layup to end the half, and he was blocked by Antetokounmpo. Milwaukee led 60-45 at the break, propelled by Bledsoe with 17 points. Bledsoe's jumper stretched the lead to 69-49 in the third quarter. Bledsoe's layup made it 83-59, and boos could be heard among the hometown fans. Henson had 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Bucks, who withstood any efforts by the Blazers to rally. ""They've grown a lot, understand how to finish a game,"" coach Jason Kidd said. ""It is hard to keep a big lead. You have the tendency to relax. I thought the team did a good job both offensively and defensively. It's hard to win here."" TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee guard Gary Payton II went to Oregon State, following in the footsteps of his famous father. The crowd at the Moda Center greeted him with a warm applause when he came in the game late. ... Thon Maker was given a flagrant foul for elbowing Nurkic in the face in the first quarter. Trail Blazers: With Aminu's return, rookie Caleb Swanigan went to the inactive list for the game. ... Portland wore new all-red ""Statement"" uniforms for the first time. The jerseys featured a black diagonal stripe. TRIBUTE Portland played a video tribute to former Blazer Steve ""Snapper"" Jones, who died this past weekend in Houston after a lengthy illness. Jones was a three-time All-Star in eight ABA seasons and played his lone NBA season with the Blazers in 1975-76 before a lengthy career in broadcasting. He was 75. LETDOWN ""Typically this is the way it goes,"" Lillard said. ""You have a good road trip and then the first game back home, it's a setup for a letdown. We talked about that before the game, we wanted to come out and I guess play above that. And they came in ready. They played a good game.""","400975067"
"LOS ANGELES --  In a matchup of injury-riddled teams, the Utah Jazz had more depth and made it matter. Alec Burks scored a season-high 28 points off the bench and the Jazz went on a 22-4 run early in the fourth quarter Thursday night to turn a one-point advantage into a 126-107 victory over the worn-out Los Angeles Clippers. ""Our defense was awful in the first half,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""I think we got pleased with ourselves because we were scoring, and then wouldn't guard. I thought in the second half we dug in a little bit."" It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Jazz, who were without four injured players -- including starting center Rudy Gobert and leading scorer Rodney Hood. Still, seven Utah players scored in double figures. Rookie guard Donovan Mitchell had 24 points and six assists. ""I think we're just scratching the surface with how good we can be,"" said Jonas Jerebko, who added 14 points. The Clippers played without four starters. Austin Rivers led Los Angeles with 25 points, but only seven after the first half. Lou Williams had 20. ""Lou and Austin were gassed a little bit and it's tough when they had the ball the entire time,"" coach Doc Rivers said. Utah ended up outscoring the Clippers 32-20 in the fourth quarter. Jazz reserves outscored their Los Angeles counterparts 49-30. ""They're trying,"" Snyder said. ""The Clippers are in a tough spot right now. We play these games and we're depleted, but they're in a tough spot. You feel for them, but we came out to play."" DeAndre Jordan at center is the Clippers' lone healthy starter. He finished with eight points and a game-high 16 rebounds. ""Nobody is going to feel sorry for us,"" Jordan said. ""The NBA is full of injuries. We just have to play and figure out a way."" TIP-INS Jazz: With Hood sidelined by a sore left ankle, Utah listed four players out on its daily injury report, including Gobert (bruised tibia), Joe Johnson (wrist tendon instability) and Dante Exum (shoulder surgery). ""We've got our work cut out for us, there's no secret there,"" Snyder said. ""You may not be able to push through at a high level in terms of wins and losses, but you just compete. That's all you can do."" Clippers: Los Angeles' injury situation is even worse. The Clippers are missing starters Blake Griffin (MCL sprain), Patrick Beverley (knee surgery), Danilo Gallinari (sprained ankle) and Milos Teodosic (plantar fascia). ""Everybody just needs to do their job, play their role. The games won't be 30-30, I guarantee you. Someone's going to make some shots,"" Rivers said. GETTING DEFENSIVE Despite scoring 126 points, the Jazz pointed to improved defense in the second half for turning a tight game into an easy win. ""We came out in the second half and played with a lot more energy, especially on the defensive end,"" said Derrick Favors, who had 12 points and 12 rebounds. Still, the Clippers shot 54.3 percent overall. UP THE TEMPO The Jazz were a more methodical team when they played the Clippers in October and lost 102-84. Utah ran more on Thursday and had 12 points off its fast break. ""It starts with (Snyder) and the way he wants to play, and the players we have,"" Jerebko said. ""We have all unselfish guys who know how to pass the ball and how to move the ball, so it's fun to play.""","400975068"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Golden State Warriors are first in the NBA in so many offensive categories you would think adding another one wouldn't mean much. This one did. The Warriors had 46 assists, the most by any team in the NBA this season, in a 133-112 romp over the Orlando Magic on Friday night. Klay Thompson led Golden State with 27 points, Kevin Durant had 25 and Steph Curry 23, but it was the 46 assists on 55 field goals that had the Warriors talking after the game. ""Forty-six assists is insane,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""That's amazing,"" added Durant, who was ejected for arguing with 4:52 left. ""Everybody came and made plays tonight. We moved well without the ball and kept clicking on all cylinders."" Curry matched Draymond Green with a team-high 10 assists ""That's what we pride ourselves on, ball movement, getting everyone involved,"" Curry said. ""Everybody gets touches and we help each other in that way because we are all threats."" Aaron Gordon led Orlando with 29 points, Evan Fournier had 22, and Jonathon Simmons 18. The Magic have lost 10 of their last 11 and were playing catchup all night against the defending NBA champion Warriors. ""Golden State definitely impresses you with everything they do,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""Their passing, their cutting, their ability to play off each other and their shot-making facilitates all of that stuff."" The Warriors shot 62.5 percent from the field and had so many open looks they didn't need to be selective about where the shots came from. Golden State hit 12 of 24 from behind the 3-point line and 11 of the 13 players had at least one assist. ""I think the guys were embarrassed by the last two games,"" Kerr said, referring to an overtime win over the Lakers and a loss to the Sacramento. ""If we can just play with that kind of energy, a little better judgment and a little better defense, we're on to something. This is a good step in the right direction."" Golden State led wire-to-wire, taking advantage of crisp passing and aggressive shooting by its stars to build an early lead and successfully hold off any Magic rallies. Thompson was 11 of 14 from the field, and Durant 10 of 14. Jordan Bell added 16 points, Green had 12 points to go with his 10 assists and five rebounds, and Omri Casspi 11 for Golden State, which expanded a 13-point lead after Durant was ejected. Orlando also had a good night offensively, making 11 three-pointers and shooting 45.8 percent, but the Magic do not have the firepower to get into a shootout with the Warriors. Golden State backup guard Shaun Livingston was the only one of the 19 players used in the first half not to score. EMERGING STAR Not that it needs one, but Golden State may have discovered another emerging star off its bench in rookie Jordan Bell. Kerr promised the second-round pick from Oregon more playing time and he made the most of it, scoring 16 points on 8-of-10 shooting. ""He was great tonight, wonderful energy,"" Kerr said. ""We'll keep playing him and continue to help grow."" Bell also had four rebounds and three blocks in 16 minutes. ""He's obviously a freak athlete and he has a sixth sense on where to be on defense,"" Curry said. ""He seemed like he was extremely comfortable out there."" TOUGHNESS QUESTIONED Magic coach Frank Vogel said he didn't want to comment on his team's inability to sustain effort from game to game, but he was willing to talk about the team's defense, or lack thereof. ""We're not tough enough at the defensive end,"" Vogel said. ""We could be tougher, more alert, more physical, compete more ... we just got to play tougher than that to beat the champs.""

"TORONTO --  With a season-high 70 points in the paint, the Toronto Raptors brushed off the Indiana Pacers for their sixth straight home victory. DeMar DeRozan scored 26 points, Jakob Poeltl made all eight of his field goal attempts and had a career-high 18 points and the Raptors beat the Pacers 120-115 on Friday night. ""We came out extremely aggressive, attacking,"" DeRozan said. ""Everybody was in attack mode."" Serge Ibaka added 15 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 13 and Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet each had 11 for the Raptors. They are 8-1 at home. ""This is our comfort zone,"" DeRozan said. The Raptors set a season-high with 60 points in the paint Wednesday night a victory over Charlotte and wasted no team beating the mark, much to the disappointment of Indiana coach Nate McMillan. ""That was game plan No. 1, to keep them out of the paint, keep them off the free throw line,"" McMillan said. ""To give up 70 points, just not good at all. There is no excuse for that, just no excuse."" Toronto came in averaging 48.4 points in the paint, the most by any Eastern Conference team. The Raptors have scored 50 or more points in the paint in 12 of 21 games, including the past four straight. Poeltl's previous career-high was 14, done twice. His eight made baskets were also a career-high. ""We've been working on it a lot, on my finishing, and I think it's paying off,"" Poeltl said. ""Obviously, there's not a lot of defensive focus on me, so I'm trying to use that space to finish."" Victor Oladipo scored a season-high 36 points for Indiana, and Myles Turner had 17, and Darren Collison 16. The Pacers lost their second straight road game after winning the previous four away from home. They have lost eight consecutive regular-season visits to Toronto. Toronto is 13-0 this season when leading after three quarters. The Raptors led 94-89 heading to the fourth. Indiana trailed by five, 103-98, after Oladipo made three free throws with 8:31 left. Norman Powell answered with a one-handed dunk, sparking an 8-0 run by the Raptors that gave Toronto a 111-98 lead with 6:48 remaining. ""The guys that were in there understood the moment,"" DeRozan said. ""The energy kept it going, the bench kept it going, and we took care of business."" The Pacers rallied, and a layup by Collison made it 116-11 with 1:45 left. Indiana missed its next three shot attempt, allowing DeRozan to seal the victory at the free throw line. Turner started for the Pacers despite a sore right knee suffered when he collided with an opponent in Wednesday night's loss at Houston.

"WASHINGTON --  Washington Wizards forward Markieff Morris studied video with coach Scott Brooks before Friday night's game in an effort to end a slump. The extra work paid off with his best offensive performance of the season. Morris scored 23 points, Tomas Satoransky added a career-high 17 off the bench, and the Wizards beat the Detroit Pistons 109-91 for their first home win in nearly three weeks. ""It's about time I had a good game,"" said Morris, who surpassed his scoring in his previous three games combined. ""I have to keep pressing forward and be more aggressive."" Otto Porter Jr. added 17 points, and Marcin Gortat had 12 points and 12 rebounds for Washington. The Wizards snapped a two-game home losing skid after they outscored Detroit 35-15 in the third quarter, the Pistons' lowest scoring period of the season. Washington also improved to 3-3 this season without All-Star point guard John Wall, who has missed four straight games after getting injections in his left knee to treat swelling. ""That gives us some confidence going on a five-game road trip,"" Brooks said. ""It's not going to be easy. Don't know when he's going to come back."" Andre Drummond had 14 points, 17 rebounds and seven assists for Detroit, which was still outrebounded 49-32. Tobias Harris led with 15 points for the Pistons, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. ""It was a team effort, for sure,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy deadpanned. ""Every guy that played, played poorly."" Morris had just 18 points in his last three games, which prompted the video session with Brooks. ""Basically, he told me my activity was low, standing around the 3-point line too much,"" Morris said. He responded with by shooting 10 of 16 from the floor and 2 of 3 from beyond the arc. He scored 14 of his points in the second half, which Washington began on a 17-0 run to open a 63-52 lead. The Pistons missed six field goals and turned it over four times during that stretch. They didn't get closer than eight points the rest of the way. ""Turnovers on our part and then hard play on their part,"" said Detroit's Reggie Jackson, who scored 12 points. ""They were just able to do anything they wanted."" FRAME FREEZE Wizards guard Bradley Beal began the game wearing protective goggles after taking an elbow to the face in Washington's loss at Philadelphia on Wednesday, but he got rid of them by the second quarter. He scored 10 points. UNDER SIEGE Despite posting impressive numbers himself, Drummond suggested his team was unprepared for the Wizards' rebounding approach. ""We are not used to having an entire team crash the offensive glass,"" he said. ""We didn't do a good job of adjusting to that throughout the game."" SATO SEALS IT Satoransky is getting more minutes with Wall out and scored 11 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter. He finished 5 of 6 from the floor and 5 of 5 from the foul line, leading a bench that outscored Detroit's 41-32. ""We're playing good as a second unit and I think that's something that gives you the confidence when you're playing the point guard position,"" he said. ""Just trying to let the game come to me."" TIP-INS The Pistons registered 20 assists, matching or surpassing 20 for the 15th consecutive game. ... Drummond received a technical foul in the third quarter. ... Drummond has 15 double-doubles in Detroit's 21 games. ... The Wizards announced that their NBA G League team will be named Capital City Go-Go, a reference to a style of music native to the city.

"MIAMI --  Miami erased a brutal start was by a big finish. Josh Richardson scored a career-high 27 points, Dion Waiters added 19 and the Heat shook off a horrendous opening few minutes to beat the Charlotte Hornets 105-100 on Friday night. The Heat went on a 9-0 run in the final moments to decide things, keyed by a 3-pointer from Waiters with 1:09 left for a 102-96 lead. ""We got the win, that's most important,"" Waiters said. ""But once we really figure this thing out, we know how good we can be -- especially defensively."" Miami missed its first 11 shots, six of them coming from 4 feet or closer, and got into a 16-1 deficit before the game was 5 1/2 minutes old. They outscored the Hornets by 20 the rest of the way, shooting 57 percent in the final 42 minutes. Wayne Ellington scored 14 points, Tyler Johnson added 12 and Kelly Olynyk had 10 for Miami, which snapped a two-game slide. Richardson was 11 for 14 from the field, which the Heat hope was a breakout. He's shot 20 percent or worse in six games this season, and was shooting 33 percent in his last eight games. ""You do have to credit J-Rich for his character, his competitiveness,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Even while he's been struggling from the field, he's been an all-NBA defender. You can ask anybody that we've played. They would agree with that."" Marvin Williams scored 16 points for Charlotte, which lost despite having seven players in double figures. Nicolas Batum had 13, while Michael Carter-Williams, Jeremy Lamb and Cody Zeller each had 12. Charlotte fell to 1-10 on the road. The Hornets were 5 for 20 from 3-point range, while the Heat were 14 for 35. ""I thought our energy was good the whole game,"" Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. ""I was pleased with that. When the other team makes nine more 3s it's going to be very hard to win."" Both teams were missing key players. Charlotte's Kemba Walker sat for a second straight game with a left shoulder contusion, and Miami's Hassan Whiteside is expected to miss two weeks or more with his second left knee bone bruise of the season. Goran Dragic's basket with 2:30 left put the Heat up for good at 97-96, and the Heat pulled just far enough away after a drive by James Johnson, the Waiters 3-pointer from near the Charlotte bench and Richardson's final field goal of the night. ""We got off to a hot start,"" Zeller said. ""We covered them for most of the game but just didn't make enough plays down the stretch."" Richardson's steal and dunk gave Miami its first lead, 44-43 with 2:43 left in the first half. From there, neither team led by more than four until Miami's burst in the last 2 minutes. TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte had all five starters in double figures for the third time this season. ... The Hornets have led after six first quarters on the road this season. They're 0-6 in those games. ... Dwight Howard and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist each scored 10 for Charlotte. Heat: Richardson's previous career-best was 22. ... Shaquille O'Neal sat courtside. ... Miami has faced a double-digit deficit in three straight games. ... Miami is now .500 in many ways -- 11-11 overall, 5-5 at home, 6-6 on the road, 7-7 vs. the East, 4-4 vs. the West. HOWARD'S FOULS It was the fifth time this season that Howard had at least five fouls -- and he got them Friday in 17 minutes. No. 5 came four minutes into the third quarter, and he sat the rest of the way. FOOTBALL TALK Spoelstra was close with former Tennessee coach Butch Jones, and with coaching-change season in full swing he's watched the college football circuses at Florida State, Texas A&amp;M and other places. He also confessed that he's enjoyed the comments of a certain first-year coach at nearby Florida Atlantic. ""It's hard not to follow Lane Kiffin,"" Spoelstra said.

"Lauri Markkanen with a 3-pointer and a dunk in transition on consecutive plays for the Bulls. (0:33) CHICAGO --  The slumping Chicago Bulls may have seemed like the more desperate team, but Zach Randolph thought the Sacramento Kings needed a win just as badly. Randolph had 25 points and 13 rebounds, Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 19 points and the Kings beat the Bulls 107-106 on Friday night, extending Chicago's losing streak to eight games. ""Everybody's desperate right now -- especially us,"" Randolph said. It was the third road win this season for the Kings (7-15). ""It's tough getting road wins,"" Randolph said. ""Any team it's tough, trying to go into their place to get a win. ""It was a good win, a team win. Everybody contributed."" Randolph was 12 for 19 from the field. Garrett Temple had 13 points and Willie Cauley-Stein added 10 points and four blocks for the Kings. Jerian Grant had 17 points, while rookie Lauri Markkanen, Robin Lopez and Paul Zipser scored 14 points apiece for Chicago, which dropped to an NBA-worst 3-18. It was the second straight night the Bulls lost by a point, although Friday's game ended with a meaningless 3-pointer at the buzzer. Chicago's last win was a 123-120 decision against Charlotte on Nov. 17. ""It's pretty tough,"" Denzel Valentine (six points) said. ""I think tonight we just didn't play with the same edge. I don't know whether it was travel. We weren't aggressive. We didn't have the same edge as last night, so that's what we get."" Chicago kept it close throughout the fourth quarter. Randolph hit what turned out to be the key basket, giving Sacramento a 103-99 lead with 51.5 seconds left. Cauley-Stein also contributed with tough defense on Markkanen down the stretch as the Bulls came up empty on three straight possessions in the final 2 1/2 minutes. BELOW THE RIM The Kings and Bulls are rebuilding with a host of athletic high flyers, but Randolph, the old-school big man, controlled things with his ground game. ""How about a 36-year-old that goes and gets 25 and 13 and has one free throw,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""That's amazing. That's fantastic work by Zach, and we did a good job of playing off of him, too."" STAYING POSITIVE With the losses piling up, the Bulls' biggest challenge might be to avoid focusing solely on the streak. ""That's the thing we talk about with this group all the time,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""It's not about looking at the wins and losses. It's about taking steps in the right direction every day. It's about going out and competing every night and giving ourselves a chance. ""If you can look at your teammate and say you were the harder-playing team at the end of the night, whatever happens -- win, loss -- you can live with it."" TIP-INS Kings: Rookie F Justin Jackson and second-year players C Georgios Papagiannis and G Malachi Richardson were assigned to the Reno Bighorns of the G League. ""It's a developmental tool for them to be able to play,"" Joerger said. Bulls: F Bobby Portis (right arm) was scratched just before game time. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The San Antonio Spurs are looking for more consistency on defense. They came up with one of their better efforts of the season against the faltering Memphis Grizzlies. The Spurs held Memphis to 41 percent shooting, forced 16 turnovers and pulled away in the fourth quarter sending the Grizzlies to their 10th straight loss with a 95-79 triumph Friday night. ""We're not consistent,"" said Spurs reserve guard Manu Ginobili, who had 11 points, seven rebounds and six assists. ""We've had some games where the activity is great like (Friday), where we hustle, went for loose balls. We were very aggressive. Some other games we are passive. ... Consistency is what we are after."" The defensive consistency, coupled with 22 points from LaMarcus Aldridge and 18 more from Rudy Gay, led the Spurs to their fourth straight victory. Patty Mills had 10 points. Memphis' 79 points were two short of the season-low for a San Antonio opponent. Memphis, which trailed 68-59 heading into the fourth, let the game slip completely away when San Antonio ripped off a 16-1 rally in the middle stages of the final frame, taking the Spurs lead to 25. ""What bothers me the most is how we laid down at the end of the game, especially on the defensive end,"" said Marc Gasol, who led the Grizzlies with 16 points and 13 rebounds. ""I understand when things don't go well for you offensively. You may go in a weird place mentally, but the defense has no excuse."" The Grizzlies did come out with more energy at the start of the game than the overall tone of play during the losing streak. The more spirited effort came in the second game under interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who took over after David Fizdale was fired Monday. While the attitude was different, it didn't offset the Spurs talent and depth. Memphis held an early lead, but it didn't take long for San Antonio to overcome the advantage and lead the rest of the way. ""Team defense was very good,"" said Spurs guard Tony Parker, who was playing in his third game after returning from offseason surgery for a ruptured left quadriceps tendon. ""I thought we communicated pretty good, and overall, we were active."" TIP-INS Spurs: Aldridge had a season-high 41 points against the Grizzlies on Wednesday night. ... San Antonio shot 44 percent, and the Spurs are 15-0 when they outshoot an opponent. Grizzlies: Chandler Parsons (right knee), Mario Chalmers (right ankle) and Brandan Wright (right groin), all of whom sat out Wednesday's game at San Antonio with injuries, played Friday. ... However, Wright experienced tightness in the groin during the first half and did not return. ... McLemore surpassed his season-high with 11 points in the first half. BAD, BAD STRETCH The 10-game losing streak is the longest for Memphis since losing 12 straight in January 2009. Memphis has not won a game since a road victory at Portland on Nov. 7. The Grizzlies last home win was Oct. 28 over the Houston Rockets. ""The guys are down about it, but what happens sometimes when you on these streaks is one punch and you just start thinking about (the struggles),"" Bickerstaff said. KAWHI STATUS Injured Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard accompanied San Antonio to Memphis, but did not play. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said before the game that Leonard, who hasn't played this season because of a quadriceps injury, may return soon. ""He's getting closer all the time,"" Popovich said. ""He could be back sooner rather than later."" Leonard's teammates are looking forward to his return and getting players back in their regular roles. Patty Mills is playing with the second unit since Parker's return, and Kyle Anderson eventually will go back to the reserves when Leonard is healthy.  ""We've been playing together for a long time and we are used to each other,"" Ginobili said.","400975074"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  It took a scoring burst by Paul George and a perfect performance by Steven Adams for the Oklahoma City Thunder to finally win a close game. George had 35 points and nine assists and Adams scored a career-high 27 points on perfect shooting from the field and the free throw line to help the Thunder beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 111-107 on Friday night. It was Oklahoma City's first win by fewer than nine points this season, and all but two of the team's 12 losses this season have been by nine or fewer points. This time, the Thunder made the tweaks that coach Billy Donovan has been preaching about all season. ""I think we checked all the boxes down the stretch,"" George said. ""Played great team defense to close the game out. We made our free throws. We just had a winning mentality, and it resulted in a win for us."" Adams made all 11 of his shots from the field and all five of his free throws. ""He's a huge weapon that we have,"" George said. ""More times than not, we find him. We've just got to keep finding him throughout the game."" Russell Westbrook added 15 points, 14 assists and nine rebounds for Oklahoma City. The Thunder shot 51.9 percent from the field and outrebounded the Timberwolves 42-26 to snap a three-game losing streak. ""You can't give a team like that two or three shots at a time, so there was times in the second half that I thought we defended OK, but then gave them a second or third shot,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""When you do that for great players, you're going to pay for it, and we did."" Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins scored 23 points each and Jimmy Butler added 22 for the Timberwolves, who shot 51.3 percent in the loss. Minnesota won the previous two meetings this season by a combined five points. Oklahoma City posted its highest-scoring quarter of the season to lead 42-33 at the end of the first. The Thunder struggled to create distance in the fourth quarter until a 3-pointer by George put Oklahoma City ahead 97-86. A bounce pass by Westbrook led to a dunk by Jerami Grant that gave the Thunder a 101-90 lead. Wiggins made a 3-pointer to cut Oklahoma City's lead to 101-96, and Towns scored in close to make it a three-point game with just over 4 minutes to play. Adams put back a missed 3-pointer by Westbrook with 26.2 seconds remaining to put the Thunder up 107-102. Wiggins made a quick 3, but George made two free throws with 5.2 seconds left to clinch the win. ""They played very well,"" Thibodeau said of the Thunder. ""They played hard. They played together.""

"SALT LAKE CITY -- Rookie Donovan Mitchell couldn't hold back a wide, toothy smile as Utah Jazz fans chanted his name and gave an ovation that lasted for minutes after a win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Mitchell scored a career-high 41 points and powered the Jazz's fourth-quarter rally in a 114-108 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. The No. 13 overall draft pick set the Jazz scoring record for a rookie and became the first NBA rookie to score 40 points in a game since Blake Griffin in 2011. He surpassed Darrell Griffith's team-record 38 in 1981. Mitchell is the seventh rookie in franchise history to have a 30-plus point game. ""I don't have any words, to be honest,"" Mitchell said. ""I had Jonas (Jerebko) in my ear saying keep taking those shots. Even shots that may not always be good shots, he says keep being aggressive. Coach's saying it. Everybody's saying it. ""The fans are incredible. Just like Louisville. I'm speechless, but it was great to have that ovation. I'm pretty sure I was smiling for about the last six points I scored. Still smiling now."" New Orleans star Anthony Davis went down with a left groin injury at the beginning of the fourth quarter, hitting the ground under the Jazz basket and laying there until trainers came to help. Coach Alvin Gentry said Davis will have an MRI in Portland on Saturday and is ""very unlikely"" to play. They eventually carried the All-Star off because he couldn't put any pressure on one of his legs. He was immediately placed in a wheelchair and taken to the training room. Davis had 19 points and 10 rebounds before leaving. DeMarcus Cousins led New Orleans with 23 points and 13 rebounds. The Pelicans controlled the first three quarters with an outstanding shooting effort despite decent defense from the Jazz. They shot 52.4 percent and made 11 of 21 3-point attempts in the first three quarters. ""One of the things about Donovan, he's got his head on straight,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Some of what he did tonight is a function of the fact that he's studied it, worked at it and as a result his reads were really good."" Utah trailed by 12 at halftime, but began to chip away in the third quarter behind 21 combined points from Mitchell and Alec Burks. The Jazz were down 16 in the third, making this their largest comeback of the season. ""Like I said to the guys, if you would've said that we had an opportunity to be up four with 12 minutes to play, we would've taken that,"" Gentry said. ""We just didn't finish the game. I thought they did a great job and, obviously, Donovan played a great game, pressure on us the entire game driving to the basket. When he didn't drive he was shooting a 3-point shot. I think he has a chance to be a great player."" The Jazz opened the fourth quarter with a 10-0 run to take a 90-84 lead. The Pelicans answered with a 12-0 run to take a six-point lead before Mitchell absolutely took over. He unleashed a variety of layups and pull-ups, including five straight during a 9-0 run to put the game away after the teams were tied at 103. Burks scored 24 off the bench, and Mitchell had 29 in the second half. Derrick Favors added 18 points and 11 rebounds. ""They hit some shots, they hit some big shots,"" Cousins said. ""The rookie had a (heck) of a game, he dominated from start to finish. They hit some big shots. ""What didn't he do? He had a (heck) of a game. Super impressive coming from a rookie, such a young guy to be that poised and control the game the way he did.""

"Kyrie Irving works his way around the key and drives for a right-handed scoop layup as Boston beats Phoenix at home 116-111. (0:26) BOSTON --  With Boston in danger of blowing a big fourth-quarter lead, Kyrie Irving stepped up again for the Celtics. Irving had a key 3-pointer and a driving basket in the closing two minutes, helping Boston hold off the Phoenix Suns for a 116-111 victory on Saturday. ""Kyrie's ability to make those shots with very little space is pretty impressive,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""We put ourselves in a bad spot after that fourth-quarter run."" Irving finished with 19 points, leading a balanced attack for NBA-leading Boston (20-4). Jaylen Brown and Marcus Morris each scored 17 points, Jayson Tatum had 15 and Al Horford added 14 points and a career-best 11 assists. Devin Booker scored a season-high 38 points for Phoenix in his first game at TD Garden since he put up 70 against the Celtics on March 24. T.J. Warren had 19 points, and Tyson Chandler finished with 14 points and 18 rebounds. Booker was certainly thinking about playing in Boston again. ""This whole week I've been getting questions about the game,"" he said. ""But like I said, it was a great night. Tried to come out and be aggressive. Just fell a little short."" Phoenix cut a 17-point deficit to 105-103 on Chandler's dunk late in the game. But Irving, who returned to the game with 4 1/2 minutes left with the lead down to eight, responded with a 3 from the right wing on the next possession, and his spinning shot off the backboard made it 112-106 with 29 seconds left. ""We have to do more of that for Kyrie, so he can just go out there and not have to work so hard all the time,"" Horford said. Leading by one late in the third, the Celtics closed the quarter with an 11-2 run. Marcus Morris' alley-oop jam in the final seconds made it 89-79. Boston then scored the first seven points in the fourth before Phoenix rallied with 15 of the next 19 points over a five-minute stretch. ""It's just understanding the game and what's available and not making mistakes down the stretch,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said. Coming off a season-low two points when he played only 22 minutes, Brown scored 16 in the opening half. TIP-INS Suns: Reserve C Alex Len was sidelined by a sore left ankle. ""It's still bothering him a little bit,"" Triano said before the game. ""I think if we needed him, he could play."" Celtics: Improved to 10-2 at home. ...

He pointed toward the right side of his knee while talking to the trainer, but returned at the start of the second and nailed a jumper in the opening minute. NOT WATCHING AGAIN A good portion of questions to Stevens in his pregame session with the media focused on the Suns' last visit, when Booker put on his show in a Celtics' victory. ""We didn't show much of him last year,"" Stevens said. ""We talked a little bit about how he gets his points, obviously.""

"NEW YORK --  The Atlanta Hawks got pushed by the Brooklyn Nets in the fourth quarter, and they responded with a game-clinching run. Not bad for a team playing without a couple of key post players. Dennis Schroder scored 24 points, reserve Luke Babbitt had 20 and the short-handed Hawks beat the Brooklyn Nets 114-102 on Saturday. ""It's been a grind for us.

""I don't think we could really guard them,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I felt like they were getting us in closeouts and driving us to the rim."" Allen's layup trimmed Atlanta's lead to 90-88 with 8:13 left. But the Hawks responded with an 18-3 run. Kent Bazemore made a 3-pointer and Schroder and Babbitt each hit a jumper to make it 108-91 with 3:54 remaining. TIP-INS Hawks: Ersan Ilyasova had nine points and 11 rebounds. ... After logging just 13 minutes in his first two games back from a quad injury, Mason Plumlee started at center. ... PF/C Mike Muscala was sidelined by a sprained left ankle. Nets: Harris made four of Brooklyn's 17 3-pointers. The Nets were 17 for 42 from beyond the arc. LEARNING CURVE Budenholzer said Collins' time away from the Hawks could be beneficial for the 20-year-old rookie, who is averaging 11.5 points and 7.1 rebounds and had started four straight games before he got hurt. Budenholzer thought back to the 2013-14 season, when former Hawk Al Horford hurt his shoulder late in December and missed the rest of the year. He then made the All-Star team the next two seasons. ""Injuries are unfortunate, but you get to sit and watch and see things teammates are doing well. You see defensively and offensively places to be,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think just watching the team play helped (Horford) that summer to decide to work on some things, and in how he came back and approached the next season.""","400975079"
"LeBron James and Kevin Love each record double-doubles as the Cavs defeat the Grizzlies 116-111 for their 11th straight victory. (1:45) CLEVELAND -- The Cavaliers' winning streak was in unexpected jeopardy Saturday night before LeBron James took over. James scored 34 points, including seven in the final 1:22, and Cleveland beat the Memphis Grizzlies 116-111 for their 11th straight victory. The loss was the 11th straight for Memphis, including three since David Fizdale was fired Monday and replaced by interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff, but the Grizzlies nearly ended their streak in shocking fashion. Memphis trailed 91-72 late in the third quarter, but rallied all the way to a tie at 109 on Dillon Brooks' 3-pointer with 2:10 remaining. That's when James stepped up, to the surprise of no one in the building, particularly Dwyane Wade, his long-time friend and teammate. ""You just shake your head,"" Wade said. ""It's impressive, man. When you're on a team and you have a guy when the game gets close and you can get him the ball and he comes through, maybe not all the time but it seems like every time ... we know he's going to make the right play."" James' basket in the lane gave Cleveland the lead. After Tyreke Evans missed a 3-pointer, James drove the lane, scored and converted the three-point play after being fouled by Brooks with 34 seconds left. Brooks made two free throws, but James dribbled for several seconds on Cleveland's next possession and hit a jumper from the top of the key for a five-point lead with 5 seconds to go. ""When it's winning time in the fourth quarter, my teammates want me to step up and do what I do best,"" said James, who scored or assisted on Cleveland's last 17 points. ""That effort tonight would have beaten 90 percent of this league on their home court,"" Bickerstaff said. ""Unfortunately, they've got a guy who is pretty damn good."" Evans had 31 points and 12 assists for Memphis. Marc Gasol scored 27 and passed 10,000 career points despite being listed as questionable after injuring his left foot in Friday's loss to San Antonio. Cleveland has scored at least 100 points in each game during its streak and is closing in on its longest winning streak since it ripped off 12 straight in 2015. James scored 11 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, including a pair of three-point plays and a jumper from the corner at the buzzer, helping Cleveland to a 66-52 halftime lead. James, the reigning NBA Player of the Month, also had 12 assists. He has shot 50 percent or better from the floor in each of his last 10 games. Kevin Love added 20 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland. He went to the floor after banging knees with JaMychal Green in the third quarter, but remained in the game. Memphis point guard Mike Conley missed his ninth straight game because of a sore left Achilles. CAVS, ROSE TALKING Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said the team's communication with point guard Derrick Rose has been positive. Rose is away from the team because of a personal matter. He also has been sidelined by a sprained left ankle. The team is expected to provide another update Sunday. GOOD DECISION Gasol wasn't cleared to go until arriving at the arena, but played a game-high 41 minutes. He underwent an MRI Saturday that revealed no structural damage. ""The medical staff was a little worried, but when it's only pain, I'm going to play,"" Gasol said. ""We were able to manage it."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Gasol has 10,007 career points. ... Memphis hit seven of its first nine shots and took a 16-9 lead, forcing the Cavaliers to call a timeout four minutes into the game. Cleveland called another timeout at the 4:24 mark with Memphis leading 24-13. ... Memphis didn't get to the line until Evans was fouled shooting a 3-pointer at the 6:50 mark of the second quarter. Cavaliers: J.R. Smith scored 17 points, and Wade had 16. ... Love was the only starter to get a rebound in the first half when he had seven. ... F Channing Frye went to the locker room in the fourth quarter with a dislocated right finger, but doesn't think the injury is serious.","400975080"
"Joel Embiid shares that he told teammates he wanted to get Andre Drummond to foul out before Saturday's game, but it was all in good fun. (0:33) PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid had a chance to fulfill a promise and demanded the ball. Embiid got it, muscled toward the hoop and drew the sixth foul on Andre Drummond. Then, in typical Embiid fashion, he pointed toward the exit and waved goodbye to his rival. Through two rounds of this matchup of young, talented and trash-talking big men, it's Embiid 2, Drummond 0. Embiid had 25 points and 10 rebounds and got the better of Drummond down the stretch to help the Philadelphia 76ers to a 108-103 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. ""That was the goal going into this game. I told my teammates that he was going to foul out, and he did,"" Embiid said. ""But it's all fun. At the end of the game we hugged it out."" Embiid drew the fifth and sixth fouls on Drummond in the span of a minute and hit the ensuing four free throws to put Philadelphia ahead 100-95 with 2:35 left. ""I got up into him and tried to make it tough for him,"" Drummond said. ""Obviously, he sold the move better than I played defense, so he got the sixth foul and won the game. Simple as that."" Embiid shot just 7-of-21 from the field and committed six turnovers, but he made 11 of 12 free throws and has two wins in two tries against Drummond this season. They've been trading playful insults since the Sixers' victory in Detroit on Oct. 23. ""When's the last time you've seen two real big men go at it?"" Drummond said. ""It's just a great matchup, and I look forward to playing him again."" Drummond had 14 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and five steals. Tobias Harris scored 27 points, and Reggie Jackson had 25 points for the Pistons. They trailed by 18 points early in the third quarter and were outrebounded 47-36. ""We don't play two halves of games now,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""It's not going to get it done."" For a while, it looked like Drummond was going to lead a stunning comeback win. His dunk with 10:04 left gave Detroit its first lead since the first quarter. He added a tip-in and two free throws before Embiid got the upper hand. Robert Covington added 25 points, and Dario Saric had 17 points and hit a 3-pointer with 1:40 left to put the Sixers ahead 103-95 in a game in which the centers were the story. Embiid, known to needle opponents, had 30 points and nine rebounds in a 97-86 victory in Detroit to end the Sixers' 0-3 start. Embiid bragged that he dominated Drummond despite the Detroit center's trash talk and said Drummond ""doesn't play defense."" Drummond responded with the tweet, ""See you Dec. 2nd."" Embiid kept it going at the morning shootaround by saying of Drummond, ""No disrespect, but he can't shoot."" Drummond wouldn't speak to reporters in the locker room before the game, but he told Fox Sports Detroit, ""You can't really have a conversation with a man who can't play a back-to-back."" Embiid missed his first two NBA seasons with injuries and played in only 31 games last season before knee surgery. He's yet to be cleared to play on consecutive nights and sat out Thursday's loss at Boston. Drummond has played in all but three games over the past five seasons. ""We're just having fun,"" Embiid said. ""I love having fun on social media. He does, too. We're just young kids having fun out there."" TIP-INS Pistons: The Pistons were twice called for a five-second inbounding violation, including while trailing by five with six seconds left. ... The Pontiac Silverdome, home of the Pistons from 1978 to 1988, will be demolished Sunday morning. Sixers: Covington, who was 4-of-24 from 3-point range in the previous three games, hit 6 of 13 from long range. ... Backup PG T.J. McConnell (left shoulder) missed his second straight game. ... Fans chanted ""MVP!"" as former Sixers great Allen Iverson was introduced before tipoff. TRASH TALK The coaches took different stances on the Embiid-Drummond feud. Detroit's Van Gundy called it ""a bunch of NBA crap,"" while Philadelphia's Brett Brown believes it fuels Embiid. ""He's very much drawing a line in the sand. That's his style. That's Joel,"" Brown said. ""I think in a good way his young teammates feed off it.""","400975081"
"MILWAUKEE --  After dismantling the Sacramento Kings on the road earlier in the week, Milwaukee Bucks coach Jason Kidd worried about a possible letdown as the teams met in a rematch on Saturday night. ""We came off a long road trip and this was a trap game,"" Kidd said. Much like they did in the earlier meeting, the Bucks raced to a big early lead. This time, the Kings fought back and overcame a 20-point, second-half deficit before falling to the Bucks 109-104. ""They kept playing and we were just going through the motions,"" Kidd said. ""You have to give those guys credit. They were down and kept playing and made a game of it. We got the win but it wasn't pretty."" Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 33 points, made a season-high 17 free throws and had 13 rebounds for the Bucks. ""I think we did a good job starting the game, playing hard and moving the ball and just setting the tone,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We've got to do a better job keeping the lead and finishing the game up."" Khris Middleton added 25 points and Eric Bledsoe had 18. Milwaukee beat the Kings 112-87 on Tuesday night in Sacramento. ""It's frustrating but at the end of the day we got the win,"" Bledsoe said. ""I thought we did a great job keeping our composure."" Zach Randolph led the Kings with 22 points, and Buddy Hield added 19. They were coming off a victory Friday night in Chicago. The Bucks led by as many as 20 in the third quarter and took a 12-point advantage into fourth. ""They kind of pushed us around, we turned the ball over and didn't play with any energy,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""The guys didn't quit, though. They kept fighting."" Milwaukee's shooting went cold for an extended stretch in the fourth, allowing the Kings to pull to 100-96 on Garrett Temple's 3-pointer with 3:19 remaining. After Antetokounmpo's two free throws, Bogdan Bogdanovic connected on a 3-pointer to pull the Kings within three points. After the Bucks came up empty again, Bogdanovic made two free throws to cut the lead to one with less than 2 minutes remaining. John Henson's hook shot and two free throws by Antetokounmpo put the Bucks up 106-101. Middleton sealed the win with two free throws. Milwaukee jumped to a 14-0 lead, taking advantage of five Kings turnovers. The Kings scored their first points on Randolph's jumper with 7:44 remaining in the first. Sacramento trailed by 16 at one point, finished with eight turnovers and was down 33-25 after the quarter. ""We just have to get off to a better start. We're better than that,"" Randolph said. GOING TO THE LINE Antetokounmpo attempted a career-high 22 free throws. ""We have to be in attack mode,"" he said. Antetokounmpo ""set the tone early"" with his aggressive play and by getting to the line, Kidd said. The Bucks made a season-high 35 free throws on 42 attempts, also a season high. TIP-INS Kings: Willie Cauley-Stein sustained a lower back strain in the second quarter after falling awkwardly on a layup and didn't return. ... With the Kings down 12-0 3 minutes into the game, Joerger replaced his entire lineup at once. Joerger picked up a technical foul a short time later after storming onto the court to argue a foul call. Joerger said gaining mental toughness is part of the maturation process for his young team. ""Playing the second night back-to-back. There's a mental toughness to that,"" he said. Bucks: Recalled guard Sterling Brown and forward D.J. Wilson from the Wisconsin Herd of the NBA G League. ... Returned home after a 3-1 trip against Western Conference foes.","400975082"
"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets' offense came alive just as their defense clamped down on the Los Angeles Lakers. Jamal Murray had 28 points, Will Barton scored 13 of his 16 points in the final 7:44, and the Nuggets scored the game's final 15 points to beat the Lakers 115-100 on Saturday night. The Nuggets held the Lakers to two points over the final 5:41 to extend their home winning streak to seven games. ""If we're going to win it's always going to come down to defense,"" Gary Harris said. ""We were able to get stops when we needed them."" Denver was without its starting frontcourt of Nikola Jokic, Paul Millsap and Wilson Chandler. Millsap is out several months after surgery on his left wrist, Jokic was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained left ankle Thursday, but Chandler (back) could return Monday. The Nuggets missed the trio, which combines for nearly 40 points and 21.2 rebounds per game. The Lakers outrebounded Denver 52-39, including an 18-7 advantage in the second quarter when Los Angeles took a 59-55 halftime lead. ""We practice with a lot of lineups. We know the offense, we know each other, our chemistry is growing,"" Murray said. ""We know what everybody can do."" Brandon Ingram led the Lakers with 20 points and Brook Lopez had 15 points. Lonzo Ball had nine points, nine rebounds and five assists but couldn't duplicate the triple-double he had against the Nuggets at home on Nov. 19. The Lakers took a 98-94 lead on Kyle Kuzma's 3-pointer but managed one field goal the rest of the way and had four turnovers. Barton and Murray led Denver's rally by combining for 20 of the 37 points in the fourth quarter. ""I thought a lot of what happened to us tonight was self-inflicted,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""The exciting thing about that is if it's self-inflicted we can be the ones that change it."" Barton gave the Nuggets the lead for good with two free throws, Murray hit a 3-pointer to go up five and Denver closed it out. ""We just kept turning the ball over,"" Kuzma said. ""We made a few costly turnovers and they converted."" TIP-INS Lakers: Kuzma was named the NBA Western Conference Rookie of the Month for November and games played in October. Kuzma ranked second among West rookies in rebounding (6.1) and third in 3-point field goal percentage (37.9). Kuzma returned to the lineup after missing Thursday's game with back spasms. ...

Lever, who played for the Nuggets from 1984-90, recorded 43 triple-doubles in his career. Lever is the sixth player to have his number retired by the Nuggets. ""I started thinking about (getting my number retired) when I was with the (Sacramento) Kings,"" Lever said. ""I saw a lot of ceremonies that happened there. I thought `what if,' and what if came tonight."" SHOW STOPPER Harris finished with 13 points, but his biggest bucket brought the crowd to its feet. With 8:41 left in the third Harris drove into the lane and started to go up for a layup. Ball cut off his path and Harris did a 360 and finished with a finger roll. ""Once I spun I was like, `Nah, this has to stay in my right hand the whole time. I'm not switching it up,"" Harris said. The crowd cheered and his teammates were impressed. ""I was speechless. I didn't know what to do. It was a crazy play,"" Murray said. Murray then shouted across the locker room to Harris, ""I was open by the way."" Harris quietly responded, ""My bad.""","400975083"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The Pelicans were motivated against the Trail Blazers by a tough loss the night before and the absence of Anthony Davis. DeMarcus Cousins had 38 points and New Orleans -- missing Davis because of a pelvic injury -- beat Portland 123-116 on Saturday night. E'Twaun Moore added 19 points, including four 3-pointers for the Pelicans, who were playing the second of a back-to-back after a loss to the Jazz the night before. They snapped a three-game losing skid. ""I think it was a great team effort. We preached before the game, `No excuses,"" Cousins said. ""It stinks that my partner in crime AD went out last night. That being said we kind of crumbled as a team the previous night. We just tried to come in with no excuses."" Damian Lillard had 29 points and eight assists for the Blazers, who have lost two straight after a three-game winning streak. CJ McCollum added 17 points. Lillard got the Blazers within 116-107 with a layup with 2:20 left, but Jrue Holiday answered with a layup. Lillard had a 3-pointer with 12 seconds to go that narrowed the game to 121-116, as close as Portland would get. The Pelicans, who led by as many as 19 points, were short-handed because of injuries, suiting up 11 players for the game. Davis, the Pelicans' top scorer with an average of 25.2 points, was ruled out against the Blazers because of a the injury. An All-Star, Davis was injured in the fourth quarter against the Jazz and was carried off the court because he couldn't put pressure on his legs. He had 19 points and 10 rebounds before leaving and New Orleans lost to the Jazz 114-108. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry called the effort against the Blazers ""truly a team win."" ""We have to do that in order to win, and I thought we were really focused when we went out,"" Gentry said.

Meyers Leonard was handed a flagrant foul after coming down on Cousins on an attempted block, a call that fans at the Moda Center weren't happy about. Soon thereafter Blazers coach Terry Stotts was handed another tech as fans continued to boo the officials. Jameer Nelson hit Leonard in the face on the other end and Leonard flung the ball toward the basket -- and it went in. Nelson also got a flagrant. Leonard said he had no clue that the odd shot had fallen. ""I got hit, and then I just flipped it up like whatever,"" he said. ""Then 5 or 6 seconds later everyone's screaming their head off and I'm not really sure what happened. I was yes, very shocked."" Cousins, for his part, said afterward that things never got heated with Leonard. The Blazers were coming off a 103-91 loss to Milwaukee on Thursday. It was the team's first home game after a 4-1 trip. TIP-INS Pelicans: Dante Cunningham started in Davis' place. ... The Pelicans' 38 third-quarter points were a season high.

Vucevic scored 34 points, eight straight in a decisive 10-0 fourth-quarter run, and the Magic beat the Knicks 105-100 on Sunday. With the score tied at 85 midway through the fourth quarter, Vucevic made a short basket, a three-point play and a 3-point shot in succession to give the Magic the lead for good. ""Throughout the game I (felt) good. In the fourth quarter, I know it's a time when we need to win a game, we needed to close the game,"" Vucevic said.

"MIAMI --  Golden State coach Steve Kerr gave the Warriors an unexpected day off Saturday, so they could enjoy some balmy weather and get beach time in Miami. It energized the reigning NBA champions. Stephen Curry scored 30 points in 30 minutes, Kevin Durant added 24 and the Warriors rode a big third-quarter run to pull away and beat the Miami Heat 123-95 on Sunday night. Curry and Durant didn't even play in the fourth quarter, getting more unplanned but deserved time off. ""Just needed to get some sun and hit the clubs,"" Kerr deadpanned, the sarcasm clear. ""That's what the coaches and I did. We were out all night."" Klay Thompson scored 19 points for the Warriors, who started the second half on an 18-3 run and outscored Miami 37-17 in the third. Golden State's lead was only two at the half, then ballooned to 99-77 going into the fourth. Curry -- playing with a sore finger on his shooting hand -- had 16 of his points in the first quarter, then 10 more in the third. ""Nothing magical or no secret sauce to it,"" Curry said. ""Just trying to be efficient."" Goran Dragic scored 20 points for the Heat. They led by eight in the early going and 36-33 after the first quarter. The Heat then scored 41 points in the next 24 minutes. ""Golden State took it to a different level,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""What I wanted to see was a competitive response."" Starting with a layup by Curry late in the half, Golden State made 10 out of 11 shots in one stretch. Curry had two 3-pointers in that third-quarter barrage, and his driving score pushed the lead out to 80-63. At that point, he had 30 points in the game's first 28 1/2 minutes. He didn't score again, and the Warriors didn't need much more help anyway. ""The first half we competed with them,"" Dragic said. ""Second half, we didn't."" Golden State would eventually lead by 33. Miami was outscored by 26 in the second half. TIP-INS Warriors: Shaun Livingston got ejected with 6:24 left in the first half after going forehead-to-forehead with referee Courtney Kirkland while arguing a non-call.

Curry took notice, and Sims got a night he won't forget.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  This is why Minnesota acquired Jimmy Butler in the offseason. And not just for the scoring, although that certainly helped Sunday night. Butler scored 20 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter to help Minnesota outlast the Los Angeles Clippers 112-106. After the game, though, her spent more time bemoaning the defensive breakdowns -- a common sight in these parts for the past several years. ""We've got to start guarding somebody,"" Butler said. ""It's really bad, it's really noticeable, and everybody capitalizes on it. But lucky enough, if your shot's falling you can still win. But good gracious, if it's not, I'd hate to see which way this game could've went."" Sounds an awful lot like his defensive-minded coach, Tom Thibodeau, who's trying to solve Minnesota's defensive woes as it looks to turn around a culture of losing. Thibodeau looked and sounded just as downcast as he has after losses. ""The miscommunication, the awareness, we're talking to each other and they're racing the ball up the floor,"" he said of several breakdowns that led to easy Clippers baskets in the fourth quarter. ""The fourth quarter is so different, and we have a lot to do in that area."" The Wolves overcame a season-high 30 points from Austin Rivers, who matched his career best with seven 3-pointers. Rivers' final 3-pointer gave L.A. a 92-91 lead with 6:54 to play before Butler scored nine in a row to send the Clippers to their third straight loss. Minnesota led for most of the game but couldn't manage a serious run, mostly due to Rivers' shooting. Rivers hit three 3-pointers in the final five minutes of the first half to keep the Clippers close. He had a career-high 20 points in the half. ""I just got good looks early and once you see a couple go in, it goes from there,"" Rivers said. ""Once you make a couple, even the tough ones seem easy, or at least in my mind."" The back and forth continued for most of the second half, and a couple of Minnesota defensive lapses led to easy layups and a wide-open dunk by Montrezl Harrell to give Los Angeles an 84-83 lead with 9:12 to go. Rivers' seventh 3-pointer gave the Clippers a one-point lead, but Butler took over from there, hitting a free throw, 3-pointer and short jumper before converting a 3-point play to give the Wolves some breathing room. ""I mean, if I make a couple shots,"" Butler said, ""why not keep shooting the ball?"" His teammates certainly didn't mind. ""That shows you why he's such an elite player in this league,"" Karl-Anthony Towns said. ""I was glad to have the popcorn right there and have a front row seat for it because it was amazing."" GROWING PAINS Rookies Jamil Wilson and C.J. Williams made their first career starts. Wilson finished with nine points and Williams five. The Clippers were missing four of their opening-night starters, but it wasn't obvious from the close score. And L.A.'s bench outscored Minnesota's 43-23. ""Overall, I'm upset"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""I mean, you want to win the game. But I loved how we played. It's amazing how much better we got in one night. That's what I would take.""

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  It was an ugly win against a short-handed opponent, but the struggling Oklahoma City Thunder are in no position to worry about such details. Russell Westbrook posted his seventh triple-double of the season to help the Thunder defeat the San Antonio Spurs 90-87 on Sunday night. Westbrook had 22 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the Thunder, who won their second straight after dropping five of their previous six. ""A win is always great in this league,"" Westbrook said. ""You don't take anything for granted."" Steven Adams added 19 points and 10 rebounds for Oklahoma City, which won even though No. 2 scorer Paul George had only eight points on 2-for-17 shooting. But the Thunder held the Spurs to 40.8 percent shooting. ""We just missed some shots,"" Westbrook said. ""We overshot some that we usually make. As long as we defended -- we can't score, they can't either."" Dejounte Murray had 17 points and Derrick White added 16 for San Antonio. With a chance to tie it at the end, Brandon Paul missed a 3-pointer and the Thunder rebounded. Spurs starters LaMarcus Aldridge and Tony Parker sat out. San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said Aldridge rested with a minor knee issue and Parker was ""dinged-up."" The Spurs are still waiting for forward Kawhi Leonard's right quadriceps to heal. The injury news got worse on Sunday. San Antonio's Kyle Anderson sprained his left knee with a minute remaining in the third quarter and did not return. Popovich liked the way his team competed. ""I'm really proud of them,"" he said. ""I thought they did a great job tonight. Defense in the second half was very good. Had a lot of guys participate and a lot of guys get a lot of minutes. They did very, very well."" Jerami Grant's 3-pointer as time expired in the first half gave the Thunder a 54-43 advantage. Adams had 17 points on 7-for-10 shooting and Oklahoma City led even though George went scoreless and Carmelo Anthony managed just three points. San Antonio rallied in the third quarter and cut Oklahoma City's lead to 76-73 at the end of the period. Westbrook clinched his triple-double on an assist to George for a 3-pointer that gave the Thunder an 87-79 lead. George had made just one of 14 shots before connecting with 4:13 remaining. ""I thought we did well all game defensively,"" he said. ""It was a low-scoring night in today's NBA. We are happy with that. We missed a lot of opportunities at the rim, missed a lot of open 3s. But sometimes you have to win games like this."" TIP-INS Spurs: Popovich said reserve forward Rudy Gay was ""dinged-up,"" so he did not play. ... Paul made his first NBA start and was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Manu Ginobili did not play. The veteran had played in all but three games this season as a reserve.

"James Harden pours in 36 points and adds nine assists in a win over the Lakers, extending Houston's win streak to seven. (0:49) LOS ANGELES --  The way Chris Paul sees it, this is only the beginning for the Houston Rockets. James Harden scored 36 points, Eric Gordon added 22 off the bench and the Rockets blew past the Los Angeles Lakers 118-95 on Sunday night for their seventh consecutive victory -- all by at least 14 points. ""We're capable of a lot more,"" Paul said. The winning streak coincides with Paul's arrival after sitting out the first 14 games of the season with a knee injury. But the Rockets have won six straight on the road (all by 15 points or more) and 13 of 14 overall. They lead the Western Conference at 18-4. ""In my opinion, they're playing the best basketball in the NBA right now,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. The Lakers (8-15), meanwhile, are going in the opposite direction. Sunday marked their season-worst fifth loss in a row, and their next four games are on the road, where they are 2-8. ""We knew this was going to be a testing time of the season,"" Walton said. ""This is the time of the year that can really break teams down. I think we will stick together, keep getting better and grinding."" Paul had 21 points and six assists for Houston. Harden handed out nine assists, and Gordon scored 20 points in the first half. Houston outscored the Lakers 34-19 in the second quarter to take a 61-46 lead at halftime. Los Angeles mounted one last charge to start the third quarter, pulling within three before the Rockets rolled off nine consecutive points. They were never threatened again. Houston led by as many as 24 in the fourth. ""As soon as we have a breakdown or go through a dry spell for a period, their lead would go right back up,"" Walton said. The Lakers got 22 points from rookie Kyle Kuzma -- 16 in the fourth quarter. Brandon Ingram had 18 points and nine rebounds. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 16 and Larry Nance Jr. added 15 for the Lakers, but it was hardly enough to stay with the NBA's second-highest scoring team. ""Our goal is to be great defensively every night,"" Harden said. ""We have enough offense that we're going to score."" GETTING DEFENSIVE Houston's defense was plenty effective against the Lakers. The Rockets forced 21 turnovers and converted them into 27 points. ""The turnovers killed us,"" Walton said. UNSTOPPABLE Harden, the league's leading scorer at 31.5 points per game, went 13 of 22 from the field and 4 of 9 from 3-point range. ""James probably missed his first 3 and then got like seven in row,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""He's ridiculous."" BALL STRUGGLES Lakers rookie point guard Lonzo Ball struggled again. He missed all four shots from the field, finishing with two points and three assists. He played only 22 minutes. ""A lot of what we try to do depends on him, which is a lot of pressure to put on a young rookie,"" Walton said. ""Tonight we just didn't get that much out of him."" TIP-INS Rockets: Have made an NBA-high 340 3-pointers, 50 more than second-place Golden State. D'Antoni said he wouldn't be upset if a Rockets player was by himself on a fast break and pulled up for a 3. ""No, not if he made it. I'd say, `Good shot.' Nah, players wouldn't do that. It would be crazy,"" he said. ... F Ryan Anderson played only 12 minutes due to back tightness. Lakers: Ball had a slight limp after Saturday's game in Denver, the result of left calf tightness. He participated in the morning shootaround and was cleared to play Sunday night. In his first 20 NBA games, Ball is averaging 9.0 points, 7.1 assists and 7.1 rebounds while shooting 31.8 percent.","400975089"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  A well-rested Kemba Walker was too much for an Orlando Magic team playing on the second night of a back-to-back. Walker returned to the starting lineup after missing two games with a shoulder injury and provided instant energy to a Hornets team mired in a four-game losing streak. Walker had 29 points and seven assists, Dwight Howard reached a rebounding milestone and Charlotte defeated the Orlando Magic 104-94 on Monday. ""I feel like when I'm not around things are different, and when I come back it changes,"" Walker said. ""That's the kind of guy I am. I'm the leader of this team and my team goes as I go. Depending on my mood, my attitude, it kind of trickles down to everybody else. If I'm upset, a lot of the guys get upset. When I'm out there enjoying the game and having fun and I'm intense, my teammates follow."" Walker became the first player in franchise history with 200 career 20-point games. He made all 14 free throw attempts, tying a career high. Howard had 12 points and nine rebounds, moving past former Charlotte coach Paul Silas and Dikembe Mutombo for 19th on the all-time NBA rebounding list. ""It's an amazing accomplishment,"" Howard said. ""Being 14 seasons in, I'm very thankful and blessed to be able to play this game, so I'm always thanking God for giving me this opportunity to play and I just want to keep it going."" The game turned early in the fourth when Orlando's Marreese Speights lost his cool. Speights received a flagrant foul when he shoved Cody Zeller to the ground following a dunk by Frank Kaminsky, giving the Hornets two foul shots and the ball. Zeller made both and Jeremy Lamb was fouled on the ensuing possession and made both free throws, allowing the Hornets to take a double-digit lead. ""It's a six-point possession,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""So that was definitely the turning point. But if we don't turn the ball over as much as we did, we don't have to worry about that."" Orlando had 20 turnovers that resulted in 29 points for the Hornets. Walker made sure the Hornets didn't fall apart down the stretch. On one play he went 1-on-4 on a transition opportunity, but still found his way to the basket for a layup while drawing a foul. TIP-INS Magic: Evan Fournier led the Magic with 18 points. ... Orlando was outrebounded 52-40. Hornets: Shot only 3 of 17 from 3-point range. ... Kaminsky had 14 points off the bench. ... Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had 11 points and eight rebounds. NOT HAPPY Vogel wasn't thrilled with the discrepancy in free throws. Charlotte attempted 40 foul shots; Orlando just 14. ""It was impossible to not be ... frustrated with the way the game was called,"" Vogel said. Speights agreed. ""When you are on the road you are really playing against six people -- or eight people -- so it's up to us to play through it,"" Speights said. ""Tonight we tried to but it was hard."" SILAS STEPS IN The Hornets were coached by assistant Stephen Silas after head coach Steve Clifford came down with an illness. ""He just said, `You'll do a great job,"" Silas explained. ""He just let me do my thing. I did the substitutions on my own and all the play calls and all the after-timeout plays and all that. He just let me do it. He sent me a text after the game, so I was happy to do it for him because he's a great man."" Silas' father, Paul, watched the news conference. MR. PERFECT After going 14 of 14 at the foul line, Walker is shooting a career-high 87.1 percent from the stripe. ""I put my work in, man,"" Walker said. ""That's really it. I try to keep it consistent. I shoot a lot of free throws and it's something that was a goal of mine to be a great free throw shooter this year. I just want to continue it."" Walker's goal is to shoot 90 percent.","400975090"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers took it right to the short-handed New York Knicks and came away with an easy victory. Thaddeus Young scored 20 points to lead seven Indiana players in double figures as the Pacers routed the Knicks 115-97 on Monday night. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 19 points and Victor Oladipo added 16 for the Pacers (13-11), who led by 26 at half and 95-65 after three quarters. ""It's about ourselves,"" said Pacers point guard Darren Collison, who had 10 points and 10 assists. ""I'm glad we didn't have a letdown."" The Knicks (11-12) were without leading scorers Kristaps Porzingis (25.8 ppg) and Tim Hardaway Jr. (17.8 ppg) for a second consecutive loss.

""We just know we had to come ready to play."" The Pacers had a season-high 31 fast-break points, 26 more than the Knicks. ""For the most part we did a good job of moving the ball and ended up with 28 assists,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Everyone gets involved that way, with guys open."" Reserve Willy Hernangomez led the Knicks with 14 points. ""(The Pacers) had more energy,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""They got steals, we had some careless turnovers.

That includes being down 19 at home in the third quarter of a 108-101 victory over the Pacers on Nov. 5.

"PHILADELPHIA -- Devin Booker was unguarded as he swished a 26-foot 3-pointer, and he shrugged as he tossed up his hands. The Suns were surely impressed. The 76ers? Well, they likely wished they could have stayed in bed and called out sick. Booker scored 46 points, outplayed a flu-ridden Ben Simmons in a battle of 21-year-old stars and led the Phoenix Suns to a 115-101 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night. Booker and Simmons, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft, have positioned themselves as future faces of the league. Booker was the one who left Monday's game all smiles. ""I know there's more things I have to work on,"" Booker said. ""Turn around this franchise, start to get wins and make the playoffs. Whatever I have to do to do that, I'm with it."" He shook off a wretched start (2-of-11 in the first quarter) and rallied for perhaps his best game of the season. Booker, who once scored 70 points in a game, made a whopping 11 of 17 shots in the second half for 32 points. His three 3s in the fourth helped the Suns put away an on-the-rise Sixers team that played one of its worst games of the season. Booker made five of eight 3s. ""Devin had quite a night,"" 76ers center Joel Embiid said. ""We took them lightly, and we paid for it."" TJ Warren scored 25 points, and Tyler Ulis had 12 points and 12 assists for the Suns. Embiid had 22 points and 12 rebounds, and Simmons scored 20 points. JJ Redick led the Sixers with 25 points. Redick rallied the Sixers from 17 down and hit consecutive 3s in the fourth that sliced the deficit to five. Ulis pushed back the Sixers with a 3, and Booker buried two on the next two possessions that squashed the 76ers' comeback. Booker let out a big yell after a fast-break dunk that made it 110-94 and sent The Process fans toward the exits. Booker added one more 3 and a shrug for good measure. Simmons had the flu and covered his head with his hoodie as he trudged off the court from pregame warm-ups to the locker room. ""I feel like my body kind of hit a wall,"" Simmons said. ""I woke up, and I didn't feel like I could play."" Simmons, who is averaging 23.1 points and 9.4 rebounds, was sick for most of the past three days and didn't leave his place at all on Sunday. ""Out of kindness, I've decided to still start him,"" coach Brett Brown. Simmons made his first four shots and played 17 minutes in the first half. Fittingly, his first-half highlight was a sick dunk: He reached high, snared a low lob pass from Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot that skimmed Dragan Bender's outstretched finger and completed the alley-oop. Simmons also scored on an up-and-under layup that brought the crowd to its feet. It just wasn't enough to bring the Sixers a victory. Embiid tried to make it a game in the third. He routinely punished Alex Len defensively; Embiid used his right hand to smack a shot into the backboard in the third. The Sixers recovered the ball, Embiid scored, and it was 82-75. The Sixers trailed by 10 through three. The Sixers, shooting 36 percent on 3s this season, missed a whopping 23 of 30 3s. TIP-INS Suns: The Suns expect to travel 4,987 miles during the six-game road trip. ... Tyson Chandler had 12 rebounds. 76ers: G T.J. McConnell could return this week against the Lakers.

"ATLANTA --  With his team headed to Mexico City for two games this week, Caris LeVert knew the Brooklyn Nets couldn't afford a second straight poor outing against the Atlanta Hawks. ""We feel like we let one get away at home against these guys,"" he said. ""We wanted to come in and play super hard tonight. I think that gives us great momentum going into Mexico."" LeVert scored a season-high 17 points, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 16 and the Nets used a strong third quarter to beat the Atlanta Hawks 110-90 on Monday night. Brooklyn, avenging Saturday's home loss to Atlanta, had everything working in its favor in the second half. It began the third trailing by one but went on a 17-0 run to go ahead 70-54 on DeMarre Carroll's 3-pointer. The lead swelled to 29 in the fourth as the Nets earned their largest win of the season. Brooklyn leaves Tuesday for Mexico City to face Oklahoma City and Miami and help the NBA broaden its international appeal. They head there with coach Kenny Atkinson knowing that LeVert can handle more minutes to spell starting point guard Spencer Dinwiddie. LeVert tied a career high with seven assists and played over 27 minutes. ""I thought Spencer was on fumes a little bit and I thought Caris came in and really took the torch,"" Atkinson said. ""He was really good in the pick-and-roll. He can really pass the ball, had a couple of nice lobs, a couple of nice wraparounds."" Hawks point guard Dennis Schroder, the catalyst in the last game, hit his first seven shots but missed eight of his last 10. He finished with 19 points but was a nonfactor in the second half. ""He was hitting tough shots,"" LeVert said. ""He was hitting floaters, contested floaters, contested pull-ups. If you look at the numbers, they're going to even out. You're not going to keep hitting those shots."" The Nets improved to 5-9 on the road. They didn't win their fifth away from home last season until early March. Dinwiddie and Carroll each had 13 points to help Brooklyn improve to 9-14 overall. Hollis-Jefferson began the game 1 for 9 from the field but hit his last five shots. The Hawks missed 17 of their first 18 shots in the third. They pulled within nine on Luke Babbit's 3 in the closing minute, but Jarrett Allen had two dunks and assisted on Levert's jumper to lead by 15. Kent Bazemore and DeAndre' Bembry each added 13 points for Atlanta, which dropped to 5-18, second-worst in the NBA. ""It just looked like we were a little bit short on some good looks,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Then we had some shots that just went in and out. If those go in, maybe it's a little different game."" TIP-INS Nets: Allen Crabbe was ejected after fouling out in the fourth.

"BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving has long admired Al Horford's skillset from afar. He's now getting to really savor all the advantages that come along with being his teammate. Irving had 19 of his 32 points in the second half, helping offset a 40-point night by Giannis Antetokounmpo as the Boston Celtics held off the Milwaukee Bucks 111-100 on Monday night. Al Horford added 20 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. Jayson Tatum chipped in 17 points to help Boston improve to an NBA-best 21-4. The Celtics have won five of their last six. ""We're just utilizing our strength's -- me realizing that he can use me and I can use him,"" Irving said. ""When we utilize each other, we can get other guys great shots."" The Celtics shot 50 percent or better from the field for the fifth straight game. That's their longest such streak since 2010. ""I think it's just the work I've been putting in. It's starting to pay off for me,"" Horford said. ""I feel like we're starting to find our rhythm as a group, and I'm finding my rhythm, too."" It was the third 40-point game this season for Antetokounmpo. Khris Middleton added 19 points while Eric Bledsoe had 18 points. ""You have to compete against them because they don't stop playing hard,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""From start to finish they play hard and play together."" Boston led by as many as 20 in the third quarter, before the Bucks stormed back, thanks in large part to Antetokounmpo. He almost singlehandedly kept the Bucks in it, scoring 16 points in the period and trimming Boston's lead to 88-81 entering the fourth. It was 104-97 following a free-throw by Bledsoe, but the Celtics got five straight points from Irving to get the lead back up to 12 with less than a minute to play. Antetokounmpo and Middleton entered Monday as the most productive scoring duo in the Eastern Conference, averaging a combined 49 points per game. They combined for 59 Wednesday. It offset some early inconsistency from the rest of their teammates, which went just 6 of 24 from the field in the first half. TIP-INS Bucks: Bench was outscored 18-4 in the first half.

"CHICAGO --  LeBron James could sense the Cleveland Cavaliers were starting to click the last time they lost. But a streak like this? He wasn't about to say he saw that coming. Dwyane Wade and Kevin Love each scored 24 points, James had 23 and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Chicago Bulls 113-91 Monday night for their 12th straight win. Backed by a trio of stars, the Cavaliers matched their longest winning streak since the 2014-15 season. They dropped a tight game at Houston on Nov. 9 and haven't lost since. The streak started with wins at Dallas, New York and Charlotte. ""I'm not Nostradamus so I did not see the streak,"" James said. ""But in the Houston game, I'd seen the way we played in that game. And I'd seen that if we could build off that game, then we can kind of turn the things around. That was a great road trip for us."" Wade made 9 of 13 shots in his first game in Chicago since agreeing to a buyout with his hometown team in late September. Love grabbed 13 rebounds and made 8 of 13 from the field. James finished 9 of 15 with seven rebounds and six assists. The Cavaliers shot just under 52 percent. Kris Dunn led Chicago with 15 points. Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday scored 14 apiece as the Bulls fell to 3-19 with their ninth straight loss. ""When the lights turn on, for whatever reason, when things get tough, we stop doing the things that make us a solid team, that make us a team that gets a good shot,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We stop running the offense and go back and try to get it all on our own. We can't do that. We have to keep playing together on both sides of the ball. ... Everybody has to be on the same page out there and we had too many breakdowns again."" STRONG START The matchup between the three-time defending Eastern Conference champions and the team with the NBA's worst record went as expected. Third in the league in scoring coming into the game, the Cavaliers grabbed a 61-45 halftime lead. James scored 15 in the half, driving hard and hitting from the perimeter while Wade chipped in with 12 points. James' jumper from up top in the closing seconds of the first quarter sparked a 13-0 run that broke open a five-point game. Wade scored six points during that stretch, helping Cleveland bump its lead to 40-22. Love had 10 of his team's first 13 points in the third as Cleveland increased it to 74-50. And the Cavaliers remained in control the rest of the way. ROSE'S RETURN Derrick Rose ended his self-imposed separation from the Cavaliers. The point guard, who has been dealing with a sprained left ankle for much of his first season with Cleveland, returned to the Cavs on Monday to resume rehab and treatment. A frustrated Rose had left the team on Nov. 22 to contemplate his future. MIROTIC UPDATE Coach Fred Hoiberg said the Bulls will decide after Tuesday's practice if forward Nikola Mirotic will travel with the team to Indiana. Even if Mirotic goes, Hoiberg said it ""might be a stretch"" for him to make his season debut against the Pacers on Wednesday. The Bulls play at Charlotte on Friday and host New York on Saturday. Mirotic has been sidelined since Oct. 17, when he suffered two facial fractures and a concussion in an altercation at practice with forward Bobby Portis.

But the relief of their first victory since Nov. 7 had to wait as the team and their fans held their collective breaths until one last misfire by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Marc Gasol scored 21 points, Tyreke Evans added 16, including the two game-clinching free throws with 12.7 seconds left as the Grizzlies snapped an 11-game losing streak 95-92 on Monday night. The Timberwolves still had a chance to tie after Evans' free throws, but Jimmy Butler's off-balance 3-point attempt over Andrew Harrison with 1.3 seconds remaining, bounced off the glass, grazed the rim and fell harmlessly away from the basket, preserving the Grizzlies first win since defeating Portland about four weeks ago. ""I just didn't want him to get a clean look at the 3,"" Harrison said. ""I just wanted to make it as tough as possible."" Butler, who led the Timberwolves with 30 points, his second straight game reaching at least 30 points, said he thought the shot had a chance. ""I think every shot I take is a good look,"" Butler said. ""You've got to take it, and go on to the next one."" Taj Gibson finished with 14 points, while Andrew Wiggins and Jeff Teague added 12 points each, Wiggins going 6 of 17 from the floor. The game was close throughout with 14 lead changes and a dozen ties, the last coming at 86-all with 5:43 remaining. After a pair of free throws from Gasol, Memphis never surrendered the lead the rest of the way, although the margin didn't reach more than three points. ""Our defense in the first half hurt us badly,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I thought it was a little better in the second half. We didn't come up with any loose balls at the end, and that could have separated the game."" Memphis interim coach J. B. Bickerstaff, who got his first win since taking over for David Fizdale earlier this week, said there were a lot of happy players in the locker room. ""It's been awhile,"" Bickerstaff said of the span between wins. ""You almost forgot what it felt like to win because guys want it so bad, and they're emotionally invested. Every loss that kept popping up became a heavier and heavier weight."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: The loss continued a trend for Minnesota, alternating a win and a loss over the last eight games. ... F Nemanja Bjelica missed his seventh game with a sprained left foot. He was not with the team Monday night, but Thibodeaux said he expects Bjelica to meet the team in LA on Wednesday. Grizzlies: In addition to snapping the losing streak, Memphis also stopped an eight-game skid at home, matching the longest home losing streak since moving to Memphis. .Evans had nine assists in his new role as the team's starting point guard, filling in for the injured Mike Conley (left Achilles injury). .The Grizzlies' 76-75 lead entering the fourth marked the first time Memphis had led after three quarters since the Nov. 7 win at Portland. HOLDING DOWN TOWNS Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota's leading scorer at 20.3 points a game, was limited to seven points, taking only six shots. Thibodeaux noted the Grizzlies were willing to double-team the Timberwolves center down the stretch. ""We tried to play off that,"" the Minnesota coach said of the Grizzlies strategy. ""I thought he did a good job (of) getting the ball out."" Towns had 11 rebounds and was held without a double-double for only the sixth time this season. LAST WORD ""It was the biggest regular-season win that I have ever been a part of,"" -- Gasol. WELL, ONE MORE LAST WORD Conley, who still is a ways from playing, simply tweeted after the game ""Thank God.""","400975096"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Stephen Curry was in good spirits, but a little annoyed with himself as he stood on crutches in Golden State's locker room. After all the work he'd done to lead the Warriors back from a 21-point deficit in New Orleans, he went for a steal that his team didn't really need in the waning moments, stepped on E'Twaun Moore's foot and sprained his right ankle. ""It was a dumb play,"" Curry said. ""I got caught on E'Twaun's shoe as I went by him and couldn't catch myself. So, obviously, it hurt."" Curry scored 31 points, going 5 of 11 from 3-point range, and had 11 assists before his injury, and the Warriors outscored the Pelicans by 30 in the second half for a 125-115 victory Monday night. Klay Thompson added 22 points and Kevin Durant and Draymond Green each had 19 for the Warriors, who won their fourth straight. After it was over, Curry went for X-rays on his right ankle, which was surgically repaired earlier in his career. Curry said the images ""thankfully"" came back negative. He also joked that his first thought after the injury was that he wouldn't be able to play golf with his father on Tuesday in Charlotte, where the Warriors were headed next for a game on Wednesday night. More somberly, he added that he always looks forward to his team's annual trip to Charlotte and ""playing in front of people that have seen me grow up."" ""Hopefully, my fans still show up and support the other guys if I'm not out there,"" he said. Jure Holiday scored 34 and Moore had a career-high 27 for the Pelicans, who lost for the fourth time in five games. DeMarcus Cousins added 19 points and 11 rebounds -- but also had seven turnovers -- before both he and Durant received their second technical fouls of the game while bickering in the final minutes, resulting in ejections for both players. Cousins didn't talk after the game. Durant did, criticizing himself for losing his cool, but also stressing that he never felt as though he was close to coming to blows with Cousins and that the officials ""threw us out of the game pretty quick."" ""I'm not going to fight nobody. I don't want to get injured. I don't want to get suspended. I love to play,"" said Durant, ejected from a game for the second time in four days and third time this season. ""I've got to be more poised. I can't let anybody take me off my game. I've been in the league for too long. Especially somebody like Cousins. We know that he's feisty. We know that he's emotional. We know that he plays that way, so I can't get involved with that."" Trailing 69-49 at halftime, the Warriors opened the third quarter with a 15-0 run, with Durant scoring six on two dunks and a fadeaway, while Thompson and Green each added a 3-pointer. From then on, the game was tight, with the Pelicans only briefly rebuilding a lead as large as 11 on Holiday's back-to-back 3s late in the third quarter. Golden State regained the lead at 96-95 on Andre Iguodala's steal and breakaway dunk with 8:31 left. New Orleans briefly went back up 95-92 when Darius Miller hit a 3 while being fouled by Curry for a four-point play, but Nick Young responded with consecutive 3s to give Golden State the lead for good, and Green added a pair of late 3s to help seal it. ""As bad as this loss is -- and I don't look at anything as a moral victory -- what we keep proving is that we have the ability to play extended minutes with the world champs,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""Now what we have to do as a team is that we have to now find a way to not do it for 32 minutes or 36 minutes, but we've got to do it for 48 because that's the only way you can beat that team."" TIP-INS Warriors: C Zaza Pachulia missed his first game this season because of soreness in his left shoulder. ... Patrick McCaw left in the second quarter after getting hit on the nose when Cousins followed through on a blocked shot. The Warriors said X-rays were negative, but McCaw did not return. Pelicans: Star forward Anthony Davis missed his second straight game with a strained left adductor. New Orleans won its previous game without him in Portland on Saturday. ... New Orleans matched Golden State's 16 made 3s. MOMENTUM  SWINGS New Orleans led by 13 late in the first quarter after a 6-0 mini-run featuring Holiday's dunk and Cousins' 3, but the Warriors responded with a 17-3 surge to take a 37-36 lead early in the second quarter. Curry scored the first six points of the spurt, starting with his 21-foot jumper as he was fouled by Tony Allen. Rajon Rondo, who had 10 points and 11 assists, helped New Orleans pull away again, assisting on two 3s by Holiday and hitting a pair of his own during a 25-5 run. Rondo's 10th assist came on Moore's 3, which put New Orleans up by 21 in the final minute of the first half.","400975097"
"DALLAS --  After a tough start to the season, the Dallas Mavericks are starting to find their identity with consecutive wire-to-wire wins. Harrison Barnes scored 22 points and Dennis Smith Jr. added 20 to lead six Mavericks in double figures as Dallas beat the short-handed Denver Nuggets 122-105 Monday night. The Mavericks never trailed once again after beating the Clippers by 26 on Saturday. Dallas had its highest scoring game of the season and has won five of eight since starting 2-14. ""Our identity just happens to be very gritty on defense and have each other's backs, and then ball security on offense,"" Smith said. ""If we do both of those things, we're gonna win a lot of games."" Dallas did both on Monday, building a 25-point, first-half lead as they held Denver to 35 percent shooting before the break. And the Mavs had only seven turnovers. Will Barton led Denver with 23 points, Jamal Murray added 22 and Gary Harris had 21. Denver played without two-thirds of its starting frontcourt as Paul Millsap (left wrist injury) and Nikola Jokic (sprained left ankle) remained out. The Nuggets started the second half making their first six shots and got within 88-80 on Barton's 3 with 2:13 left in the third quarter. It was the first time Denver had been within single digits since trailing 16-8 early on. ""I think we had enough gas in the tank to come back, but the first quarter was such a big deficit on the road, it's going to be very tough,"" Murray said. Barnes hit a long jumper to restore a 10-point lead, and Dallas maintained a double-digit lead throughout the fourth quarter. ""We shot it well. We moved it well. We had low turnovers,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""There were a lot of good things."" SOLDIERING ON Dallas held its annual Seats for Soldiers Night, where the team's season-ticket holders provide their courtside seats to more than 100 wounded U.S. service members. Former president and first lady George W. and Laura Bush were also in attendance. The Mavericks improved to 11-2 in these games since starting the tradition in 2004. ""Coming out of halftime I told some of them that I personally appreciate everything that they do,"" Smith said. ""Their sacrifice -- some of the guys and women were missing limbs -- they made sacrifices a lot of people wouldn't make. That was a little added motivation for everybody tonight."" ROAD WOES Denver fell to 3-8 on the road against 10-2 at home as they began a six-game road trip. ""They hit us first and we hit back too late,"" Murray said. ""We can't afford that on the road."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Kenneth Faried had 13 points and 11 rebounds, his fifth-straight double-figure scoring game while starting in place of Millsap. ... The Nuggets got starting forward Wilson Chandler back, but Chandler scored just four points in 27 minutes after missing the last three games with lower back pain. Mavericks: Yogi Ferrell scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half. Other Mavs scoring in double figures: Wesley Matthews (15), Devin Harris (14) and Dwight Powell (11).","400975098"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs fought through another injury and the second game of a back-to-back to beat the Detroit Pistons and earn some rare praise from coach Gregg Popovich. LaMarcus Aldridge had 17 points and 10 rebounds and San Antonio rallied to beat Detroit 96-93 on Monday night. ""I thought the guys in a tough back-to-back did a heck of a job to hang in there, keep playing and trusting each other,"" Popovich said. ""We made some great plays down the stretch from a lot of people. A lot of people participated. It was a good, physical game. I'm just really pleased with their effort. I thought they did a wonderful job."" Reggie Jackson had 27 points for Detroit, which led by as many as nine points before dropping its third straight. Jackson was held to seven points in the second half on 3-for-10 shooting as San Antonio clamped down defensively to win after falling to Oklahoma City on Sunday. The Spurs were without Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Anderson, who has started in place of Leonard all season. Anderson will miss two to three weeks after spraining his left knee against the Thunder. Rudy Gay, making his first start in place of Anderson, had 12 points, 10 rebounds and four assists. His final points came on a three-point play that gave San Antonio an 88-86 lead with 3:39 remaining. Detroit trailed 94-93 when Gay failed to hit the rim on a 3-point attempt as the shot clock expired with 5.2 seconds remaining, but the Pistons' Tobias Harris committed a foul prior to the violation. Aldridge made two free throws to give the Spurs a 96-93 lead. Gay blocked Harris' 3-point attempt at the buzzer to preserve the victory. ""It's great, just having another guy who can create,"" Spurs veteran Tony Parker said. ""He had some very nice passing off the pick-and-roll. He knows how to play."" Pau Gasol added 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs, who had seven players score in double figures and had three with double-doubles. San Antonio had 30 assists and a 51-42 edge in rebounding to win for the fifth time in six games. ""It was tough,"" said Spurs guard Danny Green, who had 11 points and three blocked shots. ""They are a very good team. They've been playing good basketball in the East and they are one of top teams in the East. They've been playing well against everybody."" Andre Drummond finished with 11 points and 15 rebounds for his 17th double-double in Detroit's 23 games this season. Jackson had 20 points in the first half and Detroit shot 48 percent against the league's second-best defense statistically through two quarters. The Spurs held the Pistons to 33 percent shooting in the second half, including 7 for 20 in the fourth. ""I think we go a little too much just one-on-one isolation,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy. ""We've got to be able to sustain our offensive energy better. I probably overplayed guys tonight, but our bench just struggled, I mean they just struggled."" TIP-INS Pistons: Drummond averaged 16 points and 16 rebounds against San Antonio last season. ... Detroit is 6-2 against Western Conference teams. . Van Gundy has 498 career wins. . Jon Leuer missed the game with a sprained left ankle. . The Pistons have lost six straight to the Spurs. Spurs: San Antonio had three players with double-doubles for the first time since 2014 when Leonard, Green and Tim Duncan did so against Brooklyn. . The Spurs are 36-0 since 2015 when they have 29-plus assists. . San Antonio is 4-0 when Parker plays. . Reserve forward Joffrey Lauvergne missed the game with an injured right middle finger. . Patty Mills joined Manu Ginobili and Matt Bonner as the only reserves in franchise history to make 500 3-pointers. LEONARD RETURNING `SOON' Leonard said prior to the game he is feeling healthy and will return ""soon"" from a quadriceps injury that has kept him out all season, but he does not have a target date for his debut. BLIND LUCK Green had a critical block against Drummond with 3:19 remaining that led to a reverse layup by Ginobili for a 90-86 lead. ""It was pure luck,"" Green said. ""I mean, if he knew I was coming, I'm sure he probably would have dunked the ball but I don't think he saw me weakside. When you're a guard, you can sneak up on bigs sometimes and I got lucky.""","400975099"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Utah Jazz looked lottery bound two weeks ago after losing 8 of 10. They've rebounded with six straight wins, including their most lopsided victory of the season. Alec Burks scored 27 points for his third straight game with 20 or more, and the Jazz blew out the Wizards 116-69 on Monday night. ""We played really well,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""I don't know (about) `best,' but it was really good. ... We were crisp on the offensive end, for sure. We were also pretty disciplined defensively, which is a good mindset on both ends of the floor. Burks is on his best string since three straight 20-point games in February 2014. He helped the Jazz put on a show during the first 24 minutes to lead 64-30 at halftime, their second-biggest output in a half this season. Utah moved the ball crisply, leading to wide open 3-pointers, layups and dunks. It shot 56.8 percent in the first half and knocked down seven 3s. Every Jazz player that played had an assist in the half, and the team scored 34 points in the paint. Washington set a season low for points. Otto Porter Jr. led the Wizards with 14 points. ""We've learned how to play together,"" Jazz center Rudy Gobert said, ""and how to play that style of basketball of driving and kicking and moving the ball. There's no one guy that holds the ball all the time. It's always moving and they don't know how to guard that. ""Defensively, I think that's one of the best games we've played since I've been here."" Utah used a 33-6 run that spanned the first and second quarters to take a 31-point lead. Donovan Mitchell highlighted the stretch with a tomahawk, alley-oop dunk on a fast break off a look-away pass from Ricky Rubio. Mitchell finished with 21 points. The rookie has scored 20-plus points in 9 of 24 games. Monday's effort followed a 41-point outing Friday. Gobert returned after missing the last 11 games with a bruised bone in his lower right leg. The defensive player of the year candidate wore a brace and was on a minutes restriction, but he started, played well and finished with four points and 10 rebounds in 21 minutes. ""They punched us and punched us again and punched us again,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""Surprisingly, we didn't fight back. One of the first times since I've been here we didn't play with fight."" Washington's 30 first-half points marked its second fewest points in a half this season. The Wizards shot 26.8 percent from the field and 14.3 percent from beyond the arc. Bradley Beal added 11 points on 4-for-15 shooting for Washington. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington shot 28.8 percent from the field and 20.0 percent from 3-point range for the game. Both were season lows. Jazz: Rodney Hood (ankle soreness) missed his fourth straight game. ... Raul Neto returned from a hamstring issue. WALL STILL OUT All-Star John Wall missed his fifth straight game with a sore left knee, and the team is 2/3 without him. The Wizards began the day ranked No. 11 in the league with 107.8 points per game and had averaged 104.75 in the previous four without Wall. ""We're scoring it in different ways,"" Brooks said before the game. ""John is such a great attack player in pick-and-roll. We're doing it with probably more passing and more misdirection plays."" BANGED UP The NBA has had a litany of injuries to major contributors early in the season. The Jazz have handled them fairly well after dealing with significant injuries for three years running. ""It does seem like there's been a rash, particularly, the fact that they've all happened at the same time,"" Snyder said. ""Ours happened earlier and we continued to have guys out. It's something teams deal with consistently, it's just a question of degree.""","400975100"
"TORONTO --  The Phoenix Suns are heading home from their season-high six-game trip anxious about the health of star guard Devin Booker. Booker injured his groin while the Toronto Raptors beat the Suns 126-113 on Tuesday night. Preliminary tests showed Booker strained his left adductor while playing defense with 2:40 left in the fourth quarter. Booker froze in place near midcourt, and trainers came out to examine him before two teammates carried him off the floor and into the locker room. ""It's tough,"" Suns center Greg Monre said."" He's obviously one of the great young players in this league. He's having an outstanding year right now, so you definitely don't want to see him get injured."" Booker, who shook off a 2-for-11 start to score a season-high 46 points Monday in a win at Philadelphia, shot 0 for 7 in the first half Tuesday. He finished 4 for 15 with 19 points, including 10 of 12 from the foul line. A team staffer had to help Booker limp to his stall in the locker room after being examined. Booker declined to speak to reporters. ""I'm sure they'll have to do an MRI or something to make sure we take care of him the right way,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said. Phoenix is off Wednesday before hosting Washington Thursday. Now in his third season, Booker came in averaging a team-high 24.5 points per game. ""Any time you have to get carried off it's always a scare, especially someone like him and how valuable he is to our team,"" Suns forward Jared Dudley said Kyle Lowry had 20 points and 10 assists, DeMar DeRozan scored 20 points and Toronto improved its NBA-best home record to 9-1. Serge Ibaka scored 19 points and OG Anunoby matched his career high with 16 as Toronto won its fourth straight and seventh in a row at home. Anunoby's four 3-pointers were a career-high. ""He played excellent tonight,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""Didn't try to do too much. He took what the game gave him."" The Raptors, who have scored 100 or more points in 10 consecutive games, almost reached triple digits in three quarters Tuesday. Toronto led 97-79 heading to the fourth and weren't seriously challenged in the final frame. Monroe had 11 points and 10 rebounds as the weary Suns wrapped up a six-game, 10-day road trip with their seventh of 15 back-to-backs this season. Phoenix is 3-4 in the second game of back-to-backs. TIP-INS Suns: F T.J. Warren was ejected after picking up two technical fouls in quick succession in the third. Marquese Chriss was also called for a technical shortly after Warren's ejection. ...

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  With all the excitement about the Oklahoma City Thunder's new Big Three this season, Steven Adams had become a bit of an afterthought. Not anymore. The 7-foot center had 20 points and nine rebounds to support Russell Westbrook's triple-double, and the Thunder defeated the Utah Jazz 100-94 on Tuesday night. The Thunder have won three straight, and Adams' offensive play has been critical. During the streak, he has averaged 22 points and 8.3 rebounds and made 28 of 34 shots from the field. ""That's good, mate,"" the New Zealander said. ""Good stuff."" The two new stars did their parts, too -- Paul George scored 11 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter and Carmelo Anthony added 14 points and eight rebounds. They also opened things up for Adams, and now, teams have been forced to decide whether to focus on Adams or on George and Anthony, two of the league's most capable scorers. ""The reason why Steven is doing what he's going is because of Carmelo Anthony and Paul George,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""When we're patient on offense, Steven's going to get those opportunities. Steven's not doing really anything different from maybe he's done in the past."" Westbrook finished with 34 points, 14 assists and 13 rebounds to register his seventh triple-double of the season. Oklahoma City outscored the Jazz 32-14 in the fourth quarter to complete a rally from 17 points down in the third. Rookie Donovan Mitchell scored 31 points and Joe Ingles added 16 for the Jazz, who had won six straight and scored at least 106 points in each game. The Jazz led 47-39 at halftime, and they opened things up even more early in the third quarter. A driving layup by Alec Burks put the Jazz up 72-55 as the Thunder continued to misfire on open shots. Westbrook closed out the third quarter strong and helped the Thunder cut Utah's lead to 80-68 by the end of the period. He scored 11 points in the quarter. ""Russell Westbrook, the MVP of the league, got going,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""I thought in the third quarter, he gave them a lot of energy and gave them points."" Oklahoma City cut the deficit to six points early in the final period before Westbrook re-entered the game after a brief rest. The Thunder finally took the lead on a layup by Westbrook with about four minutes remaining. Adams didn't put up big numbers late in the game, but he made a critical tip-in with 43.2 seconds left to put the Thunder up five. Oklahoma City's defense -- statistically one of the league's best -- tightened up late in the game. Utah shot 30 percent in the fourth quarter. ""(Andre) Roberson's one of the best defenders in the league, Paul George is one of the best defenders in the league. Russell Westbrook turned it up defensively, and that's tough,"" Snyder said. The Thunder now have won three straight close games after making a habit of losing them. ""We stayed with it,"" Westbrook said. ""Teams are going to make runs. It's about what you do when you get hit in the mouth. We learned our lesson, and we know that we have to continue to fight, and we did that tonight."" TIP-INS Jazz: Starters shot 13 for 25 in the first half, but reserves went 3 for 14. ... Shot 60 percent in the third quarter. ... Were outrebounded 46-35. Thunder: Westbrook and Anthony combined to make just 3 of 13 shots in the first half. ... Made 1 of 9 3-pointers in the first half and 4 of 18 overall. ...

HE SAID IT Donovan, on how the Thunder played in the first half: ""We played hurried, we played rushed, we played like we were down by 20 points with five minutes to go in the game. That's the way we played the first half. Without question, from start to finish, I thought our defense gave us a chance tonight. We were very lucky in my opinion to only be down eight at the half. We could've been down drastically more.""","400975102"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Bradley Beal had a career night, and in the process, he gave the Washington Wizards a morale-boosting rebound victory. ""I've been thinking way too much,"" Beal said after scoring a career-high 51 points in a 106-92 victory Tuesday night over the Trail Blazers. ""Tonight, I was just playing freely and having fun."" The Wizards bounced back from a discouraging 116-69 loss Monday night at the Utah Jazz. It was the second-largest losing margin in franchise history. Beal made 21 field goals against the Blazers, also a career high, and the Wizards led by as many as 23 points. He hit five 3-pointers. His 51 points were the most ever scored in Portland by an opposing player. Beal certainly set the tone, Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""You never go into a game thinking one of your best players or best guards in the league is going to get 50, but he has the ability to get high numbers when he's aggressive,"" Brooks said. ""We gave him space to work."" Beal said he barely slept after the loss to the Jazz. ""I came into the game with the mindset of being aggressive, especially coming off the game last night and the way I played the last four or five games,"" he said. Damian Lillard finished with 30 points, eight rebounds and nine assists for the Blazers, who have lost three straight at home after returning from a 4-1 trip. Portland was hurt midway through the final quarter when center Jusuf Nurkic limped off the court and to the locker room after appearing to injure his right ankle. He had 15 points and nine rebounds before leaving. The Blazers said X-rays on the ankle were negative. Playing without All-Star John Wall for the sixth straight game, the Wizards came out like they did not want a repeat of the night before. They went on an 11-0 run to go up 31-22 in the first half, capped by Kelly Oubre Jr.'s pull-up jumper. They went on to lead 51-37 at the break. Beal scored 19 first-half points, and the Wizards collectively had 12 steals by the break. ""The greatest thing about the NBA is you can bounce back the next night, and that's what happened tonight,"" Washington center Marcin Gortat said. Portland, meanwhile, had 13 turnovers at the half and finished with 18 overall. Beal's 20-foot jumper gave the Wizards a 61-38 lead in the third quarter, but the Blazers clawed back to 63-52 on Lillard's 3-pointer and a free throw. Lillard appeared to tweak his left hip late in the quarter -- and at times he grimaced -- but he had 15 points in the period to help keep the Blazers in it. CJ McCollum's layup got Portland within 81-72, but Beal answered with a 3-pointer that put him over his previous career high. Beal had 42 points against the Phoenix Suns on Nov. 21 last year. Al-Farouq Aminu made a 3-pointer that pulled Portland within 99-90 with 1:28 left, but that was as close as Portland would come. Beal dunked with 24 seconds left to punctuate his performance. ""I'm not somebody that's going to get overly concerned, especially this early in the year,"" Lillard said. ""We're just not playing well. I think it goes back to the road trip. We didn't play great, but we found ways to win games. We came home, and we just haven't played well offensively or consistent defensively."" Portland coach Terry Stotts tinkered a bit with his lineup, starting Aminu and Maurice Harkless, while sending Pat Connaughton and Noah Vonleh to the bench. The Blazers were coming off a 123-116 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday. TIP INS Wizards: It was the second of two meetings this season between the teams. Portland won the first 108-105. ... Washington swept the series last season, scoring more than 120 points in each contest. Tuesday's game was the second of a five-game trip for the Wizards. Trail Blazers: Evan Turner started the second half for Harkless, who stayed behind in the Blazers' locker room. The team later said he had a left quad contusion.

"CLEVELAND --  The play is called ""Chicago,"" named after a game-winning shot LeBron James made in the playoffs to beat the Bulls. It worked like a charm again in Cleveland. James drained a 3-pointer with 15 seconds left and finished with 32 points as the Cavaliers tied a franchise record with their 13th straight win, 101-95 over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. James, who changed his sneakers three times, also had 11 rebounds and nine assists, helping the Cavs rally from a 14-point deficit in the third quarter to remain unbeaten since Nov. 11. His decisive 3-pointer in the final minute over JaKarr Sampson came after James went to the bench during a timeout and told coach Tyronn Lue to run a play for him. ""Was going to run a different play and then Bron said, `I want Chicago.' So I said, `OK,"" Lue said. ""We got it to him and he made a big shot."" After catching the inbounds pass, James took a dribble to his left and then stepped behind the line and knocked down his fifth 3-pointer. ""It felt good,"" said James, who finished 12 of 18 from the floor. ""I was able to get the laces where I wanted them and I got enough space, I created enough space with the step-back away from JaKarr and I was able to let it go. It felt good the whole time."" Cleveland, which also won 13 straight in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons, will try to break the team record Friday at Indiana. This one wasn't easy. The Kings gave the Cavs everything they had, but couldn't contain James in the clutch. That's been the case for nearly every team that has faced the three-time champion, who is shooting with a confidence rarely seen in his career. ""He's amazing,"" said Kyle Korver, who opened the fourth quarter with three straight 3-pointers to give Cleveland the lead. ""He's just demanding the ball. He's like, `Give me the ball, we're about to win.' And, I've been around some guys who've had amazing years. I've been playing with him and Derrick (Rose) when he was MVP. Allen Iverson when I was young. ""But he's taken this to a whole new level. It's amazing to have a better than a front-row seat, because I'm usually on the court next to him somewhere. I'm glad he's on my team."" Zach Randolph had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Buddy Hield added 17 points for the Kings. Sampson grabbed 16 rebounds in his first start this season. While Cleveland's win streak is impressive, James said he won't consider anything special until the Cavs nearly double it. ""Twenty-five,"" he said when asked where the streak needs to get to before becoming significant. ""Because you're getting close to 33 (Lakers 1971-72), that's the all-time record. We ain't nowhere near close. We got close in Miami. We got to 27 and lost to Chicago."" Thanks to James and another Chicago, the Cavs roll on. ROSE REFLECTS Cavs guard Derrick Rose spoke to his teammates before the morning shootaround, two days after returning to the team from a self-imposed hiatus.  Rose has been dealing with a sprained ankle and the 2011 NBA MVP's latest injury had him re-considering his future. Lue didn't provide any specifics about Rose's comments, but said his teammates were glad to have him around again. ""It was just good to have him back and hear him talk because he's not a big talker,"" Lue said. ""He's a quiet guy. But just hearing what he had to say and then just seeing how everyone was welcoming him back and was happy he's here."" SAMPSON START Sampson, who was born in Cleveland and went to the same high school as James, didn't know he was starting until he arrived at the arena.  Then he learned he was guarding James. ""I knew it was going to be a challenge,"" he said. ""I look at moments like this, it was fun. You want to make as few mistakes as possible, and make that guy work. LeBron's one of the best players in the league so you've got to make everything tough on him. That's what I tried to do, but we came up short."" TIP-INS Kings: G Frank Mason scored a season-high 15. ... C Willie Cauley-Stein (strained lower back) didn't play after getting hurt on Saturday against Milwaukee. Cauley-Stein is also expected to sit out Friday's game at New Orleans. Cavaliers: F Tristan Thompson scrimmaged along with G Isaiah Thomas, who is nearing his debut with Cleveland after being sidelined with a hip injury. While it's still not clear when Thomas will play, Thompson, who has missed 17 games since Nov. 1 with a strained left calf, could be back in the floor in days. ""I'll be ready to return when the front office and them (the medical team) say I'm ready to return,"" Thompson said, purposely being vague. ""I gotta stay in my lane like LaVar Ball said."" ... Cleveland has made at least 10 3-pointers in 13 straight games and scored at least 100 in 18 in a row.","400975104"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The start was disappointing for the Indiana Pacers. The finish was great. Victor Oladipo scored 27 points, including a clutch 3-pointer with 31.1 seconds left, and the Pacers beat the Chicago Bulls 98-96 on Wednesday night. Bojan Bogdanovic had 17 points for Indiana (14-11), and Darren Collison finished with 14. Myles Turner had 11 points and blocked four shots, and Thaddeus Young finished with 10 points and nine rebounds. The Pacers outscored the Bulls 29-13 in the fourth quarter. ""I was going out there and playing as hard as I could on both ends of the floor and trying to help us pull it out,"" Oladipo said. ""We've got to learn to not put ourselves in that hole in the first place and try to make sure we avoid that. At the end of the day it was a big win for us and we can build on it."" The lowly Bulls led by as many as 17, but couldn't hold off the Pacers in the final moments. Oladipo's 3 gave Indiana its first lead at 97-96, and he tacked on a free throw with 12.8 seconds left. Lauri Markkanen missed a potential game-winning 3-pointer in the final seconds of Chicago's 10th straight loss. ""This one, it stings a lot,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""It's a really, really hard (loss) because we had control for the majority of it and played really good and hard unselfish basketball. The big message to our team is if we continue to play with that type of effort, if we continue to play the right way, and unselfish, we're going to start winning games."" Kris Dunn had 18 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Bulls (3-20), and Robin Lopez scored 16 points. Denzel Valentine finished with 15 points and eight boards. Chicago looked pretty good for about 3 1/2 quarters. The Bulls went 7 for 15 from beyond the arc on their way to a 55-39 halftime lead. Turner said the Pacers didn't take the Bulls lightly. Instead, Indiana just got going late. ""We just didn't come out as sharp as we've been all season,"" Turner said. ""Defensively we had some lapses, offensive end we weren't hitting shots, I think we started settling. It was a flat start, but we recovered, thankfully."" TIP-INS Bulls: All three of Chicago's wins have come on Friday. ... The Bulls went 8 for 16 at the free-throw line. ... Chicago has lost nine of its last 11 games against the Pacers.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic weren't in the mood to celebrate their 110-106 overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night. Magic shooting guard Evan Fournier, the team's second-leading scorer, crashed down on his right ankle on the first possession of overtime and had to leave the game. Orlando said X-rays were negative, but Fournier will be re-evaluated in the morning. He led the Magic with 27 points. ""I just saw Evan and he said it's hurting him,"" teammate Nikola Vucevic said. ""Hopefully, it won't keep him out too long. He's a big part of what we do. He needs to take care and make sure he comes back healthy."" Aaron Gordon had 24 points and 15 rebounds, and Vucevic contributed 22 points, 16 rebounds and four blocks as the Magic big men dominated. Orlando outscored Atlanta 62-42 in the paint. The Magic got to overtime thanks to a 3-pointer by reserve guard D.J. Augustin with six seconds left in regulation. Augustin had a wide-open look at the top of 3-point arc after getting a nice assist from Vucevic. ""D.J. is a reliable 3-pointer shooter and you know if the ball finds him, he's going to knock it down,"" coach Frank Vogel said. Dennis Schroder led Atlanta with 26 points and seven assists. Taurean Prince had 19 points and Tyler Cavanaugh 13 for the Hawks, who led 96-93 with 15 seconds left in regulation after Schroder and Kent Bazemore made four straight free throws. The Hawks chose not to foul and prevent Augustin from even attempting a 3-point shot in the final seconds, but coach Mike Budenholzer didn't second guess the decision. ""It's something you debate in meetings, but we felt like we had a chance to get a stop and trust our defense,"" Budenholzer said. ""Give Augustin credit for hitting the shot."" ""It was a good decision not to foul,"" Schroder said. ""If they miss, we win the game. We just have to play better defense and not let their big guys bully us around the basket."" Fournier's injury took some of the glimmer off the Magic's rally from a nine-point, fourth-quarter deficit. The Magic struggled to get any offensive rhythm for the first 3 1/2 quarters, finding themselves in an 86-77 hole with nine minutes to go. Gordon started the rally with five straight points, and Fournier hit a driving layup that put Orlando up 93-92 with 1:59 to play. From there, both teams struggled to execute. Bazemore hit a 3-pointer with 1:33 to play, but it was waved off after an instant replay review because of a shot-clock violation. Gordon then was charged with an offensive foul as he made a layup, but Schroder and Ersan Ilyasova both missed layups at the other end for Atlanta. Schroder ended the run of bad offense by hitting two free throws with 27.3 seconds left to give the Hawks a 94-93 lead and Bazemore hit two more with 14 seconds left to give Atlanta a 96-93 lead. The Magic hit 6 of 10 shots in overtime, including five layups against a tired and ineffective defense. TIP-INS HAWKS: C Dewayne Dedmon missed his fourth straight game with a leg injury, and F John Collins missed his third straight with a shoulder strain. ... F Marco Belinelli hit his 900th career 3-pointer in the third period. MAGIC: Rookie F Johnathan Isaac missed his 13th straight game with a sprained ankle. ... Elfrid Payton, who shot 62.5 percent (30 of 48) in his previous five games, was just 3 of 11 against the Hawks. ... Gordon is 3 of 17 from 3-point range in his last three games.","400975106"
"BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics are no strangers to adjusting on the fly this season. They recovered from Gordon Hayward's injury on opening night and the early absence of Marcus Morris to reel of 16 straight victories following an 0-2 start. That ability to bounce back was on display again to help them remain perfect against the Western Conference. Kyrie Irving had 23 points and five assists, and Jayson Tatum added 17 points and 10 rebounds and the short-handed Celtics slipped past the Dallas Mavericks 97-90 on Wednesday night Boston's Al Horford finished with 17 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. ""In the NBA you can have afternoons like today, where all of a sudden, you're down to 11 guys, and the next man up has got to be ready,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Boston has won four straight and six of their last seven. The Celtics are 8-0 against the West. The Celtics played without Jaylen Brown and Morris. Brown sat with an inflamed right eye, while Morris was out due to left knee soreness. It forced Stevens to rely heavily on his reserves. They came through in the fourth, leading a 10-0 run to put Boston back in front 80-73. Dallas fought back to tie it up at 85. But the Celtics ran off eight straight points to push their lead to 93-85 with 2 minutes to play. ""Just covering for one another. We're a team. We're pros for a reason,"" said Terry Rozier, who led all Celtics reserves with 12 points. ""You put all that hard work in and you have to be ready."" Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 19 points and seven rebounds. Dirk Nowitzki added 16 points and six rebounds. Boston's bench outscored their Dallas counterparts 36-23 for the game. ""They have a good team, they keep coming,"" Nowitzki said. ""I wasn't really good tonight. I didn't close the game the way I wanted to."" Dallas had just three turnovers in the opening 24 minutes and led 57-47 at the half. The Celtics fought through periods of sloppiness offensively, committing seven turnovers in the first two quarters. They were also outscored 20-12 in the paint. Though it's early, Horford said it feels good to be 22-4 after all they've been through. ""I'm very happy,"" he said. ""Going into the season you never have any expectations. This is good. We want to keep building on it."" Stevens is also cautiously optimistic. ""I feel good about where we're headed,"" he said. ""We've got a long way to go."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Were outrebounded 53-45. ... Were outscored 34-32 in the paint. Celtics: Stevens said both Brown and Morris are expected to be with team when it departs for three-game trip on Thursday. QUOTABLE ""Our first half was really good. Their second half was better, and that's the game."" -- Dallas coach Rick Carlisle. WILD THIRD The Mavericks took a 59-47 lead earlier in the third quarter. But the Celtics erased the deficit with a 15-2 run. It was part of a fast-moving quarter that saw the lead change hands eight times. Barnes had 12 points in period for Dallas. Horford paced Boston with 10 points. NOEL SURGERY Carlisle announced before the game that forward Nerlens Noel will have surgery later this week in Cleveland for a torn ligament in his left thumb. ""He'll be out for several weeks,"" Carlisle said. ""I don't know for how long."" Noel has appeared in 18 games this season, but hasn't played since Nov. 22. DIRK'S LONGEVITY Nowitzki hasn't said whether this will be his final NBA season at age 39. He's already tied Kobe Bryant for the most seasons spent with one franchise at 20. Another season would give him the outright record, but Carlisle said he believes it is still an open question. ""I believe it's going to depend on how he's feeling. I don't know any NBA player that wouldn't want to continue playing into oblivion,"" Carlisle said.","400975107"
"NEW YORK --  Tim Hardaway Jr. is still out and Kristaps Porzingis couldn't find a rhythm coming back, so the Knicks needed to find offense somewhere. Courtney Lee provided it. Lee scored 24 points, Porzingis had 18 after a slow start in his return to the lineup, and New York beat the Memphis Grizzlies 99-88 on Wednesday night. Lee doesn't force his offense and coach Jeff Hornacek has told him not to pass up open shots. He certainly can't now, as Hornacek said Lee has to pick up a bulk of the missing shots with Hardaway's 17.8 points per game missing. ""Tim was shooting like 18, 20 shots a game, so I need to warm this arm up man, get ready, if he wants me to shoot that many times,"" Lee said. ""On top of my shots that's like 30 shots, if he wants me to do that."" Moving from forward back to shooting guard in Hardaway's absence, Lee took 17 shots, about seven more than his season average. He fell just shy of his season high for points and was the catalyst in a big run to open the second half that largely determined the game. Porzingis scored 12 after halftime as the Knicks rebounded from consecutive losses without their top two scorers that had dropped them under .500. Porzingis came back from his sprained right ankle and illness, but the Knicks announced Tuesday that Hardaway had a stress injury in his lower left leg and had begun a treatment and rehabilitation plan. He will be re-evaluated in two weeks. Marc Gasol had 17 points and eight rebounds for the Grizzlies, who were playing for the first time since ending their 11-game skid with a victory over Minnesota on Monday. Tyreke Evans added 15 points but was just 4 for 13 from the floor. Porzingis was just 3 for 11 for six points in the first half, but the Knicks rallied to tie it at 49 going into the break on Lee's 3-pointer. Porzingis then hit a deep 3 to open the third quarter and the Knicks took off from there. Lee had a pair of baskets and then consecutive 3s late in what became a 19-2 run that made it 68-51. ""We knew that second half was going to be different and you could already see that end of the first half we were turning up our defense and it was giving us results right away,"" Porzingis said. ""And that's what we did in the second half. We came out with a different mentality and we had that run."" And the Grizzlies thought they made it easy for New York with selfish play. ""We stood around too much,"" Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""Offensively we got stagnant and watched one guy try to go 1-on-1."" New York kept a safe lead from there and when Memphis trimmed it to 88-82 with about five minutes remaining, Lee scored in the lane and Porzingis followed with a basket and a 3-pointer to push it back to 95-82. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Gasol was fined $15,000 by the NBA for using a profanity during a live television interview after the victory Monday. ... Memphis has lost six straight road games. Knicks: Enes Kanter finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds. ... Lee's season high is 26 points. ... The Knicks were 9 for 14 (64.3 percent) from 3-point range. ... Joakim Noah was activated so the Knicks had another big body to use against Gasol, but he did not play. GASOL'S TROUBLES Gasol said his right knee locked up on him during the game. ""I don't know exactly what happened. It just locked up,"" he said. ""Couldn't really extend it. I never had any knee issues. So it was a new feeling for me.""

"Kevin Durant comes to play with Steph Curry sidelined, dropping the ninth triple-double of his career, and lifting the Warriors past the Hornets. (0:48) CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kevin Durant doesn't often run the Warriors' offense -- certainly not with Stephen Curry on the floor. So when he got the opportunity on Wednesday night, he relished it. Durant had 35 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists, and Golden State beat the Charlotte Hornets 101-87 without Curry and Draymond Green. It was Durant's first triple-double of the season and his second since joining the Warriors. ""It's fun when you get to create and just be creative out there, whether it's passing to JaVale (McGee) for a lob or shooting a pull-up jump shot,"" Durant said. ""Tonight it felt like I could go in my bag of tools, my bag of tricks, to pull some stuff out. I don't expect it to be like that every single game, but tonight I thought it called for it."" Coach Steve Kerr called it a luxury to turn from one MVP to another in a time of need. He said Durant simply took over. ""It wasn't so much a vocal leadership role, but more of an `I got this' type of thing,"" Kerr said. ""It was the way he carried himself. He was clearly the best player on the floor and the dominant player on the floor. Without Steph, he almost had a different bounce to his step, like `This one is mine, I got it."" Klay Thompson scored seven of his 22 points in the fourth quarter for the Warriors, who have won five straight overall and seven in a row against the Hornets. Curry will be sidelined for about two weeks with a sprained ankle, while Green is nursing a sore shoulder. It hardly mattered. Durant set the tone, scoring 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting in the first quarter to help the Warriors build a 26-18 lead. The edge increased to 26 in the second quarter following back-to-back 3-pointers by Nick Young, who had 10 points. ""Even without those other guys, they're still pretty good,"" said Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas, who is leading the team while Steve Clifford is dealing with a health issue. ""Obviously with Kevin Durant and Klay it was hard to stop those guys tonight."" Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 24 points, while Nic Batum added 15 and Dwight Howard 14. Charlotte cut the lead to 11 at the end of the third quarter behind 10 points from Batum but didn't make a serious run at the lead thanks to a strong fourth quarter from Thompson. TIP INS Warriors: Golden State (20-6) had 24 fast-break points against a team that had been allowing the second-fewest fast-break points in the league at 7.5 per game. ... Patrick McCaw did not play because of a bruised nose. Hornets: Charlotte attempted one free throw in the first half after attempting 40 on Monday night against the Orlando Magic. WHAT'S COOKING: Quinn Cook started at point guard for the Warriors and had eight points, three assists and three rebounds. Kerr said his play was fantastic. ""I knew Quinn would play well,"" Kerr said. ""He's played a lot of minutes for New Orleans last year and we have watched him in practice in the G league. ... We have a lot of synergy between the franchises and we run the same stuff, so Quinn knows all of the plays."" INJURED HORNETS: Just when the Hornets finally got everyone back healthy, they lost two big men off the bench. Frank Kaminsky left the game in the first quarter with an ankle injury and Cody Zeller left in the fourth with a strained left knee. Neither returned to the game.

Giannis Antetokounmpo had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and Khris Middleton had 21 points, including four free throws in the final 20 seconds to help the Bucks win for the fourth time in five games. Eric Bledsoe added 22 points. ""We just stayed with it,"" Middleton said. ""We did a great job of holding onto the lead. We have just been grinding it out and staying with it."" Milwaukee took a 60-51 lead into halftime, but Detroit outscored the Bucks 25-16 in the third quarter to send the game to the fourth tied at 76. The Bucks took a 90-77 lead on a jumper by Malcolm Brogdon with 6:42 remaining. Including the end of the third quarter, Detroit went 7:57 without a field goal until Tobias Harris scored with 5:12 left. Andre Drummond scored 27 points with 20 rebounds for Detroit, which lost its fourth straight. Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy blamed the slow start to the fourth quarter on the Pistons bench players. ""Our bench has not played well on this trip,"" Van Gundy said. ""We maybe have to change up our rotations. Our bench has been really, really good for us, but now has not been."" Reggie Jackson's jumper pulled Detroit within 97-94, but Bledsoe tipped in his own miss to make it 99-94 with 32.1 seconds to play.

"DeMarcus Cousins drops 40 points and 22 rebounds against the Nuggets, putting him in some pretty special company. (0:49) NEW ORLEANS --  DeMarcus Cousins employed a hesitation dribble between his legs as he approached center Kenneth Faried in the lane. The Pelicans big man then spun between Faried and converging Denver forward Wilson Chandler and was fouled as he converted a leaning scoop off the glass. It was perhaps the best of many highlights for Cousins, who had 40 points, 22 rebounds and four blocks to help New Orleans down Denver 123-114 on Wednesday night. ""Just trying to make a play, doing whatever it takes to help the team win a game. Tonight was my night,"" Cousins said. ""You kind of get locked in and you know when you're rolling, of course, but it's still all about making the right play because eventually they adjust."" Jrue Holiday scored 27 points and E'Twaun Moore had 14 for New Orleans, which shot 53.5 percent (46 of 86) and won for the second time in three games without All-Star forward Anthony Davis. Gary Harris scored 24 for the short-handed Nuggets, who remained without recently injured frontcourt stalwarts Nikola Jokic and Paul Millsap. ""They're not as deep as they usually are at the big spot and they were a bit under-sized,"" Cousins said in explaining why he was aggressive from the outset. The Pelicans liked what they saw and let Cousins dictate the offense. ""It's hard to stop him. Just give him the ball, really,"" Holiday said. ""He should have had 50. He missed a couple free throws."" Cousins missed seven, in fact, but it hardly mattered. Emmanuel Mudiay scored 17 points, while Will Barton and Jamal Murray each scored 15 for the Nuggets, who were as close as 97-94 after Malik Beasley's 3 with 11:25 to go, only to fade down the stretch. The Pelicans broke the game open in the fourth quarter with a decisive 20-3 run during which Cousins scored six points and blocked two shots. That made the score 117-97, and Denver didn't threaten again. ""We didn't guard anybody,"" Denver coach Mike Malone said. ""It's becoming the same story every single night.  Until our guys start taking it personally, until our guys start understating the importance of playing defense and guarding your man 1-on-1, forget playoffs. That is a word we should not use for this team."" Cousins has now had at least 40 points and 20 rebounds in a game twice this season, the first time coming in a victory at Sacramento on Oct. 26. ""I'm not really focused on the numbers,"" insisted Cousins, who played 39:34 and scored his last point with 23 seconds left. ""We got a win. That's all that matters."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Trey Lyles had 10 points and 11 rebounds. ...  Jokic missed his third straight game with a left ankle sprain, while Millsap missed his eighth straight with a left wrist injury. ... Barton was assessed a technical foul for arguing after officials called a defensive foul on Denver on Cousins' missed layup.

Darius Miller has made at least one 3 in 17 straight games. DEFENSIVE DEFICIENCIES The Nuggets made 10 of 19 3-point attempts in the first half, when they shot 51 percent overall and led by as many as 10 points. New Orleans shot nearly 57 percent, with Cousins and Holiday each scoring 19 points during the first two quarters, after which New Orleans led 67-66. ""In the first half we kind of got sucked into playing their style of play, just trying to outscore one another,"" Cousins said. ""We came in at half and said the first team to play a little bit of defense is going to be the team to win the game."" QUOTABLE Cousins was upset that officials reviewed a play in which Mason Plumlee crashed dramatically to the court after Cousins' elbow came near the Denver forward's face as Cousins secured a rebound. Replays did not show obvious contact, and officials decided to uphold their original call that Plumlee committed a foul. On Nov. 20, Cousins was ejected after a similar play involving Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook. ""Just the antics. It's silly man, like, just let me live,"" Cousins said. ""Just trying to villainize me and the way that it's going, I hate it. Just let me be a basketball player. That's all I'm asking.""","400975111"

""That's always wonderful,"" Popovich said of the balanced attack for the Spurs. ""And then when you sit down and when you start feeling good about it, you realize that Golden State does that every night. Ok, we've got a ways to go, don't get too excited, but it is great to see."" The Warriors are tied with the Houston Rockets for the Western Conference's best record, but the Spurs are only 2 1/2 games back despite the season-long absence of All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard. With Leonard's return looming from a right quadriceps injury, Aldridge led the Spurs in scoring for the 20th time in 25 games. While Aldridge has been the team's primary offensive threat in place of Leonard, San Antonio has carved out a 17-8 record by taking advantage of its depth. ""It comes from everybody being willing to make a pass for us to be successful,"" said veteran Rudy Gay, who signed with the Spurs in the offseason. ""We have to find the open man and pass up a good shot for a great shot. We've been doing that well these past few games. I think that's one of the great things about this system, everybody is playing for each other and it ends up in the win column. That's part of the reason I came here."" The Spurs shot 52.9 percent from the field and had seven players score in double figures. Bryn Forbes had 17 points, and Gay finished with 16 in San Antonio's sixth win in seven games. Tyler Johnson led Miami with 25 points, and Dion Waiters had 22. San Antonio got off to a slow start defensively, just like it did in its comeback victory against Detroit on Monday night. Miami shot 58 percent in the first half, including going 9 for 18 on 3-pointers. ""It was a little bit surprising that we were able to score 35 in the first quarter,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We moved the ball, knocked down some open 3s, that always helps, and then they started to get the game a little bit more to their liking."" San Antonio forced 11 turnovers and outscored Miami 60-47 in the second half. The Spurs' reserves stepped up again, just as they have done all season. Forbes made three 3s in the third quarter, helping San Antonio to an 86-82 lead heading into the final period after they trailed by four at halftime. TIP-INS Heat: Starting center Hassan Whiteside missed his fourth straight game with a bruised left knee bone. ... Spoelstra has 451 career victories, three shy of tying Pat Riley for the most in franchise history. ... The Heat have not beaten the Spurs since Jan. 26, 2014, in Miami. Miami is 18-42 all-time against San Antonio in the regular season. Spurs: Forbes made a career-high five 3-pointers. He became the fourth undrafted player to make at least five 3-pointers in a game for the Spurs, joining Bruce Bowen, Gary Neal and Jaren Jackson. ... The Spurs have made a 3-pointer in 1,000 straight games dating to April 9, 2005, the fourth-longest streak in league history. Dallas holds the record with 1,108 straight games with a 3 from 1999-2012. ... Aldridge has 197 blocks, passing Tiago Splitter for 23rd in franchise history.","400975112"
"LOS ANGELES --  Karl-Anthony Towns and the Minnesota Timberwolves were challenged by the Los Angeles Clippers in the fourth quarter. This time, they held on. Towns had 21 points, 12 rebounds and four blocked shots, and the Timberwolves edged the sliding Clippers 113-107 on Wednesday night. Minnesota, which recently blew a couple of double-digit leads, went up by 19 early in the third quarter. The Clippers pulled within four in the fourth, but the Timberwolves responded. ""Obviously you don't want to see a lead like we had go away that way,"" Towns said. ""We knew we needed to stop the bleeding as soon as possible. We did a great job of staying at an eight-point lead and taming them down and stalemating it."" Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague each scored 19 points for the Timberwolves (15-11), who placed six players in double figures. Andrew Wiggins and Taj Gibson had 16 apiece, and Jamal Crawford finished with 11 points. ""They kept coming, and because of the way they can score, you are always concerned,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""Just finding a way to win was probably the most important thing."" Los Angeles dropped its fourth straight game despite an impressive performance by DeAndre Jordan, who had 18 points and 21 rebounds. Lou Williams and Austin Rivers each scored 23 points for the Clippers (8-15). ""It's very difficult,"" Rivers said. ""It's frustrating. Nobody likes to lose. We're losing a lot of games."" Danilo Gallinari returned for Los Angeles and scored seven points on 2-for-13 shooting. Gallinari had been sidelined since Nov. 5 due to a glute injury. TIP-INS Timberwolves: F Nemanja Bjelica remained out with a sprained left foot. He has missed eight straight games. ... Wednesday marked Crawford's first game back at Staples Center since leaving the Clippers. Said Crawford: ""You see these people every day for five years. It's just weird. Some of those relationships will last a lifetime."" Clippers: G Milos Teodosic (plantar fascia) remained out, but coach Doc Rivers said he is close to returning. GALLINARI RETURN Gallinari had only two rebounds and no assists in 26 minutes. ""I wanted to be better,"" he said. ""I didn't expect to shoot the ball that bad. I was expecting to be better already, but I wasn't. I'll be better next game.""","400975113"
"PHILADELPHIA --  LaVar Ball's fourth-quarter taunts to Philly fans turned up the volume on an already raucous atmosphere. His son, Lonzo, later helped silence the sold-out crowd. Brandon Ingram scored 21 points, including the game-winning 3-pointer with 0.8 seconds remaining on an assist from Lonzo Ball, to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 107-104 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night. Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson added 16 points apiece for the Lakers, who snapped a five-game losing streak. On the winning play, Ball drove to the basket before dishing back to Ingram on the right wing. ""He already saw it before it happened,"" LaVar Ball said of his son's assist. Ingram calmly drained what he called the biggest shot of his young NBA career. ""I think he made a great pass,"" Ingram said. ""I had the confidence to shoot it."" Lonzo Ball finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. The winning basket sent Ball's dad, LaVar, into a wild celebration in a suite. ""When I come this far of a distance, it's hard to beat him,"" LaVar Ball said. ""I don't like all them losses. So, he'll do whatever it takes to get that `W."" LaVar Ball later embraced his son outside the Lakers locker room and told him how proud he was. ""Keep doing what you're doing,"" he said. ""You're going to figure it out. You're going to have more fun than you've ever had."" The game was the first for the Lakers since LaVar Ball criticized coach Luke Walton and the Lakers offense in a radio interview, saying son Lonzo was ""very disgusted."" It has been a tumultuous week for the Ball family, as LaVar withdrew another son, LiAngelo, from UCLA stemming from his suspension by the school for his involvement in a shoplifting incident in China. LaVar Ball recently withdrew youngest son LaMelo from Chino Hills High, where he was a junior, and said he was going to home school him. On Thursday LaVar Ball told ESPN that LiAngelo and LaMelo have signed with Harrison Gaines, the same agent who represents Lonzo Ball. That ends the amateur status of both. Lonzo Ball was loudly booed every time he touched the ball. And Philadelphia fans gave the elder Ball even worse treatment when he began hooting and hollering from his suite in the fourth quarter. ""They don't know the boos make my son stand up because I've been teaching him since he was a baby boos mean ball,"" LaVar Ball said. Lonzo Ball said he enjoyed the atmosphere. ""Right when they called my name, they were ready to go,"" Lonzo Ball said of the fans. ""They were going after us. It's always fun playing like that though."" Joel Embiid scored 33 points and Ben Simmons had a triple-double with 12 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists for Philadelphia. ""I never really felt we started playing until halfway through the third,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. The 76ers battled back from a 16-point second-half deficit to tie the game on Embiid's two free throws with 39.8 seconds remaining. Lonzo Ball missed a 3 on Los Angeles' ensuing possession and Embiid then missed a chance to give Philadelphia the lead. After a timeout, Richaun Holmes' tying attempt at the buzzer was way off. TOP PICKS FACE OFF The game matched the top two picks of the 2016 draft, with No. 1 selection Simmons facing off with No. 2 pick Ingram. Simmons drew ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" in the third quarter when he spun left before throwing down an emphatic right-handed dunk. But Ingram got the last laugh. ""It is (fun),"" Ingram said of playing against Simmons. ""He's a really good player. He gets his team involved. He's a leader of his basketball team."" LOUD FANS Philadelphia's faithful lived up to their reputation as hearty sports fans, drawing praise from the Lakers. ""They have great fans here,"" Randle said. ""It felt like a college atmosphere."" Philadelphia clawed within 90-86 on Holmes' three-point play with 6:56 left, drawing such a loud reaction from the sold-out crowd that it sounded like the glory days of Allen Iverson exciting the 76ers followers. ""The fans out there were crazy,"" Ingram said. ""It was amazing how poised our team stayed (for) how loud it was in that basketball gym."" OKAFOR TRADED Earlier Thursday, Philadelphia traded Jahlil Okafor to the Brooklyn Nets. The deal ended a stalemate that had kept Okafor, the No. 3 pick in the 2015 draft, on the bench for all but two games this season. The Sixers also sent seldom-used guard Nik Stauskas, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2014 draft, and a 2019 second-round pick to the Nets for forward Trevor Booker. Booker, the 23rd overall pick of the 2010 draft by Washington, averaged 10.1 points with the Nets. TIP-INS Lakers: Former Villanova standout Josh Hart had four points in 9 minutes. ...

"PHOENIX --  Bradley Beal was asked if there is a certain feel to a high-scoring night, moments after the Washington Wizards guard's second offensive outburst in two games. ""I don't come into a game thinking that I'm going to score 50 or 40,"" Beal said after scoring 34 points in the Wizards' 109-99 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Thursday. ""I play within the flow of the game. Whatever the number is, that's what the number is."" Beal made 13 of 22 shots two nights after scoring 51 points in a victory at Portland. He had 22 points in the first half, and his 85 points in two games are the most by a Wizards player over a two-game span since Gilbert Arenas had 85 in games Dec. 22 and 26, 2006. Former Sun Markieff Morris added 21 points, and the Wizards made 51 percent of their shots. Washington has won three of four. T.J. Warren had 23 points for Phoenix. The Suns played their first game with star guard Devin Booker sidelined with a groin injury. Booker is expected to miss two to three weeks with the left adductor strain. He was hurt Tuesday night in Toronto. ""The game comes down to the end where you give it to somebody,"" Suns coach Jay Triano said. ""We saw Beal do it and make tough shots and our guy who does it (Booker) was on the pine."" Phoenix cut Washington's lead to two at 98-96 on Alex Len's dunk with 5:46 to play. The Suns missed two chances to draw even, and Washington outscored them 11-3 the rest of the way. Beal took a key charge to thwart the Suns on one possession, and later got the Suns' Josh Jackson to commit his sixth foul and foul out. Ian Manhimi made it 107-96 with a basket and free throw with 2:38 to play, and the Suns couldn't rally. ""I feel like I had an upper hand on him with him being a rookie,"" Beal said of Jackson. He's aggressive but our bigs were screening the mess out of him."" The Wizards took a 57-52 lead into halftime and led by as many as nine in the third. The Suns cut the lead to three, 83-80, on Troy Daniels' 3, and on the next possession made it a one-point game with 58 seconds left in the quarter. Mike James made two free throws for the Suns' first lead of the half, but Beal banked in a runner at the quarter buzzer to give the Wizards an 85-84 lead. The Suns have lost four of five. CHRISS-CROSSED Suns forward Marquese Chriss turned in the game's best defensive play when he blocked Otto Porter Jr.'s driving dunk attempt with 2:51 to go in the first half. Porter drove the lane and was met in the air by Chriss at the basket. Chriss also provided a highlight on the offensive end with a lob dunk off a pass from Warren just before halftime. THOUGHTS OF L.A. Wizards coach and California native Scott Brooks was asked if he is considering practice schedule changes with the next game in wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles against the Clippers. ""We definitely monitor it, but we monitor it just for the safety of the people,"" Brooks said. ""It's a sad situation. Hopefully all the great firemen of the state can take care of it ... Basketball's not even important. If we don't have a practice or have a shootaround it's not that big a deal."" TIP-INS Wizards: G John Wall missed his seventh straight game with a left knee injury, but went through a workout on the court before the game. ... The Wizards have a 63-62 lead in the series with the Suns. ... The Wizards have won consecutive games for the first time since Nov. 9-15.

"MEXICO CITY --  Playing short-handed because of injuries and a trade, the Brooklyn Nets found a way to hold off Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was a nice little start to their stay in Mexico. Caris Levert scored 21 points, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 17 and Brooklyn overcame another strong performance by Westbrook to beat Oklahoma City 100-95 on Thursday night in the first of the Nets' two games in Mexico City. Westbrook had 31 points, eight rebounds and six assists. The Nets played without guards Jeremy Lin and D'Angelo Russell because of injuries. They also traded power forward Trevor Booker to Philadelphia before the game. ""Sometimes when you have injuries you discover new things and that*s what*s happening to us,"" said Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson, who praised his team for playing hard after the trade. ""I spoke to everybody individually, I felt it was important, we told them why we made the trade and why it*s good for the future and they understood."" Allen Crabbe had 15 points for Brooklyn, which won for the third time in four games. The Nets will play the Miami Heat on Saturday at Arena Ciudad de Mexico. The Thunder had won three in a row. ""For most of the first half we played good but we did not come out great in the second half,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I think the difference was that they went downhill into the basket and we weren*t able to go downfield enough."" Donovan said Mexico City*s altitude did not play a role in the team*s fourth-quarter performance, when it managed just 16 points. Steven Adams scored 12 points for the Thunder, and Carmelo Anthony had 11 on 5-for-20 shooting. Oklahoma City played without Paul George (right calf contusion) and Jerami Grant (left hip contusion). Westbrook made a foul shot to give Oklahoma City an 85-84 lead with 7:38 left.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  James Harden and the Houston Rockets are defined by their explosive offense, and it got the best of the Utah Jazz on Thursday night. Harden scored 29 points, Ryan Anderson added 23 and Houston overwhelmed the Jazz during the third quarter in a 112-101 victory. The Rockets totaled seven 3-pointers in the third, which equaled the number of field goals for Utah in the same stretch. Harden and Anderson each shot 3 of 4 from the perimeter in the quarter. ""We've got Ryan at the four, and he spaces the floor extremely well, so you got space and guys are able to drive the lane and get up 3s,"" Harden said. ""No different how we play. We get up 3s and we take the best of every shot and, defensively, we just try to lock down."" Chris Paul added 18 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds for the Rockets. Houston (19-4) won its eighth straight game and 14th in 15. The team is 9-0 with Paul in the lineup. ""Having him here has just opened up the court so much more for me and for our shooting ability,"" Anderson said. ""But for me it's just easier looks. It's easier, more open looks."" Donovan Mitchell had 26 points, Alec Burks added 17 and Thabo Sefolosha chipped in 14 to lead the Jazz. Utah (13-13) dropped its second straight game. Utah played from behind throughout much of the first half after struggling with turnovers and erratic shooting. The Jazz turned it over eight times before halftime, leading to several key baskets for the Rockets. ""That's what they do,"" center Rudy Gobert said. ""They're very aggressive. They don't have to play defense much, so they steal the ball, drag you off and that's what they do. I had five turnovers, and that's something we need to avoid."" Houston surged in front after Gobert committed back-to-back turnovers less than two minutes into the first quarter. Utah rallied twice to take the lead, but both runs were answered with bigger ones from the Rockets. Houston used a 13-2 run early in the second half to pull away from the Jazz. Clint Capela got it going with a three-point play and finished it with a dunk to give the Rockets a 74-53 lead with 7:00 left in the third quarter. ""Our pace picked up a little bit,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We were getting stops and getting out on the break."" Houston led by 25 points after Ariza buried a 3-pointer in the opening minute of the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston has totaled 41 3-pointers in two games against Utah this season. ... The Rockets went 14 of 14 from the free-throw line over the final three quarters. ... Harden has averaged 35.4 points in his last five games against the Jazz.

Utah's offense has not been the same without him. Hood was averaging 17.7 points per game and emerged as a reliable sixth man. Jazz coach Quin Snyder said there's no timetable for Hood's return. ""We miss him in lots of ways, especially his ability to take us through periods of the game where we have a dry spell and he's able to score,"" Snyder said.","400975117"

On Friday night, they kept their poise and finished strong. Lauri Markkanen had 24 points, including a key 3-pointer in overtime, and 12 rebounds to lead Chicago to a 119-111 win over the Charlotte Hornets. ""Lauri showed again that he's going to be a heck of a player in this league,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""He was awesome down the stretch making big, clutch plays for us."" Robin Lopez had 19 points and 10 rebounds for Chicago. Kris Dunn scored 20 points, Justin Holiday had 17 and David Nwaba chipped in with 11 for the Bulls, who are 2-0 against Charlotte and 2-20 against the rest of the league. Dwight Howard had 25 points and 20 rebounds to lead the Hornets, his second 20-20 game of the season. Kemba Walker added 20 points, and Marvin Williams had a season-high 17. ""We have to rely on (Howard) quite a bit,"" Hornets' coach Stephen Silas said. ""Dwight was great tonight as far as his post presence, paint catches, rebounding and just keeping us in the game."" Charlotte made up a two-possession deficit in the final minute. Walker made a pair of free throws with 5.3 seconds left to force overtime in a back-and-forth game that featured 17 lead changes and 20 ties. Neither team led by more than eight. The extra period belonged to Chicago as the Bulls never trailed. ""We thought, as a team, the last couple close games, we thought we could have won them. It just happened down the stretch we didn't execute,"" Dunn said. ""We finally got the monkey off our back. It felt good, and we should start something new."" The Bulls used an 8-0 run to open the fourth quarter and gain an 83-79 lead, setting up a frantic final few minutes.

Silas coached the Hornets for the third straight game in place of Steve Clifford, who is out indefinitely with health issues. CALLING THE RESERVES The Bulls' bench provided 32 points and tight defense to keep the game close. ""The second unit was key,"" Holiday said.

NO TIME TO REST The short-handed Hornets will turn around and play again Saturday against the Los Angeles Lakers. Four Charlotte players were on the floor for at least 39 minutes against the Bulls, and Silas believes fatigue will be a factor. ""It's a mindset.

"DETROIT --  It wasn't a perfect road trip for Golden State -- not with Stephen Curry going down with an ankle injury -- but the Warriors made it through with an unblemished record. Kevin Durant scored 13 of his 36 points in the third quarter, and the Warriors beat the Detroit Pistons 102-98 on Friday night to finish 6-0 on the trip. They've played the past two games without Curry, who is recovering from a sprained right ankle . ""Just a great finish to just an amazing trip,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""The last two games without Steph, obviously, tonight against a team that's given us some problems and beat us a few weeks ago -- so thrilled with the effort and now we get to go home and we're all very happy about that."" Detroit had a chance to tie it in the final seconds, but Reggie Jackson's wild drive to the basket did not lead to a good shot, and Klay Thompson made two free throws with 5.3 seconds left for the final margin. ""He drove the ball hard, and they had a lot of guys going to the ball,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We had a couple guys open outside, but it is easier to see that on tape than it does when you are out there in the paint."" Golden State went 1 for 12 from 3-point range in the first half but took control by outscoring Detroit 31-17 in the third quarter. Thompson had 21 points. Avery Bradley scored 25 points for the Pistons, who have lost five straight. Detroit led 50-46 at halftime. Golden State led 77-67 after Quinn Cook made a 3-pointer at the buzzer at the end of the third quarter. After Detroit cut the deficit to two in the fourth, Durant missed badly on an open 3-pointer, then fell to the ground well after releasing the shot. A foul was called on Detroit's Anthony Tolliver, and with the crowd booing, Durant made all three free throws for an 87-82 lead. ""I'm not looking to get fined, so I can't comment on that,"" Pistons center Andre Drummond said. A 3-pointer by Thompson made it 94-85. The Pistons scored the next four points and had the ball when Durant blocked Tolliver's perimeter shot and then dunked on a breakaway at the other end. A 3-pointer by Bradley made it 100-98 with 22.7 seconds left, and Shaun Livingston missed two free throws for the Warriors, but Jackson wasn't able to tie it. IMPRESSIVE MARK No NBA team has had a perfect trip of more than six games. Golden State became the first to go 6-0 on a trip since the Lakers in 2009, according to information the Warriors provided from the Elias Sports Bureau. ""I think our focus level was the main thing throughout this whole trip, especially with so much that went on,"" Durant said. ""Just proud of the effort that we all gave, from the coaches all the way down to the players."" DEFENDING THE RIM The Warriors had 15 blocked shots, and Van Gundy said his team was at least partly responsible for that. ""You get five or six blocked, that's just great defense,"" he said. ""You get 16 blocked against Milwaukee, 15 blocked tonight, that's bad decision making. It's not that anybody is trying to make bad decisions, but we've just got to make better decisions.""

"INDIANAPOLIS -- Victor Oladipo keeps delivering knockout blows. And nobody in the NBA seems to be immune from his closing flurries. Two nights after beating the league's worst team with a late 3-pointer, Indiana's new shooting guard did it again with another late 3 and the Pacers beat Cleveland 106-102 on Friday to end the Cavaliers' 13-game winning streak. Oladipo finished with 33 points, eight rebounds and six 3s and played so well that Cavs coach Tyronn Lue called him an All-Star. ""Coming from someone like him who's been around great players, played with great players and, obviously, coaching the best player we have in our league it's an honor for him to say that,"" Oladipo said. ""I'm not satisfied by any means and neither is this team. I've got to keep getting better, and this team has got to keep getting better."" The Pacers have played better than most expected following last summer's Paul George trade. And the biggest reason has been Oladipo's clutch shooting. In late October, his shot with 10.1 seconds left beat San Antonio. On Wednesday, his 3 with 31.1 seconds to go beat Chicago. This time, with 1:01 left, Oladipo's 3 gave Indiana a 103-97 lead that sunk the three-time defending Eastern Conference champs. Cleveland never got another chance to tie or take the lead. Indiana has won three straight, nine of 12 and is the first team to beat the Cavs twice this season. Not bad for a rebuilding franchise that got swept by Cleveland in the first round of last season's playoffs. ""You've got to take away the head of the snake, and that's been Paul George and now it's Oladipo,"" LeBron James said. ""They've given (him) the confidence, no matter make or miss. He missed three or four straight 3s -- some of them didn't hit the rim, some of them hit the backboard -- but they've given him the confidence, keep taking `em. Then he makes the (one) to kind of put it away,"" While Oladipo gave Indiana the upper hand, James &amp; Co. did everything they could to break franchise records for longest winning streak and most consecutive road wins. Instead, they came up just short on a night James had 29 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Kevin Love added 20 points in Cleveland's first loss since Nov. 9 at Houston. The Cavs had won seven straight on the road. These teams went toe to toe most of the night, trading jabs, leads and momentum swings. But Oladipo's closing combination finally stopped Cleveland. After using an 11-2 third-quarter spurt to finally retake the lead, the Cavs played catch up for the final 14 minutes. They got as close as 96-95 on J.R. Smith's 3-pointer with 2:49 to go. Then Bojan Bogdanovic answered with a 3, Oladipo made one of two free throws and then hit the 3 that made it a six-point game. Cleveland cut the deficit to 104-102 on Smith's 3 with 10 seconds left, but Cory Joseph made two throw and Myles Turner grabbed the rebound off Love's errant 3 to seal it. ""Tonight was an example of us putting the ball in his hands in the fourth quarter, late in the game and he has to makes reads,"" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said, referring to Oladipo.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Denver Nuggets needed a spark after a miserable first quarter Friday night, and they got something more like a fire from their bench in a 103-89 victory over the Orlando Magic. Kenneth Faried led the way with 20 points and 10 rebounds and Denver rebounded from a 14-point first quarter with a 53-16 advantage in bench scoring. ""I noticed we started running and they started calling timeouts. Our energy changed,"" said Malik Beasley, one of three Nuggets to come off the bench with double-digit scoring. ""We were hyped on the bench and hyped on the court, especially in the second half, just pushing on them and not breaking down."" Will Barton added 19 points. Emmanuel Mudiay had 18 and Beasley 12 for the Nuggets. Only Barton started. ""Obviously, I rode that second unit in the second quarter and they deserved those minutes,"" coach Michael Malone said. ""We had great energy, great efficiency. Anytime you outscore your opponent 53-16, that's a great job by them."" After falling behind by 11 in the first quarter, the Nuggets (14-11) dominated the rest of the game, shooting 61 percent (28 for 46) in the second and third quarters en route to their second road victory since Oct. 29. Nikola Vucevic led the Magic (11-16) with 21 points and 17 rebounds. Jonathan Simmons also scored 21 points, 11 in the first quarter. With Mudiay and Faried contributing 11 points each, Denver erased a 13-point deficit in the second quarter and led 49-48 at halftime. ""In the first quarter we were very good defensively. In the second quarter, we weren't,"" said Magic coach Frank Vogel. ""Mudlay, Faried, Beasley, those guys turned the game around."" Gary Harris scored six straight Denver points early in the second half to put the Nuggets ahead to stay. Magic forward Aaron Gordon left with a concussion shortly after colliding with Harris midway through the third quarter. Orlando also played without guard Evan Fournier for the first time this season. ""It's not easy when you lose guys that are a big part of what we're doing, but it's part of the job we do,"" Vucevic said. ""People get injured. Every team goes through it. We need the next guy to step up and find a way to win games."" DEFENSIVE NUGGETS The 89 points were the fewest given up by the Nuggets since the second game of the season. They gave up an average of 116.8 points in losing five of their preceding six road games. ""The story of the game for me was our defense,"" Malone said. ""We weren't down early because of defense. We were down because we couldn't make a shot."" TIP-INS Nuggets: It was the fourth straight game in which neither Nikola Jokic (left ankle) nor Paul Millsaps (left wrist) played. ... The Nuggets have won only six times in Orlando. They lost 15 straight here, a streak that ended in 2008. Magic: Arron Afflalo started his first game for the Magic since April 16, 2014, two months before being traded to Denver for Fournier. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Toronto finally got untracked enough for a good start to a four-game trip. Despite trailing by 17 in the first half, the Raptors worked through their problems, upped their game after intermission and pulled away from Memphis for a 116-107 victory Friday night. ""I think we were more frustrated with ourselves that we let ourselves get down 17 points,"" said guard DeMar DeRozan, who led the Raptors with 26 points. ""It kind of made the job harder on ourselves. It was on us to play great basketball the rest of the game."" The Raptors, who have stops in Sacramento, Los Angeles against the Clippers and Phoenix in the next six days, pulled within five at halftime, trailed by one after three, then outscored the Grizzlies 24-14 down the stretch. ""The middle of the third quarter is when we made our move because we started off the (second) half a little stiff,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said, adding: ""But with the first half, we have to get our motor going earlier and not allow teams to jump on us like that."" Serge Ibaka matched his season high with 21 points, Kyle Lowry added 16 points and eight assists, and Fred VanVleet had 12 points to help the Raptors win their fifth straight. For Memphis, its play continues to be uneven. After shooting 74 percent in the first quarter, the Grizzlies returned to reality, shooting 43 percent the rest of the game. Seventeen turnovers contributed to the Grizzlies troubles as they lost for the 13th time in the last 14. ""Defensively, for us, you can't give (Toronto) 41 fast break points,"" Memphis interim coach J. B. Bickerstaff said. ""That's where they thrive, in the open court. ""You allow these guys to get out and play freely like they did, they're hard to beat."" Tyreke Evans led the Grizzlies with 27 points, Marc Gasol had 20, and Chandler Parsons 15. Blowing a big lead and having only one win since Nov. 7 frustrated Memphis. The Grizzlies were still within single-digits when Gasol drew a technical with 4:01 left. Then Evans got one with just under 2 minutes to go. ""We're not in a position to have those mental errors,"" Bickerstaff said. ""We need two points as bad as anyone right now."" TIP-INS Raptors: Have scored at least 100 points in 11 straight games. ... C.J. Miles missed all four of his shots from outside the arc, ending his string of 11 straight games with a 3-pointer. ... Ibaka has at least one block in the last 12 games. ...Toronto has won seven of the last nine in the series. Grizzlies: Memphis announced Friday that the team has hired Greg Buckner as an assistant coach. Buckner, who finished his 10-year NBA career in 2009 with the Grizzlies, fills the vacant spot on the staff that resulted from Bickerstaff taking over for David Fizdale, who was fired Nov. 27. ... The Raptors are one of only two NBA teams over which the Grizzlies have an all-time, better-then-.500 record. The Washington Wizards are the other. ... Memphis is 0-8 against the Eastern Conference. TURNING POINT Memphis was rolling in the second quarter, building a 17-point lead. The Grizzlies were still up 13, when Mario Chalmers got a steal and passed the ball ahead to a streaking Ben McLemore. With the crowd rising, McLemore went for a 360-degree dunk -- and clanged it off the back of the rim. The Raptors went on a 15-5 run after that. ""Ben has made that play probably a hundred times in his career,"" Bickerstaff said. ""But that this moment, everything needs to be certain. VanVleet said: ""If he makes it -- whatever -- it's a cool highlight. But it's one of those things you don't want to do in a game. He might do it again, but he'll probably think twice.""","400975122"
"MILWAUKEE --  All Khris Middleton needed to get going on offense was to create a little space. Once Middleton's first couple shots started falling, he was tough to stop , especially in front of a friendly crowd in a tight game in the fourth quarter. Middleton scored 12 of his 31 points in the final 4:38, Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points and 11 rebounds, and the Milwaukee Bucks rallied for a 109-102 win over the last-place Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. ""Just got into a rhythm really. I was able to create a little space, was able to catch and shoot 3s ... find a rhythm, find an open shot,"" Middleton said. Middleton finished 10 of 18 from the field, including 5 of 6 in the fourth. The 6-foot-8 forward is a tough matchup because of his length and shooting ability, especially when paired with the athletic Antetokounmpo in the frontcourt. Eric Bledsoe added 24 points for the Bucks, who erased an 11-point deficit late in the third quarter to pick up their fifth win in six games. The Bucks then turned up the defensive pressure during a chippy final few minutes, highlighted by Middleton's four-point play sandwiched between two Dallas turnovers. ""A lot of his points down the stretch came off situations where we weren't executing well offensively and gave them some downhill momentum,"" Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. But the worst team in the Western Conference didn't wither on the road against an East contender. The Mavericks played the Bucks tough until the end, as they did in a loss to the Boston Celtics on Wednesday. Wesley Matthews had a season-high 29 points to lead Dallas. He scored 15 in the first half on 6 of 7 shooting, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range, to give the Mavericks a 54-49 lead going into the locker room. Shooting 6 of 13 (46 percent) from beyond the arc in the half, the Mavs tried to follow a formula similar to their 32-point win over Milwaukee on Nov. 18, when they shot 19 of 38 (50 percent) from 3-point range. This time, the Bucks answered with clutch jumpers and improved defense. They used a 12-0 late in the third quarter sparked by two 3s from Middleton and the playmaking ability of Malcolm Brogdon to take a 77-76 lead after looking lethargic for much of the game. ""In that first half we kind of fell into the trap of them walking the ball up and kind of were just going through the motions,"" coach Jason Kidd said. BACK IN TOWN Matthews returned to the Bradley Center, which is also the home court of his alma mater, Marquette. He finished 11 of 15 from the field. It wasn't a happy homecoming after the Bucks pulled away in the fourth quarter. STAT LINES The teams combined for 60 foul shots, with the Bucks going 29 of 34 at the line, while the Mavericks were 22 of 26. ... Harrison Barnes added 18 points and eight rebounds for Dallas. OFF THE BENCH Thon Maker (eight rebounds, two blocks) and DeAndre Liggins (five rebounds, two steals) provided valuable minutes off the bench, combining with sixth man Brogdon to give the Bucks a lift during the third-quarter push. TIP-INS Mavericks: Rookie G Dennis Smith Jr. missed the game with a strained left hip after getting hurt during Wednesday's loss to the Celtics. Dallas' first-round draft pick is also expected to miss Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're just unlucky. He came in, slid in, landed into a cameraman and kind of took his leg out,"" Carlisle said. ""We're hoping it's not serious."" Bucks: G Tony Snell missed the game with left knee tendinitis. G Matthew Dellavedova (left knee) appears to be getting closer to returning. He was questionable coming into Friday but was scratched before the game. The team said Snell and Dellavedova would be questionable for Saturday's game against Utah. ... G Gary Payton II replaced Snell in the starting lineup but played just 5 minutes, with Brogdon (14 points) starting the second half and playing 40 minutes overall.","400975123"
"NEW ORLEANS --  DeMarcus Cousins looked like he was going to haunt his former team again. But the other main piece in the trade that brought Cousins to New Orleans ended up making the biggest play on Friday night. Buddy Hield scored eight points down the stretch, including a 3-pointer with 34 seconds left that forced overtime, and the Sacramento Kings beat the Pelicans 116-109. Zach Randolph made two of his career-high five 3-pointers to start overtime and finished with a season-high 35 points. He also had 13 rebounds. ""When you're hot, you're hot,"" Kings guard De'Aaron Fox said. ""(Randolph) hit corner 3s, off balance, getting fouled. They were going in. He just had one of those games."" Hield finished with 18 points off the bench, Fox added 14 points and Frank Mason III scored 12 for the Kings, who won for just the fourth time in 15 road games this season. Cousins led New Orleans with 38 points and 11 rebounds, but in the fourth quarter and overtime he had just five points, making 2 of 12 shots and missing all five 3-point attempts. Cousins had 41 points and 23 rebounds in a victory over the Kings in Sacramento in October. ""I don't think we had a sense of urgency the entire night,"" Cousins said. ""We just kind of coasted through this game and we gave this team life. We had plenty of opportunities to put the game away and we just wouldn't put our foot on the pedal full-throttle."" Anthony Davis, returning from a three-game absence with an adductor strain, had 18 points. Ian Clark had a season-high 15 points in his first start, and Jrue Holiday scored 14. Randolph made two 3-pointers to help give Sacramento a 110-105 lead with 3:13 left in overtime. The second 3-pointer came with the shot clock winding down and Randolph fading out of bounds while shooting over Jameer Nelson, who's nine inches shorter than Randolph. ""I just saw the clock going down and tried to get my feet set,"" Randolph said. ""Jameer's strong, but kind of short, so I was able to shoot over him."" Holiday made a jumper, but Fox made two free throws and Mason scored on a drive for a seven-point lead with 58 seconds left. ""They outplayed us in every phase of the game,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""They outplayed us. They just kept playing and they played for the forty-eight minutes. They got it into overtime and they outplayed us."" Cousins scored 15 points in the second quarter, and the Pelicans led by six at the half. Randolph scored 10 points as the Kings pulled even at 77 late in the third quarter. The Pelicans went ahead by 10 early in the fourth as Clark and Darius Miller scored the first two baskets and Dante Cunningham added a 3-pointer. Sacramento cut the lead to five midway through the quarter, but Davis answered with four consecutive points. The Kings pulled within 100-99 on Randolph's drive with 1:07 left. Cousins got free for a dunk and a three-point lead with 49 seconds left before Hield tied it with his 3-pointer. ""I made some shots,"" Hield said. ""We all did our part. (Randolph) made plays. (Mason) made plays in the overtime. It was a great team effort."" TIP-INS Kings: Randolph missed a baseline jumper just before the final buzzer, and Vince Carter rebounded the miss and dunked just after the buzzer. ... The Kings' bench outscored the Pelicans' bench, 53-16. ... Sacramento finished its trip 2-2. Pelicans: The Pelicans beat the Kings 114-106 on Oct. 26 in Sacramento as Cousins had 41 points and 23 rebounds. ... New Orleans made 17 of 19 free throws. ...

He had started the last 11 games at point guard. In those games, Holiday averaged 20 points while starting at shooting guard. Clark started in Rondo's place.","400975124"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Boston Celtics are flush with young talent, but those youthful legs were done in by a 40-year-old Spurs veteran fresh from a ""killer nap."" Manu Ginobili, who has teetered on the brink of retirement the past two offseasons, hit a high-arcing 3-pointer with 5 seconds remaining and San Antonio beat Boston 105-102 on Friday night, snapping the Celtics' four-game winning streak. ""Like he told me a lot of years ago, `This is what I do,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He's amazing. He loves those moments and he's come through an awful lot and he did it again tonight. At age 40."" The veteran's heroics enabled San Antonio to escape Kyrie Irving's 36-point effort for Boston. ""I said before the game he's probably the best player, one of the best players, at the end of quarters I've ever seen,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""Now I wish I hadn't said it."" Ginobili rose earlier than normal on game day to enjoy a rare snowstorm in San Antonio with his family, but he recovered by taking a refreshing nap. The added sleep was beneficial as Ginobili set up the winning basket by sprinting into the paint for an offensive rebound with 25.8 seconds left. He eventually was able to get Boston rookie Jayson Tatum to switch off him defensively, allowing him to shoot a rainbow shot over a charging Al Horford. ""Horford contested great, I just gave him a little more air,"" Ginobili said. ""Shot it higher and it just went in. I think I got even a little lucky because it's not my usual shot. I had to shoot it higher."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 27 points and 10 rebounds for San Antonio. Irving, who scored a career-high 57 points against San Antonio in 2015 while with Cleveland, created havoc again at the AT&amp;T Center. Irving finished 13 for 21, including 6 for 10 on 3-pointers, but missed his final two 3s. His final 3-point attempt rattled in and out as the buzzer sounded. ""I thought it was cash money,"" Irving said of his final attempt. ""I thought it was going to hit the bottom of the net, and I obviously didn't put enough on it. It was a good play call, you know just happens. I'm just going to replay it, probably for about 33 more minutes, then I'll be over it."" The Spurs, already without Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Anderson, lost Danny Green in the first half. Green left with tightness in his left groin. There was no update on the severity of the injury, but Popovich said he doesn't expect him to travel with the team for their upcoming road trip. ""We've got to remember we played the best team in the league so far, the best defense in the league without Kawhi, without Tony in the last few minutes and without Danny in the second half,"" Ginobili said. ""Danny, for us, is a key player. We fought hard, we stayed in the game and then it was a lottery."" Pau Gasol had 14 points and 11 rebounds, Rudy Gay had 15 points, and Tony Parker added 11 for the Spurs, who are undefeated with Parker in the lineup through six games. San Antonio held Boston to one field goal in the opening 4 minutes of the final quarter to erase a five-point deficit and set up the last-second dramatics. Tatum had 20 points, and Jaylen Brown added 15 for the Celtics. TIP-INS Celtics: Forward Marcus Morris was listed as questionable while rehabilitating his left knee, but felt comfortable enough during pre-game warmups to play. Morris finished with five points in 25 minutes after being listed. ... Boston suffered its first loss to a Western Conference team after winning eight straight. ... The Celtics are 10-3 on the road, trailing only Houston (11-1) and Golden State (11-3) for the league's best road record. Spurs: Popovich would not confirm a report by the San Antonio Express-News that Leonard will make his season debut Saturday in Phoenix. ""Sooner rather than later,"" Popovich said, repeating the answer he has given all season about the All-Star forward's return. ... Parker has played 36,000 career minutes as a starter, 24th in league history. ... Ginobili has played 26,000 minutes in his career, all with the Spurs, the fourth most in franchise history behind Tim Duncan, Parker and David Robinson. ... Green has 500 steals and 401 blocks in his career. Green, LeBron James and Kevin Durant are the only players since 2009 with 500 steals, 400 blocks and 800 3-pointers.","400975125"
"LOS ANGELES --  The way things have been going for the struggling Clippers, it figures a wild finish involving an arcane clock rule would be the way they'd finally win again. Lou Williams hit a go-ahead pull-up 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds remaining, lifting Los Angeles to a 113-112 victory over the Washington Wizards on Saturday to end a four-game skid. ""Nothing has been easy,"" coach Doc Rivers said. With Bradley Beal guarding him, Williams unleashed the winner from the top of the key, capping a wild final 12 seconds in which both teams traded leads on clutch plays. ""I made a move and Bradley bit on it,"" Williams said. ""I was able to pull up with one dribble. If I go left, I like my chances."" After Williams' basket, the Wizards called a timeout. They inbounded the ball on the sideline with 1.2 seconds left and Beal hit the potential winning baseline jumper, which was waived off because the game clock started a couple tenths of a second too soon. After a video review, the referees decided to give Washington possession for a replay, except the Wizards inbounded in the left corner with 1.1 seconds on the clock. Marcin Gortat's jumper bounced off the rim as time expired. Crew chief Bill Spooner told a pool reporter after the game that the referees incorrectly reset the shot clock to 1.1 seconds instead of 0.1. Spooner said the location of the inbounds changed to the point of interruption where Beal caught the ball. ""We had a clock malfunction, early start,"" Spooner said in a statement. ""The time that they lost was 1.1. With an inbounds at 1.2 that leaves, mathematically, 0.1 and that should have been where we reset it. We actually made the mistake in their favor if you will, and reset it at 1.1."" Wizards coach Scott Brooks wasn't upset about the mistake. ""I never complain about tough decisions and tough plays at the end of the game that referees have to make,"" he said. Beal called it ""a freak rule"" and said it didn't make sense because the Wizards had his basket taken away. ""We had a great play, now that you take that away that gives the defense a chance to set up now to change some things,"" he said. ""Now we've got to go back and try to change into a different play with the ball in the corner. He said we get the same amount of time, but we didn't get the same amount of time. Then the ball was placed in the corner. So I don't really understand it."" Rivers said he wasn't sure what triggered the review. ""I just wanted it to go in our favor and it did,"" he said. ""We showed a lot of heart."" Williams scored 35 points to lead a dominant bench effort for the Clippers. Their reserves outscored Washington's 59-47. Beal scored 20 of his 25 points in the second half. Otto Porter Jr. had 27 points and 11 rebounds, and Mike Scott had 22 points off the bench for the Southeast Division-leading Wizards. ""This is one of those games that you can't be 100 percent mad because there was so much freak stuff going on at the end of the game it could have played out any way,"" Beal said. Austin Rivers hit a 3-pointer from the right wing, putting the Clippers ahead 110-109 with 12 seconds left after he missed a 3 in the right corner and Los Angeles controlled the rebound. ""I thought that was going to be the one that won it,"" Williams said. Beal completed a three-point play with 8 seconds remaining to put the Wizards back in front, 112-110. That set up Williams' winning shot after the Clippers had blown a 14-point lead in the third quarter. Both teams were missing injured stars: John Wall for the Wizards and Blake Griffin for the Clippers. Neither team led by more than four points in the fourth. Beal got loose for 16 points in the third. He made four 3-pointers before Porter pulled the Wizards into a 75-all tie on a free throw. The last 1 1/2 minutes turned into a 3-point shootout between Williams and Scott. Each of them hit two 3s and Williams added another basket to give the Clippers an 85-81 lead going into the fourth. SWEET LOU Williams is the NBA's leading scorer off the bench and he's been on a roll in his last six games, scoring at least 18 points in each of them. It's the most dominant run of his career that he can recall. STRANGE START In an omen to the strangeness of the game, the referees called a foul on the opening tip. ""That was the first time I saw that,"" said Beal, a six-year veteran. ""Why was it a foul versus a re-jumped ball or just their ball?"" STREAKING The Clippers have won 15 of their last 18 against the Wizards dating to March 18, 2009, including 10 in a row at Staples Center, which is the second-longest active home winning streak against a single opponent. TIP-INS Wizards: Wall missed his eighth straight game with a sore left knee. Coach Scott Brooks said Wall practiced Friday and responded well. He will practice again on Monday and be monitored day-to-day. Clippers: G Milos Teodosic sat out his 22nd straight game because of a left foot injury. He practiced Friday, worked out Saturday and will work again Sunday. Coach Doc Rivers said if Teodosic can get through all that, there's a chance he could play.","400975126"
"MEXICO CITY --  The Miami Heat spent a lot of time in the last couple of days as a group of tourists in Mexico City. When they got back in the court, they were all business. Goran Dragic and Tyler Johnson each scored 20 points and Miami beat the Brooklyn Nets 101-89 on Saturday in the Heat's first game in Mexico in franchise history. Playing in front of 19,777 fans at raucous Arena Ciudad de Mexico -- and with former Heat star Chris Bosh courtside, around the team for a game for the first time in well over a year -- Dragic was 9 of 19 from the field and had seven rebounds for Miami. The Heat snapped a two-game losing streak to improve to 12-13. ""It was a terrific and easy trip coming down from San Antonio, we had a day off to go out and see the city, you don't travel all this way to watch TV in your room, I'm going to need to get on a diet after this trip,"" said Miami coach Erik Spoelstra, who said he visited as many cafes as possible. ""It was fun but then we got back to work and we prepared good for tonight's game."" James Johnson added 17 points, Justise Winslow had 15 and Kelly Olynyk 11 for Miami. The Heat rallied from two seven-point deficits, using a stingy defense that allowed only 36 points in the second half. ""It was a great game for us, especially on the defensive end,"" Dragic said. ""Tyler played great and the second unit gave us the extra boost that we needed, we have a deep bench and everybody can play."" Miami arrived Wednesday night after a loss in San Antonio. The players had a video session the day after and Spoelstra left them visit the city the rest of the day. Most of the players and coaches went shopping and sightseeing in Polanco, an upscale neighborhood in the capital. ""The fans are terrific, it's a great environment,"" Spoelstra said. ""I was pleasantly surprised walking around and seeing NBA games on the T.V. everywhere we went, and the fans recognized us, it felt like we were in Miami"". By arriving two days ahead of the game, the Heat had a chance to know the city but it came with a price because they struggled early in the game with the altitude. Mexico City's 7,350 feet above sea level is at a far higher elevation than Denver -- the NBA's highest venue at 5,280 feet. Professional teams try different approaches to avoid the effects of the altitude on the body and usually, arriving as close to a game as possible is regarded as the way to go. ""It was tough, it feels like we played two games, but `Spo' (Spoelstra) did a great job rotating so we could stay fresh,"" Dragic said. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson led the Nets with 18 points. Coming off a 100-95 victory over Oklahoma City on Thursday night in the Mexico City opener, the Nets dropped to 10-15. In the third quarter, the Nets took a seven-point lead on Tyler Zeller's layup, but Dragic sealed a 10-2 run to give Miami a 60-59 lead and the Heat took a 75-72 advantage into the final period. BOSH COURTSIDE Bosh was warmly welcomed by his former club. Bosh and his wife Adrienne got long hugs from Spoelstra, and Bosh interacted with players throughout the night. Bosh's career with the Heat was cut short by recurring bouts with blood clots. ""He looks good,"" Spoelstra said, according to The Palm Beach Post. ""His family, his kids are doing well. I love CB. He's Heat family for life."" Bosh even did one of his trademark videobombs during the televised postgame interview with Winslow, drawing laughs. REGULAR VISITORS The game between the Heat and the Nets was the fourth in Mexico this year. It marks the first time the NBA has hosted four international regular-season games in the same country in one calendar year (outside Canada). In January, the Phoenix Suns played the Dallas Mavericks and the San Antonio Spurs. Also, the game was the 26th south of the border since 1992, also a record for any nation besides the U.S. and Canada. INCHING ON RILEY Spoelstra (452-295) is two wins short from tying Pat Riley (454-395) for the most wins in Heat history. Spoelstra is the only second active coach in the NBA to record at least 450 wins with their current team. The other one is Gregg Popovich. FEELING THE HEAT The Nets suffered their sixth straight loss to the Heat. Brooklyn has not beaten Miami since Dec. 28, 2015.","400975127"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Jordan Clarkson believes he's figured out the key to his NBA success: fried chicken and scary movies. The 25-year-old Clarkson said he brought some food into a movie theater and just chilled out on his night off between games -- and it helped him immensely. ""I've got to start eating more fried chicken the day before a game,"" he joked. Whatever it was, Clarkson turned in one of his best games with the Los Angeles Lakers, scoring 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter of a 110-99 win over the fatigued and short-handed Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night. Clarkson was so hot that he played the entire fourth period while rookie point guard Lonzo Ball sat out. Ball finished with five points and nine assists after turning in perhaps his most complete game Wednesday night against Philadelphia, when he had 10 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, three steals and four blocks in a 107-104 victory. Ball didn't seem to mind. ""That's what the team is for,"" he said. ""JC came in and he was cooking tonight."" Brandon Ingram added 18 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 15 for the Lakers, who have won two straight after losing five in a row. ""It doesn't matter who comes in, who finishes the game -- we support each other and throughout the game everyone made huge contributions,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""At the end, that group had it rolling. So I was planning on throwing `Zo and Brook (Lopez) back in the game but because of the way the momentum was going, we stuck with the group that was out there and they got the job done for us."" Kemba Walker scored 23 points and Dwight Howard had 21 points and 12 rebounds for the injury-riddled Hornets, who have lost seven of eight. The Lakers led by one entering the fourth but went on a run midway through the quarter to push the margin to 15. Clarkson beat Walker on a backdoor cut for a jam, Caldwell-Pope knocked down a 3-pointer and Julius Randle scored on a layup and drew a foul. Ingram's tip-in off his own missed layup and Clarkson's floater increased the Lakers' lead to 14 with four minutes remaining. The Hornets had no legs left to challenge. The Lakers outscored Charlotte 28-17 in the final 9 1/2 minutes. TIP-INS Lakers: Scored 28 points off fast breaks. ... Their bench outscored the Hornets' reserves 53-31. ... Shot 50.6 percent from the field. ... Walton was assessed a technical foul in the first half. Hornets: Walker and Howard were both assessed technical fouls. ... Howard has 14 double-doubles this season. ... Johnny O'Bryant had 11 points and seven rebounds. HORNETS INJURIES The Hornets played without three key reserves out due to injuries -- Cody Zeller (meniscus tear in knee), Frank Kaminsky (sprained ankle) and Jeremy Lamb (bruised shin) -- one night after four of their five starters played more than 40 minutes in an overtime loss to Chicago. To make matters worse, starter Nic Batum re-aggravated his left elbow against the Lakers and left the game early. ""The injury situation we have is pretty dire right now,"" said associate head coach Stephen Silas, who is filling in for coach Steve Clifford while he deals with a health issue. ""I mean, that's four of your top eight guys that are out there. So yeah, it was a tough one."" KUZMA STEPS UP Walton was thrilled with the play of Kyle Kuzma, who had 12 points and 14 rebounds. He was able to play more of his natural power forward position than in previous games. ""He was active on the rebounding glass and had a big block for us when we were making our run,"" Walton said. ""He's a rookie and we are throwing him between multiple positions, which down the road is going to be great for him that he knows how to play both positions. But for now it is already tough enough in this league and I think he feels more comfortable at the 4 right now.""","400975128"
"ATLANTA --  Ersan Ilyasova was flawless almost from start to finish Saturday night, and Kent Bazemore was perfect in the final minute for the Atlanta Hawks. They needed it to overcome Nikola Vucevic's first career triple-double. Pretty as it was to watch Ilyasova score 26 points while making all nine of his shots, including five 3-pointers, Bazemore stole the show in scoring six points in an 18-second span in the final minute -- four on dunks after steals -- in Atlanta's 117-110 vicrtory over Orlando. The game was tied at 110 before Bazemore, a forward known for his defense, did his thing. Twice he picked off Magic passes and quickly threw them down. ""We made winning plays in the last 90 seconds,"" said Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer. ""Kent Bazemore . . . his activity, his competitiveness. ... Obviously, the steal in the middle of the court, but the activity, length, and arms on the inbounds makes it difficult (on the Magic)."" The Hawks (6-19) needed something special to win for the second time in six games, even though the Magic (12-17) lacked their two leading scorers. Aaron Gordon (18.5 points per game) suffered a concussion in Friday's loss to the Nuggets, and Evan Fournier (18.3) remained sidelined with a sprained ankle. Still, Orlando took the lead three times in the fourth quarter and the Hawks -- with three injured big men inactive -- had no answer for Vucevic as he registered game highs with 31 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. The 7-foot center made 4 of 6 3-pointers. Plus, Johnathan Simmons added a career-high 29 points for Orlando. Ilyasova scored 10 of Atlanta's first 14 points and had 13 in the first period. He was irked about missing 2-of-4 free throws in the fourth quarter. Ilyasova made his only free throw before that, added four assists and three rebounds and did not turn the ball over. ""Not really,"" Ilyasova said when asked if he had a special feeling going into the game. ""It was one of those nights, I guess. Obviously, everybody came out with a lot of energy. You have to give them credit; the Magic obviously (had) a back-to-back. ""We kind of knew we had to go at them at the beginning of the game . . . those free throws, I was kind of disappointed."" Atlanta shot 51.2 percent in the game, and tied a season high with 17 made 3-pointers on 33 attempts. Bazemore (19 points) made three 3-pointers, and point guard Dennis Schroeder added 18 points with seven assists. Schroeder tied the game with a pair of free throws at the 56-second mark. Then, Bazemore happened. He stole a pass from Simmons to Vucevic and took it two-thirds of the court to dunk for the lead with 36 seconds remaining. ""Bazemore made huge plays; a lot of credit to them,"" Vucevic said. ""That was a big play by him, to time that right."" After he was fouled following his rebound of an airball by former Hawk Shelvin Mack, Bazemore added a pair of free throws with 21 seconds left, and Orlando head coach Frank Vogel called timeout. Next, Bazemore stole Mack's inbounds pass from the sideline, and again raced for a dunk with 18 seconds left to put away the Magic. TIP-INS Magic: Vucevic on back-to-back nights combined for 52 points and 30 rebounds after scoring 21 points and grabbing a season-high 17 rebounds in a loss to Denver. . . . In Gordon's place, 6-foot-8 guard/forward Mario Hezonja made his first start. The native of Croatia scored seven points and on 3-of-9 shooting. . . . Orlando had a season-high 39 assists. Hawks: Once again without injured big men Mike Muscala (left ankle sprain), John Collins (sprained shoulder) and Dewayne Dedmon (left tibia stress reaction), the Hawks started Miles Plumlee at center. He finished with three points and three rebounds. . . . Reserve forwards Marco Belinelli (13 points) and rookie Tyler Cavanaugh (14 points) each made three 3-pointers. ABOUT FREE THROWS Magic head coach Frank Vogel surely wasn't happy about the disparity at the free throw line, where the Hawks made 18 of 25 to his team's 7 of 8. ""No comment,"" he said. ""Look, we played hard and played the right way. I'm proud of the effort.""","400975129"
"CLEVELAND --  LeBron James made certain the Cavaliers' losing ways lasted only one day. James had his 58th career triple-double and Cleveland rallied in the fourth quarter to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 105-98 on Saturday night. James had 30 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists to help the Cavaliers bounce back from a loss in Indiana on Friday night that ended their 13-game winning streak. The Cavaliers didn't arrive in Cleveland until 4.a.m. after their flight from Indianapolis was delayed. Cleveland surged ahead after falling behind 18-7 and built a double-figure lead in the second and third quarters, but trailed again in the fourth. ""This is a big win for us,"" James said. ""After everything that we went through last night, your whole day is kind of just screwed up. For us to come out here and be professionals -- nobody's going to feel sorry for you -- everyone just gave what they had and we were very resilient, have a lot of resolve."" In what has become almost a nightly occurrence, James took over with the game on the line, scoring or assisting on Cleveland's last 22 points. ""I started the game 3 for 11, was missing some chippies,"" he said. ""I don't need to score to be productive and to help win a game. I just stay with it. That's a crazy stat, though. I didn't know that, that's for sure."" ""He went 9 for 23 with six turnovers, but he is still that good where he puts his thumbprint on the game the way he did,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""He's very unique."" Sixers forward Robert Covington fell into Cleveland's bench trying to save a loose ball with just over a minute to play. He landed on the metal flooring behind the bench and was down for a couple of minutes before being helped to his feet and to the locker room. Covington was being treated in the trainer's room following the game. Brown said he injured his lower back and right hip. A timeout was called following the play and it took a few moments before anyone realized Covington was injured. ""I was just shocked because I didn't know he went down,"" 76ers rookie Ben Simmons said. ""I just spoke with him and hopefully he'll be all right."" Asked if Covington will play Sunday against New Orleans, Brown said, ""I can't assume anything, but it would seem like he's a no-go."" Simmons' breakaway dunk gave Philadelphia a 96-91 lead, but the Cavaliers ended the game on a 14-2 run. James converted a three-point play and Kyle Korver hit a 3-pointer, giving Cleveland the lead. Dwyane Wade added two baskets and Jae Crowder's 3-pointer put the Cavaliers ahead 104-98. Covington and J.J. Redick scored 19 points each for Philadelphia. Both starting centers missed the game. Joel Embiid sat out for Philadelphia because he hasn't been cleared to play on back-to-back nights and Kevin Love didn't play because of a sore left hip. Wade, Korver and Crowder each scored 13 points for Cleveland. Simmons had 14 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists for the Sixers. Sixers forward Dario Saric, who scored 17 points, wore goggles because a left eye laceration and a corneal abrasion of his right eye. BIG MAN BREAK Brown said Embiid, who is averaging 23.5 points and 11.1 rebounds, will play Sunday against the Pelicans. ""It's disappointing that Cleveland fans aren't going to be able to see a very unique player,"" Brown said before the game. Philadelphia plays again in Cleveland on March 1. TIP-INS 76ers: Rookie G Markelle Fultz is no longer experiencing soreness in his right shoulder. The No. 1 overall draft pick, who has only played in four games, will increase his on-court workouts over the next three weeks. ... G T.J. McConnell (sprained AC joint in left shoulder) was also out. ... G Justin Anderson (left shin splints) will be re-evaluated in two weeks.

"CHICAGO --  Kris Dunn is a key piece of the Chicago Bulls' rebuilding effort. He wants to be a key to the team's success. Dunn made two free throws with 2.9 seconds left to give the Bulls a 104-102 victory over the New York Knicks on Saturday night. Coach Fred Hoiberg put the ball in Dunn's hands during the final possession and the second-year point guard was fouled by Courtney Lee while driving to the basket. ""I want to be a leader for my team and I want to make the big plays,"" Dunn said. ""I know we have multiple guys who can make plays, but I definitely want to be one of them."" Following a timeout, the Knicks -- who scored 10 straight points to tie it at 102 -- had a chance to tie or take the lead, but Kristaps Porzingis missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Nikola Mirotic, in just his second game of the season, had 19 points to help Chicago win its second straight. Dunn finished with 17 points, nine assists and seven rebounds, and Luari Markkanen and David Nwaba had 15 points apiece. Nwaba had 11 points in the fourth quarter. ""I'm proud of the guys for finding a way to hang on there,"" Hoiberg said. Porzingis had 23 points for New York. The Knicks are 1-8 on the road. ""I feel like I let my teammates down, and I'm not talking about the last shot but in general the whole game,"" Porzingis said. ""We have to play at a better level and I have to play at a better level from the beginning."" After snapping a 10-game losing streak Friday night in Charlotte, the Bulls didn't arrive back in Chicago until about five hours before game time because of weather-related delays. But they jumped out to a 19-6 lead and rallied after New York took a 70-68 lead into the fourth quarter. ""The game was lost way in the beginning,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""They're a team that had travel issues. We come out not ready to play, let them get out to a big lead. They showed some fight at the end. We've got to come out at the beginning of the game. That's a mental preparation thing that we talked about."" Knicks: C Enes Kanter injured his hip late in the game, but said he will be fine to play on Sunday . C Joakim Noah, who spent the first nine seasons of his career in Chicago, was inactive even though he is not injured. Noah has been inactive or has not played in four of the last five games. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. (stress injury, lower left leg) remains in a walking boot. ""We're going to reevaluate in two weeks,"" GM Scott Perry said. ""I'm optimistic that we're doing all the right things and eventually he's going to be OK."" Bulls: Markkanen was 15 for 51 (29.4 percent) from the field in the previous three games before going 8 for 15 against Charlotte on Friday. ""The biggest thing about him, even when he was struggling, he kept a smile on his face, he still came in to work every day and I could tell he didn't lose any confidence at all,"" Hoiberg said. ""For a 20-year-old to have that mentality is pretty impressive."" PERFECT The Bulls are 5-20, but 2-0 with Mirotic. ""I said to (assistant) Randy Brown on Friday that we were going to win,"" Mirotic said. ""He said, `Why?' I said, `Because I'm back.' I said we were going to win again today."" DELAYED The winter storm moving across the Eastern portion of the country this weekend created a travel nightmare for the Bulls following the win at Charlotte. The team had to stay over Friday night and didn't land in Chicago until after 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon. ""We all got to the plane and thought we were going to get out of there (on Friday),"" Hoiberg said. ""It sounds like our pilot was on a commercial flight that ended up getting canceled. This morning, the same thing.""","400975131"
"MILWAUKEE --  The game was already well in hand for the Milwaukee Bucks, but a thunderous dunk by Giannis Antetokounmpo in the final minute provided an exclamation point on a successful stretch of three home games in four days. Antetokounmpo finished with 37 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists and the Bucks beat the Utah Jazz 117-100 on Saturday night for their third consecutive victory. Milwaukee is five games over .500 for the first time since Feb. 28, 2015, and is off to its best start through 25 games since also starting 15-10 in the 2005-06 season. ""As a team, we're growing up and understanding what it takes to win in this league,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""It's not easy. The week didn't start off well for us (with a loss to Boston) but we ended it on a positive note. Now we turn the page to another week with another three in four."" The Bucks built a 22-point lead early in the fourth and held on after the Jazz pulled within single digits. Antetokounmpo scored 24 points in the second half, drawing chants of ""MVP! MVP!"" from the home crowd on multiple occasions. Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe each added 20 points. ""Coming out of the half, we talked here in the meeting, we said we got to finish this game and not give them chances,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""So that was what I was trying to do, and that is why I came out playing hard."" Milwaukee led by as many as 16 points in the second quarter before Utah went on a 19-5 run to pull to 44-42 on a pair of free throws by Ricky Rubio with 1:50 until halftime. The Bucks scored the final seven points of the quarter to take a 51-42 advantage into the break. ""They had their way with us early,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""If we start games like that, it is very difficult to come back on the road against a good team."" Milwaukee opened the second half on a 10-3 run and took a 61-45 lead on Antetokounmpo's basket. The Bucks built a 22-point fourth-quarter advantage, but Utah pulled to 95-86 on a 3-pointer by Donovan Mitchell with 4:05 to play. Bledsoe answered with a triple on the other end, and the Bucks closed out the game on a 22-14 run. Rudy Gobert led the Jazz with 20 points and nine rebounds. Alec Burks added 20 points. ""The way we started the game was terrible,"" Mitchell said. ""We came out flat, gave up transition points that we never give up. We just didn't look like us."" TIP-INS Jazz: Guard Rodney Hood missed his seventh straight game with left ankle soreness. ... Guard Raul Neto left the game in the first quarter with concussion-like symptoms and did not return. Bucks: Guard Tony Snell sat out for the second consecutive night with left patella tendinitis. ... Listed as questionable prior to the game, guard Matthew Dellavedova remained out with left knee tendinitis. ...

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Even struggling from the field, Russell Westbrook managed to record a triple-double, and he converted two game-winning free throws in overtime. Westbrook's free throws with 5.2 seconds left gave him 20 points on the night to go with 14 assists and 11 rebounds as the Oklahoma City Thunder rallied for a 102-101 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night. The Thunder overcame a 20-point first-half deficit, the second consecutive game that the Grizzlies have squandered a big lead in a losing effort. Memphis led by 17 against Toronto on Friday night before losing to the Raptors. ""It was the extra kind of urgency,"" said Thunder center Steven Adams, who along with Carmelo Anthony led Oklahoma City with 21 points and nine rebounds each. ""We tried to speed up the game as well with tempo. We were just playing too slow, allowing them to get into their defense. The change of tempo was good."" After chipping into the 20-point Memphis lead, the Thunder still trailed 57-46 at intermission. The change of pace and a defense that allowed the Grizzlies only nine points in the third quarter, helped erase the Memphis lead. The teams were tied at 92 after regulation as Andrew Harrison blocked Westbrook's 3-point attempt at the end of the fourth. Alex Abrines, starting for the injured Paul George, made two 3-pointers in the early stages of overtime to keep Oklahoma City tied with Memphis. Abrines would match Westbrook's 20 points to lead the Thunder -- the 20 points was Abrines' career-high. He converted 6 of 8 from outside the arc. ""I just felt confident this morning,"" Abrines said, ""and I hit the first three (3-pointers) I shot, so that gave me a lot of confidence."" Tyreke Evans led Memphis with 29 points and 13 rebounds, while Marc Gasol finished with 22 points. Ben McLemore contributed a season-best 17 points as the Grizzlies lost their third straight and 14th of the last 15. ""We had our chances. Over and over again, we had our chances,"" Memphis interim coach J. B. Bickerstaff said. ""We can't afford to let these games slip. ""We had our opportunities. We let it slip away from us.""

Westbrook has eight triple-doubles on the season. . The Thunder are 3-10 on the road this season. Grizzlies: F Chandler Parsons did not play, resting on the second night of a back-to-back. ...

CLOSING OUT QUARTERS Oklahoma City cut into Memphis leads with strong final minutes in the second and third quarters. After Memphis took its 20-point lead in the second, the Thunder reeled off 13 straight points to get back in the game before the break. Then, in the third, the Thunder used a 12-3 run to erase an 8-point Memphis lead. BLOWING LEADS The 20-point lead, the biggest of the season for Memphis, disappeared quickly, and despite hanging on for overtime, the Grizzlies again didn't take advantage of the early performance. ""Basketball happened. They made runs,"" Gasol said. FINAL WORD The Grizzlies frustration is in full force. ""We have to figure out a way to close out these games. It's frustrating.

"PHOENIX --  San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich says Bryn Forbes has ""never seen a shot he didn't like."" There was one in particular that both of them must have loved Saturday night. Forbes sank his only 3-pointer of the night with 21.5 seconds to play and the severely depleted Spurs held off a fourth-quarter Phoenix rally to beat the Suns 104-101. ""It was our fifth game in seven nights, on the road, had a back-to-back to end it all,"" Popovich said. ""I thought we were pretty tired, but I thought they hung in as well as they could."" The Spurs left Pau Gasol and Manu Ginobili home to rest after a victory over Boston on Friday night and had Danny Green (left groin tightness) and Kyle Anderson (left MCL sprain) out with injuries. Still, they led by as many as 19 points in the third quarter before the Suns came back to take their first lead of the night, 100-99, on Marquese Chriss' breakaway dunk with 1:32 to go after a San Antonio turnover. Josh Jackson made one of two free throws to boost the Phoenix lead to 101-99 with 29 seconds remaining before Patty Mills got the ball to Forbes, who made his lone 3 in six tries. ""I think every shot is going in,"" Forbes said. ""He (LaMarcus Aldridge) set a great screen and got me wide open. I couldn't have asked for a better screen.  Patty put it right in my shot pocket. That is what he told me to say. He made a great pass."" Phoenix's Mike James scored 25 points, one shy of his career high, but missed a 3-pointer, the Spurs got the rebound and Mills sank two free throws with 1.6 seconds to play. Jared Dudley's 3 from the corner went off the side of the backboard at the buzzer. Mills and Aldridge scored 20 apiece for San Antonio in its fourth straight win and eighth in nine games. T.J. Warren scored 19 of his 24 points in the second half for the Suns, who fell to 0-2 since losing Devin Booker to a left adductor strain that is expected to sideline him two to three weeks. ""Took us 24 minutes to find a group that would play with the right energy,"" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. ""I mean, we just seemed to be a step slow. You know, I was mixing guys in and out trying to look for offense, defense, anything that would give us some juice and finally got it in the second half.""

But Mills made two 3s in the final 10 seconds of the quarter and San Antonio led 79-71 entering the fourth. Warren rattled in a 3 to punctuate another 12-2 surge that made it tied it 94-94 for the first time since it was 2-2. Aldridge said it was good to have to ""learn how to execute down the stretch with different guys."" ""A lot of these guys haven't been in that type of moment, haven't been in the game down the stretch,"" he said.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  The NBA's hottest team has found a home on the road. Houston won its ninth consecutive game after James Harden scored 48 points and the Rockets rallied from 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 124-117 on Saturday night. The Rockets, who trailed for most of the game, won their eighth consecutive road game, running their season road record to 12-1. It is Houston's best road start since the 1996-97 season. Harden hit 16 of 29 shots and grabbed eight rebounds, while Chris Paul scored 24 points and Trevor Ariza had 13 for Houston. The Rockets' 20-4 record is the best by percentage in the NBA this season. ""We're riding high right now. That's great. We know we'll have some bumps. We have a lot of things to figure out, but we just keep getting better and grinding it out,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. Houston took a good punch from Portland, which was trying to end a three-game home court losing streak. Damian Lillard tied a franchise record with nine 3-pointers and scored 35 points, while C.J. McCollum had 28 for the Blazers (13-12). ""It was disappointing to lose. . We had a lot of good efforts from a lot of different players. It was good to be in a game at the end against a really good team,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. Houston hasn't had a close game in a while, particularly with Paul returning to action from an early season knee injury. That changed Saturday as Portland built a 98-84 lead after three quarters, though Lillard started the fourth quarter with an ice bag on his right foot after limping to the bench. Houston went to a small lineup, and punished Portland's defense with 1-on-1 offense. The Rockets hit 15 of 18 shots, and Harden and Paul combined to score 25 of the team's 40 fourth-quarter points. ""Me and James were talking about how cool it was. I went a few times and then he got to go a few times. It was fun that we got to play off of each other like that,"" Paul said. Harden went 6 of 7 during the fourth quarter, including five layups. ""We went small and they had to adjust to us . once they did that, we had shooters on the court and the lane was wide open. So it was layup, layup, layup, 3-ball,"" Harden said. With Lillard's foot on ice, Houston launched a rally, pulling to 103-98 when Lillard returned with 7 minutes remaining. But the Rockets had momentum, and took a 110-109 lead on Ariza's 3-pointer. The Rockets never trailed again, outscoring Portland 14-6 during the final 3 minutes. ""It took everything we had to beat them,"" D'Antoni said. The Blazers, eager not to finish a home stand 0-4, were aggressive early, as Lillard hit two 3-pointers but also drew two fouls during the first 3 minutes. Midway through the first quarter, Lillard stepped in front of Paul and earned a charging foul, touching off a battle of words that resulted in technicals to Portland's Meyers Leonard and Paul. Lillard's 3-pointer gave Portland its largest lead of the first half at 57-46, but Houston outscored the Blazers 16-5 during the final 5:37 to pull even at 62 at halftime. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston is 10-0 with Paul in the lineup. ... Paul missed 14 games with a knee injury. ... Nene returned to action after missing one game with a corneal abrasion. ... Houston plays its next seven games at home. ... Harden has scored at least 20 points in each of Houston's 24 games this season, only the second player to accomplish such a feat since the 1990-91 season. Trail Blazers: Portland had fresh faces in its starting lineup, as Leonard made his first start and guard Evan Turner his second of the season. They were replacements for injured Jusuf Nurkic (ankle) and Maurice Harkless (quad). ... The Blazers hit a season-high nine 3-pointers during the first half. ... Portland begins a five-game trip Monday at Golden State. ROCKETS WIN BIG AT THE LINE Houston piled up a big edge at the free throw line, making 34 of 42 shots, while Portland took only 12 free throws, making nine. ""The disparity was ridiculous,"" Stotts said.","400975135"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Dwane Casey's 500th career game as Toronto's coach had plenty of moments to go sideways, especially after his team let a 15-point lead slip away in the first half. DeMar DeRozan's decision to be more aggressive in the third quarter kept the Raptors on track and they extended their longest winning streak of the season. DeRozan scored 13 of his 25 points in the third quarter and Toronto held off the Sacramento Kings 102-87 on Sunday for its sixth straight victory. Kyle Lowry added 15 points, 12 rebounds and six assists on an off-night shooting, Serge Ibaka scored 20 points, and CJ Miles had 11 for the Raptors. They won for the first time in Sacramento since 2014. ""That's something we've got to fight for is consistency and make sure it doesn't become a habit,"" Casey said, referring to Toronto's blown early lead. ""We've got to fight that. But I thought our defense carried us when we couldn't make shots."" Toronto led by 17-2 four minutes into the first quarter, but couldn't shake the Kings until the third when DeRozan repeatedly got into the lane and to the free throw line. He also made two late baskets in the fourth after Sacramento pulled to 90-83. DeRozan shot 9 of 15 and was 7 of 11 on free throws while going over the 12,000-point mark for his career. He went into the day six points shy of the milestone. ""Just being aggressive, picking and choosing my spots, understanding my knack of trying to get to the free throw line, when I can get to the free throw line,"" DeRozan said. ""That's all that was, me understanding the moment."" That helped extend Toronto's longest winning streak of the season and ended a four-game skid against Sacramento. Casey is the winningest coach in franchise history. ""That means you're old,"" Casey said."" The teams will meet again in Toronto next Sunday. Zach Randolph had 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Kings, and Buddy Hield added 17 points. Two days after an overtime road victory in New Orleans, Sacramento couldn't sustain the momentum and dug a hole with eight turnovers in the first quarter. Toronto scored the first 13 points and led 17-2 on DeRozan's short jumper four minutes into the first quarter. Sacramento cut it to five going into the second and went ahead 29-28 on Frank Mason's two free throws with 8:06 left before the Raptors went on another run late to go up 54-46 at halftime. The Kings cut it to 67-64 on Bogdan Bogdanovic's 3-pointer midway through the third, but Lowry scored on a three-point play, added a 16-foot baseline jumper and made two free throws to help the Raptors pull away Sacramento committed 21 turnovers, leading to 27 points for Toronto. ""We struggled to score the basketball and our turnovers were a big Achilles heel for us,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""Their veterans All-Stars were terrific for them and kind of handled the game."" ON A ROLL The six-game winning streak matches Toronto's longest since it won 11 straight during the 2015-16 season. The Raptors had a pair of six-game streaks last season. GOING DEEP Jakob Poeltl made his first career 3-pointer to open the fourth quarter for the Raptors. The ninth overall pick in 2016, Poeltl hadn't even attempted a shot beyond the arc before Sunday. ""That's what we do. That's our secret weapon,"" Lowry said. TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry shot 4 of 17 and was 3 of 12 beyond the arc. . It was the first time that DeRozan won a game in Sacramento. Kings: Hield scored 14 points in the first half on 6-of-8 shooting. ... Bogdanovic started in place of George Hill, who was out because of personal reasons. ... Willie Cauley-Stein did not play because of a lingering sore back he initially hurt in Milwaukee on Dec. 2. ... Sacramento had eight turnovers in the first quarter.","400975136"
"DETROIT --  The Boston Celtics prevented Andre Drummond from scoring in the paint and quieted Reggie Jackson on the perimeter. That helped Boston get revenge from a rare loss in a 91-81 win over the Detroit Pistons on Sunday. When Detroit beat the Celtics last month, Drummond scored 26 points and Jackson had 20. In the rematch, Drummond didn't make a shot until late in the game and finished with just six points on 1-of-5 shooting while Jackson was 0 for 9 with two points. ""We were locked in,"" said Boston center Aron Baynes said. ""Our offense wasn't as crisp as we wanted it to be, but defensively we had a game plan and we stuck with it. We were trying to pack the paint and make them make plays from the outside. Last time, they really had whatever they wanted inside the paint."" The Eastern Conference-leading Celtics bounced back from a loss Friday night at San Antonio, extending their feat of losing consecutive games only once this season. ""We responded not only to that loss at home (to Detroit), but also to the tough Spurs loss,"" said Boston's Kyrie Irving, who scored 16 points. ""We want to continue to build character and identity for our team and be responsive with a quick turnaround."" Al Horford had 18 points, Jaylen Brown scored 12, reserve Marcus Smart also had 12 points and smooth-shooting rookie Jayson Tatum scored 11 for the Celtics. Tatum made a 3-pointer late to help hold off a potential comeback by the Pistons, putting Boston ahead by eight points with 1:55 left. Boston shut down the Pistons' offense after giving up a season-high 118 points on 52 percent shooting in the loss to them. On Sunday, the Celtics held Detroit to a season low in points and forced it to miss two-thirds of its shots. Baynes kept a hand, arm or shoulder on Drummond while defending him, keeping him out of the lane as much as possible. ""They never took a body off him, and we could never take advantage of it,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""He got shots for other guys, but we didn't make any of them."" The Pistons have lost six straight for the first time since late in the 2014-15 season. ""We've lost some confidence and we need to get it back,"" Van Gundy said. ""We knew we were going to play a month unlike anyone else in the NBA, and we started it well, but now it has gotten bad."" TIP-INS Celtics: Marcus Morris, who was acquired in last summer's trade with Detroit for Bradley, didn't play and is expected to sit out the next game before having his left knee evaluated in Boston. ... Horford left the game briefly in the first half, favoring his right leg as he limped off the court. ""I just banged knees,"" Horford said. Pistons: Tobias Harris scored 19, reserve Anthony Tolliver had 15 points and Avery Bradley scored 12 against his former team. Ish Smith added 11 points off the bench, taking advantage of an opportunity to play in place of the cold-shooting Jackson. ""We had a lot of open shots, but I think someone put a lid on the basket,"" Jackson said. ""I couldn't get anything to go down."" HE SAID IT ""My job is to be a truth teller for these guys,"" Van Gundy said. ""When they were 10-3, they weren't as good as everyone was saying. And now that they have lost six straight, they aren't as bad as everyone is saying.""","400975137"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo is enjoying his return to Indiana. Oladipo, who starred in college at Indiana University, had a career-high 47 points and added seven rebounds and six assists to lead the Pacers to a 126-116 overtime win over the Denver Nuggets on Sunday. The Pacers trailed 114-106 with 2:54 remaining in the fourth before scoring eight straight points, capped by Thad Young's putback with 5 seconds left to tie it. Then, Indiana got the first nine points in overtime to secure its fourth straight win -- all at home -- while outscoring the Nuggets 12-2 in the extra period. ""These fans are incredible. It's like I never left,"" Oladipo said. ""In college it was the same way. It's pretty awesome to play in front of them."" On a night where most will remember all the baskets Oladipo made, the most crucial of his plays came with his drive to the basket with 7 seconds left that pulled defenders away from the rim and allowed Young to tip in his miss. ""(Victor) drove to the basket, got guys to bite and commit and I was just in position to get the rebound,"" Young said. ""We started to pressure up (in overtime) and started to get back to Pacers basketball."" Myles Turner finished with 24 points and eight rebounds, and Lance Stephenson had 12 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Pacers. Oladipo's made six 3-pointers with the biggest coming with 2:10 to play in the third quarter to give Indiana its first lead of the game. After the final buzzer, Oladipo walked to mid-court, standing along the sideline passing out high-fives to Pacers fans who found little optimism less than six months ago when Paul George was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Domantas Sabonis and Oladipo. Averaging just over 24 points per game, Oladipo now has his career high in points while wearing an Indiana uniform. ""The players in this locker room have been phenomenal,"" Oladipo said. ""They just make the game easier for me."" Wilson Chandler keyed a hot start for Denver by scoring eight of the Nuggets' first 10 points on the way to a 35-22 lead heading into the second quarter. And that deficit grew. Indiana trailed by as many as 19 in the second quarter after a slow start on offense. But the key moment of the game came near the end of the first half when the Pacers hit their stride, climbing back into the game with a 21-8 scoring run to head into halftime trailing 66-59. Trey Lyles led the Nuggets with a career-high 25 points, Gary Harris and Will Barton each had 21 points, and Chandler finished with 18. ""They're a very good basketball team,"" Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. ""We had our chance to close the game out in regulation, and they closed it out on an 8-0 run. Oladipo is a great player, but I am very proud of the way my guys played tonight, how we competed, and how we gave ourselves a chance to win on the road."" HOMECOMING Oladipo scored 20 points or more in 19 of Indiana's 26 games this season, with his latest effort marking the 18th time he has led the Pacers in scoring. FAMILIAR FACES Lyles and Harris are two of the most recent well-known Indiana prep stars to make it to the NBA. Lyles (Arsenal Tech High School) and Harris (Hamilton Southeastern High School) made what will be their only trip back to Indianapolis this season. Harris (Michigan State) and Lyles (Kentucky) were highly sought after recruits during their time in high school with Lyles winning a state championship his senior year. On Sunday night the two combined for 46 points. TIP-INS Nuggets: Paul Millsap (left wrist) and Nikola Jokic (left ankle) were held out of Sunday's game. ... Denver is now 3-10 on the road. . Denver's 19-point lead marks the largest blown lead in a loss by the Nuggets this season. ... Denver's 66 points at halftime were the most first-half points scored against the Pacers this season. Pacers: Darren Collison missed Sunday's game due to a sore left knee. ... Since snapping a four-game losing streak Nov.10, the Pacers are 11-4. ...

"MINNEAPOLIS --  After alternating wins and losses over the previous 10 games, the Minnesota Timberwolves were simply satisfied to pull out a victory against the Mavericks that stopped the back-and-forth swing. Dallas lamented missed opportunities and a chance to continue its improved play of late. Karl-Anthony Towns had 28 points, Jimmy Butler scored 10 of his 22 in the fourth quarter and Minnesota held on for a 97-92 win Sunday night. ""Just win, win the game,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""Dallas has played well. If you watch their games, you would know how tough they've been playing. So I knew it was going to be a hard-fought game."" Towns added 12 rebounds, including four on the offensive end, for his NBA-leading 21st double-double of the season. Minnesota committed 18 turnovers but hit four free throws at the end to pull away in a game in which no team led by more than six points. Jamal Crawford had 16 points off the bench for the Timberwolves (16-11), who won back-to-back games for the first time since Nov. 15-17. ""They're not always going to be pretty wins,"" Crawford said. ""When you go through tough stretches and still find a way to win, I think that says a lot about your group."" Harrison Barnes scored 19 and Maxi Kleber tied a career high with 16 points for Dallas, which has lost three in a row. The Mavericks, who had won four of six before the skid, shot 41 percent in the second half despite going 8 of 19 on 3-pointers. ""We can't complain with the shots,"" Barnes said. ""We had layups, we had open 3s, open 2s. Our shots didn't fall. From an execution standpoint we did everything we're supposed to do."" J.J. Barea sparked Dallas with 14 of his 16 in the second half, including a driving bank shot with two minutes left to give the Mavericks their final lead at 90-89. Butler followed with a turnaround jumper to put Minnesota back in front. Barea added a pair of free throws with 24.9 seconds left to pull Dallas to 93-92. But Crawford and Taj Gibson each hit a pair of free throws to secure the victory for Minnesota, its third in the past four games. ""The best part is we found a way to win, so we'll take the positives as they are,"" Towns said. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dirk Nowitzki played his 65th regular-season game against Minnesota, the most for any player. Nowitzki scored 10 points in 25:22. It was the 1,421st game of his career, leaving him three behind Kevin Willis for sixth on the NBA's all-time list. ... Six players scored in double figures for Dallas. ...

NO TIMETABLE FOR SMITH Dennis Smith Jr. missed his second straight game with a left hip strain, and Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle didn't have a timeframe on when his rookie point guard might be able to return. Smith is going back to Dallas to see a doctor. ""He's getting a little better each day, but I'm not going to give you any timetables right now,"" Carlisle said. ""Him being 100 percent healthy is the No. 1 priority. That's what's got to be our focus."" Smith, the No. 9 pick in the draft, is averaging 14.4 points and 4.0 assists per game.

"NEW ORLEANS --  Right when it looked as if rising star Ben Simmons might lift the 76ers to an unlikely road victory, a guy that used to have Simmons' job in Philadelphia took over in the clutch and rescued the Pelicans. Jrue Holiday made five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, when he scored 19 of his 34 points, and New Orleans overcame an eight-point deficit in the final period to beat short-handed Philadelphia 131-124 on Sunday night. The 6-foot-4 Holiday, an Eastern Conference All-Star in Philadelphia before being traded to New Orleans in 2013, struggled to create scoring chances on dribble drives against the 6-foot-10 Simmons, missing eight of his first 12 shots. He shifted his focus to passing out of his drives and committed five turnovers. Then Holiday opened the fourth quarter by letting fly quick 3s and changed the game. ""I guess it was just my turn at that time,"" Holiday said. ""Obviously, we were down and I was having a rough game passing the ball."" Rajon Rondo, who sat out the Pelicans' collapse against Sacramento on Friday night, returned with 13 points and 18 assists. Holiday said Rondo fueled New Orleans' 44-point fourth quarter with his ability to push the pace and ""get everybody a good shot."" ""My points are (thanks) to him,"" Holiday asserted. ""Right when he came back in, everything changed for me."" Anthony Davis added 29 points and DeMarcus Cousins 23 for New Orleans, which looked out-of-synch in the third quarter and in danger of dropping a second straight at home. ""We didn't want to happen what happened last game,"" Holiday said. ""That's all that we kept on talking about."" Simmons, who played one season at LSU before being selected first overall in the 2016 draft, had 27 points and 10 rebounds. He dazzled the crowd with a handful of explosive, driving dunks, including a reverse jam along the baseline that had the Sixers as close as 108-107 with 7:26 left. But Holiday and Davis responded with 3s to make it 114-107. ""Closing games out on the road is always difficult,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. ""It's especially difficult with DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday"" on the other team. J.J. Redick, who had 28 points, hit a tough 22-foot jumper that briefly cut the Sixers' deficit to five with four minutes left, but Holiday again responded with a 3, and his final 3 a couple possessions later gave the Pelicans' an 11-point lead with 2:54 to go. Already without 6-foot-9 starting forward Robert Covington, the Sixers scratched 7-foot center Joel Embiid minutes before the game because of back stiffness. ""We have to be more consistent and make the right plays every time,"" Simmons said. ""When we make mistakes and do not have guys like Joel and Cov to make up for it, it gets tough. We have to just come together as a team and get through it."" Still, Philadelphia outrebounded New Orleans 47-33 and outscored the Pelicans 60-44 in the paint. The Sixers snagged 22 offensive rebounds, which tied a season-high and led to 20 second-chance points. TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid, whose playing time had been limited since offseason knee surgery, was expected to play in New Orleans after sitting out in Cleveland on Saturday night. ... Covington was ruled out because of a back injury stemming from his leap into the stands in Cleveland a night earlier. ... Guard T.J. McConnell also was scratched with a left shoulder sprain. ... Amir Johnson and Trevor Booker each had 16 points for the Sixers. ... Dario Saric had 13 points and 11 rebounds. ... Richaun Holmes scored 12 points.

Reserve swing player Tony Allen dropped to the court in the first quarter before limping to the locker room on his own with what team officials said was a left knee injury. He did not return. KEEPING MOMENTUM Cousins said he persuaded coach Alvin Gentry to delay subbing him back into the game in the fourth quarter because he didn't want to disrupt New Orleans' surge into the lead. ""He wanted me to get AD a break, but at that moment we were kind of going on a run, so I said, `Coach, let `em roll,"" Cousins recalled. ""I just didn't want to be the guy to break what we had going on.""","400975140"
"NEW YORK --  The New York Knicks are still trying to learn how to make winning plays down the stretch, no matter the opponent. For starters, how to hold big leads in the fourth quarter. Or to make sure not to foul 3-point shooters. Or to limit easy opportunities at the free throw line. They did none of this Sunday night and still escaped with a win over one of the worst teams in the NBA. Kristaps Porzingis scored 30 points, Doug McDermott added 23 off the bench and the Knicks withstood a late push from the Atlanta Hawks for a 111-107 victory. New York coach Jeff Hornacek stopped short of feeling relieved, one night after a road loss to the NBA-worst Chicago Bulls. His team managed to hold off a fourth-quarter rally by the Hawks, who have the second-worst record in the league. ""It's never easy to win in the NBA no matter what the other team's record is,"" Hornacek said. ""We're still trying to learn things. I thought the end of the game was a good learning lesson for us."" The Knicks appeared to have the game put away after three straight points from Jarrett Jack and Porzingis gave them a 101-92 lead with 3:46 left. The Hawks then scored five consecutive points, including three free throws from Marco Belinelli, who was fouled as he attempted to hoist a 3-pointer, to make it 103-100 with 1:40 remaining. Porzingis answered with a quick basket at the other end to extend the Knicks' lead 105-100 before Ersan Ilyasova's layup drew Atlanta within three with 1:18 to play. But the Knicks allowed the Hawks to make it interesting. Jack was able to hit only one of two free throws, making it 109-106 with seven seconds left. Isaiah Taylor brought up the ball up the court and lost control of it near halfcourt before Kent Bazemore recovered. Bazemore was fouled with three seconds to go. After making the first free throw, he purposely missed the second one, but Porzingis sealed it with two free throws of his own. ""We made that game a lot more interesting down the stretch than we should have,"" Jack said. ""You know, we should have been able to close that thing out with two minutes to go and kind of been able to walk out of there kind of comfortable, feeling good and ready to move on to the next one."" Jack scored a season-high 19 points for a Knicks team that had lost six of eight, including a 116-104 defeat at Atlanta on Nov. 30. Despite sitting out the last eight minutes of the game, Dennis Schroder scored 21 points to lead Atlanta. Ilyasova added 20 for the Hawks, who are 3-11 away from home. Taurean Prince had 17 points and eight rebounds. ""Tough loss on the road,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We've just got to keep competing for more of the 48 minutes and stay together . and find a way to win on the road in a tough environment."" The Hawks led 75-71 after Miles Plumlee's jumper with 1:28 left in the third quarter. Porzingis answered with a pair of free throws that sparked an 11-0 run during a four-minute span. It ended with two free throws from Lance Thomas that increased New York's lead to 82-75 with 10:33 remaining in the fourth. Atlanta missed six shots and committed two turnovers during that stretch before Schroder's layup with 9:53 left. The Hawks outscored the Knicks 7-2 to cut the margin to 84-82 with 9:04 to go. TIP-INS Hawks: Rookie power forward John Collins, who has been out due to a left shoulder strain sustained on Nov. 30, worked out before the game at Madison Square Garden. The 20-year-old first-round pick from Wake Forest was averaging 11.5 points and 7.1 rebounds and had started four straight games before going down with the injury. Knicks: Porzingis had eight rebounds. ... Ron Baker, who has fallen down the depth chart at point guard, logged a season-high 31 minutes, giving the Knicks a nice lift as they went with a small lineup down the stretch. The fan favorite scored nine points, including four free throws during 10 minutes of play in the final period. 30-30 CLUB The Knicks improved to 7-2 when Porzingis scores 30 or more points. ON SECOND THOUGHT The Hawks are winless in the second game of a back-to-back, going 0-6 so far this season. Atlanta has eight more sets of back-to-back games on its schedule.","400975141"
"CHICAGO --  Nikola Mirotic and Bobby Portis are starting to draw attention for their play together instead of their fight with each other. Mirotic scored 24 points, Portis added a career-high 23 and the Chicago Bulls blew out Boston 108-85 on Monday night with Celtics star Kyrie Irving sidelined because of a bruised left quadriceps. Owners of the NBA's worst record, the Bulls (6-20) built an 18-point lead in the second quarter against the Eastern Conference leaders. And when Boston cut it to 12 in the fourth, the Bulls simply pulled away for their third straight win. Leading the way were two players who made headlines for all the wrong reasons before the season started. Their fight at practice left Mirotic with facial fractures, causing him to miss the first 23 games. Portis served an eight-game suspension. But the two have played well together the past two games. ""We need to give the credit to (coach Fred Hoiberg),"" Mirotic said. ""Fred is the one who is making us play. He's the guy who is calling the plays for us and putting us in the right spots to play."" As for the fight? ""Man, that situation's over,"" Portis said. ""Everybody's talking about that. But that doesn't matter anymore. We're just trying to win games."" Mirotic made his first start of the season with leading scorer Lauri Markkanen sidelined because of back spasms and shot 9 of 14 with eight rebounds. Through three games, the 6-foot-10 forward is averaging 16.3 points. Portis shot 10 of 15 and nailed all three 3-pointers. Al Horford scored 15 for Boston (23-6). Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier added 13 points apiece in the Celtics' most lopsided loss of the season. ""Sometimes you get your butt kicked. It was simple as that,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""Chicago dictated the whole game. They played harder than we did. They played with more presence than we did. They played more competitive than we did. They played with more authority than we did. You're not going to win many games when you play like that."" PULLING AWAY Boston got within 12 in the fourth quarter before Portis hit a 20-footer and Mirotic made a 3 to make it 90-73 with just under eight minutes left. The Bulls remained in control the rest of the way. Mirotic came through with 16 points as Chicago grabbed a 56-42 halftime lead. Portis scored 15 in the first half. The Bulls wiped out a four-point deficit and led 52-34 after a 24-2 run in the second quarter. Portis scored 10 during that stretch, nailing two 3s, and Mirotic finished it with a short hook. QUOTABLE ""It feels like it's March, but it it's not,"" said Mirotic, who has averaged 16.5 points in March during his career -- more than in any other month.

"HOUSTON --  In a season where the Houston Rockets have become one of the league's best teams, scoring a career-high in points like Clint Capela did on Monday night doesn't get congratulations. It draws comments on how he needs to play like he did over the New Orleans Pelicans more often. Capela scored 28 points and James Harden scored 12 straight points for Houston in the fourth quarter as the Rockets rallied for the 130-123 victory over the Pelicans to extend their winning streak to 10 games. ""We're going to need nights like that from Clint to be consistent and be a beast like he did, blocking shots, dunking the basketball,"" Harden said. ""And to close the game out he did a really, really good job. So progress, he's got to get better, but tonight was a good step for him."" Capela agreed with Harden's assessment. ""Of course it feels good and I'm happy tonight but I'm really trying to be consistent in what I'm doing,"" he said. ""So I'm going to keep working and try to get better simply. It's just one game and there's going to be a lot of other ones, so just got to be ready for the other ones now."" The game was tied with about three minutes remaining after Harden made two free throws. Those were the first of seven straight points by Harden that put Houston's up 124-119 with 1:30 left. Jrue Holiday made a basket after that, but Harden hit a 3-pointer seconds later to push the lead to 127-121. Harden stole the ball from E'Twaun Moore after a timeout by New Orleans. He was fouled and made both free throws to make it 129-121 with 34 seconds left. ""James running out of gas in the first half, and then his leg was hurting him and all that,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""But then at the end he just puts daggers in people."" After scoring 48 points in Houston's last game, Harden finished with 26 on Monday, but he tied a career-high with 17 assists, finding the 6-foot-10 Capela under the basket again and again. ""Harden and CP3 closed out the game, they are both great players,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We had our opportunity, but couldn't quite get it done."" Holiday had a season-high 37 points for the Pelicans and Rajon Rondo had a triple-double of 13 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists. Moore had a career-high 36 points and made a career-most six 3-pointers on a night New Orleans set a franchise record with 18 3-pointers. The Pelicans led by seven entering the fourth and were up by eight with about 10 minutes left when Moore scored all their points in a 6-2 run. Houston used an 11-3 spurt after that to tie it at 112-112 with about six minutes remaining. Paul made five points in that span and Capela capped it with two dunks. New Orleans was without Anthony Davis, who sat out with a groin injury. He missed three games after sustaining the injury on Dec. 1 but played in the last two games before the problem began to bother him again. The Pelicans were up by 2 early in the third quarter when Holiday scored five quick points to push the lead to 89-82. They led by seven later in the quarter when Holiday got going again, scoring all of their points in a 5-2 run that made it 96-86. Another basket by Holiday extended the lead to 13 points with about two minutes left in the quarter. But Paul outscored the Pelicans 8-2 the rest of the quarter to allow the Rockets to get within 103-96 entering the fourth. He made two 3-pointers in that stretch, with the second one coming just before the buzzer. DeMarcus Cousins received a technical foul in the second quarter when he shoved Trevor Ariza away from him with two hands after Ariza fouled him. Ariza yelled at Cousins after the push and Chris Paul and Harden pulled him away as he walked toward him before order was restored. TIP-INS Pelicans: New Orleans set a season-high with 74 first-half points. ... Holiday has scored 30 or more points in two straight games. ... Cousins had 24 points and 14 rebounds. Rockets: Harden's 14 assists in the first half tied a franchise record for assists in a half. Harden also did it last year and John Lucas did it on Oct. 27, 1977. ... Paul finished with 20 points.

""We've got to find solutions somehow,"" Gasol said, adding that the tough defense that was part of Memphis' reputation for years is not part of the team's mentality. ""We always had a mindset here where we can have a tough night offensively, but if we don't score, you don't score."" That certainly wasn't the case Monday night. The Heat carried a 70-60 lead into the fourth quarter and kept up the pressure in the final period. Johnson scored five straight points to run the advantage out to 18, and the lead ballooned to 27 in the closing minute. ""The effort wasn't there,"" Memphis interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""To a man, the responsibility that we have to our teammates, to the organization, to the fans, we didn't give the fans what they deserve. We didn't give the organization what they deserve, and, we didn't give one another what we deserve."" TIP-INS Heat: C Hassan Whiteside missed his sixth straight game with a left knee injury. ... Miami did not register a second-chance point and grabbed only two offensive rebounds. ... Miami's 56.1 percent shooting for the game was a season high for a Memphis opponent. ...

Memphis is 1-14 since starting PG Mike Conley was shelved by left Achilles problems. ... Harrison's 16 points were a season high. FOR FIZZ It was Miami's first trip to FedExForum since Memphis fired former Heat assistant David Fizdale as head coach last month. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said he had lunch with his former assistant earlier in the day. ""I still feel for Fizz, and what he, unfortunately, had to go through here. That's my brother, and you want him to have a fair shot at it,"" Spoelstra said, adding: ""He's going to get another opportunity."" BAM IMPACT When Miami center Kelly Olynyk got into foul trouble, Adebayo stepped up. Adebayo, a rookie out of Kentucky, was 5 for 6 from the field and also contributed four rebounds and two blocked shots. ""He really used his technique, energy, multiple efforts and mental stability to be in a lot of places that were pretty disruptive,"" Spoelstra said. Olynyk added: ""There's plays in practice all the time where you're like: `Man, this guy's a freak. Where did that even come from?' And he's starting to string more of those plays together every day."" FINAL WORD Regarding the Grizzlies talking with each other about the overall problems, Gasol said: ""I don't think talk does much. It's doing. I always believe that talk is great, and we're going to say the right things, and we can sit down and sing `Kumbaya,' but it's more about grabbing it and taking ownership of the things we have to do.""","400975144"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Charlotte Hornets finally won a road game. In a tough spot, too. Dwight Howard scored 23 points to help the Charlotte Hornets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 116-103 on Monday night. It was Charlotte's first victory on the road since Oct. 30 at Memphis. ""There are two ways you can go when you have a slow start,"" Howard said. ""You can either look down upon yourself and say, `I can't do it, it's too hard,' or you can look in the mirror and say `I want to get out of this.' That's how we are feeling. Together we can do something good."" Kemba Walker had 19 points for the Hornets, who had lost seven of eight. Marvin Williams scored 18, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist finished with 17 points. Russell Westbrook had 30 points and seven assists, and Paul George scored 20 points for the Thunder after missing the previous two games with a right calf contusion. Charlotte shot 53 percent from the field against one of the league's best defensive teams. The Hornets made 13 of 25 3-point attempts while improving to 2-10 on the road. ""We played together, we moved the ball, our defensive intensity was great and when we needed a big play, they came up with the big plays,"" interim coach Stephen Silas said. The game was tied at 66 in the third quarter when Charlotte went on a run and never relinquished momentum. A 3-pointer by Williams made it 74-66, leading to a Thunder timeout. Charlotte kept right on rolling. A 3-pointer by Frank Kaminsky put the Hornets up 86-68, and a layup by Kidd-Gilchrist made it a 20-point game. The Hornets made 7 of 10 3-pointers in the quarter to go up 92-74 at the end of the period. Oklahoma City cut the deficit to 11 on a dunk by Westbrook, but the Hornets quickly regained control for good. ""We just gave them little bonehead plays,"" Westbrook said.

QUOTABLE ""We're not a team like them where they have a bunch of stars and you have guys who can just go win games for you,"" Silas said. ""We have to do it as a group. Most of it, for us, is on the defensive end. We did that tonight, and hopefully, that'll carry on.""","400975145"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Golden State returned from a dominant road trip that might help shape its season and showed once more how important depth is to its success. Kevin Durant had 28 points, nine rebounds, five assists and three blocked shots, leading the short-handed Warriors past the sluggish Portland Trail Blazers 111-104 on Monday night. Golden State played without two-time MVP Stephen Curry, who is nursing a sprained right ankle and missed his third straight game. Draymond Green sat out with a sore right shoulder while starting center Zaza Pachulia was sidelined for his second game in a row because of soreness in his left shoulder. ""These nights are really powerful for a team where guys are able to get out there who aren't usually in the lineup,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""Makes them feel good, makes us feel good and just strengthens the lineup."" Portland star Damian Lillard scored a season-high 39 points with five 3-pointers playing back home in Oakland. He hit a 3-pointer late in the first half with Durant in his face and pumped his arm to celebrate. Durant, who earned Western Conference Player of the Week honors on Monday, shot 11 for 21. Klay Thompson overcame a cold shooting start to score 24 points, and reserve Nick Young contributed 12 points in 13 minutes before leaving with a concussion in the third quarter. David West scored 10 points to reach double figures over consecutive games for the first time with the Warriors and first since 2015-16 for San Antonio. He also had four blocks. ""I just thought our focus 1 through 12 was where it needed to be,"" West said. ""We were able to take care of business."" Rookie Jordan Bell scored in double figures for the second time with 11 points, while Omri Casspi and Shaun Livingston also started for the defending champions, who were coming off a 6-0 road trip. It marked the franchise's first time doing so in that long of a stretch away from home. ""We're going to need that in the future if we want to continue to keep winning with Steph and Draymond out,"" Durant said of the contributions from so many players. Now, the Warriors will get to stay home for almost the entire rest of the year except for a trip to face the Lakers on Dec. 18. CJ McCollum scored 21 points in Portland's fifth straight loss. It was the first meeting of the season between the West rivals after Golden State took all four games last regular season and then swept the Blazers in the first round of the playoffs. ""In a game like tonight when you have Steph out, Draymond out, we have to understand that other guys are going to come in and be aggressive and try to take advantage of their opportunities,"" Lillard said. After missing his first four 3-point tries, Thompson hit from deep in the final 30 seconds of the first half as the Warriors led 59-47 at the break. BARNES RETIRES As he expected to do this winter, Matt Barnes announced his retirement on Monday. Barnes, who received his Warriors championship ring Nov. 27 when Golden State hosted his former Kings and hometown team, posted his news on Instagram with a selfie. ""Had a cool 15yr run!! Traveled the world met alota cool people, some will be brothers for the rest of my life!"" he wrote, later adding, ""Love me or HATE ME, I DID IT MY WAY!!""

"LOS ANGELES --  With Blake Griffin, Patrick Beverley and Danilo Gallinari sidelined by injuries, playing hard has to be the Los Angeles Clippers' calling card. Montrezl Harrell scored 17 points and the Clippers rallied over the final 3:21 to beat Toronto 96-91 on Monday night, snapping the Raptors' six-game winning streak. ""We scrapped, we played hard, we got the loose balls, we got the 50-50 game, we took charges, we created turnovers, got baskets,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""That's who we have to be right now, and our guys have bought into it."" DeAndre Jordan had 14 points and 17 rebounds for the Clippers. Their backups outscored Toronto's reserves 50-17, led by Harrell and Lou Williams, who also had 17 points. ""Our second group tries to bring a lot of energy and play as hard as we can,"" Harrell said. ""We know we're going to make some mistakes, we know we have some younger guys who aren't accustomed to playing this amount of minutes. Everyone has that next man up mentality."" Milos Teodosic scored 12 points in his return after missing 22 games with a left foot injury. His 3-pointer with 40 seconds left extended the Clippers' lead to 91-87. Jordan fouled Kyle Lowry in the lane, and he made one of two free throws to make it 91-88. Williams made two free throws before C.J. Miles hit a 3-pointer from the right corner that closed the Raptors to 93-91. But the injury-plagued Clippers went 3 for 4 at the line to hang on for their second win in a row. Harrell gave Los Angeles a scare when he went down near the baseline early in the fourth. Eventually, he got up and stayed in the game. Jonas Valanciunas had 23 points and 15 rebounds for the Raptors, who led by 13 points in the first half. Serge Ibaka and DeMar DeRozan each scored 17 points. ""We were playing in mud. Psychologically, we were a step behind,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. ""After we lost that lead, we couldn't get our traction back."" The Raptors were up 81-74 early in the fourth on seven straight points, including consecutive baskets by Valanciunas. Teodosic and Austin Rivers hit 3-pointers and Sam Dekker made a pair of free throws to pull the Clippers into an 82-all tie. They tied it again at 84-all on Dekker's baseline shovel pass to Jordan, who dunked. ""We kept a high-scoring team under 100 points. That's pretty good, man,"" Austin Rivers said. ""This is the biggest win for us. We kept playing and fighting."" Harrell ran off the Clippers' first nine points of the second quarter, cutting their deficit from 13 points to four. He scored 13 in the period, and the Clippers trailed 53-51 at halftime. PASSING DJ Jordan had four assists. ""He's going to be out there trying to throw all kinds of passes,"" Austin Rivers joked about Jordan. TIP-INS Raptors: Fell to 2-1 in the second game of a back-to-back. Clippers: Gallinari has a strained glute, similar to the injury that sidelined him for 13 games recently. He took a hard fall in the fourth quarter against Washington last weekend, when he scored a season-high 25 points, and is expected to be out a few games.","400975147"
"CLEVELAND --  LeBron James always takes pride in being efficient. His numbers Tuesday night were several steps beyond that. James had 25 points and tied a career-high with 17 assists, as Cleveland defeated the Atlanta Hawks 123-114 -- the Cavaliers' 15th win in 16 games. James, as he has done all season, turned in an almost error-free  performance. He was 11 of 13 from the field, had seven rebounds and two turnovers. James was given a standing ovation when he was removed from the game with 2:34 remaining. The four-time MVP set the tone for the entire team. The Cavaliers hit a season-high 20 3-pointers, including nine in the first quarter. Cleveland had a season-high 35 assists. ""For me to get assists means somebody's making shots,"" James said. ""That's always been an enjoyment of mine to be able to see my teammates reap the benefits of the pass that I try to put on time and on target."" Kyle Korver had 19 points, including six 3-pointers. Kevin Love, returning after missing a game with a hip injury, scored 17 points, all in the first half. Love had 11 points in the first quarter after sitting out Saturday's game against Philadelphia. He had 12 rebounds. Cleveland's ball movement kept Atlanta's defenders scrambling all night in chasing the open man. ""Guys are sharing the ball extremely well,"" James said. ""When the ball is moving, energy is behind it and guys are in rhythm."" ""It's a tried and true formula,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""You have a great player and you surround him with 3-point shooters. LeBron is obviously a great player and a great facilitator. We defended him pretty well but when we pressured the ball, he kicked it out for open shots."" James is shooting 58 percent from the field and still makes a point of finding teammates. ""That's just who I am,"" he said. ""I've never liked being a volume shooter. That's just not my game. Me being efficient just helps our team ultimately."" Atlanta fell to 6-21, the worst record in the league. Taurean Prince scored a career-high 24 points while Kent Bazemore had 20. Cavaliers guard Dwyane Wade missed the game because of a sore left knee. He is averaging 11.5 points and shooting 46 percent. The Cavaliers built a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter and set a team record with 10 or more 3-pointers in 17 consecutive games. The Hawks defeated the Cavaliers 117-115 in Cleveland on Nov. 5, which was Atlanta's second win of the season. Atlanta had beaten Cleveland three of the last four games dating to last season. Dennis Schroder scored 14 points after sitting out the final 8:14 of the Hawks' loss in New York on Sunday. Jose Calderon had a season-high 14 points while J.R. Smith had eight assists, his most of the season. CAVALIER RETURN Center Tristan Thompson, playing for the first time since Nov. 1 when he strained his left calf, was scoreless and didn't have a rebound in 6 minutes. Thompson is on limited minutes and didn't play in the second half. NEW EXPERIENCE Rookie center Tyler Cavanaugh, who is on a two-way contract, made his first NBA start for Atlanta, scoring 11 points with nine rebounds in 28 minutes.

"DETROIT --  The Denver Nuggets decided before Tuesday's game in Detroit that the safest approach was to give Nikola Jokic at least one more night off before bringing him back from injury. It turned out to be a wise decision. Without Jokic and Paul Millsap, the Nuggets still routed the Pistons 103-84 behind 28 points from Jamal Murray. ""Jamal was great, but this was the whole team,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Holding that team to 84 points is a remarkable effort, and we were unselfish on offense. Will Barton had 10 assists and Gary Harris had nine, and they only combined for two turnovers."" Murray finished the game with 11 field goals, one more than Detroit's starting lineup combined. ""That was extremely bad basketball,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""That's one of the worst losses I've ever had as a coach, and I've coached 850-some games between the regular season and the playoffs."" Van Gundy had juggled Detroit's lineup after his starters shot 26 percent (13-for-50) in Sunday's loss to the Boston Celtics. It didn't help. Reggie Bullock, inserted for Stanley Johnson, went 3-for-5 from the floor, but the other four starters -- Tobias Harris, Andre Drummond, Avery Bradley and Reggie Jackson -- shot 22.6 percent (7-for-31) and turned the ball over 15 times. ""Those four are our best four players, so we can't bench them and expect to win games with the other nine guys,"" Van Gundy said. ""Those four have got to stop putting us in holes, and it is my job to figure out how to make that happen."" Trey Lyles added 20 points for Denver. Wilson Chandler scored 18 points, and Mason Plumlee had 10 points and 13 rebounds. ""Guys were missing a lot of shots, so there were a lot of rebounds out there,"" Plumlee said. The Nuggets shot 50.6 percent from the floor and held Detroit to 35.4 percent. ""When we defend like this, we're a good team,"" Malone said. ""We did it for 48 minutes, which is great to see, but we have to keep it going."" Reserves Langston Galloway (18 points) and Boban Marjanovic (14) led the Pistons in scoring. Jackson was the only Detroit starter to reach double figures with 12 points. Detroit turned the ball over eight times in the game's first nine minutes, and was down 12 points as a result. Van Gundy went to his bench, and Marjanovic started a rally with his post offense. The Denver lead was down to 33-30 when Drummond returned to the floor, but Van Gundy went back to Marjanovic after the Nuggets went back up 44-36 late in the half. Drummond finished with just five points in 27 minutes. ""Mason was great,"" Malone said. ""Drummond is a load and so is Boban. Those are two big individuals, and our guys met the challenge against them."" The Nuggets led 49-40 at halftime, outshooting Detroit 48.7 percent to 33.3 percent. Denver kept up in the pace on both ends of the floor in the third quarter, taking a 72-52 lead late in the period. They led 80-60 going into the fourth and were never seriously threatened. TIP-INS Nuggets: Malone said Jokic has a chance of playing Wednesday against the Boston Celtics. ... Monte Morris made his NBA debut, finishing with an assist and a missed 3-pointer in three minutes of action. Morris grew up in Flint, about 90 minutes north of Detroit. ""It was special to hear my number called, and it was pretty spectacular to do it here, in front of my family,"" he said. Pistons: Johnson was demoted to deep in Van Gundy's new rotation, not entering the game until the Pistons were down by 22 in the third quarter. ...

"NEW YORK --  Lonzo Ball was having a dazzling stretch, every basket bringing his father farther and farther off his courtside seat for an emphatic celebration. By the end, the New York Knicks were the ones celebrating. Kristaps Porzingis had 37 points and 11 rebounds, Michael Beasley made the biggest plays in overtime, and the Knicks beat the Los Angeles Lakers 113-109 on Tuesday night. Beasley finished with 13 points, including the tiebreaking follow shot, and had an assist in the extra period as the Knicks went back over .500 at 14-13. Thirteen of their victories have come at Madison Square Garden. Rookie Frank Ntilikina went the whole fourth quarter and overtime in a strong defensive effort that helped slow down Ball after his third-quarter flurry. ""A lot of effort, big plays, just keeping our poise on the court, not being stressed and not being overrun by the moment,"" Ntilikina said. ""So I mean that was great and for a young team like this to play like that, it's a huge step in our process."" Ball had 17 points, eight rebounds and six assists, but had just two points after the third quarter. ""It was a lot of fun. I heard the crowd the whole game. It was crazy,"" he said. ""Would have been nice if we got the win, but it was very eventful."" Ball went high to slam down a lob pass from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, nailed a 3-pointer, drove for a layup, and then fed Brook Lopez for a 3-pointer in the third, with LaVar Ball jumping up with arms waving from his sideline seat next to Lithuania-bound sons LiAngelo and LaMelo. ""I know how he is,"" Lonzo said of his father. ""I like his energy. Some people don't."" The Knicks essentially won it with Beasley's stretch of a tip-in, a pass inside to Doug McDermott for a basket, and a driving layup that turned a 103-all game into a 109-103 lead with 1:24 remaining in the overtime. ""Just thinking go get the win, try to do everything the team needs,"" Beasley said. ""Dive on the floor. Just the little things."" Caldwell-Pope scored 24 points for the Lakers, who had won two in a row on their trip. Rookie Kyle Kuzma added 19 points off the bench. ""We were right there. It says a lot about our group of guys and the way they compete and how far they've come to be in a road game with that type of environment on national TV,"" coach Luke Walton said. ""Obviously disappointed that we weren't at our best, but still finding a way to give ourselves a chance and I'm proud of our group for that."" The Knicks were in good shape when Porzingis' basket made it 99-94 with 1:29 remaining in regulation and Ball threw away a pass. But Caldwell-Pope tipped in a miss and Kuzma made a 3-pointer to tie it with 23.9 seconds to go, before Porzingis missed a 3 at the buzzer. TIP-INS Lakers: Brandon Ingram missed his first 10 shots before a three-point play with 40 seconds left that made it 79-76 heading to the fourth. Ingram finished with five points on 2-for-12 shooting. He entered as the Lakers' leading scorer and averaged 19.2 points in the previous 11 games, scoring in double digits in all of them. Knicks: Former Knicks forward Amare Stoudemire was at the game and led a countdown to the lighting of a menorah on the overhead videoboard to celebrate the start of Hanukkah. It was the seventh anniversary of Stoudemire setting a franchise record with his eighth straight 30-point game. LUKE ON JACKSON Walton, who played for Phil Jackson with the Lakers, said he still talks to his former coach. He was asked his feelings about Jackson's departure in June after three seasons as Knicks president. ""I don't know all the details on what was going on here,"" Walton said. ""Obviously a mentor to me like that, someone that means as much to me as Phil does, I'm not in favor of it happening. But again, I'm coaching on the West Coast and I'm not around out here to see everything and how and why everything played out the way it did.""

"NEW YORK --  Allen Crabbe had missed his last six 3-point attempts when he had another shot with the game on the line. A 40 percent career 3-point shooter, he just shrugged at his previous failures and let another one go that proved to be decisive. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Caris LeVert each scored 16 points, and the Brooklyn Nets overcame blowing a double-digit second-half lead and took advantage of a costly mistake by the Washington Wizards in the final seconds to pull out a 103-98 victory Tuesday night. ""I think it was just that I don't care attitude. If you miss, you miss,"" said Crabbe, who went 3 for 15 from the field, including 3 for 14 behind the 3-point line. Brooklyn shot just 10 for 43 overall beyond the arc. Crabbe raced from the corner opposite the Washington bench as Spencer Dinwiddie handled the inbounds pass and drew the defense of center Jason Smith and Bradley Beal, who lost Crabbe. Crabbe's 3-pointer with 43.8 seconds left put the Nets up 100-98. Beal missed a potential game-tying pull-up jumper and Dinwiddie was then fouled, making one of two free throws to increase the lead to 101-98. ""I still have confidence in him,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. A timeout by Washington advanced the ball past half court, but Tomas Satoransky was unable to inbound the ball in time, drawing a 5-second violation. LeVert then made two free throws with 7 seconds left to seal the win. The Wizards had already committed a couple of other miscues before Satoransky's mental mistake, like not fouling with 9 seconds left in regulation. A few minutes before that, Beal turned the ball over and then committed a foul as he tried stopping DeMarre Carroll from scoring, giving him a three-point play. Playing at home for the first time in over a week after playing a game in Atlanta and two games in Mexico as the home team, the Nets returned to the Barclays Center and had a total of seven players score in double figures. Carroll had 15 points, Crabbe chipped in 13, Tyler Zeller added 12, and Dinwiddie and Jarrett Allen each contributed 11. Dinwiddie also had a career-high 12 assists. Beal scored 28 points to lead the Wizards despite making only 11 for 33 from the field. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 12 points and Otto Porter Jr. added 11 for a Washington team that dropped to 4-5 without John Wall. Beal thought the team had shown some type of growth but not constant enough with their floor leader sidelined. ""I think we just show glimpses of it. I think we're too inconsistent,"" Beal said. ""We've shown that we can compete at a high level. We've shown we can defend at a high level and rebound at a high level. But sometimes we take our opponents for granted because of what's in front of the chest. They come out and just outwork us."" Wall was listed as questionable and went through his pregame routine but sat on the bench in his warmups. Wall has been out since Nov. 25 due to a sore left knee, but is expected to return Wednesday night at home against the Memphis Grizzlies. The Nets led 74-60 after Dinwiddie's basket with 4:32 left in the third quarter before Washington went on a 10-3 run to close out the period, taking an 82-79 lead in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter on four straight points from Smith and Beal. But Brooklyn answered with a 10-0 run immediately, capped by LeVert's 3-pointer that made it 89-82 with 9:05 to go. Both teams traded baskets the rest of the way before Beal stringed together three consecutive points to increase Washington's lead to 98-97 with 51 seconds left. TIP-INS Wizards: Ended their five-game trip going at 2-3. Nets: Tallied 26 assists on 34 field goals. . The last Net with more than 12 assists in a game was Shane Larkin back on Feb. 1, 2016. He had 14 against Detroit. EARN YOUR STRIPES Atkinson does not have a timetable as to when Brooklyn's recently acquired center Jahlil Okafor and guard Nik Stauskas would get into a game. The team used a Sunday workout and a practice on Monday to get to know the duo who was acquired last Thursday in a trade with Philadelphia. ""This isn't CYO, where you show up at 4 o'clock and you meet your teammates and you just throw them out there,"" Atkinson said. ""We have a ton of plays, a defensive system. We want to put both those guys in a position to succeed, a position to help the team. I can't give you an exact date.""","400975151"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Joel Embiid was a spectator for two games, and that was long enough for the Philadelphia big man to get antsy. Embiid scored 28 points in his return to the lineup and the 76ers topped the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-112 in overtime Tuesday night to stop a four-game losing streak. ""We needed this,"" Embiid said. ""My goal is to always bring back a lot of energy. Obviously use my skills, but a lot of it is just playing hard."" After missing two games with back tightness, Embiid hit two free throws with 14.8 seconds remaining to force overtime. Then he scored seven points in the extra session, including a 3-pointer that gave Philadelphia a seven-point lead in the final two minutes. J.J. Redick scored 24 points and made all 11 of his free throws for the Sixers. Jimmy Butler led Minnesota with a season-high 38 points, including a pair of 3s in the final minute of regulation. Embiid got the better of Karl-Anthony Towns as the talented 7-footers battled down low all night. Towns had 17 points and 15 rebounds, his 22nd double-double of the season. ""Last year I was really excited to play against him,"" Embiid said. ""This year was treated like a regular game and we got the win."" Before Butler hit a 3-pointer with 47.6 seconds to play in regulation, Minnesota was 1 for 21 from long range. Butler connected again with 17.8 seconds remaining, but his step-back jumper at the buzzer fell short as the game went to overtime. Butler had 14 fourth-quarter points and helped the Timberwolves build a seven-point lead early in the period. But his late heroics weren't enough. ""Jimmy was fantastic tonight,"" Towns said. ""I didn't do anything tonight to help him."" Philadelphia jumped out to an early lead in overtime, aided by three free throws from Redick. A dunk by rookie Ben Simmons provided an answer for the Sixers after Minnesota threatened to climb back into it. The turnover discrepancy was lopsided. Philadelphia committed 24 turnovers while the Timberwolves turned the ball over just 10 times. Yet despite sloppy play at times, the Sixers didn't end up getting hurt in the end by the turnover margin. ""It is so frustrating, because they play their hearts out and you just keep squirting the ball around the gym,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We were lucky to get out of it with a win with that many turnovers."" Minnesota shot just 5 for 29 from 3-point range and was 1 for 13 from deep in the first half. Andrew Wiggins went 8 of 24 overall and 1 of 7 from beyond the arc. ""Every night, your shot's not going to fall,"" Wiggins said. ""We didn't shoot great from the 3-point line, but that's basketball. You're not going to make all the shots."" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau used just three reserves despite visible fatigue from his starting five. Towns and Butler each topped 40 minutes in regulation. Though four starters played 39 minutes or more, Minnesota players said that wasn't the reason they lost. ""I think we need to get into better shape if we're tired,"" Butler said. ""Do whatever it takes for this team, this organization, to win. If you're tired, run some extra laps after practice."" TIP-INS 76ers: Simmons, who entered averaging 18 points per game, didn't score until 1:17 remained in the fourth quarter when he had a dunk. He finished with seven points. ... The Sixers set a season worst for turnovers. Their previous high was 22 on Nov. 7 against Utah. Timberwolves: F Nemanja Bjelica missed his 10th straight game with a foot injury. ... Minnesota fell to 5-10 when committing fewer than 15 turnovers in a game. The Timberwolves are 11-2 when turning the ball over 15 or more times. CLUTCH AT THE LINE Philadelphia got to the free throw line 13 times in overtime and made 11 of those shots. The Sixers shot 84.4 percent (27 for 32) from the line overall. Minnesota, meanwhile, was 19 of 27 (70.4 percent) from the stripe. ""Putting them at the line hurt us,"" Thibodeau said. In addition to Redick's perfect performance, Embiid was 11 for 12 at the foul line. Philadelphia entered shooting 74.4 percent on free throws.","400975152"
"DALLAS --  Kawhi Leonard strolled to the locker room late in third quarter, just as J.J. Barea was starting a Dallas rally that spoiled the season debut of San Antonio's star forward. The minutes restriction was up for Leonard after he missed the first 27 games with a right quadriceps injury, so there wasn't anything he could do in the fourth quarter about Barea and the last-place Mavericks ending another four-game winning streak for the Spurs. Barea scored 14 of his 16 points in the second half and alley-oop dunk partner Dwight Powell had 12 points and 12 rebounds in the Mavericks' 95-89 win on Tuesday night. ""I understand the situation that I'm in and we're thinking about down the road,"" said Leonard, who had 13 points in 16 minutes -- roughly the first 5 minutes in each of the first three quarters. Leonard, who has been recovering from a quadriceps condition that causes pain and weakness in the knee, made his first three shots and scored six of San Antonio's first eight points. It was his first action since Game 1 of the Western Conference finals last season, when he injured his left ankle in what was eventually a sweep for Golden State on its way to the NBA title. Leonard finished with a flourish as well, tipping a loose ball a couple of times to keep an offensive rebound alive and hitting a short jumper. But soon after that play in the third quarter, Leonard looked winded as he headed to the bench following a timeout. His night was over. ""I'm just happy to be out there, just to play the game and enjoy the things I missed -- missing shots, losing games, making mistakes, just everything,"" said Leonard, who had six rebounds, an assist and a block. ""I missed everything on the court."" Harrison Barnes scored 17 points while Yogi Ferrell and Wesley Mathews had 16 apiece as the Mavericks ended a five-game losing streak at home to the Spurs. Barea led the Mavericks with six assists, including two alley-oop passes to Powell. The second one put them ahead for good at 71-69 and was part of a 10-0 run bridging the third and fourth quarters. Barea started and finished the run with layups. ""We have been waiting for a game like this where we go out and play a full 48-minute game,"" said Ferrell, who had a career-high eight rebounds. ""We've had some good games this season, but we put it all together tonight."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 23 points and 13 rebounds and Rudy Gay scored 21 for the Spurs, who shot 29 percent while getting outscored 28-20 in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Spurs: Bryn Forbes banked in a 3-pointer over 7-footer Dirk Nowitzki at the first-half buzzer to get the Spurs within 46-44. ... Aldridge, Gay and Leonard were the only Spurs in double figures. Patty Mills was next with eight. ... C Pau Gasol went scoreless on just two shots with nine rebounds. Mavericks: Rookie PG Dennis Smith Jr. missed his third straight game with a left hip strain and won't play on the upcoming two-game trip. ... Nowitzki was 1 of 8 from the field and finished with six points. ... Barnes matched a season high with three steals. PARKER PLAN 2.0? San Antonio's minutes plan for Leonard appears similar to that of guard Tony Parker, who played more than 20 minutes for the first time in seven games since returning from surgery for a ruptured quadriceps tendon. The 35-year-old Parker had six points on 3-of-9 shooting as the Spurs lost for the first time with him in the lineup. Parker has skipped two games since returning. Parker didn't play in the fourth quarter of his first four games. ""I'm not going to say how I'm going to play him,"" coach Gregg Popovich said of Leonard. ""But he can only have so many minutes, so that's the way it is."" POWELL POWER Powell had his first double-double of the season and sixth of his career. He's scored in double figures six of the past nine games. ""He always gives us amazing energy, toughness and just gives us that team toughness,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Guys like him, you just can't get enough of.""","400975153"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  From the moment he signed with the Kings last offseason, Zach Randolph fully embraced his role as a veteran mentor in the locker room for a mostly young team. Sacramento's 36-year-old power forward is still getting it done on the court, too. And in crunch time, no less. Randolph scored 11 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter to spark a big run, and the Kings rallied past the slumping Phoenix Suns 99-92 on Tuesday night. ""Just trying to get good shots,"" Randolph said. ""I missed a couple easy shots. Didn't really get (anything) going until the end. Just tried to get something going in the paint."" Randolph missed seven of his first 10 shots but was perfect on four attempts in the fourth quarter, all of them coming after the Kings fell behind 85-80 with six minutes remaining. Sacramento scored the next 13 points to take control. The Kings' big man, who had seven rebounds and five assists, made a three-point play with 44.9 seconds remaining to secure the win after getting fouled by Tyson Chandler. ""That's what you pay big stud muffins like that for, to go deliver the mail,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""We didn't play great but we played hard and gave ourselves a chance coming down the stretch."" George Hill had 18 points and seven rebounds in his return to the starting lineup. Buddy Hield scored 14 points and Willie Cauley-Stein added 13 points and six rebounds to help the Kings win for the second time in five games. ""(Hill is) a big part of this,"" Randolph said. ""Without him on top of his game, it's going to be hard for us. We need G to play like that every game."" The late scoring flurry was a departure from the rest of the game, when both teams struggled to score with much consistency. Phoenix built an early 10-point lead in the first half but went scoreless for more than five minutes in the fourth quarter and lost its fourth straight. The Suns, who have dropped nine of 11, fell to 0-3 since losing leading scorer Devin Booker to a left adductor strain. ""They made shots down the stretch,"" Phoenix coach Jay Triano said. ""We missed a couple of good shots and they made theirs. That's the difference in the game."" TJ Warren scored 18 points for Phoenix. Mike James added 17 points and five assists. The teams combined for 15 lead changes before Sacramento pulled away behind Randolph. Warren scored two quick buckets early in the fourth quarter and Dragan Bender made a 3-pointer to put the Suns up 85-80. Randolph hit back-to-back baskets then fed Hill for a reverse layup. After a 3 by Hield, Randolph made two free throws and then scored down low to put the Kings up 93-85. Tyler Ulis and James scored to cut the gap to 93-89 before Randolph's three-point play. OFF TARGET The Suns missed 15 of their 17 attempts from 3-point range in the second half and finished 7 of 32 from beyond the arc. ""We just have to be better at shooting the 3-ball,"" Triano said. ""The game is trending that way and we've got to be able to make more than 2 for 17."" DEFENSIVE STAND Joerger praised his team's defense after the King held the Suns to 0-for-12 shooting during their scoring drought in the fourth quarter. ""We were a little bit more aggressive,"" Joerger said. ""When our defense was set, we were much more effective over the course of the game."" TIP-INS Suns: James, Troy Daniels, Josh Jackson and Bender made consecutive 3s without a miss as part of a 12-2 run in the second quarter. Kings: Sacramento committed nine turnovers. ... Hill returned to the starting lineup after sitting out one game for personal reasons. ... Cauley-Stein had missed three games with a lower back strain.","400975154"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Paul George struggled on homecoming night. He still left town with the crown. On a night the four-time All-Star was repeatedly booed and couldn't seem to make a shot, he finally sunk two free throws with 10.7 seconds left Wednesday to seal Oklahoma City's 100-95 victory at Indiana. ""Yeah, I'm happy this circus is over with. Everybody can move on,"" George said. ""I understood what the environment was going to be, so it wasn't a surprise."" Everything from finding the visiting locker room to dealing with the fans was different, and it seemed to take a toll. George went 3 of 14 from the field, 2 of 7 on 3-pointers, had two rebounds and four turnovers. But spurned fans who are still upset George's camp went public with his free agent intentions last summer made sure the box score was the most pleasant part of George's night. When first he walked onto the court for warmups, one fan shouted ""traitor!"" During player introductions, the boos reached a crescendo and every time he touched the ball, the boo-birds returned with full force. The only cheers came when George made a mistake or drew a foul. Fortunately, George's friends helped him out. Steven Adams finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds while reigning MVP Russell Westbrook recorded his ninth triple-double of the season -- 10 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists. And when George came up with the final steal of the game, he pumped his arms and his teammates savored the moment as much as he did. ""I thought he had incredible poise tonight,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Everybody was asking how is he and I hadn't really noticed anything different. I thought his defense -- certainly on the side out of bounds play -- was really critical for us."" The trade for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis was widely panned as below market value, but has turned out pretty well so far for the Pacers. Oladipo led Indiana with 19 points and nearly brought them all the way back from an 11-point deficit with 5:16 left. The Pacers got to 96-94 with 1:07 to go and had a chance to tie it when they got the ball with 15.2 seconds left and down 98-95. Instead, George came up with the steal and made the free throws to seal the win, silence the crowd, end the Pacers' four-game winning streak and leave town as the king of the night. ""That team showed us that when you're playing against these elite teams, it's going to be a physical game and we didn't match that tonight,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook was 3 of 17 from the field, 1 of 3 on 3-pointers and 3 of 7 at the free-throw line. ... Oklahoma City is 4-10 on the road. ... Oklahoma City got its first series split with the Pacers since 2012-13. ... Oklahoma City had 17 offensive rebounds and was 13 of 29 on 3-pointers. Pacers: Bojan Bogdanovic had 15 points while Thaddeus Young had 11 points, 10 rebounds and seven steals. ... Sabonis wound up with eight points and six rebounds. ... Indiana made 11 3s but fell to 14-3 when making 10 or more 3-pointers in a game this season. ... Myles Turner had three blocks, his 12th game this season with three or more. ... Former Colts coach Tony Dungy attended the game. He's in town for Thursday night's NFL game between the Colts and Broncos. ALL-STAR DAY The Pacers got a win before they even took the floor. A little less than three hours before tip, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced Indiana would host the 2021 All-Star Game. It will be the first time the Pacers have hosted the marquee event since 1985. The move comes seven months after Larry Bird hand-delivered the formal proposal at the league's New York headquarters in an IndyCar. QUOTABLE Thunder: ""Let's put all this to rest,"" George said. ""I had an amazing seven years here. I was blessed to play in front of a great Indiana fan base -- which, as you saw, showed up and showed out tonight. I'm grateful to have played in this organization, but ultimately I didn't achieve what I wanted to do here, so I moved on. Both sides moved on. So, let's all move on."" Pacers: ""It was the first time I've had a defender guard me like that since I've been on this team,"" Oladipo said after going 9 of 26 from the field. ""They were just trying to deny me and he (George) can move his feet.""","400975155"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Los Angeles Clippers needed someone to provide points and Lou Williams filled that role. Williams scored 31 points Wednesday night to lead the Clippers to a 106-95 victory over the Orlando Magic. ""We've had some guys go down with injuries and somebody has to step in and fill that scoring void,"" Williams said. ""I've been able to do it."" DeAndre Jordan added 16 points and 20 rebounds and the Clippers opened a four-game road trip with their third straight victory. The Clippers shot 54 percent in the second half in a matchup of injury-riddled teams. Much of the scoring power of both teams was sidelined by injuries, and guard Austin Rivers was added to the Clippers' injury list with a concussion. ""We don't have the luxury of talent where we're going to out-talent the other team. Every night we find somebody to help us score. Tonight Sam (Dekker) helped us. Lou was Lou,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Jonathon Simmons scored 20 points for the Magic, who have lost 14 of 17. Mario Hezonja added 17 points and nine rebounds in his second start of the season. Making only eight of their first 30 shots, the Clippers fell behind by 12 points midway through the second quarter. But Williams connected on three 3-pointers and Austin Rivers added one during a 14-0 run, and the Clippers (11-15) outscored Orlando 24-7 over the final seven minutes of the first half. ""I tend to earn the trust of my coaches,"" said Williams, who made 11 of 22 shots and added eight assists. ""This is my 13th year. I'm a veteran guy. Teams that sign me understand what they're getting and I don't think it's any different for Doc."" Nikola Vucevic hit a mid-range jumper to put the Magic (11-18) up 55-54 midway through the third quarter, but Williams answered quickly with a basket to regain the lead for the Clippers permanently. ""We got up 10 or 12, then didn't play with enough energy,"" said Vucevic, who had 14 points and 12 rebounds. ""There wasn't much excitement, there wasn't much going on. It was just flat out there. We could never get a good flow or good rhythm. Even if we get a block, we wouldn't run it down the court the way we can."" The shooting of Williams and Dekker, both of whom came off the bench, helped the Clippers expand their lead to 16 points with three minutes left. Austin Rivers left the game in the final seconds of the first half after running into the elbow of Simmons. He did not return and will not play in the Clippers' next game. TIP-INS Clippers: F Danilo Gallinari is not on the road trip due to a left glute contusion. ... F Blake Griffin missed his seventh straight game with a left MCL strain.

EVERY GAME IS DIFFERENT ""The one thing when you have all these injuries: Every game is different,"" said Doc Rivers. ""You can't plan on being the team you're going to be the next night.

"WASHINGTON --  John Wall helped the Washington Wizards avoid a bad loss. Wall had 13 points in his return from a sore knee, Bradley Beal scored 18 points and the Wizards held off the Memphis Grizzlies 93-87 on Wednesday night. Washington surrendered a 17-point third quarter lead and nearly continued its season-long trend of losing games to inferior teams. ""We have leads but we don't do a great job of stepping on teams' throats and just getting these teams out of the way,"" said Wall, who had four assists and a blocked shot in 27:37 of playing time. Unlike some other nights, the Wizards pulled this one out. Beal scored 11 points in the fourth quarter, hitting three 3-pointers. After the Grizzlies took their first lead of the night, 67-65, on James Ennis III's 3-pointer with 8:53 left to play, Washington responded with a 13-0 run and Memphis got no closer than 83-80 the rest of the way. ""When you're down at that point, you've got to play perfect,"" Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""And those 3s especially, they hurt you."" Wall missed nine games, with Washington going 4-5 in his absence and coming off a five-game trip that ended with a Tuesday night loss at Brooklyn. ""Just what I thought. He gave us a boost,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said about Wall. ""He made some amazing plays, blocked (a shot) like I've never seen a point guard do ever and he makes it look easy. He didn't have a lot of assists, but we didn't make a lot of shots for him."" Andrew Harrison led Memphis with 20 points, JaMychal Green had 15 points and15 rebounds, and Marc Gasol had 15 points and 10 rebounds. The Grizzlies have lost five straight and 16 out of 17.

He hit a corner 3 and followed by a driving dunk and a long 2-pointer to cap his personal 9-0 run and Washington eventually led 41-29 at halftime. The Wizards built the lead to 17 early in the third quarter, but Memphis rallied and Ben McLemore's 3-pointer tied it at 62 early in the fourth.

Irving added seven assists. It was his eighth game this season with 30 or more points. Jaylen Brown finished with 26 points and five rebounds. The Celtics improved to 13-2 at home this season.

The 124 points was a season-high for Boston. The Celtics shot a season-high 60 percent from the field. There were eight ties and six lead changes, but Boston never surrendered the lead in the second half.

He wore contacts Wednesday for the first time since accidentally scratching his cornea. He had been playing with protective goggles for three games. But he said the two versions he'd been using both had issues. One pair was fogging up too easily. The other started to become a hindrance and fit too tightly on his face, obstructing his peripheral vision. ""It's just uncomfortable with them. So I decided I was better off without them,"" he said. Doctors say he can wear his contacts for a few hours the next couple of days. The change even brought about a postgame joke from Stevens. ""We had some laughs in retrospect about that. `Retro-spec' about that,"" Stevens said. ""I said `retro-spec'. I've been thinking about that all week."" FIRST STEP Wednesday marked a milestone in Gordon Hayward's recovery process from his broken left ankle. He out of the walking booth he's been using since his surgery in October. He will continue to wear a protective brace. It's a promising step in is rehab, Stevens said, but he cautioned it's just the next one in an ongoing process. ""It's another box to check. There's a big difference in getting out of the boot and playing in an NBA game,"" Stevens said. ""He's got a long way to go. But it's good that he has these things as goals.

Lillard, who came into the game averaging 26.6 points, had only one field goal in the first 31 minutes because the Heat ganged up on him defensively. ""They were trying to show me a lot of attention, so I was just trying to make the right plays,"" he said. ""But down the stretch I knew I would have to get aggressive."" Lillard converted a three-point play to put the Trail Blazers ahead to stay, 98-95, and sank two free throws on their next possession for a five-point lead. ""You almost hate seeing him have a pedestrian box score stat line going into the fourth quarter,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""You know he's not going to sit back and not put his fingerprints on the game going down the stretch."" CJ McCollum scored 28 points for the Trail Blazers, who climbed back above .500 and improved to 7-5 on the road. ""That was a game we needed to win coming off five losses in a row,"" McCollum said.

"CHICAGO --  Nikola Mirotic is smiling again. The shots are falling. All the weightlifting work he did in the summer is paying off. The Chicago Bulls are winning. That infamous practice fight is beginning to fade into the background. Mirotic scored 29 points, Kris Dunn hit a clutch jumper with 22 seconds left and the Bulls beat the Utah Jazz 103-100 on Wednesday night for their fourth straight victory. ""I think right now, Niko has brought a confidence to this team,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. Mirotic made 11 of 18 shots from the field and grabbed nine rebounds in his best performance since he returned last week after missing the start of the season with facial fractures. The 6-foot-10 forward got hurt in a fight with teammate Bobby Portis, throwing the future of both players in question, but the Bulls are perfect since Mirotic returned to the court. ""We are enjoying playing the basketball together,"" Mirotic said. ""You can see good chemistry. The guys on the bench, they are all yelling, they've been happy. So I think after (what) we all get through, this team deserves it."" Robin Lopez added 16 points for Chicago (7-20), and Dunn finished with 13 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. Portis scored each of his nine points in the fourth after he got off to a slow start.

After Mitchell responded with a driving layup, Dunn made a stepback jumper over Alec Burks to restore the Bulls' four-point advantage. ""I believe in my game,"" Dunn said. ""The coaching staff believes in me, my teammates do. There's going to be times where there's going to be bad games, I understand that, but I am going to keep fighting."" Dunn, David Nwaba and Justin Holiday each missed a foul shot in the final seconds, giving Utah one more chance. But Mitchell missed a running 3-point try as time expired. ""I rushed it,"" Mitchell said. ""I should have shot it with two hands, first of all. I should have shot it like a regular pull-up."" Ricky Rubio added 14 points for Utah, which has dropped the first two on a six-game road trip. Burks finished with 13 points. ""We can't do it in spurts,"" Hood said. ""If we can't sustain it over 48 minutes, we're not going to win."" Utah trailed by as many 12 in the second quarter, but closed the half with a 17-6 run and kept up its solid play at the start of the third. Jonas Jerebko's reverse layup with 7:06 left gave the Jazz a 63-58 lead, leading to a timeout by the Bulls. TIP-INS Jazz: It was Mitchell's third game of his rookie season with at least 31 points. ... G/F Joe Johnson has been sidelined since Oct. 30 because of right wrist tendon instability, but he could return soon.

"NEW ORLEANS --  When DeMarcus Cousins was asked about his soaring, one-handed, put-back dunk in the fourth quarter, the Pelicans star took the opportunity to have a little fun at the expense of Pelicans teammate Jameer Nelson, sitting two lockers away. ""Well, I saw that Jameer was going to miss, so something just told me to keep going,"" said a chuckling Cousins, who got a running start from about the 3-point line on the play. ""But when it left his hand, it didn't look too good."" The thunderous, fourth-quarter jam, which brought roaring fans out of their seats, highlighted a 26-point, 13-rebound performance and sent New Orleans on its way to a 115-108 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. The Pelicans turned the ball over 21 times, with nine committed by Cousins, but the mercurial All-Star center came through in the clutch. His 3-pointer with 22 seconds left put the game virtually out of reach. In the minutes before that, he threw down not only his stunning putback, but also a two-handed slam which he set up with a spinning dribble around Milwaukee's Thon Maker. ""I'm not your guy that's soaring above the rim, but the opportunity kind of presented itself so I took advantage of it,"" Cousins said. Anthony Davis returned from a one-game absence caused by a nagging adductor injury to score 25 points on his usual diverse array of jumpers, layups and dunks, including an alley-oop set up by Cousins. Davis also grabbed 10 rebounds. ""Everything feels fine. Just excited we got the win,"" Davis said. ""We played great team defense toward the end of the game."" E'Twaun Moore hit four 3-pointers and finished with 21 points on 8-of-11 shooting for the Pelicans, who shot 56.3 percent (45 of 80). Cousins and Davis each hit 10 of 16 shots. Moore closed out his scoring with a soaring dunk with 1:41 left to help New Orleans pull away. That outing came one game after his career-high 36 points in Houston on Monday night. ""His confidence is very high,"" Davis said. ""He's playing at an elite level. He's shooting the ball from 3, mid-range, getting to the line, layups. He's playing well defensively."" Giannis Antetokounmpo had 32 points and nine rebounds for Milwaukee, which had its three-game winning streak snapped and lost for only the second time in eight games. The Bucks made only 8 of 27 3s. ""One thing we've got to learn is we need to move the ball and we need to make open shots,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""We didn't make open shots tonight. We missed some layups that we normally have made in the past. ""That was the one thing that slowed us down and we didn't do a good job of that tonight."" Khris Middleton had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Bucks. They led 94-87 after Malcolm Brogdon, who had 11 points, hit a 7-foot floater early in the fourth quarter. But the Bucks faded after that. New Orleans took the lead for good on Davis' reverse layup that made it 99-98 with 7:02 to go. TIP-INS Bucks: John Henson and Eric Bledsoe each scored 14 points. ... Fell to 6-7 on the road ... Have scored 100-plus points in 10 straight, going 7-3 in those games. ... Tied a season low with 10 turnovers. Pelicans: Darius Miller made three 3-pointers on five attempts for nine points. ...

TURNOVERS When asked about the Pelicans' struggles with turnovers, Cousins called himself ""the main culprit."" ""It just shows how good we could be if we cut down half our turnovers,"" he added. ""I definitely have to make better decisions with the ball. I take full responsibility for the high amount of turnovers on the night."" Not all of Cousins' passing attempts went in vain. He finished with seven assists.","400975161"
"PHOENIX --  DeMar DeRozan had already matched his season high with 37 points. With his team up four in the closing seconds, he was needed on the defensive end. DeRozan forced T.J. Warren to take a difficult one-handed floater from 12 feet out, and with the miss the Toronto Raptors sealed a 115-109 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night. ""I'm just understanding tendencies,"" DeRozan said. ""We did a great job, we got the rebound and we made our free throws."" The Raptors have won seven of eight, and at 18-8 tied the second-best start in team history through 26 games. DeRozan scored 18 points in the third quarter and Toronto led by as many as 15 before the Suns rallied in the fourth. ""It was on the starters and myself to come out (of halftime) with that energy and try to get us going,"" DeRozan said. Toronto was 3-1 on its four-game trip. Phoenix has lost five straight and seven of eight -- the last four losses with star guard Devin Booker sidelined by a groin injury. Serge Ibaka had 21 points and 13 rebounds, and Jonas Valanciunas added 20 points and 11 rebounds for the Raptors. ""JV (Valanciunas) was rolling to the basket, getting what he wanted,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""We just felt we needed rebounding."" Valanciunas said his job is simple. ""It doesn't matter which spot on the court I'm in. They pay me to fight for the rebounds,"" he said. Troy Daniels led the Suns with a season-high 32 points on 11-of-16 shooting, including 7 of 10 on 3-pointers. His 3 with 11:12 to go in the fourth quarter and short jumper moments later cut the Raptors' lead to 92-87, and the Suns took advantage of a long scoring drought for the Raptors to pull within three with 9:22 left. ""My teammates were finding me.  I had a couple go in early which is very important and then the rest were just falling,"" Daniels said. ""Even the ones I miss I think they are going in. I think as a shooter you have to think like that."" The Suns got as close as 111-109 with 22 seconds to play when Daniels knocked down a 17-footer. But DeRozan and Kyle Lowry each hit a pair of free throws in the final seconds. Greg Monroe added 17 points and 11 rebounds for Phoenix, and Warren had 17 points. The Suns went ahead 46-43 midway through the second quarter on the third 3-pointer of the night for Daniels, who scored 14 first-half points. The Raptors finished the half on a 15-6 run to take a 58-52 lead. ""Tried to keep him on the floor as much as we can,"" Suns coach Jay Triano said of Daniels. ""He's got an NBA skill of being able to really shoot the basketball and it's good to see him have a great night."" Toronto went up 79-68 on Ibaka's 3 with 5:24 left in the third. Lowry's first field goal of the game came at 3:56, when his 3 made it 82-68. Lowry missed his first five shots before that. INADVERTENT GOALTEND Suns center Alex Len leaped and grabbed a first-quarter shot from DeRozan that was on its descent. The ball was nowhere near going through the hoop, but Len was whistled for defensive goaltending and DeRozan was fouled on the shot, scoring a three-point play. TIP-INS Raptors: C Lucas Nogueira (right calf injury) and G Delon Wright (right shoulder) did not play. ... The Raptors swept the season series for the first time since the 2012-13 season. ... DeRozan has 86 career 30-point games, second-most in franchise history behind Vince Carter's 91.

SUNS' WINS HARD TO FIND The Suns (9-21) matched their longest losing streak of the season at five games. Guard Tyler Ulis was asked if efforts to come back like Wednesday's will lead to wins. ""We are tired of saying that. We are tired of hearing that,"" Ulis said. ""We want to get some wins. We are going out there fighting and playing our hearts out. We just want to come up with a couple.""","400975162"
"HOUSTON --  With the way Mike D'Antoni has handled Houston's rotation lately, there are times nine-time All-Star Chris Paul is left to run Houston's offense against second-team defenses. That combination proved the difference on Wednesday night when Paul led the Rockets to a huge run in the first half that helped them extend their NBA-best winning streak to 11 games with a 108-96 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. Paul scored a season-high 31 points and James Harden added 21 to help Houston to its 17th win in 18 games and improve to 22-4, the best record in the league. After allowing the Pelicans to stick around before putting them away late in their last game, the Rockets made sure this one was decided early. Houston led by one late in the first before scoring 25 straight points over the end of that quarter and the beginning of the second to make it 49-23 and cruise to the easy win. ""Chris comes in fresh (and) if I'm not mistaken something like 2:50 to go in the first quarter we go on a (25) to zip run. Game's over,"" D'Antoni said. With Harden on the bench, the Rockets scored the last 14 points of the first quarter, with the last nine from Paul, to turn a one-point lead into a 38-23 advantage entering the second quarter. Houston continued to pile on to start the second, scoring the first 11 points of the period to extend its run to 25-0 and make it 49-23 with 9:45 left in the half. The Rockets made six 3-pointers during that run, with three from Paul and one from Eric Gordon. Paul acknowledged that he looks to be more aggressive when he's without Harden. ""I sort of control the pace with that group,"" he said. ""Early in the game it's both me and James and we both pick our spots. With that second unit I sort of dictate the tempo. So I just take whatever's there."" Harden enjoyed watching the show Paul put on from the bench. ""We got stops and Chris got hot,"" he said. ""He was extremely aggressive. We just kind of rode that wave throughout the entire game."" The Hornets finally ended their scoring drought when Jeremy Lamb made a pair of free throws, but they didn't make a field goal until Kemba Walker hit a jumper with about eight minutes left in the second that made it 50-27. Dwight Howard tied a season high with 26 points and had 18 rebounds and three blocks as the Hornets continued to struggle on the road, where they've dropped nine of their last 10 dating to Oct. 30. ""There was that one stretch where we really struggled,"" interim coach Stephen Silas said. ""I think beyond that stretch we played pretty well and I think the score was actually our way. But it's been tough going on the road trying to win games and we're trying to figure it out."" Houston made 17 3-pointers and held the Hornets to just four. The Rockets had a 14-point lead at halftime and used a 9-2 run, with five points from Harden, to open the third quarter and make it 72-51. Charlotte scored eight straight points to cut the lead to 79-65 with about 3 1/2 remaining in the third. But Houston outscored the Hornets 12-4 to wrap up the quarter and take a 91-69 lead into the fourth. Harden and Paul each made a 3-pointer in that stretch and Gordon added two more. The Rockets led 63-49 at halftime. TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum returned after missing the last game with a sore left elbow. He had nine points and nine rebounds. ... Michael Carter-Williams received a technical at the end of the first quarter. ... Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added 18 points and 11 rebounds. Rockets: Trevor Ariza played despite dealing with a sore left foot. He had 13 points and six rebounds. ... Luc Mbah a Moute injured his left shoulder crashing to the court after a shot just before halftime and didn't return. D'Antoni said he'd have an MRI on Thursday. ... Paul added 11 assists and seven rebounds. THEY SAID IT Harden on if he thinks there's still room for the Rockets to improve: ""Of course. Even though we went on a 25-0 run, we allowed them to get confidence going into halftime so we've just got to be consistent. We can't give any teams hope, especially when we've got them down like that."" BLOCK PARTY Houston's Clint Capela had four blocks on Wednesday to give him three or more in 10 games this season after only doing it six times in 65 games last season. He ranks fifth in the NBA with 1.88 blocks a game and has also improved on offense this season. He leads the NBA in field goal percentage at 68 percent.","400975163"
"ATLANTA --  Leading the NBA's worst club by 21 points midway through the fourth quarter, Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy took no chances. He sent his starters back in. ""It's been two weeks of hell,"" Van Gundy said. ""I said, `We're going to make sure we get this one.' "" Andre Drummond had 12 points, 19 rebounds and a career-high nine assists, Tobias Harris added 19 points and Detroit snapped a seven-game slide with a 105-91 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night. Avery Bradley finished with 18 points and Langston Galloway scored 17 as Detroit won for the first time since beating Phoenix on Nov. 29. Ersan Ilyasova had 23 points, rookie John Collins scored 15 and Dennis Schroder had 10 assists for Atlanta, which dropped to 6-22 and has lost three in a row. The Pistons never trailed after Galloway's 3-pointer early in the second quarter. They led by 13 at halftime when Galloway hit a 20-footer in the closing seconds and went up by 22 on Reggie Bullock's floater midway through the third. Van Gundy knew Drummond needed just one assist for his first career triple-double, but said he didn't want to risk an injury to the 6-foot-11, 279-pound center and pulled him out with 1:59 remaining. Drummond was fine with the decision. ""I tried to get one more, but obviously the flow of the game didn't go that way,"" Drummond said. ""But a career night for me, so I'm pretty excited about that."" Detroit recovered from a 103-84 home loss Tuesday to Denver, a performance Van Gundy called one of the worst ""I've ever had to coach"" in over 850 career games. Bullock was promoted to the starting lineup after Sunday's 10-point home loss to Boston. He finished with 10 points in 24 minutes against Atlanta. Collins returned after missing the last six games with a sprained left shoulder. The first-round draft pick from Wake Forest is one of the few reasons for Hawks fans to cheer. ""He brings an athleticism,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""He brings a pop. Going to the offensive boards, the ability to put pressure on the rim, the pick-and-roll game and defensively, for his first game back, I'm really pleased with how he played.""

The sixth-year veteran has averaged just 3.6 points and 3.3 rebounds in nine games.

"NEW YORK -- Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson asked before facing the Knicks if anyone knew how to stop Kristaps Porzingis. The Nets never really did, and they couldn't beat New York even after the star forward was injured. Courtney Lee scored 18 of his 27 points in the second half, Michael Beasley added 15, and the Knicks held on to beat the Nets 111-104 on Thursday night after Porzingis left the game due to a sore left knee early in the second half. Replays showed Porzingis motioning to the bench with 9:25 remaining in the third after contesting a shot made by Brooklyn's Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. The Knicks' leading scorer had 13 points in nearly 18 minutes in the first half. ""It was one play when I actually made the pass out to the corner to Courtney and hit the 3. I felt my knee just kind of buckle maybe a little bit and I felt a little pain there,"" the 22-year-old from Latvia said. ""It's more of just being cautious. I had a little sharp pain there. I honestly don't have any more information about what is going on there, but it shouldn't be, hopefully, not too serious."" Porzingis added that he is unsure whether he would play Saturday night against Oklahoma City in Carmelo Anthony's first game back at Madison Square Garden after he was traded in September. Enes Kanter had 13 points and nine rebounds for the Knicks, who earned just their second road victory of the season. Their only other one was Oct. 29 at Cleveland. The second of four meetings this season had a lively atmosphere, especially late in the second half when Brooklyn made its push with Porzingis out for good. ""When KP went out, Mike really stepped up there for that stretch and got us buckets,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""Late in the game we said, `That's their run.' It was a battle. To me, as a coach, it was a great game to watch. Guys were flying around and hitting each other."" Spencer Dinwiddie had a career-high 26 points for the Nets, who have dropped the first two games to their city rivals. Hollis-Jefferson added a career-best 25 points on 10-for-16 shooting and Caris LeVert scored 15. ""We just couldn't make the plays down the stretch we needed to make,"" said Allen Crabbe, who shot just 1 for 8, including 1 for 7 from 3-point territory. The Nets made only 12 for 42 beyond the 3-point line. New York appeared on its way to an easy one after shooting 23 for 43 from the field and 6 for 13 from the 3-point line and leading by as many as 18 points in the first half. The Nets rallied to take an 82-79 lead on DeMarre Carroll's 3-pointer with 1:49 left in the third. But the Knicks went on an 8-0 run to close the quarter, capped by Lee's 3-point shot that increased their lead to 87-82 with 25 seconds left. Brooklyn trailed 100-97 with 3:29 to go before a 3-pointer by rookie Frank Ntilikina and an impressive defensive Knicks effort, contesting five straight shots, including a block by Ron Baker under the rim that forced a jump ball. Lance Thomas then sealed it with a 3 that made it 106-97 with 1:07 left. ""We were scrappy, man. We fought,"" Thomas said. ""Ron came in and gave us a really big boost and we were just tenacious tonight. We didn't want them to outdo us."" TIP-INS Knicks: Center Kyle O'Quinn had nine points and 10 rebounds. .

"CLEVELAND --  Lonzo Ball got an up-close look at the biggest baller of them all. LeBron James recorded his 59th career triple-double in front of Ball and his brothers, Kevin Love scored 28 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers won for the 16th time in 17 games, 121-112 over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night. James finished with 25 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists to move into a tie with Larry Bird for sixth place on the career triple-doubles list. James also put the Lakers away in the final minutes with a dunk and short runner, leading Cleveland to its 10th straight home win. For Ball, his first on-court encounter with James was eye-opening. ""Watching him doesn't do him justice,"" Ball said. ""He has that size, that speed. I'd say he's the best player in the world right now."" James, who has been complimentary of the 20-year-old Ball in the past, met with the Lakers highly touted rookie on the floor following the game. As cameras recorded the moment, James and Ball, whose all-around games and backgrounds are very similar, covered their mouths so the world couldn't listen in on their conversation. James said he was humbled to learn the former UCLA star patterned his game after him. James has become a fan of Ball's game. ""It's always team,"" James said when asked what he admires most about Ball. ""He passes the ball. Pushes the ball up the floor. Someone you want to play with. This is a team game. Everyone gets so caught up in this whole individual thing and it's, the whole team game gets overlooked, but then, I'm not going to go there."" Love scored 13 in the third quarter, when the Cavs opened an 11-point lead. Jose Calderon added a season-high 17 points for Cleveland. Brandon Ingram scored 26 for the Lakers and Ball had 13 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. The first game between James and Ball had the buildup of a playoff game as the world's best player matched up against a budding star. Ball's father, LaVar, did not attend the game but his brothers, LiAngelo and LaMelo, sat behind L.A's bench. LaVar Ball launched his ""Big Baller Brand"" to promote his three talented sons. James gave the family a lesson in the business of basketball. Of course, James' impending free agency has led to speculation he may sign with the Lakers. Because of his connections to Los Angeles (he owns a film production company, and recently bought another home there) and some Twitter posts he's made about Ball, the Lakers are believed to be a potential landing spot for the three-time NBA champion, who scoffed at the conjecture about his future or his relationship with Ball. ""I see all the stupid noise that happens,"" he said. ""You know I can't buy a home in L.A., I can't live in L.A. It's funny noise. But I don't get involved in it.

I forgot he's like the king of Instagram and Twitter. So it doesn't matter if he said a letter, it was going to be taken more highly regarded than my comeback. Like I told, I didn't think his caption was very good. At least respect me and give me a better caption than that."" OUTFOXXED Fox left the game in the first quarter with a left quadriceps injury and didn't return. Fox, the No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft, was on the ground stretching with trainers before being declared out. Joerger didn't have an update on Fox's status after the game. Fox entered the game averaging 10 points and a team-high 3.9 assists.","400975167"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  After his brilliant game, Omri Casspi returned to the court to sing a Hanukkah prayer along with hundreds of fans and then took his turn lighting the large menorah on night three of the festival of lights -- and on Jewish Heritage Night at Oracle Arena. A veteran forward from Israel, Casspi earned another start for the injury-plagued defending champions and posted his 17th career double-double with season bests of 17 points and 11 rebounds, helping send the Golden State Warriors past the Dallas Mavericks 112-97 on Thursday for their eighth straight win. ""My family's in town always for Hanukkah, so it's always fun to have family around,"" he said, adding of his role, ""Same mindset, just play hard. I want to stay sharp, stay ready whenever I'm called upon."" Kevin Durant led the way for the Warriors with 36 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. Klay Thompson scored 25 points, making all five of his 3-pointers and shooting 10 for 18 overall as the Warriors pulled away in the third quarter. The Warriors are still down three starters in Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Zaza Pachulia, while Nick Young joined the sidelined group with a concussion sustained in Monday night's win over Portland. Dirk Nowitzki had 18 points and nine rebounds, and Harrison Barnes added 16 points and seven boards against his former team. ""They're a talented team and we let a few miscommunications let them get a run going, and we just couldn't really stop them,"" Barnes said. Golden State rookie Jordan Bell provided an all-around solid performance in his fourth career start with eight points, a season-best eight assists, six rebounds and two steals. Durant also blocked two shots in his fourth 30-point game of the season and third in the last four. Golden State won its 10th in a row against the Mavericks at Oracle Arena and eighth consecutive in the series overall.

""I'm not going to say 100 percent I'll be back, but it's looking like it,"" he told the Dallas Morning News after Thursday's morning shootaround. Carlisle has heard hints that's how his big man is leaning. ""This is kind of what he has been saying all along,"" Carlisle said. ""We're about a third of the way through, and he is feeling good, which is great. I'm hoping like crazy that he plays another year because having him here is one of the really special experiences in coaching. As far as the message it sends to the other guys, it's pretty clear that if you want to be as good as you possibly can be in this league, do what this guy does on a day-to-day basis -- everything from diet and nutrition to taking care of your body to doing everything possible to keep your skill level where it needs to be. He's impeccable, the best I've ever seen."" OUCH! Sitting courtside, Peggy Mizono took a third-quarter bad pass by the Mavericks to the left eye and face area. She appreciated Durant and Bell checking on her, and KD even kissed Mizono's cheek. Warriors owner Joe Lacob and athletic trainer Chelsea Lane each delivered ice bags. ""That hurts, I don't care who you are,"" Thompson said. ""It doesn't feel good when a basketball comes at your head."" ""That's awesome,"" coach Steve Kerr said of his players' care. Durant also kissed a woman in Oklahoma City in November 2012 when his own errant pass hit her in the forehead.","400975168"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Playing without two injured post players on Friday night against the Charlotte Hornets, the Miami Heat turned to perimeter shooting from its bench for scoring punch. Tyler Johnson and Wayne Ellington delivered to lift Miami to a .500 record with a 104-98 victory. Johnson and Ellington scored 16 points each in Miami's 24th win in its past 30 games against Charlotte (10-18), which opened a stretch of six of seven home games with a loss. Johnson and Ellington combined for 10-of-16 shooting on 3-pointers. With center Hassan Whiteside and forward Justise Winslow back home with knee injuries, Johnson and Ellington routinely hit 3-pointers at points in the game the Hornets appeared poised to make a comeback. ""It's very, very helpful to have that,"" said the Heat's Kelly Olynyk, who, along with Josh Richardson, James Johnson and Bam Adebayo, scored 11 points. ""That second unit is tough to guard. They're making guys pay."" Dion Waiters scored 12 for the Heat. ""They showed their depth tonight,"" Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas said. ""They had seven guys in double figures and no one over 16 points. When you play like that, it's a winning combination."" Kemba Walker led Charlotte with 23 points after aggravating a wrist injury and leaving the game in the first half. He returned to start the second half with his left wrist wrapped, and his 3-pointer with 3:16 left pulled Charlotte within 100-93 after trailing by 17. ""As soon as Kemba Walker hit that one 3-pointer, I turned to the bench and said, `Uh-oh,"" said coach Erik Spoelstra, who tied Pat Riley's career win record for Miami. ""I like our guys having to go through all that stress and anxiety and have to execute under duress and under the pressure in context of a close game."" Walker drew a foul against Johnson, his fifth, with 2:02 left. His free throws closed the gap to 100-96, and Dwight Howard's driving layup brought the Hornets within 100-98. Waiters hit a fadeaway for Miami's first basket in more than 2 minutes and a 102-98 lead. Miami pulled away with free throws from Goran Dragic for the final margin. ""We have to find a way to be consistent and win these games,"" said Hornets guard Nicolas Batum, who struggled to a 2-for-7 shooting performance but finished with a season-high tying 10 assists. ""It's right there. We have to find a way to create for other guys."" Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shot 6 of 8 for 13 points for Charlotte, which has lost five of its past six. Howard recorded his fourth double-double in five games for Charlotte with 15 points and 16 rebounds. It was his 16th double-double this season. TIP-INS Heat: Whiteside (knee), who has missed eight consecutive games, returned to practice on Thursday. Hornets: The Hornets last won the series against Miami in 2009-2010. Miami leads the season series 2-0. MICKEY'S DEVELOPMENT: F Jordan Mickey nearly gave Miami four double-digit scorers off the bench. Mickey, who has spent time working on skill development with Juwan Howard, shot 4 of 6 with seven rebounds in more than 15 minutes on the court. ""He's in the best shape that he's been in this past week,"" Spoelstra said. ""All of his testing has been phenomenal and that is what you want of your young players. You never know when you're going to get an opportunity."" TROUBLE WITH THE 3: Miami (11 for 31, 35.5 percent) shot slightly lower than Charlotte (10 for 27, 37 percent) from 3-point range, but the timing made the difference. Heat shooters found open shots on defensive lapses off penetration all night. ""We were biting on shot fakes, they were driving by us,"" Silas said. ""They had isolations, they were driving by us. It wasn't necessarily the rim protection, it was the drive and kicks. That's the problem that I see and it's a recurring issue that we've had.""","400975169"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Detroit Pistons refused to blow another big lead in Indiana. Andre Drummond finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds, and Detroit withstood another late rally to beat the Pacers 104-98 on Friday night. Reggie Bullock finished with 15 points for Detroit, which let a 22-point cushion get away last time it was in Indianapolis. ""I thought we fought through a lot at the end,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""They went on a big run and our guys just hung in there and fought through the pressure. We just kept playing and got some big shots down the stretch. I would've taken a 15-point win, but I think to be good you have to be able to win in different ways."" The Pistons had their biggest lead of the game at 95-79 with 9:12 to play before the Pacers put together a late offensive surge. Indiana outscored Detroit 19-5 during the final eight minutes and had a chance to take the lead on Myles Turner's 3-point attempt with less than 30 seconds left, but the shot fell short and Detroit grabbed the rebound. Victor Oladipo had 26 points and eight rebounds for Indiana. Turner added 24 points and eight boards. Drummond's biggest basket of the night came with about four minutes to play when he was fouled on a follow shot after Ish Smith missed a jumper. Drummond made his free throw, which gave Detroit a 100-93 lead. ""Andre was big tonight,"" Van Gundy said. ""That three-point play was a monster play."" The Pistons jumped out quickly behind Drummond, who dominated inside with eight points and eight rebounds during the first quarter. The Pistons led Indiana 27-19 at the end of the period. The Pistons led by as many as 14 points during the first half, but Indiana closed with a 21-9 scoring run that gave the Pacers a 54-52 lead at halftime. Detroit opened the second half on a 7-0 run. The Pistons then ended the third quarter on a 13-4 run and entered the fourth quarter with an 86-74 lead. The Pacers never led by more than four points. ""We did dig a hole tonight,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We've got to stay together and understand that in situations like that when you're playing from behind, one guy is not going to be able to do it. And you've got to do it together."" TIP-INS Pistons: Avery Bradley was held out of Friday night's game due to a right adductor (groin) strain. Bradley went through pregame warmups with the team before notifying Van Gundy he was not able to play. ... After starting the season 10-3, the Pistons have gone 6-10, including two straight wins. ... Drummond recorded his 20th double-double of the season. Pacers: Indiana is 11-7 against Eastern Conference opponents, with five wins coming against Central Division rivals. RELIABLE RESERVES Every one of Detroit's reserves scored on Friday night. The Pistons' bench outscored Indiana's 43-22. Stanley Johnson led all Detroit reserves with 13 points, Langston Galloway scored 11 and Anthony Tolliver finished with nine points. STAN VAN-TASTIC Van Gundy earned his 500th career win. Van Gundy has compiled a 500-354 record over 12 seasons in the NBA, which includes prior stints with the Heat and Magic. In his fourth season with Detroit, Van Gundy also serves as the organization's president of basketball operations.","400975170"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Portland Trail Blazers quietly have been one of the best defensive teams in the NBA this season, something they have reminded opponents of the last two games. Portland limited Orlando to 38.6 percent shooting and made enough plays in the final minute to hold on for a 95-88 victory on Friday night. Damian Lillard led the winners with 21 points and C.J. McCollum had 20. Al-Farouq Aminu added 15 points and Jusuf Nurkic had nine points and 11 rebounds. ""We had certain games where the defense wasn't good, but the second half against Miami (Wednesday) and tonight it was pretty solid throughout,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. It was the second straight game that Portland held the opponent under 100 points. Those two victories followed a five-game losing streak during which opponents averaged 113.4 points against the Trail Blazers. ""Every year, for every team, adversity hits at some point and I feel like it was just hitting for us,"" Lillard said. ""We hadn't been defending well, we hadn't been playing good offensively."" Nikola Vucevic led Orlando with 26 points and 14 rebounds. Johnathon Simmons had 15 points for the Magic, who have lost four straight and 15 of their last 18. Aaron Gordon, who was returning to the Magic lineup after missing two games with a concussion, limped off the court with 7:45 left in the game and the Magic trailing 85-69. He strained his calf after colliding with Trail Blazers rookie Zach Collins. He finished with 13 points and six rebounds. Orlando trailed by 17 with just over seven minutes left in the game, but cut it to five with three minutes to go before the rally petered out. ""We had some droughts early in the game and then you're fighting uphill and need the fourth quarter to be almost perfect,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""We had some good possessions, played the right way and just didn't get the payoff. We've got to finish better."" Lillard had 13 points in the third quarter when Portland slipped away from the Magic. The point guard was too quick for Orlando's Elfrid Payton and created all four of his field goals off the dribble and got Payton to foul him on a 3-pointer. But the Blazers couldn't put enough distance between themselves and the Magic even after running off 11 straight points to take an 86-69 lead with 7:28 left in the game. Orlando responded by scoring 12 straight points, the last basket a layup by Vucevic that made it 86-81 with just over 3 minutes to go. The Magic took advantage of five Portland turnovers during the final quarter. ""Obviously that stretch was a little unsettling,"" Stotts said. ""We had a lot of poor offensive possessions. Give (Orlando) a little bit of credit defensively, but we were turning the ball over."" Nurkic ended a nearly five-minute drought for Portland by powering inside for a layup that gave the Trail Blazers a seven-point lead. The teams traded baskets the rest of the way, with Orlando never getting closer than five. Aminu settled the matter with an uncontested dunk with 23 seconds to go. TIP-INS TRAIL BLAZERS: Aminu is 18 of 31 on 3-pointers in his last five games. ... Nurkic returned after missing three games with an ankle sprain. He played 25 minutes. MAGIC: The Magic haven't won a game this season (0-9) when they score less than 100 points. ...  Rookie Johnathan Isaac practiced Thursday, but was held out of the game by team doctors. Isaac has missed 17 games with an ankle injury. ... Evan Fournier (ankle), Terrence Ross (knee) and Aaron Afflalo (back) were inactive.","400975171"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Russell Westbrook said goodbye to a three-overtime thriller and trolled Joel Embiid with a smile and a wave. ""I was telling him, `Go home,"" Westbrook said. Embiid irked Westbrook earlier in the game when the 76ers' social media star waved goodbye toward the crowd once Oklahoma City center Steven Adams fouled out. Westbrook got the last laugh, and capped his triple-double, 52-minute effort with the final assist of the game, and the Thunder pulled out a 119-117 victory on Friday night. The early contender for NBA game of the year was led by perhaps the game of Embiid's career. Embiid scored 34 points in 49 minutes with an achy back, saved the game in the first overtime with a block on Westbrook and trash talked Carmelo Anthony. He waved his arms and exhorted the crowd to get louder with each chant of ""Trust the Process!"" ""I'm not about to get in a back-and-forth with him,"" Westbrook said. ""I'm not about to give him my energy."" Westbrook had an off night from the floor (10 of 33; missed a driving dunk at the end of regulation), yet finished with 27 points, 17 rebounds and 15 assists. He even saved Andre Roberson from goat status in the third OT. Roberson failed to even look at the basket and then missed a layup in a stunning sequence to close the second OT, then earned redemption when Westbrook fed him for the winner with 10 seconds left in the game. ""Just trusting it,"" Westbrook said. It's a twist on the Sixers catchphrase popularized during Embiid's absence over his first two seasons with injuries. Embiid, Philly's franchise center, grabbed his lower back when he took a hard foul on a drive to the basket in the fourth quarter. Embiid grimaced during timeouts on the bench and trudged into position a few times. Embiid, who said he just needed treatment, brushed off Westbrook's wave and took a shot at the Thunder guard's stats. ""They did a lot of things. But, I mean, the dude shot 10 for 33. I wish I would had shot 33 times. I guess we would have had a better chance of actually winning the game,"" Embiid said ""But he told me to go home. This is my home. I ain't going nowhere."" Embiid sucked it up and carried the Sixers in the fourth and the first overtime. His feed to a charging Ben Simmons on the baseline for a two-handed dunk tied the score at 94-all with 53 seconds left in the quarter. The Sixers closed the fourth on an 11-0 run. Embiid scored the first bucket of OT and the Sixers led for the first time in the game. The Sixers' five-point lead with 1:20 left in overtime was wiped out on Paul George's 3-pointer and a Westbrook bucket that made it 102-all. The Sixers blew their final possession on an ill-conceived 3 for Dario Saric. Round 2 was just as fun. Westbrook and Robert Covington exchanged 3s and George tied it at 109 on a driving layup. Westbrook and Embiid swapped buckets that kept it even and the Sixers had one more chance to win it Embiid lost the ball late in the second OT. Embiid and Westbrook combined to score eight straight points in the third overtime, and Embiid waved see-ya later when Adams fouled out of the game. But Embiid seemed gassed at the end and there's no telling how the heavy workload may affect his availability the rest of the week. The Sixers were featured on ESPN on Friday as part of Philadelphia All Access, and Sixers' related content was aired throughout the day on all platforms. ""I'm not a fan,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""I like living behind closed doors."" But Brown understood the exposure would help build the brand and serve as a recruiting pitch of sorts to any free agents intrigued about becoming part of The Process. The Sixers put on a show in the fourth until Embiid gave them a scare. Embiid's health woes have dogged him since his college career at Kansas and every slip, ache or bump throws Sixers fans into a panic. Embiid has been banged-up lately but he calmly went to the line after he smacked the court and made both free throws. He fell again when he tripped over Adams, who earned a foul, and sank two more free throws to make it 78-72. TIP-INS Thunder: Roberson had missed two games with a sprained left ankle. ... Coach Billy Donovan was drilled in the face on an errant no-look pass -- as in, Donovan wasn't looking -- by Sixers forward Richaun Holmes. 76ers: F Robert Covington shot three airballs in the first half. MELO BACK Carmelo Anthony warmed-up for his New York homecoming with 24 points. Anthony cracked the 20-point mark for only the second time in his last 10 games and perhaps gave Knicks fans a glimpse of what's ahead when he returns to Madison Square Garden on Saturday. Anthony had struggled headed into Friday's game, averaging just 17.7 points on 40 percent shooting. He made 11 of 17 shots. ""I became entrenched into not just the Knicks but the city as a whole,"" Anthony said. ""Those are my roots. The people there, I became one of them. I've embraced New York City, I've embraced the culture."" 50 MINUTE MEN Adams, Westbrook, JJ Redick and Simmons all played 50-plus minutes.","400975172"
"WASHINGTON --  For the second time in a week Mike Scott was almost perfect. Both times it happened against the Los Angeles Clippers. Scott tied a season-high with 22 points while Bradley Beal added 20 as the Washington Wizards held off the Clippers 100-91 on Friday night. ""He loves to play against the Clippers, I know that,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks joked after Scott went a combined 18 for 23 from the field as Washington split two games with the Clippers over the last seven days. Scott scored 10 points in the third quarter, hitting four of his five shots from the field. Scott, who averages 8.4 points per game, has made 34 of 43 shots over the last six games for the Wizards. ""Just in a zone,"" Scott said when trying to explain his recent shooting surge. ""I didn't think I'd be shooting like this either."" John Wall scored 15 points on just 5-for-16 shooting in his second game back after a nine-game absence but scored seven points as the Wizards closed the game on an 18-9 run after Los Angeles had come back to tie the game at 82 on a 3-pointer by Lou Williams. ""He made big plays for us down the stretch,"" Brooks said about Wall. ""He's a gamer, he's a closer."" For Wall and the Wizards, the scene of blowing a large lead against a team under .500 was almost all too familiar. ""We always show these lapses,"" Wall said after the Wizards built up double-digit leads in all four quarters only to once again wait until the end to seal the victory. Washington is 8-8 against teams under .500 including home losses to the Mavericks and Suns. Williams led the Clippers with 23 points while rookie Jawun Evans had a career-high 15 points as Los Angeles had a three-game winning streak snapped. DeAndre Jordan had 12 points and 16 rebounds. ""That's all you can ask,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said about his team's ability to come all the way back from 18 down to tie things up in the fourth quarter despite missing multiple starters. ""We're just going to try to stay in games and steal them at the end. That's what we tried to do tonight."" The Clippers are 0-8 when trailing after the third quarter on the road and just 2-13 overall. Otto Porter Jr. left the game with 8:56 remaining in the first half after picking up two fouls. A few minutes later Porter went to the locker room with a trainer and missed the rest of the game with a right thigh bruise, finishing with a season-low 3 minutes and two points. Brooks said Porter is day-to-day. Los Angeles erased the majority of an 18-point deficit to pull within 48-43 at the half. TIP-INS Clippers: G Milos Teodosic was out with a minutes restriction from an earlier plantar fascia injury while G Austin Rivers was out in the concussion protocol. ... Doc Rivers used his 11th different starting lineup in 27 games. Wizards: F Markieff Morris returned to the starting lineup after missing Wednesday's win over Memphis with right hip soreness. ... Wall missed his first two free throws after going 0 for 4 from the line against Memphis and finished 3 for 5. NO DUNKING In an effort to keep Wall healthy, Brooks has instituted a no dunking policy during practice for the four-time All-Star even though he admitted it will be hard to enforce. Upon hearing the rule during pre-game Doc Rivers joked: ""Well, Scotty's used to that because he had that policy for his whole career as a player."" Wall didn't have a dunk against the Clippers.","400975173"
"BOSTON --  The Utah Jazz broke out of a slump that has been plaguing them during their current road trip. But it came at the cost of two of their starters -- one possibly for an extended period. Ricky Rubio had 22 points, Donovan Mitchell added 17 points, nine assists and five rebounds, and the Utah Jazz beat the Boston Celtics 107-95 on Friday night. Jonas Jerebko and Rodney Hood also finished with 17 points for the Jazz, who snapped a four-game losing streak. It was Utah's first victory in Boston since 2008, a span of nine games. It took everything the Jazz had to make it to the end of the game. Jazz center Rudy Gobert left early in the first quarter with a left knee injury after teammate Derrick Favors fell backward into his leg. Gobert was able to walk off the court on his own power, but went straight to the locker room and did not return. The second quarter brought more injuries. First, Boston's Daniel Theis left with a facial injury. Later, the Celtics' Jaylen Brown caught Favors with an incidental elbow, leaving him bleeding from his left eye and Brown from his elbow. Favors received six stitches and did not return. ""That's a team win. Everybody stepped up,"" Rubio said. ""We know that we have a lot of players who can play, and they were ready."" Coach Quin Snyder said Favors passed the concussion protocol. Gobert will be evaluated Saturday. ""This group's got character and they are going to compete no matter what the circumstances and they did,"" Snyder said. Boston got no closer than eight points in final quarter. Kyrie Irving led the Celtics with 33 points. Al Horford added 21 points and seven assists. Boston lost for the third time in five games. ""I gotta give Utah credit, because they grinded the game and they made tough shot after tough shot,"" Horford said.  ""They kind of, like, took the life out of you in a way."" Friday was the first meeting between the teams since Gordon Hayward left Utah in free agency last summer to join the Celtics. But Hayward could only watch as he continues to rehab from the broken left ankle he suffered in Boston's season opener. Joe Johnson returned to game action for the first time since Oct. 30. He missed 21 straight games while dealing with a right wrist injury. TIP-INS Jazz: G Raul Neto sat out his second straight game with a concussion. Celtics: It was Irving's ninth game this season with 30 or more points. ... Started the second quarter 0 for 14 from the field. TAKING CONTROL The Jazz held a 46-39 lead at the half. They were led by Rubio and Hood, who scored 12 and 11 points, respectively, and shot a combined 10 for 13 from the field. The Jazz led by as many as 10 in the half and outscored the Celtics 25-13 in the second quarter. The Celtics struggled from the field in the second quarter, shooting a combined 4 for 21. HAYWARD RETURN? Hayward is open to playing this season, but said it will depend on how fast he is able to heal and show progress as he works his way back. ""My mind is open to that,"" Hayward said of the possibility of returning to game action before season's end. ""I'm trying to get back as fast as I can. It all depends on how I heal, and taking it day-by-day, goal by goal. We'll see what happens."" Wednesday marked a milestone in Hayward's recovery process, when he was able to shed the walking boot he's been using since his surgery in October. He continues to wear a protective brace. NO HARD FEELINGS Snyder said no one feels any animosity over Hayward's decision to leave Utah. ""I think everybody understands the decision that he made,"" Snyder said. ""So to see him get hurt, it was hard. I felt horrible for him. I think most of the guys on our team reached out. I know I did. ... We hope that he's back soon."" MORRIS UPDATE Marcus Morris (knee soreness) sat out his fourth straight game and won't travel for the upcoming two-game trip. Morris has played in just 16 games this season while dealing with the injury and recently sought a second opinion on it. ""He's had a little bit of a setback here, but it doesn't sound like it's going to be a long-term thing,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said.","400975174"
"TORONTO --  With Kyle Lowry one rebound from a triple-double, Raptors coach Dwane Casey gave his point guard two minutes of fourth-quarter court time to complete the feat. In the end, Lowry got the job done in 98 seconds. Lowry had his 11th career triple-double, DeMar DeRozan scored 31 points and Toronto won its ninth straight meeting with Brooklyn by routing the Nets 120-87 on Friday night. Toronto led 91-64 through three quarters, but Lowry convinced his coach to let him keep playing a little longer. ""If he hadn't gotten it in two minutes, he wasn't going to do it,"" Casey said. ""I don't want to do anything to mess with the game or try to disrespect Brooklyn."" Lowry grabbed the ball after Norman Powell's missed layup at 10:22 of the fourth, leading to a rousing celebration on Toronto's bench. ""He really wanted it and I'm glad he got what he wanted,"" DeRozan said. It was the second triple-double of the season for Lowry, who finished with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists. Lowry's previous triple-double came against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 27. ""As long as it comes with a win, that's all that matters,"" Lowry said. Serge Ibaka scored 18 points and Jonas Valanciunas had 14 as Toronto won its eighth consecutive home game and improved its NBA-best home record to 10-1. ""We want to make this a tough place to play,"" Casey said. ""We want people to talk about not wanting to come to Toronto and play."" Nik Stauskas scored 22 points in his Brooklyn debut and Isaiah Whitehead had 13 for the Nets in their most lopsided defeat of the season. Brooklyn's previous worst loss was a 107-86 blowout at New York on Oct. 27. The Nets lost by more than 14 points for the second time. Toronto scored a season-high 74 points in the paint. ""They were in the paint all night,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It was drives and we didn't protect the rim at all."" Norman Powell and Jakob Poeltl each scored 11 points for the Raptors, who played without forward C.J. Miles (sore left shoulder). Nets guard Allen Crabbe (sore left knee) and forward DeMarre Carroll (rest) both got the night off. Brooklyn was playing the second game of a back-to-back, and its third in four days. With Carroll and Crabbe unavailable, Brooklyn's recently acquired duo of Jahlil Okafor and Stauskas made their debuts. Both arrived in a Dec. 8 trade with Philadelphia. Stauskas made five of his seven 3-point attempts, but the rest of the Nets shot 2 for 16 from long range. Okafor had 10 points and four rebounds in 23 minutes on his 22nd birthday. He had played just 25 minutes all season before Friday. ""I felt rusty, had some cobwebs on me, but just to be able to get out there, run up and down and play basketball, was great,"" Okafor said. Stauskas scored 12 points on three 3-pointers and a three-point play as the Nets took a brief lead with a 14-0 run to begin the second, but Toronto closed the quarter with a 19-4 spurt to lead 58-44 at halftime. ""That starting group came in and it went from two points to 16 real quick,"" Atkinson said. ""That was kind of lights out and then they dominated us from there."" TIP-INS Nets: Committed 24 turnovers, one shy of their season worst. Toronto scored 35 points off Brooklyn's miscues. ... Crabbe and Carroll are both expected to return for Sunday's game against Indiana. Raptors: Lowry has nine of the 21 triple-doubles in Raptors history, more than any other player. ... G Delon Wright returned after missing the previous 12 games because of a dislocated right shoulder and scored seven points in 16 minutes. SAVVY TRAVELERS Toronto has just three road games remaining against Western Conference opponents, all of them in the Central time zone.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies avoided dropping into the Western Conference cellar by beating the worst team in the East. And it took every last second to secure the win over the Atlanta Hawks. Tyreke Evans scored 22 points, including the go-ahead layup with 1:03 left, as the Grizzlies snapped a five-game skid with a 96-94 victory over the Hawks on Friday night. But there were a lot of deep breaths in the closing seconds. The Hawks attempted three shots in the final 3.5 seconds, all of which misfired, including Andrew Harrison's deflection of Taurean Prince's attempt in the left corner with about 1.2 seconds left. The ball went into Kent Bazemore's hands and his 3-point attempt at the horn bounced off the front of the rim. ""All I was thinking was don't let them get it up,"" Harrison said of his defense in the closing seconds. Mario Chalmers added 16 points and had four steals for Memphis, while Marc Gasol scored 13 points. The loss left the Hawks with the worst record in the NBA, while the win helped Memphis stay above the Dallas Mavericks, who sit at the bottom of the West. ""Winning always feels better than losing,"" Memphis interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said with relief, later adding: ""I think some plays went our way."" Bazemore led the Hawks with 19 points, while Dennis Schroder finished with 18 points and 11 assists. Prince contributed 17 points as Atlanta dropped its fourth straight. ""Tough loss,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I felt like we played well enough for more of the game, for 48 minutes, but we weren't able to come away with the win. We needed to make a few more plays down the stretch."" The first half was representative of a contest between two of the worst teams in the league, with a total of 24 turnovers and both shooting 44 percent. A few more made free throws for Atlanta and a couple of extra 3-pointers gave the Hawks a 47-40 lead at intermission. Memphis trailed 89-81 with just over 6 minutes left when it reeled off eight straight, capped by Chalmers' 3-pointer to tie the game at 89. Chalmers converted another 3-pointer with 1:45 to go, tying the game at 94, setting the stage for Evans' go-ahead basket. ""We kind of weathered the storm,"" Bazemore said of the game. ""I think we took a step forward as a team. We didn't get the win, but there was a lot of good stuff."" TIP-INS Hawks: Schroder's 11 assists marked the second straight night he has reached at least 10. ... Ersan Ilyasova finished with nine points. He entered the game having scored at least 20 in three of last four games. ... Marco Belinelli finished with 14 points, converting 5 of 9 shots. Grizzlies: Evans returned after missing Wednesday's game in Washington with right hip soreness. ... Memphis committed 14 turnovers in the first half, a season high. The Grizzlies' 22 turnovers for the game also were a season high. ... Gasol, who scored all 13 of his points in the third quarter, has reached double figures in all but one game this season, a victory over Houston on Oct. 28. ... JaMychal Green grabbed 12 rebounds, including four off the offensive glass. THREE-POINT PRINCE Prince made a career-high five 3-pointers in the game. His previous high was four on Nov. 11 against the Wizards. ""We're really encouraging him to shoot 3s,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think that will open up his drive game and other things he can do. That's what we really want from him."" THREE-POINT GRIZZLIES Memphis finished the game 12 of 25 from outside the arc, but the success fell to four players. Gasol made both of his 3-pointers, while Harrison converted all three of his. Evans and Chalmers missed only one 3-point shot each, Evans going 4 of 5 and Chalmers making 3 of 4. FINAL WORD Asked about what he was thinking during the flurry of Atlanta shots in the closing few seconds, Bickerstaff replied: ""There were some things going through my head that I don't want to say.""","400975176"
"MILWAUKEE --  Bobby Portis says it's fun playing with Nikola Mirotic, his Chicago Bulls teammate who suffered facial fractures when the two fought in October. Despite their troubles earlier this season, they made for an impressive duo Friday night against the Milwaukee Bucks. Portis scored a career-high 27 points and grabbed 12 rebounds as the Bulls won their fifth consecutive game, beating the Bucks 115-109. The winning streak coincides with the return of Mirotic, who had 22 points. ""Me and Niko, we don't really care about that situation anymore,"" Portis said about their fight. ""Everything's for the team. We're professionals, we're basketball players and this is our job. ""Ultimately, we have to come in here every day, put our shoes on and play together, find a way to make it work,"" he said. ""I feel we've done that up until this point."" Mirotic made a wildly off-balance 5-footer while being fouled and converted the free throw to give the Bulls a 112-107 lead with 1:07 to go. ""We both have stepped up,"" Mirotic said. ""I think we've learned how to play with each other."" Eric Bledsoe and Rashad Vaughn each missed a 3-pointer for Milwaukee in the final minute. Mirotic made three free throws over the last 13 seconds to seal the victory. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 29 points and 16 rebounds for the Bucks, who lost for just the third time in nine games. Khris Middleton also scored 29, while Bledsoe had 12 points and seven assists. Milwaukee's guards struggled offensively. Bledsoe shot 5 of 13 in 34 minutes, while reserve Malcolm Brogdon went just 3 for 12 in 32 minutes. ""Honestly, I thought it was just one of those nights where me and Eric were just out of rhythm,"" Brogdon said. ""I didn't think they did a specifically good job on us. There are just games where you are out of rhythm and it happens."" In addition, Vaughn played 28 minutes and shot only 3 of 10, including 2 for 8 on 3-pointers. ""He got a lot of wide-open shots that we all think he can make,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""They just didn't go down for him. I thought he was good out there while he was on the floor. He's got to be able to knock down those wide-open shots."" Portis hit a pair of foul shots to give Chicago the lead for good, 106-104, with 2:58 left. After a Milwaukee turnover, Mirotic drained a 3-pointer for a 109-104 lead with 2:42 to go. Robin Lopez scored 18 points and Kris Dunn added 17 for the Bulls. CENTURY MARK Milwaukee scored at least 100 points for the 11th consecutive game. ""You've got three guys playing at a high level with Bled, Khris and Giannis,"" Kidd said before the game. ""Sharing the ball is the key, and being able to make your free throws. Just making a play for a teammate and finding the open guy. Guys are moving the ball. Right now, the ball is going in for us."" THINKING ABOUT MIRZA The Bucks announced Thursday that Mirza Teletovic is out because of pulmonary embolisms in both lungs. He missed three months of the regular season due to blood clots in his lungs while playing for the Brooklyn Nets in 2015. ""It's not about basketball, it's about life,"" Kidd said. ""We're hoping for a speedy recovery and hopefully he has a chance to come back and play."" TIP-INS Bulls: Rookie forward Lauri Markkanen didn't make the trip to Milwaukee, missing his third consecutive game with back spasms. Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said Markkanen was being held out as a precaution. ""He felt a lot better this morning,"" Hoiberg said, adding that Markkanen still had some soreness. Bucks: Lost for only the second time in nine home games.","400975177"
"DENVER --  Will Barton put the Denver Nuggets on his back in the final minutes of Friday night's win. Sore back and all. Gary Harris had 21 points and Barton added 11 of his 19 in overtime, helping the Nuggets beat the New Orleans Pelicans 117-111. Barton said he was still feeling the effects of a back bruise that sidelined him on Wednesday. But it didn't matter in crunch time. He went 4 for 4 from the field in the extra period and had all of the Nuggets' points in the frame until Jamal Murray's two free throws made it 116-110 with 25 seconds remaining. ""Will Barton's a gamer,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""In the first half you could tell his back was bothering him. You could tell it wasn't him. It was not Will Barton. As that second half went on, he loosened up and got his swag back. ""And in overtime, he brought it home."" The Nuggets, who trailed by as many as 18, improved to 11-2 at home. Trey Lyles also had 19 points and Nikola Jokic returned from a seven-game absence with a left ankle sprain and had 13 points and 11 rebounds. Murray added 15 points. ""We realized we had to win that game,"" Barton said. ""Guys just buckled in, strapped up -- everybody just came to play and got stops."" DeMarcus Cousins led New Orleans with 29 points and Anthony Davis had 28 points and 12 rebounds. Jrue Holiday added 25 points. The Nuggets erased a 10-point deficit in the final quarter as Mason Plumlee's consecutive dunks put Denver up 100-96 with 2:47 remaining. In the final minute of regulation, Cousins converted a three-point play to put the Pelicans up 104-102 before Plumlee tied the game with another dunk seconds later. Torrey Craig then blocked Holiday's jumper at the buzzer to force overtime. ""We didn't execute down the stretch,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We didn't play hard enough down the stretch. They made the plays and we didn't. It's that simple."" Denver welcomed back Jokic with a loud roar as he came onto the court with 5:32 left in the opening quarter. He was then immediately welcomed back by Davis. Davis beat Jokic off the dribble for a dunk-and-one in the first before stuffing a short hook shot a few minutes later. The last time Davis and Jokic shared the court was Nov. 17 when Jokic inadvertently head butted Davis, giving him a concussion. Denver was 3-4 without Jokic. ""It's still a little sore,"" Jokic said of his ankle. ""That's no big deal, I think."" Davis had 14 points, six rebounds and two blocks in the opening quarter to help push New Orleans out to a 33-20 lead. He slowed down in the second, but the Pelicans continued to build their lead to 58-40. The Nuggets scored six straight in the final 1:01 of the half to cut the deficit to 58-46. DAVIS HOBBLED Davis appeared to sprain his ankle late in the fourth when he stepped on Plumlee's foot. He stayed in the game but looked to be favoring it. Asked about it after the game, Davis said: ""It's good. I don't know."" MUDIAY LEAVES Denver's Emmanuel Mudiay left the game in the second quarter with a sprained ankle. He did not return. ""I don't think it's anything really serious or sinister,"" Malone said. ""I think it's just a bad ankle sprain and hopefully we'll have him back for practice on Sunday."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Cousins and Holiday each hit five 3s. ... New Orleans had 19 turnovers. Nuggets: Craig made his first career start and scored six points to go along with his game-saving block. . The Nuggets held a moment of silence before the game after last week's passing of former player Roland ""Fatty"" Taylor. Taylor, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, was 71.","400975178"
"HOUSTON --  Chris Paul delivered on a night James Harden had one of his worst shooting performances of the season. Paul had 28 points, eight assists and seven steals to lead the Houston Rockets to their 12th straight victory, a 124-109 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Friday. Paul became the first player in NBA history to post 28 points, eight assists and seven steals in a game against the Spurs. In the past 11 seasons, that stat line has been achieved just 10 times -- Paul has done it six of them. The Rockets are unbeaten when he plays this season. ""What I lack in athletic ability, I just try to make up for it in anticipation and knowing the game,"" Paul said of his steals. ""I'm not jumping and dunking on nobody and all that stuff like that, but I've got a pretty good idea how to play."" Paul's dazzling performance came with Harden making 6 of 18 from the field, including 2 of 11 from 3. Harden still had 28 points, seven rebounds and six assists, scoring half his points on 14-of-16 shooting from the free throw line. ""We complement each other, and we're staying good at getting guys involved while we're being aggressive as well,"" Harden said. ""Obviously, Chris had his shot going tonight, but he got Clint (Capela) dunks and Trevor (Ariza) and Eric (Gordon) 3s, and Ryan (Anderson) 3s. Nights aren't going to be perfect, and we just got to figure it out. Keep pushing and keep grinding."" The Rockets are on the fourth-longest win streak in franchise history and the longest since a franchise-best 22 straight in 2007-08. The Rockets beat the Spurs for just the third time in their last 12 meetings. LaMarcus Aldridge led the Spurs with 16 points. ""I thought our starting group, our veteran group, started out the game very badly with fouls that were unnecessary, bad communication, turnovers, that sort of thing,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""But as the game went on, I thought the younger guys and the guys that haven't played as much, the energy was great. They took better care of the basketball and were more physical and focused. Our starting group let us down."" The Rockets jumped to a 31-16 lead at the end of the first quarter and led 60-43 at the half. The Rockets entered the fourth quarter with a 92-72 lead. At 23-4, the Rockets are tied for their best 27-game start in franchise history, matching the 1993-94 season when they won their first championship. ""We can get better,"" Paul said. ""The scary part is when you think you've arrived. We can get better offensively and defensively, but right now, it's just about piling up wins."" Kawhi Leonard played in his second game back after making his season debut on Tuesday night in Dallas after missing the first 27 games of the season with a right quadriceps injury. Leonard, who has been recovering from a quadriceps condition that causes pain and weakness in the knee, started and had 12 points in 17 minutes, all in the first half. ""I want to play and do what I can do to help the team win, but I know the situation I'm in and I've got to take the right steps to get back,"" Leonard said. ""Playing 16 minutes and not playing a full game, it's hard to tell where I'm at. But I think we're taking the right steps."" Before the game, Popovich hinted that Leonard and Tony Parker were unlikely to play Saturday night in Dallas in the second half of San Antonio's back-to-back. TIP-INS Spurs: SF Kyle Anderson missed his sixth straight game with a sprained left MCL, but he is progressing well and could return after San Antonio's back-to-back in Houston and Dallas, possibly as early as Monday when the Spurs host the Clippers. ... Danny Green started and played through left groin tightness, scoring two points in 19 minutes. Rockets: Houston played its first game without Luc Mbah a Moute, who suffered a dislocated right shoulder on Wednesday night against Charlotte. Mbah a Moute could be out 2/3 weeks with the injury. ... The Rockets improved to 19-1 when leading after the third quarter, winning by double digits for the 17th time in 27 games. SCORING ON THE SPURS Houston's 124 points were the most San Antonio had allowed in a regulation game since Mar. 8, 2013, in a 136-106 loss to Portland. It was also the most points the Rockets had scored in a regulation game against the Spurs since Apr. 3, 1986, when Houston scored 136. SAGER STRONG On the one-year anniversary of the passing of NBA sideline reporter Craig Sager, the Rockets hosted Sager's wife, Stacy, along with other family and friends at the game. There was a tribute video played in the first quarter, and both the Rockets and Spurs donated $25,000 to the SagerStrong Foundation. The First Shot was attempted by Sager's daughter, Riley Sager. Sager swished her pregame free throw attempt, securing a $5,000 donation from the Rockets to the SagerStrong Foundation. ANOTHER ONE The Rockets hit a Spurs opponent season-high 18 3-pointers. Houston improved to 18-0 when making 15 or more 3s. The 18 games with 15 or more 3s made is already the fourth-highest single-season total in NBA history.","400975179"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas expressed concern about stopping the Trail Blazers' talented backcourt. Turns out, his concerns were warranted. CJ McCollum had 25 points, Damian Lillard flirted with a triple-double and Portland held on to beat Charlotte 93-91 on Saturday night. Lillard had 18 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds and the Trail Blazers won their third straight on the road. ""Even though it wasn't in a sexy way on the offensive end, in a sense, I think defensively we stuck in there and did the right things to make some plays,"" Evan Turner said. Nic Batum had a season-high 23 points for the Hornets. They have dropped 10 of their last 12 games, including five straight at home. Kemba Walker had three chances to put the Hornets ahead late, but couldn't convert. He missed a foul line jumper with 18 seconds left with the Hornets trailing by one. McCollum made 1 of 2 free throws to push the lead to 93-31. On the ensuing possession Walker drove the lane, but couldn't get a layup to drop -- or draw the foul call -- with Jusuf Nurkic defending. A scramble for the loose ball ensued, but Jeremy Lamb air-balled a 3-pointer from the left wing. The Hornets still had a chance after Al-Farouq Aminu missed two free throws with 3 seconds left but Walker's heave from just inside the half court line hit only the backboard. It was that kind of night for Charlotte. ""Kemba obviously had a rough night, but he gutted it out,"" Silas said of Walker, who played with his sprained left wrist taped after aggravating it in a loss on Friday night to the Miami Heat. ""The plays that he had down the stretch, I wouldn't want the ball in anybody else's hands."" The Trail Blazers started an 18-4 run with 3:35 left in the third quarter as McCollum sparked the outburst with 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions. Charlotte tied it with 4 minutes remaining behind Walker and Lamb, but could never take the lead. ""The last few minutes (of the game) were pretty exciting,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""I was proud that we were able to hold on. It's the NBA, nothing is easy. You have to grind it out, it would be nice to have a 20-point win, but those are hard to come by."" Batum called that frustrating, particularly with it being the second night in a row the Hornets had battled back to make it a close game in the fourth quarter only to lose. ""We put ourselves in a bad situation where we were down like 15 or 16 again,"" Batum said. ""We can't as a team let that happen every time."" TIP INS Trail Blazers: Held the Hornets to 32 percent shooting in the first half to build a 49-37 lead at the break. Hornets: Johnny O'Bryant did not play in the second half due to a personal reason, according to the team. ... Michael Carter-Williams missed a wide open layup at the end of the third quarter with absolutely nobody around him. NO ROOKIES: Silas didn't play either of the team's rookies, Malik Monk or Dwayne Bacon, saying that he is shortening his rotation. ""Because we need some wins,"" Silas said of the Hornets, who dropped to 10-19. ""And it's not time to develop or gift minutes right now. It's about winning and my rotations going to be short for a little while just until we get this thing back on track."" ROAD WARRIORS: The Blazers are 3-1 on their current road trip and look to finish strong against the Timberwolves on Monday night. ""It's always hard to get a win on the road and we did that,"" Aminu said. ""We're going to keep on battling and try to finish out the road trip for sure."" HOWARD IN CHECK: The Blazers held Dwight Howard to nine points on 3 of 10 shooting. ""I thought Jusuf Nurkic and Ed Davis did a very good job of making it difficult for him to catch the ball and making him shoot over the top by not putting him in a position where he could just dunk the ball,"" Stotts said. ""Like any great player, you have to just make him work.""","400975180"
"CLEVELAND -- LeBron James' numbers have done more than move the Cavaliers near the top of the Eastern Conference. He also has placed himself squarely in the discussion to win his fifth Most Valuable Player award. James had 29 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his 60th career triple-double Cleveland beat the short-handed Utah Jazz 109-100 on Saturday night James had his fifth triple-double of the season and third in his last four games, passing Larry Bird for sixth on the career list. James had 10 points in the fourth quarter, was 9 of 15 from the field and 10 of 10 at the foul line. James has been playing at an extraordinary level all season, prompting the MVP discussion. With his 33rd birthday approaching, he's showing no signs of age. ""I feel good,"" James said. ""I mean, this is my 15th year, but this is one of the best years I've had as far as how I feel and I want to continue that. I want to kind of try to break the mold just for the next generation, just take the narrative out of, `You're past your prime when you hit 31,' or `You're past your prime in your 12th year in the league,' or whatever the case may be."" James was asked if he could envision anyone being as dominant as he's been at his age. ""As dominant as me,"" he said with a laugh. ""We'll see. I know what I'm doing hasn't been done a lot in the history of the game. You look at the minutes I've played, the consecutive Finals I've been a part of, the toll on my body. It hasn't been done."" Utah coach Quin Snyder wasn't surprised about James' performance. ""The game kind of went like a lot of Cavaliers games; LeBron just making plays at the end of the game,"" Snyder said. Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said following the game he discussed resting James in Sunday night's game at Washington. His star player's simple reply: ""Nope."" Cleveland has won 17 of 18 overall and 11 straight at Quicken Loans Arena. Center Rudy Gobert (sprained ligament and bone bruise in left knee) and forward Derrick Favors (left eye laceration) were out for Utah. Both were injured during Friday night in a win in Boston. Rookie Donovan Mitchell led the Jazz with 26 points, making 10 of 15 from the field. Utah made 17 of 34 3-point attempts. Kevin Love added 15 points for the Cavaliers. James scored six straight points after Utah cut the lead to 102-97 with four minutes left. James scored or assisted on each of Cleveland's first 13 points. A left-handed dunk off a lob pass from Jeff Green on a fast break late in the first quarter brought the crowd to its feet. Korver scored 12 points, and Green had 11. Rookie Cedi Osman scored a career-high 10 points, including five in the fourth quarter. Gobert had an MRI on Saturday and will be re-evaluated in two weeks. Favors had six stitches after being hit with an elbow against Boston and could return Monday. BIG NIGHT Mitchell is Utah's leading scorer and kept his team in the game while playing against his childhood idol. ""I've looked up to him my whole life, so the whole thing is crazy,"" Mitchell said. ""The first time I was matched up with him, I was like, `Wow.' "" TIP-INS Jazz: Sefolosha was held out Friday against Boston to recover from general soreness, but was forced into action because of the injuries to Gobert and Favors. ""Frankly, I was hoping not to play him tonight, but with two guys out, we needed him in there,"" Snyder said. .

"NEW YORK --  Carmelo Anthony's return to Madison Square Garden was much like the 6 1/2 years he spent playing for the Knicks. A video played on the overhead scoreboard as part of a huge welcome from the fans and franchise, followed by a fast start that gave Anthony hope he could have everything he wanted. Then things fell flat until the finish. The Knicks shut out their former All-Star in the second half and beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 111-96 on Saturday night for their fourth straight victory. ""It's a bittersweet feeling for me, coming back here knowing the goal that I had and what I wanted to accomplish here and falling short in that category,"" Anthony said. Michael Beasley tied his season high with 30 points in place of injured Kristaps Porzingis, and Doug McDermott, acquired with Enes Kanter for Anthony, added 11 of his 13 after halftime to help the Knicks break open the game. ""This game was kind (of) about him and I thought we did a really good job of not letting that distract us and just focus on winning the game,"" McDermott said. ""And it felt great, especially being a part of the trade (with) Enes. Anthony scored 12 points in the first half but was 0 for 5 after, perhaps low on energy after the Thunder's three-overtime victory at Philadelphia a night earlier. He made a 3-pointer for the Thunder's first basket of the game after refocusing following a video tribute that caught him off guard, but finished 5 of 18 from the field as the Knicks played with passion and precision they lacked in Anthony's final years in New York. ""You got to beat the best to be the best,"" Beasley said. ""He's one of the best of our era."" Russell Westbrook had 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the Thunder, who were trying to sweep a three-game trip that began with Paul George's winning return to Indiana on Wednesday. But they couldn't deliver a victory for Anthony back at Madison Square Garden, even with the Knicks playing without leading scorer Porzingis because of a knee injury. ""I think the guys just, they were ready for tonight's game,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""And we caught them after a triple-overtime game so that probably helped us too, but our guys played hard all night which probably wore them down."" Anthony received a pair of loud cheers during pregame introductions, before and at the end of a video tribute showing his highlights on the court and his charitable efforts off it that was played after the first four Thunder starters were announced. But the boos became more noticeable once play got underway, and soon they were coming every time he touched the ball. ""That was expected,"" Anthony said. ""They can't cheer for me, I'm on another team."" Later, the cheers were all for the Knicks, who after trading their leading scorer on the eve of training camp are a surprising 16-13 -- better than Anthony's new team (14-15). Anthony was booed one last time as he was removed with 1.4 seconds remaining. Beasley had a hand in 12 of the Knicks' final 15 points of the third quarter, scoring nine himself and assisting on Ron Baker's 3-pointer. That turned a two-point lead into an 80-73 advantage over the final 3  1/2 minutes of the period. The Knicks pushed it into double digits in the fourth behind five straight points from McDermott -- originally it was six by a 3-pointer was changed to a 2 after review -- and he later made it 100-87 with a 3-pointer with 6:02 remaining. The Thunder played without starting center Steven Adams because of a concussion. TIP-INS Thunder: George finished with 18 points. ... The Thunder were trying to move above .500 for the first time since they were 4-3 after a victory in Milwaukee on Halloween. ... Oklahoma City beat New York 105-84 at home in the season opener for both teams.

But he wanted the game, too. ""We wanted this one,"" he said. ""I'm not going to sit here and lie to you."" KNICKS' NIGHT The Knicks snapped a four-game losing streak against the Thunder. The Thunder lead the series 13-6 since moving to Oklahoma City.","400975182"
"MIAMI -- A slow start to the season is in the past for Josh Richardson. Richardson scored a career-high 28 points to help the Miami Heat beat the LA Clippers 90-85 on Saturday night. ""J-Rich played unbelievable tonight,"" Heat point guard Goran Dragic said. Richardson was 10 for 16 from the field to record his second 20-plus scoring game of the month and is averaging 16.3 points a game in December after averaging 8.8 points in his first 21 games. ""I've been feeling good lately,"" Richardson said. ""It's just another day."" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra became the franchise's victory leader with 455, passing Pat Riley. Spoelstra is only one of two active head coaches in the NBA with at least 450 wins with their current team, joining San Antonio's Gregg Popovich. ""I thought that it would be most fitting to go retro and have an old-school Miami Heat game in honor of coach Riley,"" Spoesltra said. ""This is the type of game he probably enjoys the most-you win shooting 37 percent. I think we scored too many points this game. But those are the old-school, tough, grind-it-out, find-any-way-as-a-competitor to win the games. That's in honor of my mentor and my coach. He's still my coach."" Dion Waiters added 13 points, and Kelly Olynyk scored nine of his 11 points in the fourth quarter for Miami. The Heat have won four of five to go over .500 for the first time in December. ""I really enjoyed this game for our guys,"" Spoelstra said. Montrezl Harrell led the Clippers with 15 points, and DeAndre Jordan had 12 points and 20 rebounds. Lou Williams was held to 13 points, snapping a string of scoring at least 17 in 11 consecutive games, a career-best. Despite his struggles most of the game, Williams rattled in a 3 from the left wing with 1:50 left for an 85-84 lead. Dragic hit a baseline jumper on the ensuing possession to regain the lead. After a review, the Heat were awarded the ball after a turnover by the Clippers as the ball was batted around the court before Jawun Evans tossed it out of bounds, but Dragic badly missed a 3 keeping the Heat lead at 86-85. Williams was then called for an offensive foul before he had a chance at another 3. ""We should go up two,"" Williams said. ""The referees were for sure that I pushed him, but we looked at the replay. He tripped on his own man's foot. I got both of my hands down."" Richardson responded with a pair of free throws for an 88-85 lead with 19.9 seconds left. Jamil Wilson missed a 3 and after another foul call, Clippers coach Doc Rivers was whistled for a technical foul in the closing seconds. ""I just thought the calls overall, honestly,"" Rivers said about his frustration. Williams missed his first seven shots before slamming home a two-handed dunk on a backdoor cut. He made 4 of 16 shots from the floor. ""For me personally I had a rough game,"" Williams said. ""I got banged up early in the game. I was out there on a turned ankle and wasn't shooting the ball well so to even have an opportunity to put us up two right there (at the end), not making shots, but to be in a position to make a big shot and they take it away, yeah it frustrated me."" TIP-INS Clippers: It's been an oddly scheduled road trip for the Clippers, who were in Florida on Wednesday to play Orlando, then left for a game at Washington on Friday, then returned to the Sunshine State for the matchup with the Heat. ... Austin Rivers (concussion) did not play, but has been cleared and is expected to make his return next game. ... Willie Reed made his first return to Miami after playing in 71 games with the Heat last season. Reed scored two points in four minutes. ... The Clippers are 0-5 on the second game of a back-to-back. Heat: James Johnson suffered a right ankle injury in the first quarter and did not return. He is scheduled to have an MRI on Sunday. ... Jordan Mickey scored a career-high nine points off the bench picking up the minutes left behind by Johnson's exit. ... Miami came into Saturday getting 35.5 percent of its points this season off 3-pointers, by far the highest such rate in franchise history. The Heat got 28.7 percent of their points last season off 3s.","400975183"
"HOUSTON --  Nursing a sore knee, James Harden said he came close to not playing Saturday night. When team doctors warned him that it would be painful, but he could play through it, he said, ""Let's go."" Harden scored 31 points and Chris Paul had 25 and the Rockets beat the Milwaukee Bucks 115-111 for their 13th straight victory. The winning streak is the Rockets' longest since a franchise-best 22 straight in 2007-08. Harden hit a step-back 3-pointer over Malcolm Brogdon and was fouled, giving Houston an 11-point lead with less than six minutes remaining. In the last two minutes, Paul hit back-to-back mid-range jumpers on consecutive possessions to put the game out of reach. ""Mentally, this was a big win for us,"" Paul said. ""We never let go of the rope. Every time they made a little push, we stayed right there down the stretch. James was out there, basically, on one leg. The mental toughness we showed as a team is what we take from this game."" Giannis Antetokounmpo had 28 points, nine rebounds, five assists and four steals for Milwaukee. Khris Middleton had 23 points, and Brogdon added 20. Milwaukee has lost three in a row after winning six of seven. ""Harden made some tough shots and Chris Paul made some big shots down the stretch as well,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""We gave ourselves a chance, but we just came up short."" The Rockets grinded through frustrations, 15 turnovers and a below-average shooting night. Paul had a technical foul, Harden had a delay of game warning, and the Rockets faced serious adversity for the first time in weeks. Entering Saturday, Houston had dominated teams in its streak, winning all but two games by double figures with an average margin of victory of 16.9 points. ""We just didn't have our best stuff tonight,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""But we found a way. It was one of those typical grind games where you've just got to find a way somehow."" Paul scored 23 of his 25 points in the second half, overcoming a rocky first half where he missed all five shots he attempted and turned the ball over five times. ""I had never coached him in a back-to-back, but I'm thinking he's kind of dead,"" D'Antoni said. ""Then, all of a sudden, he comes out in the third quarter and turns into Superman."" Paul made 7 of 8 shots in the second half, including 3 of 4 from beyond the arc, also making all eight free throws in the game. Harden scored 20 points or more for the 29th straight game, matching Houston's franchise record set by Moses Malone. Both Harden and Clint Capela (left heel contusion) were game-time decisions after suffering injuries on different collision plays in Friday night's win over San Antonio. Capela sat out the game, and P.J. Tucker started in his place, getting 10 points and 10 rebounds in 38 minutes. Behind Tucker, Nene scored a season-high 16 points, largely on thunderous one-handed dunks. The Rockets were outscored by the Bucks 44-40 in the paint and outrebounded 40-38. Milwaukee and Houston traded blows in the first half, with the Rockets leading by three at the end of the first quarter. They were tied at 55 at the half. The Rockets haven't trailed at the half since Nov. 25 in a 117-102 win over the Knicks. The Rockets took an 84-79 lead into the fourth quarter. At 24-4, the Rockets are tied for their best 28-game start in franchise history, matching the 1993-94 season when they won their first championship. TIP-INS Bucks: Former Rockets PG Jason Terry missed his sixth straight game with a left calf strain but was on the Milwaukee bench for the game. ... Reserve rookie guard Sterling Brown frustrated Paul early with physical defense, picking up four quick fouls in just six minutes in the first half. Rockets: With a steal in the second quarter, Paul passed Kobe Bryant for 14th on the NBA's steals list with 1,945 steals. Paul, who had seven steals Friday night and one Saturday night, is 12 shy of Derek Harper's 1,957 steals for 13th place.","400975184"
"MINNEAPOLIS -- Phoenix coach Jay Triano says he needs newly signed Isaiah Canaan to learn on the fly. Standing at the foul line for three shots with 6 seconds left, Canaan made it through his first lesson with the Suns. Canaan sank all three free throws, and the Suns denied Jimmy Butler twice on Minnesota's ensuing possession to cap a bench-led comeback in a 108-106 victory Saturday. It was Canaan's first game since being added to the roster Wednesday after the injury-ravaged Suns received a hardship extension. He helped Phoenix snap a five-game skid ""Wanted to see what he could do. He had to get a practice in,"" Triano said. And it was quite the practice. Canaan finished with 15 points and drew a foul on Jeff Teague on a 3-pointer with Minnesota leading by one. Originally ruled a shot-clock violation, replay officials overturned the call and Canaan calmly sank all three shots amid a loud crowd of neon green-clad fans. ""Playoff experience really helps in moments like those just to be able to calm down and just know that it's a regular free throw, regular part of the game"" Canaan said. ""When I got fouled, I knew i was going to make them. Stepped up to the line and made them. Alex Len blocked Butler's layup attempt out of bounds on the ensuing possession. Butler had one more look from the corner, but the attempt rimmed out and the Suns snapped their five-game losing streak. Dragan Bender and Troy Daniels each scored 17 points for the Suns, whose bench outscored the starters. TJ Warren added 15 for Phoenix, which trailed by as many as 15. ""I kept saying, 'Do we need to give them a rest? Do we need to give them a rest?'"" Triano said about his bench. ""We used our timeouts to give them a rest and I thought they were great at both ends and spread the floor."" Karl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 28 points and 11 rebounds. Phoenix had 27 turnovers, but the Wolves struggled from the floor, finishing 40 for 95. ""We shot ourselves in the foot tonight,"" Teague said. ""We had plenty of times to bury that team, and we didn't."" The Wolves took a four-point lead into the fourth before Danuel House converted a three-point play to spark a 22-11 run. Len had 12 points and a career-high 19 rebounds. Len's put back at 7:49 gave the Suns their first lead at 92-91. ""We didn't close the quarters out well,"" Thibodeau said. ""Each quarter we had a problem. And then the rebounding was problematic."" Phoenix outrebounded Minnesota 52-31. THE FINAL CALL Thibodeau took issue with the foul call by referee Mark Ayotte on Teague at the end. ""They didn't call a foul. My interpretation was that what they called was a shot-clock violation."" Video replays showed Teague falling into Canaan just before the shot clock expired. Crew chief Ken Mauer defended the call to a designated pool reporter. ""I told Thibodeau, 'Yes, he did call a foul. The play was handled correctly,'"" Mauer said. BUTLER'S BACK Thibodeau confirmed Butler is dealing with some back issues. Butler left the bench in the second half, but eventually returned. ""I could tell his back was bothering him because he was in a lot of pain. Every time he was trying to move, every time he was trying to cut he was in a lot of pain,"" Gibson said. TIP INS Suns: C Tyson Chandler returned to the starting lineup after missing Thursday night's loss against Toronto. He finished with four points in 20 minutes. ... Tyler Ulis left with an apparent hand injury with less than three minutes in the game. Afterward, Triano said Ulis was fine and could've come back into the game. Timberwolves: Towns recorded his league-leading 24th double-double of the season. ... Before the game, Thibodeau addressed G Jamal Crawford's recent comments about his limited playing time. Crawford entered the game averaging 17.7 minutes per game, the lowest since his rookie season. On Friday, he told reporters it was challenging to adjust to the change. ""I think everyone has to sacrifice for the team and if you look at Jimmy, Wig and KAT, they are sacrificing some shot attempts. You have to do what's best for the team,"" Thibodeau said Saturday. ... F Nemanja Bjelica missed his 12th straight game with a sprained left foot.","400975185"
"SAN ANTONIO --  At 40 years old, Manu Ginobili's refusal to slow down in his 16th season with the Spurs has been a source of inspiration to the team's young core. The man and the mantra helped propel San Antonio to an improbable victory over Dallas on Saturday night. LaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points and 14 rebounds and the Spurs scored the final 13 points of the game, rallying for a 98-96 victory over the Mavericks. Aldridge's fall-away, 11-foot jumper tied the game at 96 with 23.4 seconds remaining and Ginobili's driving layup with 3.1 seconds was the game-winning shot. ""He's our grandpa,"" 21-year-old Dejounte Murray said, chuckling afterwards. ""He's a beast, man. You've all seen what he's done for this organization and he's still around giving his wisdom to all the new guys. To see him coming in every day, I mean there's not one day I've seen Manu not show up at the facility. Being a young guy, I've got to be there every day."" Ginobili's layup off the left side of the glass gave the Spurs their first lead of the game after trailing by as many as 16 points. ""We did a lot of good things, but the ending is unforgiveable,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. Maxi Kleber had 21 points and Dirk Nowitzki added 19 for Dallas in the final regular season matchup between the Southwest Division rivals. Kleber's 3-pointer gave Dallas a 96-85 lead with 4:11 remaining, but the Spurs held them scoreless the remainder of the game. The Mavericks drought included a turnover when Wes Matthews was unable to inbound the ball with 23.4 seconds remaining. Mathews threw the ball at Ginobili's legs to avoid a 5-second violation, but the Spurs gained possession when the ball ricocheted off Matthews just as he stepped inbounds. ""We did everything right to lose,"" Nowitzki said. ""We missed shots offensively, bad turnover, gave them some offensive rebounds. Letting Ginobili go left down the stretch to lay it in. We literally had to do everything perfect to lose this one and we did."" Aldridge had his 12th double-double of the season to help offset the absences of starters Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker and Danny Green. Coming off a 15-point blowout in Houston on Friday night, San Antonio was able to avoid its third straight loss. ""We played with everybody in Houston and hoped to play a good game in which we could grow and learn from our mistakes while playing against the best team in the NBA right now and I don't think we got anything out of it,"" Ginobili said. ""So, if after that poor effort we came here and played badly again and lost, it would've been a tough one. We are proud of this win."" The Spurs missed their first five shots, all short jumpers from Aldridge and Pau Gasol, on their way to shooting 30 percent in the opening quarter. The Mavericks took advantage, charging to a 31-18 lead after the first quarter. San Antonio's reserves reversed the team's fortunes in the third quarter. Davis Bertans finished with 13 points and Ginobili added 12 off the bench. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dennis Smith Jr. missed a fifth straight game with a strained left hip. Also sitting out were Seth Curry (stress reaction, left tibia), Dorian Finney-Smith (left quadriceps tendinitis), Josh McRoberts (low extremity injury), and Nerlens Noel (left thumb). ... Dallas is 2-12 on the road after going 12-29 away from home last season. ... The Mavericks are 5-1 when scoring at least 30 points in the first quarter. ... Dallas has made 10-plus 3-pointers in 22 of their first 30 games this season. ... Dallas has 12 turnovers or less in seven straight games and nine of its last 10. Spurs: Leonard and Parker sat out the second game of a back-to-back as part of their recovery from quadriceps injuries that kept both out for much of the season. ... Green was scratched from the lineup an hour before the game due to tightness in his left groin. ... San Antonio is 6-7 in back-to-back games this season, losing both games once this season. ... Ginobili has played in 522 games in the AT&amp;T Center, surpassing Tim Duncan for second overall to Parker's 550 games at home. ... Bryn Forbes made his third career start, joining Avery Johnson as only the second undrafted player under 6-foot-4 in Spurs history to start 3-plus games. LEARNING ON THE JOB Murray made his 10th start at point guard in place of Parker as the second-year player out of Washington continues to try to find a regular spot in San Antonio's rotation. ""Because I'm a ballplayer,"" Murray said of adjusting to sporadic minutes. ""I love basketball, I love to do this. Coming into the NBA, everybody is good, all you can control is what you need to control and that's just getting better every day and be ready when you're number is called."" Murray is averaging 17.9 minutes while coming off the bench in 20 games. IN DISBELIEF San Antonio's come-from-behind victory astonished the fans and the Spurs themselves, apparently.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Boston saw a lead that once reached 21 points, slip away in the third quarter, but the Celtics made sure they didn't trail for long. On the short end of a 73-71 score after three, Boston opened the final frame with 16 straight points to pull away from the Memphis Grizzlies for a 102-93 victory on Saturday night. ""We just stayed composed and went out and executed,"" said Celtics forward Al Horford, who scored 15 points. ""We got some stops on defense. On the offensive end, we moved the ball pretty well. I think that was the difference. We opened up the game after that."" Kyrie Irving scored 20 points, Jayson Tatum had 19 points and nine rebounds, part of six Celtics reaching double figures. The Celtics shot 49 percent, including 14 of 30 (46.7 percent) from outside the arc. Marc Gasol led Memphis with 30 points and 10 rebounds. Tyreke Evans added 25 points, and Dillon Brooks had 14 points, hitting a season-best four 3-pointers. Boston led by 21 in the first half, but Memphis used a 21-point third quarter by Gasol to take a 73-71 lead after three. And the Memphis crowd, which has suffered through the team losing 17 of its last 19, rose in enthusiasm with the comeback. The excitement was short-lived as Boston went on its rally to open the fourth. ""Obviously, Gasol got it going. You're going to take a team's shot like that, but you have to weather that storm and stay the course,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. There was little doubt about the way the game turned in the early minutes of the fourth, and Memphis expended a lot of energy getting back even with the Celtics before that point. ""When you play a team like this with guys that can shoot and create the way that they can, they make you pay for mistakes,"" Memphis interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""And you've got to give them credit, they created a lot of those mistakes.""

Tatum, who entered the game, leading the league in 3-point shooting at 50 percent (48 of 96), made both of his shots from outside the arc in the game. Grizzlies: The Celtics outscored Memphis 31-12 in the first quarter, marking the 14th time in the last 18 games that the Grizzlies were outscored in a quarter by at least nine points. ... Gasol's 21 points in the third were one shy of a Memphis franchise record for points in a quarter. ... Ten of the last 12 Memphis opponents have shot 40 percent or better from outside the arc. LONDON CALLING The Celtics play the Philadelphia 76ers in London on Jan. 11, and Stevens sees it as an opportunity to showcase the Boston franchise. ""As a coach, you look at it, and see challenges that come along with it,"" he said. ""But it's a great experience for our players and our organization."" He added that previous trips abroad in Madrid and Milan ""kind of opened your eyes to the Celtics and the following overseas."" MAKING ADJUSTMENTS Tatum, the rookie forward from Duke, played in his 32nd game Saturday night, about the amount of a regular season college game. And, he acknowledged, he can tell the difference. ""It's tough,"" he said. ""The traveling, playing back-to-backs. It's still an adjustment. I'm still trying to get used to it. I'm just trying to rest as much as possible."" FINAL WORD ""He only made four 3-pointers but it felt like 15."" -- Stevens on Memphis center Marc Gasol's shooting in the fourth quarter.

"TORONTO --  After a high-scoring first half, the Sacramento Kings suddenly found themselves struggling to put points on the board against the Toronto Raptors. DeMar DeRozan scored 21 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 13 points and a season-high 16 rebounds and Toronto held Sacramento to 30 second-half points Sunday, beating the Kings 108-93. Kyle Lowry added 16 points and Norman Powell had 14 for the Raptors, who won their ninth straight home game. Toronto is an NBA-best 11-1 at home. DeRozan gave the Raptors a 61-60 lead with a pull-up jump shot with less than two seconds remaining in the second quarter, but George Hill banked in a 46-foot 3-pointer from midcourt at the buzzer, giving Sacramento a 63-61 edge at the intermission. The Kings shot 61.9 percent in the first half, making 26 of 42 field goal attempts. Sacramento scored 14 points in the third quarter, making five of 18 shots, then followed up with 16 points in the fourth. ""I thought we played a little bit slower in the second half,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""I think both teams were in there saying `Man, we can't give up 60 points by halftime.' Maybe we got a little slow. I credit their defense."" Toronto won for the ninth time in its past 10 and improved to 11-4 against Western Conference opponents. ""Any team in this league, you let them shoot 61 percent, it's way too high,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""We held them to 31 percent in the second half, which is admirable, but we can't play with fire."" Lowry said the Raptors ""tightened the screws a little bit"" on defense in the third and fourth quarters. Sacramento trailed 96-88 after a jump shot by Bogdan Bogdanovic with 2:28 remaining, but a step-back 3-pointer by Fred VanVleet with the shot clock expiring gave Toronto a 99-88 edge with 1:38 left. ""It was big,"" DeRozan said of VanVleet's shot. ""We needed a bucket at that time. It shifted the momentum to kind of seal it for us and run away with it after that."" After a Kings timeout, and a missed 3-pointer by Hill, Lowry made it a 14-point lead with his fourth 3-pointer. Bogdanovic and Garrett Temple each scored 18 points and Hill had 16 for the Kings, who are 4-13 away from home, tied with Atlanta for the most road losses in the league. The Raptors, who snapped an eight-game losing streak in Sacramento with a 102-87 road win last Sunday, swept the Kings for the first time since 2014-15. Sacramento, which lost for the fifth time in seven games, was without leading scorer and rebounder Zach Randolph (rest) and guard De'Aaron Fox, who sat for the first time this season because of a bruised right thigh sustained in Thursday's loss at Minnesota. Raptors forward Serge Ibaka was not available (left knee), but C.J. Miles returned after missing Friday's game because of a sore left shoulder. Miles started for the first time this season. Sacramento made seven turnovers in the third, two of them during a 10-2 Toronto run late in the quarter that gave the Raptors an 83-77 lead heading to the fourth. TIP-INS Kings: Shot a season-low eight free throws, compared to 28 for Toronto. Sacramento's six made free throws were also a season-low. ... Vince Carter led the Kings with three blocks. Raptors: All five starters scored in double figures. ... Six of Toronto's first field goal attempts were 3-pointers. They made four. CHEERS FOR CARTER A five-time All-Star in his seven seasons with the Raptors, Carter was cheered during pregame introductions and every time he checked in at what could be his final game in Toronto. Fans stood and cheered when Carter was replaced late in the fourth, and he acknowledged the crowd with a wave. Toronto has embraced Carter in recent years after treating him with disdain for more than a decade following his departure from Toronto. Carter, who finished with four points, said the change in reception hasn't changed the way he feels about his first NBA home. ""I still love being here,"" he said. ""There's nothing like it. I've been on two different sides of `there's nothing like it' but it's still a place that's near and dear to me.""","400975188"
"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons tied a franchise record for 3-pointers -- and they needed almost all of them to avoid a bad home loss. Reggie Bullock scored a career-high 20 points, and the Pistons made 17 shots from beyond the arc in a 114-110 victory over the Orlando Magic on Sunday. Detroit nearly gave away a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter, and coach Stan Van Gundy wasn't happy at all with his team's effort. ""We played a very good first half, Reggie Bullock and Anthony Tolliver played very well, and we didn't try at all in the second half,"" Van Gundy said. ""We didn't bring anything to the second half."" The Pistons have won three in a row after starting December with a seven-game losing streak. Nikola Vucevic had 24 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists for the Magic. They have dropped five straight and 16 of 19. Detroit started fast, making six of its first seven shots to take a 15-5 lead. At the end of the first quarter, Ish Smith made a shot, and then Langston Galloway added a steal and a floater when the Magic botched the inbound play. It was 36-23 after one. The Pistons led 60-43 at halftime after going 10 of 18 from beyond the arc in the first half. Then Detroit added six more 3-pointers and 36 points in the third quarter. Tolliver's 3-pointer tied the franchise record and gave the Pistons a 105-81 lead with 7:00 remaining. Then Orlando scored the game's next 19 points. ""I don't really feel like our defensive intensity was very good the whole game,"" Tolliver said. ""Even though we were shooting really well, I think we definitely relaxed way too much."" Orlando trailed 105-100 after its huge fourth-quarter run, but Mario Hezonja, who would finish with eight 3-pointers, missed one for the Magic. Tobias Harris scored on a driving shot at the other end with 1:21 to play. The Pistons finished 17 of 34 from beyond the arc, and the Magic were even better at 17 of 33. ""It was great that we didn't give in when we were down 20. We finally did the things we hadn't been doing all night,"" Vucevic said. ""We hit shots, but I think it all started with us finally getting stops."" Harris, Tolliver and Reggie Jackson scored 17 points each for the Pistons. Hezonja had 28 points for Orlando, and Jonathon Simmons added 23. OPPORTUNITY Bullock has played increased minutes lately with Stanley Johnson shooting poorly. His big game was especially welcome Sunday, when guard Avery Bradley was out with a right groin problem. Bullock finished 8 of 10 from the field and eclipsed his previous career high of 17 points. ""This is probably one of my most true opportunities probably, since I've been in the league,"" Bullock said. ""Just knowing I'm going to be in the rotation."" RESERVES The Magic got good scoring from the trio of Hezonja, Vucevic and Simmons, but Orlando's bench was outscored 45-18. Injuries have sapped some of the team's depth. ""We extended the starters' minutes, but we still need to have a bench,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""We've got backups starting, so they are already extended just from that."" TIP-INS Magic: G Arron Afflalo (back), F Aaron Gordon (right calf), G-F Evan Fournier (right ankle) and G-F Terrance Ross (knee) were out. ... Elfrid Payton had 15 points and seven assists.

"NEW YORK --  Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan came into the season trying to figure out just what kind of contribution he would get from Victor Oladipo after he arrived in a trade for one the NBA's best two-way players in Paul George. The second overall pick in the 2013 draft has met McMillan's expectations after spending the previous two seasons in Orlando and Oklahoma City. Oladipo scored 26 points, reserve Domantas Sabonis had 17 and the Pacers beat the Brooklyn Nets 109-97 on Sunday night. ""He's a guy we're trying to develop into a franchise player. He's come in with a lot of confidence,"" McMillan said. ""This year is really about developing our young guys and seeing what these guys are capable of doing. He's doing some good things."" Myles Turner added 16 points, Cory Joseph chipped in 15 and Darren Collison scored 14 for the Pacers. The Nets' Allen Crabbe shook off his recent struggles, scoring 17 points in the first half on 5-for-7 shooting, including four 3s. He took only one shot and didn't score in the second half. ""I don't think they did anything differently defensively. I don't know,"" Crabbe said of his quiet second half. Trailing by one at the end of the opening quarter, the Pacers got a jolt from Oladipo, the team's leading scorer at 24.5 points per game. After Crabbe's 3-pointer cut the lead to 51-45 with 2:25 left in the first half, Oladipo reeled off eight straight points for a 59-48 advantage at the end of the second period. When Brooklyn drew within five points in the beginning of the fourth quarter, Indiana's summer acquisition capped a 10-3 run with five consecutive points, landing an alley-oop dunk that drew the attention of the Barclays Center crowd. Indiana snapped a two-game losing streak, including a 100-95 loss in George's return on Wednesday. ""I think we did a good job of getting stops, finishing possessions with rebounds and then doing our plays. We've got to do it in that order,"" Oladipo said. ""The past couple of games we've kind of been doing one step before the other. I think we did a great job of settling down, playing our pace, and getting stops down the stretch."" Quincy Acy, Caris LeVert and Joe Harris each had 14 points in Brooklyn's third straight loss. Nets coach Kenny Atkinson thought his team was outworked as it was in those previous two games. ""I just felt like the whole game ... whatever that `it' is in terms of energy and physicality, it hasn't been there,"" Atkinson said. The second meeting of the season between these teams lacked the offensive spark of their first matchup, which Indiana won 140-131. The Pacers led by 14 with 7:08 remaining in the fourth quarter before Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and LeVert combined for a 6-0 run in little over a minute to close the gap to 94-86. Indiana then bounced back with eight straight points, including a basket by Joseph that led to a technical foul on Atkinson. FIRST IMPRESSIONS Brooklyn native Lance Stephenson, who broke into the league along with George in 2010, has enjoyed seeing the growth Oladipo has shown in 29 games. ""Vic is playing amazing. He's living up to the high expectations,"" said the Lincoln High School product, who was chosen by the Pacers in the second round of the draft. ""He's here early for practice. He's being a leader.

"WASHINGTON -- LeBron James joked that he changed out of his shoes -- one black, one white, with ""equality"" in gold capital letters -- at halftime because he was playing poorly. ""If that's a bad game,"" teammate Kevin Love said, ""then sheesh!"" James finished with 20 points, 15 assists and 12 rebounds to lead the Cleveland Cavaliers past the Washington Wizards 106-99 on Sunday night for their 18th victory in 19 games, and then said afterward his choice of footwear was related to the game being played about a mile from President Donald Trump's White House. ""This is a beautiful country and we're never going to let one person dictate how beautiful and how powerful we are,"" the four-time NBA MVP said. James had his fourth triple-double in the past five games despite being called for four fouls in the final quarter. Still, he offered a scathing self-critique. ""I actually played pretty bad tonight. I wasn't as strong with the ball: I had six turnovers. Kind of lazy with the ball, at times,"" James said. ""And my teammates did a great job bailing me out."" Love led Cleveland with 25 points and added nine rebounds. Jeff Green added 15 points, and Kyle Korver scored 11. ""He just affects the game in so many ways and makes a lot of plays for other guys, too,"" Love said about James. ""He's just setting us up and getting us into our spots. That's what he does. He's our leader."" The last time these teams played, at Washington on Nov. 3, Cleveland won thanks to 57 points from James. That prompted Wizards coach Scott Brooks to joke before tipoff Sunday that holding the four-time league MVP to ""56 would be pretty good tonight."" He also cracked, ""I have a lot of respect for Coach (Tyronn) Lue, but I think he's making a bad decision if he doesn't sit LeBron tonight. Back-to-back games, right? Our fans saw 57. They don't need to see any more."" This time, James was more of a facilitator. ""His IQ is the highest I've ever been around,"" Brooks said afterward. ""Just the way he sees the floor."" Bradley Beal led Washington with 27 points, and John Wall had 15 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in 32 minutes in his third game back after missing nine with an injured left knee. In a matchup of Eastern Conference division leaders, neither team led by more than seven until Wall turned the ball over, leading to a fast break for James, who was fouled at the other end and completed the three-point play for a 103-94 lead. That was part of a 23-16 edge for the Cavs in the fourth quarter, which began with the teams tied at 83. ""Against a great team like that, you have to be sharp the whole game,"" Wizards forward Mike Scott said. ""In the fourth, we weren't sharp on the offensive end, and they made plays."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: G Dwyane Wade was rested on the second half of a back-to-back. ... The Cavs finished with 24 assists, ending their streak of three consecutive games with at least 30. ... Cleveland made 14 3-pointers, its 20th game in a row with at least 10. ... The Cavs scored at least 100 points for the 24th straight game. Wizards: F Otto Porter Jr. sat out with an injured right hip. ... His replacement in the starting lineup, Kelly Oubre Jr., had 11 points and eight rebounds. ... F Markieff Morris missed the start of the second half because he was getting an X-ray on his neck. ""Everything came back clean,"" Brooks said. MOVING ON UP If it seems as if James climbs up some career list each and every night, well, that's because he pretty much does. This time, he overtook Hakeem Olajuwon for ninth-most made field goals in NBA history and tied Nick Van Exel for 24th-most 3-pointers. ... Wall's 3 shortly before halftime moved him up to No. 5 on Washington's franchise scoring list. He began the night at No. 7, but surpassed Phil Chenier and Gus Johnson in the second quarter.","400975191"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Frank Kaminsky snapped out of his slump, and not surprisingly so did the Charlotte Hornets. Kaminsky scored 15 of his season high-tying 24 points in the first half to give the Hornets a jolt off the bench in a 109-91 victory over the New York Knicks on Monday night. ""There's 82 games and you can control your effort for every single game,"" Kaminsky said. ""When I come out and just play, I think I'm a completely different player."" Kaminsky didn't miss a shot until the fourth quarter, finishing 10 of 13 overall and 4 of 6 on 3-pointers to provide a boost for a Hornets bench that has struggled so much lately that interim head coach Stephen Silas has shortened the playing rotation. Kaminsky ended a slump that had lasted since he returned from a sprained right ankle on Dec. 6. He had scored 28 points in the previous four games while converting only 11 of 34 shots. ""(He) just played (and) didn't worry about making mistakes, didn't worry about his shot fake and his shot and all that other stuff,"" Charlotte interim coach Stephen Silas said. ""He was just playing the game the way he knows he can. Hopefully we'll see that as we go forward with guys like Nic (Batum), guys like Frank and then the other guys, especially our bench guys, getting a little bit more consistency and confidence."" Silas was able to use all 12 of his players in a game in which Charlotte (11-19) led by as much as 27 points. The Hornets snapped a three-game skid and ended the Knicks' four-game winning streak. Kaminsky entered late in the first quarter with the Hornets trailing 15-11 and he soon sparked a 22-4 run that turned a 19-15 deficit into a 37-23 lead with 10:25 left in the first half. Later, Kaminsky had eight points in a 17-3 surge that extended a 41-30 lead to 58-33 with 3:22 left in the half. ""Well, when Kaminsky was in there he was able to spread them out,"" New York coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""And once he hits his first couple, he's a tough guy to deal with."" Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added 15 points and 10 rebounds, Marvin Williams scored 12 points and Dwight Howard finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds for Charlotte. Michael Beasley scored 23 points for New York. ""We missed shots we usually make,"" Knicks forward Lance Thomas said. ""We missed a lot of layups at the basket and a bunch of open threes from some of our better shooters on the team. TIP INS: Knicks: Forward Kristaps Porzingis missed his second straight game with left knee soreness. Coach Jeff Hornacek said Porzingis went through shootaround Monday morning before the decision was made.... Guard Tim Hardaway Jr., missed his ninth game with a stress injury to his left leg. Hornets: Monday marked two full weeks that Silas has filled in for Steve Clifford while Clifford continues to deal with an undisclosed health issue. ""He's pretty much at where he was a couple weeks ago, so I speak to him every day,"" Silas said. ""...I talked to him yesterday for quite a while and he's kind of still in the same place, trying to figure out what's going on and we're just kind of subbing right now."" SHOOTAROUND DECISION The decision to sit Porzingis came after Monday morning's shootaround. ""It still kind of felt like it did the other night, so we're going to hold him out again,"" Hornacek said. ""... He went through shootaround and kind of did the same routine he did the other day, just to test the different ways that he moves. And he still felt it.""

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Boston's plan was simple: Foul quickly and send the Pacers to the free throw line. But trailing by one with seconds ticking away, the Celtics didn't get the whistle they wanted. Instead, they got the steal they needed. Terry Rozier turned it into a go-ahead dunk with 1.5 seconds remaining that gave the Celtics a 112-111 victory over Indiana on Monday night. Following an inbound pass with nine seconds left, Boston was attempting to trap Indiana's Bojan Bogdanovic along the sideline. With 4.3 seconds left, Bogdanovic, who would have almost certainly been fouled had he simply held onto the ball, threw a high pass intended for Victor Oladipo near midcourt but Rozier intercepted it and had an open court to his game-winning slam. ""Kyrie (Irving) and Marcus (Smart) had the first trap and Marcus was trying to yell to the referee, `I'm fouling, I'm fouling!' but they didn't call it. Then they threw the ball to Bogdanovic and he made the pass and I was able to get my hand on it,"" Rozier said. ""As soon as I stole the ball I took a look at the clock and saw there were four seconds and I knew I had time."" Irving scored 30 points for Boston, which trailed 107-102 after Oladipo's basket with 31 seconds remaining. Irving made a pair of 3-pointers in the final 30 seconds to keep the Celtics within striking distance. ""That was one hell of a game to be a part of,"" Irving said. Al Horford had 14 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for the Celtics. Jayson Tatum added 16 points and Smart had 15. Oladipo scored 12 of his 38 points in the final two minutes. With less than a minute remaining, Oladipo hit a 3-pointer that gave Indiana its first lead of the game and a layup that stretched the Pacers' lead to 107-102 with 31 seconds left. Boston began the game with a dominant first quarter, making its first 10 shot attempts, jumping out to a 12-0 lead. The Celtics led by as many as 18 points in the first quarter and went into halftime leading 62-47. The Pacers cut the deficit to single digits in the third quarter and rallied late in the fourth. Darren Collison finished with 15 points and Domantas Sabonis scored 18 points and grabbed seven rebounds. ""It's a tough loss. It's a tough, tough loss,"" Oladipo said. ""We've got to have a better start. It was just a crazy game. We dug ourselves the deepest hole you can imagine and again, fought our way back like clockwork, but we come up short again.

"ATLANTA --  Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer keeps encouraging Taurean Prince to shoot more often. The NBA's worst team needs as much offense as it can get. ""We're wanting him to shoot a lot -- catch and shoot, shoot whenever he's got daylight, driving and finishing,"" Budenholzer said. ""I think his defense has improved here recently. He's just in a good place. He's playing well."" Prince scored 24 points, Dennis Schroder added 23 and Atlanta beat the injury-riddled Miami Heat 110-104 on Monday night. The Heat, down to just nine healthy players, were without leading scorer Goran Dragic, forward James Johnson and key reserve Justise Winslow. Miami center Hassan Whiteside missed his 10th straight game with a bruised left knee and 15th overall. Miami had won four of five and was trying to move two games over .500 for the first time this season. Josh Richardson scored 26 points and Dion Waiters finished with 23. Kent Bazemore had 16 points and five steals for the Hawks, who snapped a four-game skid to improve to 7-23. If Budenholzer had a more veteran team, he could work Prince into the game plans more slowly, but the Hawks have struggled so much that the coach needs Prince to step up now. Prince is averaging 13.2 points per game. Budenholzer believes he can improve on that number by shooting quicker. ""We're still basketball players, so if somebody runs out super hard, I still have the ability to go to the rack and make plays for others,"" Prince said. ""It's just doing what I do best first and then other stuff afterwards."" Miami erased a nine-point deficit midway through the first quarter to take a 40-31 lead early in the third on consecutive baskets by Richardson, but Atlanta used a strong third quarter to go up 90-76 early in the fourth on DeAndre' Bembry's corner 3-pointer. It was the first of three 14-point leads for the Hawks, but the Heat pulled within four on Tyler Johnson's dunk, Richardson's runner and Waiters' short jumper. Miami cut the lead to one on Richardson's layup with 1:05 remaining, but Bazemore hit a 16-footer and a layup to make it 106-101. Dragic tried to shoot before the game, but the pain was too much in his strained left elbow. James Johnson didn't make the trip because of bursitis in his right ankle, and Winslow missed his third straight game with a knee injury. Richardson and Waiters were the only regular starters in the lineup, and Waiters played despite a stomach bug. Miami went 0 for 11 on 3-point attempts in the second half, but coach Erik Spoelstra was more disappointed with 19 turnovers. ""We need to be better with the fundamentals, reading schemes and defenses better,"" Spoelstra said.

"CHICAGO --  Nikola Mirotic pounded his chest in celebration after a big play in the fourth quarter. Kris Dunn wagged his finger from side to side after one last stop closed it out. The Chicago Bulls are having fun again and -- surprise, surprise -- winning, too. Mirotic and Dunn each scored 22 points, and Chicago topped the Philadelphia 76ers 117-115 on Monday night for its sixth consecutive victory. ""These guys have made leaps and bounds from where we were as far as making plays down the stretch and going out and playing with confidence when it matters most,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. Mirotic and Dunn each hit huge shots as Chicago rallied past Philadelphia with a big finish in the fourth quarter. Mirotic also grabbed 13 rebounds, helping the Bulls remain unbeaten since he returned Dec. 8 after missing the start of the season with facial fractures due to a fight with teammate Bobby Portis during practice. Seven players scored in double figures for Chicago (9-20), which dropped 10 in a row before its win streak. Justin Holiday scored all 20 of his points in the first half, and Portis finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds. ""We're just trying to compete each and every game,"" Dunn said. ""We know that eventually a loss will come, but right now we're just trying to ride on the streak."" Ben Simmons had 19 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists for the Sixers, who lost for the sixth time in seven games. Dario Saric scored 20 of his 27 points in the second half. ""We've had too many times where we've gotten leads late in the game and we've given them up, so we've just got to learn how to finish,"" said Robert Covington, who had 10 points and seven rebounds. Philadelphia played without Joel Embiid, who rested on the first night of back-to-back games for the Sixers. The 7-foot center, who scored 34 points in Friday night's triple-overtime loss to Oklahoma City, did not make the trip to Chicago. Simmons and Saric helped Philadelphia get in position to stop Chicago's win streak in the fourth quarter, up 107-99 with 3:49 left. That's when the Bulls responded with one of the best stretches of their suddenly interesting season. Lauri Markkanen made a 3-pointer, Mirotic blocked Saric's shot on the other end and Dunn made a tying 3-pointer with 2:46 left -- part of a 15-2 spurt for Chicago. Dunn's jumper made it 114-109 with 1:05 remaining. ""We went through a scoring drought,"" Dunn said. ""We just needed to see the ball go in. Lauri, he's a good shooter. We just needed to see one go in, and it ignited that fire."" Simmons had a chance to tie it in the final seconds, but missed wildly and Mirotic grabbed the rebound. ""I knew I was going to take the shot,"" Simmons said. ""Tried to get to the rim, draw a foul, but trying to get a foul in the final quarter of a game like that, you know it's going to be hard. It was a chance to win but it didn't happen."" Richaun Holmes had 14 points and seven rebounds for Philadelphia, which went 14 for 33 from 3-point range. J.J. Redick finished with 12 points.

"HOUSTON --  With the amount of offensive weapons Houston has, teams have to choose who they're going to try and stop. That often leaves other players with great opportunities to score, as was the case on Monday night when Utah keyed in on slowing down James Harden and Chris Paul to pave the way for Eric Gordon's big night. Gordon scored 17 of his season-high 33 points in the fourth quarter to power a huge run that put the Rockets on top, and they cruised to their 14th straight win, 120-99. ""All it takes is one of us to get hot and (Monday) it was EG,"" Paul said. ""And that was crazy."" Houston used a 15-0 run early in the fourth to take the lead and was up by four midway through the quarter after a layup by Joe Ingles. The Rockets then scored 11 points in a row, capped by two 3-pointers from Gordon to make it 111-96 with about three minutes to go. Gordon said that was the hottest quarter he's ever had and when he got rolling he hoped his teammates would continue to find him. ""You're looking for it every time down the court,"" he said. ""I think guys were looking for me and it was just a fun game in that fourth quarter."" Harden added 26 points, Clint Capela had 24 points and 20 rebounds and Gordon finished with a season-high seven 3-pointers. The Rockets struggled from long range for most of the night, making just nine of 31 3-pointers in the first three quarters. The found their groove in the final period, when they made eight of 12 with five from Gordon to pull away for their 20th win in 21 games. Coach Mike D'Antoni was certainly happy Houston got the victory, but could have done without the Rockets waiting until the fourth quarter to pull away. ""We're getting away from getting out there and getting after them right at the beginning and blowing them out,"" D'Antoni said. ""Now we're waiting until the end. We're going against that and we'll try to do a better job."" Rodney Hood had 26 points off the bench for the Jazz, who have lost six of their last seven games. Without Dante Exum all season as he recovers from left shoulder surgery, the Jazz were also missing Derrick Favors, Rudy Gobert and Raul Neto to various injuries on Monday night. ""We didn't have enough at the end,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""We couldn't get stops in the fourth quarter and that can happen. We can say we ran out of gas, but they just continued to put pressure on us."" Utah led by five points entering the fourth quarter and had extended the lead to eight with about 10 minutes remaining. Houston then scored the next 15 points, powered by three straight 3-pointers by Gordon, to make it 98-91 with about 7 1/2 minutes left. Gordon made the first two before the Jazz called a timeout, but that didn't cool him off as he hit another on Houston's first possession after the timeout. Capela added a three-point play after that before Trevor Ariza added a 3-pointer to bring the crowd to its feet and spur Snyder to call another timeout. The Rockets were up by one at halftime. Utah scored the last five points of the third with a 3-pointer from Hood to take an 84-79 lead into the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Jazz: Favors missed his second straight game with an eye laceration. ... Gobert sat out for the second game in a row with a left knee sprain and bone bruise. ...

Harden tied Moses Malone's single-season franchise record of 29 straight games with 20 points or more. STICKING TO FOOTBALL Andre Ware, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1989 at Houston, participated in the Rockets' First Shot promotion on Monday night where celebrities can win a $5,000 donation from owner Tilman Fertitta if they make a free throw. It didn't appear that the 49-year-old's athletic prowess translated to the basketball court as he air-balled the shot . Ware laughed and shook his head as the ball fell short of the basket. He wasn't too upset though as he still earned $1,000 for charity by participating in the event.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Timberwolves needed a spark at the end of a so-so homestand. Jimmy Butler picked them up and carried them on his ailing back. Butler powered through a recent bout of back spasms to score 37 points, sinking two free throws that gave the Timberwolves the lead with 2.5 seconds left in a 108-107 comeback victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. ""I ride for everybody in this locker room. I'm going to battle with them as long as I can walk,"" Butler said. Jamal Crawford pitched in a season-high 23 points in 23 minutes, with 16 in the fourth quarter to spur the rally from 10 points down with 7 1/2 minutes remaining. The Wolves completed their third comeback win this season from a double-digit deficit, with Butler and Crawford combining for their final 21 points. ""We needed to get some passion going,"" said Crawford, whose steal near midcourt set up a fast-break feed to Butler for a crowd-cajoling dunk that brought the Wolves within 97-95 with 5:31 to go. Crawford's three-point play with 2:49 left pulled the Wolves to 105-104, and Blazers star C.J. McCollum missed his next two shots. Defense has been a recurring problem for Minnesota this season, but Andrew Wiggins stuffed a shot by Al-Farouq Aminu along the baseline with 1:06 left to cause a critical turnover. Butler made two foul shots on the other end to put the Wolves in front again at 106-105, with the fans at Target Center chanting ""MVP! MVP!"" McCollum's pull-up jumper gave the Blazers the lead back. After misses by Butler and Lillard, Aminu fouled Butler at the end of his drive to the basket to put him at the line. Butler went 12 for 21 from the floor and 11 for 12 from the line, finishing one point off his season high for a squad that needed the jolt with just one set of consecutive wins over the last month. The Wolves had already blown fourth-quarter leads to Philadelphia and Phoenix, neither winning teams, on this five-game stretch at home. ""He's changed everything for us,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. McCollum scored 20 points for the Blazers, whose three-game winning streak ended when Damian Lillard's 3-point heave at the buzzer fell short. Jusuf Nurkic had 20 points and Lillard added 17 points and 13 assists, but the Blazers had 17 turnovers and squandered their chance to finish 4-1 on a five-game road trip for a second time this season. ""Maybe we've just got to be stronger with the ball and make smarter plays,"" Lillard said. TIP-INS Blazers: Lillard notched his fifth double-double of the season, his second in a row. ... The Blazers went 10 for 24 from 3-point range, their sixth game in the last eight outings with double-digit makes from long range. Wolves: This was Butler's fourth 30-plus point game of the season. ... It was the team's fourth straight game with 10 or fewer turnovers. WHISTLE BLOWERS Aminu added 13 points for the Blazers, who shot a season-best 54.8 percent from the field. They were awarded only five throws, none in the first half, a discrepancy that had them steamed afterward. ""I got hit in the face one time, and it's like in shooting motion,"" Lillard said. ""It's a clear, easy play, and it's impacting the game, man."" Lillard also argued for a call that never came as he tried to set up for his final attempt. ""The guy's just hugging me from the back, literally hugging me,"" Lillard said. ""It's three referees out there. Somebody's got to see it."" Whether they were fouling or not was irrelevant to the Wolves. For once, they displayed some intensity on defense down the stretch. ""Now if we can do it every possession, it'd be some beautiful basketball,"" Butler said. ""We've yet to see that, though."" THE BUTLER DID IT Butler was lying on the floor in the locker room in pain on Saturday after Minnesota's 108-106 loss to Phoenix on Saturday, putting his status for this game in question. He played as if there was never any doubt about his condition, with 10 of the team's first 14 points in the first five minutes of the game. ""He's a special player,"" Thibodeau said. NAME THAT BACKUP GUARD Shabazz Napier had 15 points in 19 minutes for the Blazers, while Shabazz Muhammad watched from the Wolves bench during his fifth straight healthy scratch.

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook's co-stars stepped back, and the reigning MVP stepped forward to deliver a winning performance. Westbrook scored 16 of his season-high 38 points in the fourth quarter, including the tiebreaking free throw with 2.3 seconds left, to lift the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 95-94 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Monday night. Oklahoma City survived, despite just eight points from Paul George and four from Carmelo Anthony. Westbrook carried the load by making 16 of 28 shots. ""For anybody, if any one of us has the hot hand, you've got to keep going,"" George said. ""Russ definitely had the hot hand. We were fine with him taking the game over. He had the hot hand and was confident with shots and he was getting great looks. You can't really be mad about that, the looks that he got. He got wide-open looks and layups. We're living on his back tonight."" Westbrook drove hard to the basket in the closing seconds and was fouled on a shot close to the hoop. He made the first of two free throws to put the Thunder ahead. He missed the second, and the Nuggets called timeout with 1.7 seconds left. Denver's Gary Harris missed short on an off-balance 3-pointer as time expired. Westbrook also had nine rebounds and six assists for the Thunder, who have won seven of 10 to even their record at 15-15. ""He was playing,"" Anthony said. ""He was being aggressive, playing downhill. His shot was falling tonight. He led us tonight. He led us to this victory, especially offensively. He put the team on his back tonight offensively and defensively, we came together as a unit and won the game.""

""We didn't need to wait for the last shot to win the game,"" Denver center Nikola Jokic said. ""I think could have won with like three minutes to go, because we had the lead. We just needed to push a little bit ... it's no one's fault, but I just think we had an opportunity to finish the game earlier."" Oklahoma City led 52-44 at the break. The Thunder, who often have struggled in the third quarter, did so again at the start of this one. Denver rallied to tie the game at 54 in the opening minutes. The Nuggets took the lead on a layup by Wilson Chandler and followed with a 3-pointer by Craig that rattled in. The Thunder rallied with an 8-0 run that included two 3-pointers by Alex Abrines, but Denver bounced back to take a 76-70 lead into the fourth.

"DALLAS --  Isaiah Canaan and the Phoenix Suns were confident they could come back to win. After all, they had just done it two days ago. Alex Len had 14 points and 14 rebounds to help Phoenix rally past the Dallas Mavericks 97-91 on Monday night for its second consecutive victory on the road. ""It's a long game and it's all about getting stops and converting on the other end,"" Canaan said. ""I told them when we get stops, the shots are going to fall in the second half and that's what happened."" TJ Warren scored 19 points and Canaan added 17 as the Suns (11-21) improved to 2-0 on a three-game trip despite playing without injured guard Devin Booker. Phoenix erased a 15-point deficit Saturday in a 108-106 win against Minnesota. Canaan, Len and Troy Daniels (12 points) all reached double figures off the bench as the Suns' reserves outscored their Mavericks counterparts 55-28. ""It's crazy. When they come in with that high energy, playing the right way, spacing the floor, it works a lot for us,"" Warren said. ""Continue to do that, it's going to translate into wins."" Dallas (8-23) lost its third straight game and has one win in its last seven. ""You have to give credit to Phoenix; they beat us badly,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Bad starts and poor finishes are the recipe for losses."" Harrison Barnes had 26 points and Devin Harris added 14 for Dallas. Yogi Ferrell and Wesley Matthews each scored 13. Phoenix came from behind and won the game in the fourth quarter. ""Our defense kept us in it again,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said. ""That was the key for us. ... If we can keep playing good defense and make it tough for teams to score and rebound the ball the way we have been, we'll figure out a way to score eventually."" After the Suns had trailed for the entire second half, Canaan tied it 79-all on a 3-pointer with 7:29 remaining. Len gave Phoenix its first lead since the second quarter on a pair of free throws. Phoenix led by as many as eight in the fourth quarter, 89-81, but didn't seal the victory until Warren made one of two free throws with 11.4 seconds remaining and knocked down two more with 5.6 seconds left. It was the second consecutive game in which Dallas let a fourth-quarter lead slip away. San Antonio went on a 13-0 run Saturday over the final 4:11, including a game-winning basket by Manu Ginobili for a 98-96 victory. ""Execution is a big part of it,"" Harris said. ""Tonight we gave up too many paint points, especially in the fourth quarter."" NUMBER RETIRED The Mavericks announced they will retire Derek Harper's No. 12 on Jan. 7 against the New York Knicks. Harper played 12 seasons for Dallas and holds franchise records for assists (5,111) and steals (1,551). He ranks fourth in points (12,597). He will be the third player in team history to have his number retired. ZEKE SIGHTING Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott sat courtside by the Mavericks bench.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs are slowly returning to full health, something the Los Angeles Clippers can only hope for. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 19 points and San Antonio beat the undermanned Clippers 109-91 on Monday night in Kawhi Leonard's home debut this season. Los Angeles was without five players, including leading scorers Blake Griffin and Lou Williams, but San Antonio had little empathy considering the rash of injuries it has faced. ""We're going through the same thing,"" said Spurs veteran Tony Parker, who played in just his 10th game. ""We don't have everybody and we have a lot of guys in minute restrictions and stuff like that. Other teams, they're coming at us and so, we have to do the same thing. You just have to respect them and (know that) everybody can play in the NBA."" Parker had 16 points and seven assists in 23 minutes, his second-longest stint after missing the first 19 games while recovering from left quadriceps tendon surgery. San Antonio is taking a similar incremental approach with Leonard, limiting his minutes after he missed the first 27 games of the season due to right quadriceps tendinopathy. ""He didn't get hurt again, so, he's OK,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of Leonard's abbreviated outing. Leonard did not play in the second half against the Clippers after scoring seven points in 16 minutes during the first half, ending his streak of 110 straight games scoring in double figures. The 6-foot-7 forward made his first attempt, pulling up from 13 feet in the lane for his first points in the AT&amp;T Center since May 9. Leonard gave the crowd and the Spurs' bench a scare when he tumbled awkwardly to the court on a contested layup, but he got up quickly while shaking his head over the non-call as Popovich screamed at the officials. Leonard attempted only seven shots, driving and kicking the ball more than he attempted to shoot. San Antonio was minus-three when Leonard was on the court as the team tries to work him back into the lineup. ""It's very hard to tell because he's playing only 15 minutes,"" Spurs veteran Manu Ginobili said. ""The rotation is not quite there. So, I think it's a work in progress."" The Clippers are weeks away from being able to make any major assessments, with Griffin expected to miss two months after spraining his left knee Nov. 27 against the Los Angeles Lakers. ""This has just been a terrible season so far for our health,"" guard Austin Rivers said. ""Seems like one guy comes in, two guys go out. One guy comes in, two guys go out. Two guys come back, one guy goes out. It's just constant. We've got to keep our head up."" Los Angeles rookie Jamil Wilson had a season-high 13 points. DeAndre Jordan also scored 13 to go with 14 rebounds. FEELING FINE Parker played 23 minutes, one fewer than his season high at Dallas on Dec. 12. The Spurs' longtime point guard is encouraged by his progress after tearing his left quadriceps tendon May 4 in the playoffs against Houston, but is eager to return to playing full-time. ""Yeah, I'm fine, just have to be patient,"" Parker said. ""It's going to come, slowly but surely, but I'm just happy to be out there and just play. I'm on a minute restriction, so I can't play back-to-back."" DOUBLE TROUBLE The previous time Leonard failed to reach double digits in scoring was Jan. 12, 2016, against Detroit. He shot 1 for 7 from the field while finishing with seven points. HIGH NOTE Wilson, a rookie out of Marquette, was 3 for 10 on 3-pointers in topping his previous season high of 10 points at Washington last Friday. ""He's looking for a shot and he's more comfortable,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""Jamil has an NBA skill and that is that he can shoot the 3 and he can stretch the floor."" TIP-INS Clippers: Austin Rivers was cleared to play after suffering a concussion Dec. 13 against Orlando. ... Griffin missed his 10th game with a sprained MCL. The Clippers were also without Patrick Beverley (right knee surgery), Danilo Gallinari (left glute contusion), Wesley Johnson (sore left foot) and Williams (sprained right foot). ...

"On Dec. 18, 2017, Kobe Bryant had both of his numbers retired, and they will hang in the Staples Center rafters forever. (0:49) LOS ANGELES --  On the night the Los Angeles Lakers retired both of Kobe Bryant's jerseys, Kevin Durant provided his own tribute with a deadly accurate impression of the Black Mamba. Durant couldn't hit a shot early on, but simply refused to stop launching. And when the game was finally on the line, he didn't miss. Durant scored 36 points and hit a tiebreaking 22-foot jumper with 7.3 seconds left in overtime, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Lakers 116-114 Monday for their ninth consecutive victory. Klay Thompson had 17 points and 10 rebounds as the defending NBA champions predictably dampened a celebratory night for the Lakers, who honored Bryant with a halftime ceremony. ""That was for Kobe Night,"" Durant said with a grin. ""I had to get them up for Kob."" Durant and Thompson combined to miss 31 of their first 40 shots, allowing the Lakers to keep it close. Durant was 6 for 25 in regulation but he went 4 for 4 in overtime, capped by the pure go-ahead jumper that eventually won it. Stephen Curry missed his fifth straight game with a sprained ankle, and Draymond Green sat out for the fourth time in five games with right shoulder soreness. Durant and the Warriors still hit enough big buckets to handle the Lakers, but only after plenty of misses. ""I've had so many bad shooting nights, and I know that it makes just for a better player,"" Durant said. ""I got better tonight. I fought through it, I was able to make some shots down the stretch, and I feel more confident going into my next game shooting the ball."" The Lakers missed several opportunities down the regulation stretch to seize control of the game. They also had a chance to tie it at the end, but David West blocked Lonzo Ball's shot and Brandon Ingram couldn't beat the buzzer. ""The past two years, we've got blown out of games (like this),"" said Lakers forward Larry Nance Jr., whose eight points included a thunderous dunk over Durant that brought the crowd to its feet. ""Now we're taking these guys to overtime, and it's going down to the last shot. That's a huge step in growth. Now the next step is winning these games."" Kyle Kuzma scored 25 points in a reserve role and Ingram added 19 for the Lakers, who have lost three straight and eight of 10. Ball had 16 points, six assists and six rebounds. BIG FINISH The Warriors nursed a narrow lead in the fourth period despite their two stars' shooting struggles, but Ingram drove for the tying layup with 27 seconds left. After Durant missed, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope drove downcourt with the crowd on its feet and a chance to emulate Kobe on a late game-winner. But Caldwell-Pope badly missed his long jumper at the buzzer. He finished with 14 points on 4-of-17 shooting. Bryant didn't stick around for overtime, leaving with his family. KOBE'S NIGHT The Lakers saluted Bryant by hanging his No. 8 and No. 24 jerseys high above the Staples Center court during a ceremony attended by dozens of his former teammates and competitors, from Shaquille O'Neal to Allen Iverson. Bryant is the leading scorer in franchise history, and Magic Johnson declared him ""the greatest who ever wore the purple and gold."" Bryant spent his brief remarks thanking his friends and the Lakers before addressing his three daughters at courtside: ""If you do the work, work hard enough, then dreams come true."" TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State played its final road game of 2017. ... The Warriors will host the Lakers in Oakland on Friday night. Lakers: Ingram left briefly in the third quarter after taking a hard fall underneath the basket. He had a bruise on his right cheek, but felt good enough to continue.","400975201"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Zach Randolph and Vince Carter have been playing for so long that some of their teammates were toddlers when they broke into the NBA. That double dose of experience worked out quite well for Sacramento on Tuesday night. Randolph scored 27 points and Carter had two key plays late in the game, helping the Kings to a 101-95 victory over the slumping Philadelphia 76ers. Buddy Hield had 24 points and Frank Mason III finished with 16 for Sacramento, which came back from a 16-point second-half deficit. ""Zach started us out and really carried us for a while,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""He was really, really terrific."" The 36-year-old Randolph was rejuvenated after he rested during Sunday's 108-93 loss at Toronto. He made 12 of 19 shots and grabbed five rebounds. ""He's an amazing low-post threat, for a long period of time,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Besides putting up solid numbers -- Randolph entered leading the team in scoring and rebounding at 15.2 points and 7 boards per game -- he is enjoying his role as veteran leader. ""We get along well,"" he said. ""These kids are working, they're playing hard, and it's showing on the court. We believe in them."" Ben Simmons had 13 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists for Philadelphia, which lost for the seventh time in eight games while playing without center Joel Embiid for the second straight night due to a back injury. Robert Covington led the 76ers with 17 points. Philadelphia looked out of sync without Embiid and Sacramento took advantage. Hield gave the Kings a 79-78 lead with a 3-pointer with 9:48 remaining. Carter made a full-court outlet pass to Garrett Temple for a layup that made it 92-86 Sacramento with 4:18 left. The 40-year-old Carter  made another crucial play down the stretch, hustling for an offensive rebound that led to Randolph's jumper with 1:59 to play. ""Coach trusts me to be solid and consistent, not make mistakes and help our guys when I can,"" Carter said. ""I've been in big situations so I enjoy being on the court."" Simmons answered with a driving basket that made it 96-92, but he couldn't convert the free throw after being fouled and the rally fizzled from there. ""I don't think we've been focusing down the stretch -- missing shots, not calling the right plays,"" Simmons said. ""It's just little things like that. It comes down to us focusing, and making sure we're committed to defense and offense at the same time."" EMBIID'S ABSENCE Embiid did not travel with the team to Chicago for Monday's 117-115 loss to the Bulls. He was expected to play against the Kings on the second night of back-to-back games, but Brown said the team's medical staff advised him to keep the 7-foot center on the sideline. The injury has kept Embiid out for four of the last six games. Brown said Embiid's back ""is still a little bit sore."" BROWN ON OKAFOR Jahlil Okafor, whom Philadelphia traded to Brooklyn earlier this month, made headlines in New York on Tuesday for saying he was glad to be with an organization that had ""an actual NBA coaching staff."" ""Jahlil knows what we did here,"" Brown said before the loss. ""It's a young person who gave a quote. ...

"WASHINGTON --  Bradley Beal and the Washington Wizards put away the New Orleans Pelicans with one impressive stretch. Beal scored 14 of his 26 points in the third quarter, helping the Wizards top the Pelicans 116-106 on Tuesday night. Mike Scott had a season-high 24 points in 23 minutes and John Wall added 18 points and 10 assists as Washington won for the third time in four games. Marcin Gortat had 10 points, 14 rebounds and three blocked shots. New Orleans got another big game from Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, but the Pelicans dropped their second straight. Davis scored 37 points, and Cousins finished with 26 points and 13 rebounds. ""They're great players,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""They're two All-Stars, two future Hall of Famers, but I thought our guys set the tone in the first quarter. It started with defensive stops."" The Wizards led 36-19 after one and ran their lead out to 25 before the Pelicans closed to 61-55 at halftime. After New Orleans tied it at 61 early in the third quarter, Washington pulled away with a 24-5 run. ""You may be able to do that one time in an NBA game where you're down 20, 25 points to be able to work your way back all the way to a tie,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""But you give them separation again and the chances are not very good that you're going to do that."" Beal added two 3-pointers to make it 91-68 just before the end of the third.

Wizards: F Otto Porter sat out for the second straight game with a bruised right hip. ... In the first half, New Orleans shot 24 free throws and Washington just five.

Boogie likes to talk junk."" Just then, Cousins appeared on the threshold of the Wizards' locker room to remind Wall they had postgame plans and not to speak negatively about him. GREAT SCOTT Scott was 11 for 15 from the field. The reserve forward has made 28 of his 39 shots (71.8 percent) in his last three games. ""I have it going right now,"" Scott said. TIMELY TIME OUT The Wizards' big third-quarter run came after Brooks called a timeout after New Orleans tied it at 61. He preferred not to share the message he gave his team.

"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks have blown big fourth-quarter leads far too many times this season, leading to disheartening losses. The Bucks wasted another sizeable advantage in the final period Tuesday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers, but fought back this time to capture a 119-116 win. ""It was a big step for our team. It shows maturity,"" said Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks with 27 points. ""Usually, in a situation like that, we give the game away."" Eric Bledsoe scored 26 points for Milwaukee, which ended a five-game losing streak to Cleveland. Khris Middleton had 18 points and 10 assists, and Malcolm Brogdon finished with 16 points. ""We kind of bent but we didn't break,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""Giannis made plays down the stretch. We stayed together. We are playing against one of the best teams in the world."" LeBron James scored 39 points for Cleveland, which lost for just the second time in its last 20 games. James had seven assists but grabbed just one rebound in the waning seconds. Kevin Love finished with 21 points. After a slow start, the Bucks got to the Cavaliers for 39 second-quarter points. Milwaukee cracked the 100-point barrier early in the fourth, but then stalled. Milwaukee led 103-83 when Cleveland launched a furious comeback with James on the bench. Back-to-back 3-pointers by Dwyane Wade put the Cavaliers up 107-105, capping a 24-3 run and giving the visitors their first lead since the second quarter. ""Obviously, tonight (Wade) showed what he's capable of still doing,"" James said. ""It's a luxury having a guy like that coming off the bench."" A 3-pointer by Brogdon put the Bucks back in front with 3:38 remaining. A traditional three-point play by James put the Cavaliers ahead 113-112 with about two minutes left. Tony Snell responded with a 3-pointer for Milwaukee with 58.9 seconds remaining. After a Cleveland miss, Antetokounmpo grabbed a loose ball, hit a short shot and was fouled. His free throw gave the Bucks a 117-113 lead with 5.9 seconds to go. Wade finished with 14 points for Cleveland, and Jeff Green had 13. Milwaukee took its first lead early in the second quarter at 41-40 with Love and James on the bench. The Bucks remained hot even after the duo returned and at one point extended their advantage to 14. They led 69-58 at the half, sparked by 17 points from Middleton, who had a four-point play, as well as a 14-2 advantage in fast-break points. UNTIMELY FOULS Kyle Korver fouled Antetokounmpo as he attempted a desperation 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter. Antetokounmpo made all three free throws to pull Milwaukee within four points. Wade fouled Antetokounmpo with less than one second left in the third. He sank both free throws to give the Bucks a 15-point lead. BYE-BYE BRADLEY CENTER? Barring a playoff matchup, Wade likely played his last game at the Bradley Center, where he starred for Marquette, which shares the facility with the Bucks. The teams will move into a new arena next season. ""I've had a lot of amazing moments here,"" Wade said. ""Every time I come here and look up and see that jersey up there in the rafters, I definitely know I did something special in this city and this arena. If this was the last game, I need a piece of this building because it's very special to me and to my basketball career.""

Toronto connected on 8 of 13 3-point shots in the first half and finished 16 of 33. ""You're not going to have nights like this all the time, but it looks really good when you have nights like this,"" Lowry said.

"Victor Oladipo hits a 3-pointer to put away the Hawks in the 4th quarter. (0:17) ATLANTA --  Victor Oladipo didn't quite approach 40 points this time. He didn't have to. Oladipo scored 23 points to lead the Indiana Pacers over the Atlanta Hawks 105-95 Wednesday night, two days after scoring 38 points in a loss to Boston. Oladipo made 8 of 15 shots Wednesday, including 3 of 5 3-pointers, and Indiana built a 20-point fourth-quarter lead before the Hawks scored the final 10 points.

""I think defensively we turned it up and that's the reason why we did so well down the stretch."" Indiana led just 53-51 at halftime. The Pacers mucked up the motion offense of Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer, whose team made just 16 of 41 shots in the second half. The Hawks have yet to win consecutive games his season, and they were done in by their starters, who were outscored 77-49.

(2:09) BOSTON --  Kelly Olynyk was honored by the Boston Celtics and showered with cheers by their fans. Then he went out and beat his old team. Olynyk scored a career-high 32 points in his rousing return to Boston, and the undermanned Miami Heat hung on Wednesday for a 90-89 victory over the Celtics. On a night when the Celtics celebrated their former forward in his first game back, the popular Olynyk received a standing ovation from the Boston crowd and led the Heat (16-15) to another win against the top team in the Eastern Conference. When it was over, he took photos with fans. ""It's special. Just all the love and support they've given me, from the organization, from the team, to the city, to the fans,"" said Olynyk, who signed with Miami as a free agent last offseason. ""It's special to come back here and play in front of them. It's something that's special. For them to recognize you and honor you like that, that's something that doesn't always happen."" Josh Richardson had 19 points and six assists for Miami, which took two of three in the season series. The Heat ended Boston's 16-game winning streak earlier this season with a victory at home. ""We had nine guys,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We were running out of bodies, guys were starting to get tired. I knew guys were going to have to play probably 20 minutes in the second half. Sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures in this league."" Kyrie Irving paced the Celtics (26-8) with 33 points, but missed a jumper from the right wing that bounced off the rim at the buzzer. Jaylen Brown scored 16 and Marcus Smart had 15. ""We still had a chance to steal one tonight,"" Irving said. ""Just came up short."" Boston shot only 37.5 percent, and nearly halfway into the final quarter had only five baskets in the entire second half. ""Just because they don't have all of their players, we've still got to come out and play,"" Smart said. ""If this isn't a wakeup call for us, I don't know what is."" Boston big man Al Horford went 2 for 10 from the floor with eight rebounds and fouled out with 8:14 to play. Miami led 87-76 with 2 1/2 minutes left before Irving sparked a 13-3 run with nine points. Miami pulled out to a 71-60 lead when Olynyk drained consecutive 3-pointers in front of Boston's bench with just under 10 minutes to go. The Celtics sliced it to 79-75, but Richardson converted a three-point play and Olynyk nailed a 3 on consecutive possessions with less than five minutes left. The Heat went on a 15-2 run midway through the third quarter, taking their first lead and building a 58-51 advantage on Bam Adebayo's one-handed flip in the lane.

""I think it's a fun way to honor. It's bigger than what you do on the court,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said before the game. ""He embraced that, and I thought he lived that out well. It wasn't just talk when the cameras were on. He was out all the time."" There was a brief video of Olynyk doing events and he was given a standing ovation early in the second quarter.

"NEW YORK --  For a guy who doesn't jump very high, Zach Randolph sure has climbed up the rebounding list. Randolph became the 20th player in NBA history with 18,000 points and 10,000 rebounds, helping the Sacramento Kings to a 104-99 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. At 6-foot-9 and 250 pounds, Randolph has never been a high flyer. But he hasn't needed to be during a 17-year career in which he's averaged 10.6 rebounds per game. ""I tell the young guys, it's not about who jumps the highest and how strong you are,"" Randolph said. ""Rebounding's about positioning and having a knack for the ball and reading where the ball will come off, having a sense where the ball is going to bounce to. It's about a combination of things, it ain't just about athletic ability or just jumping up and down."" George Hill scored 22 points to lead the Kings in their first back-to-back sweep of the season. Randolph added 21 points and eight rebounds. The Kings got off to a sizzling start following their victory in Philadelphia a night earlier, then held on after Brooklyn cut a 21-point lead to two with just over a minute to play. The Nets missed a flurry of chances to tie before Hill finished it off with two free throws with 2.8 seconds remaining. The Kings had been 0-5 this season on the second night of a back-to-back. ""We're getting better,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""Just each guy learning the nuances of the game."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 16 points but was among the many Nets with poor-shooting nights. Brooklyn shot under 40 percent from the field in its fourth straight loss. ""You know we've got to make shots, we can't turn the ball over, etcetera, etcetera,"" Dinwiddie said. ""But at the same time, if we play basketball the way we're supposed to like we did in the second half and they don't score 64 points in the first half, we're not in that situation."" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game his team needed to start better, but Brooklyn couldn't have done much worse. Sacramento made 16 of 21 shots and raced to a 36-20 lead after one quarter, which grew to 44-23 on Skal Labissiere's three-point play early in the second. The lead was still 16 at halftime before the Nets finally got into the game, getting as close as 101-99 on Dinwiddie's three-point play with 1:10 left. TIP-INS Kings: Rookie G De'Aaron Fox didn't play because of a bruised right thigh. ... Reserve G Buddy Hield missed his first six shots and three in row were blocked before he made a jumper in the fourth quarter. Nets: Brooklyn has dropped two straight at home to Sacramento after winning the first four meetings at Barclays Center. ... Rondae Hollis-Jefferson finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Z-BO'S BOARDS Randolph joined Pau Gasol and Dirk Nowitzki as the only active players with 18,000 points and 10,000 rebounds. Overall, he is the 39th player with 10,000 boards. ""It felt good because I always dedicated myself, always thought I was one of the best rebounders in the league,"" Randolph said. ""So I really am proud about that. It's a blessing."" NO-KAFOR Jahlil Okafor sat out for the second straight game after making his lone appearance for the Nets since they acquired him from Philadelphia. He has not played in the other four games as the Nets try to get him into basketball shape after he was largely inactive with the 76ers. ""He was not playing. You can do as much off-court stuff as you want and run lines and get on the treadmill, but basketball shape, basketball rhythm is a little different,"" Atkinson said. ""So we're working toward getting him up to speed there. He's working his tail off with the coaches and our performance team.""","400975208"
"CHICAGO --  The Chicago Bulls' offense has exploded with Nikola Mirotic back in the lineup. Denzel Valentine had 16 points and 10 rebounds, Mirotic had 15 points and 10 rebounds, and the Bulls beat the Orlando Magic 112-94 on Wednesday night for their seventh straight win. Chicago had lost 10 straight without Mirotic prior to his return from a facial fracture Dec. 8 and hasn't lost since to improve to 10-20. Behind a season-high 31 assists, the Bulls matched their longest winning streak in three years and sent Orlando to a sixth straight loss. Nikola Vucevic scored 18 points for the Magic. ""We're improving the communication we didn't have before,"" said Mirotic, who missed the start of the season after teammate Bobby Portis punched him in October. ""Offensively playing finally the way we have to play, scoring a lot of points and sharing the ball, especially on fast breaks. It's been a lot of fun."" The excitement began early for Chicago, which started on a 12-0 run. Facing the league's fourth-worst scoring defense, the Bulls' strong ball movement resulted in easy looks inside and out, and the team had assists on 10 of its first 15 shots. Robin Lopez connected on his first four attempts for a team averaging 111.1 points per contest since Mirotic returned to the lineup -- up from 95.7 points in 23 games without the forward. Chicago took a 30-point lead with 8:17 left in the fourth quarter -- its largest advantage of the season. ""The start was key,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I was really pleased with the way the guys came out of the gate. ""But the thing that pleases you most is the unselfishness."" Chicago had six players score in double figures, including Kris Dunn with 15 points and Portis with 14. Injury-riddled Orlando, which played without leading scorers Evan Fournier and Aaron Gordon, struggled to keep pace. The Magic shot only 39 percent, including 5-of-27 on 3-point tries, en route to their 17th loss in 20 games. ""We've got to play really above ourselves right now to get a win,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""We didn't play a great basketball game and the result is what it is."" TIP-INS Magic: Fournier and Gordon were out of action yet again. Each is tied for the team lead with an 18.3-point per game average. Fournier missed his sixth straight game with a sprained right ankle while Gordon didn't play for the fourth time in five contests because of a right calf strain. Guard Terrance Ross missed a 10th straight game due to a sprained right knee. Bulls: Guard Zach LaVine, who is rehabbing from a February surgery to repair a torn ACL in his left knee, has been held out of several practices due to back spasms but should return soon. ""Zach's doing great,"" Hoiberg said. ""He's back to really feeling good again and, hopefully, we'll get him back on the practice court whenever our next practice is."" OUT AGAIN Already short-handed, Orlando only got 13:50 of playing time from guard Jonathan Isaac before he re-injured a right ankle that previously kept him out of action for 17 games. Isaac, who averages 5.7 points per game, just returned in Sunday's loss at Detroit. ""Hopefully, it's not too bad,"" Vogel said. ""X-rays were negative and we'll see how he is tomorrow."" GOING STREAKING Chicago's seventh straight win is the longest-active winning streak in the Eastern Conference and is the best for the franchise since it rolled off seven in a row from Dec. 18-27, 2014. ""We lost 10 straight,"" Portis said. ""We had a chip on our shoulder. We were so close to winning some of the games, we lost by one and two. We kind of found a way to start winning those games down the stretch.""","400975209"
"James Harden drops 51 points for the Rockets but it wasn't enough as the Lakers take down Houston 122-116. (0:43) HOUSTON --  Lakers rookie Kyle Kuzma set career highs with 38 points and seven 3-pointers against the NBA's hottest team, and he wasn't all that impressed with it. ""Why not? I scored 30s in summer league, so...,"" he said before trailing off. The stakes were a little higher Wednesday night. Kuzma helped the Lakers overcome James Harden's 51 points and end the Rockets' winning streak at 14 games with a 122-116 victory. ""It's a better team but it's the same mentality,"" Kuzma said. ""I've got the same mentality every time I step on the court. I try to play my hardest and just be locked in."" Houston lost for the first time since Nov. 14, while the Lakers snapped a three-game skid. It was tied before Los Angeles scored 10 straight points -- while Houston missed seven shots in a row -- to go up 110-100 with about four minutes left. Houston ended an almost four-minute scoring drought when Harden made a free throw, and he added three more after being fouled on a 3-point attempt a few seconds later to cut it to 110-104. But former Rocket Corey Brewer, who finished with 21 points, made a 3-pointer before Lonzo Ball hit two free throws to make it 115-104. ""The fact that we were able to kind of punch them early and you knew that run was coming and then find our composure again and hit some big plays and get some big stops, it was really good to see from our group,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. Harden powered Houston on a night when Chris Paul had just eight points before leaving early in the fourth quarter with a sore left leg. The Rockets made seven free throws down the stretch but hit just four field goals in the last eight minutes -- all in the final 1:05. ""We didn't play defense at all today,"" Houston's Trevor Ariza said. ""They got whatever they wanted and when that happens, you lose."" Kuzma was unstoppable in the first half, making all nine of his shots, including six 3-pointers. He cooled a bit after the break and finished 12 of 17 overall and 7 of 10 from deep. The Lakers led 100-92 after a 3-pointer by Josh Hart with about nine minutes to go, but the Rockets scored the next eight points. Ariza led the way in that span, scoring five points and blocking a shot by Brandon Ingram. The Rockets opened the third with a 6-1 run for their first lead of the game, 65-64, with about 9 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. Paul tied it on a 3-pointer later in the third, but Brewer made the last five points of the period to put the Lakers up 94-89 entering the fourth. The Lakers led by 22 points during the first half, but Houston used a 12-2 run midway through the second to cut the deficit and a 7-2 spurt to end that quarter to get within 63-59 at halftime.

Westbrook had 24 points and 10 rebounds to help the Thunder roll past the Jazz 107-79 on Wednesday night. After being outscored in the third quarter in 14 of their previous 16 games, the Thunder used it to take charge this time. Paul George and Carmelo Anthony both scored 10 points in the period to help Oklahoma City take an 87-60 lead into the fourth. In a defining moment, George exploded to the rim, then fully extended his arm back before dunking over Derrick Favors to give the Thunder a 62-44 lead. ""About time,"" Westbrook said. ""It's about time. I told him he hadn't dunked on anybody in a long time. It's about time he did something."" Westbrook made 10 of 13 shots and had seven assists and four steals. George and Anthony both finished with 18 points. For the first time in a while, the Thunder looked like they enjoyed playing. ""That's the most important part,"" Westbrook said. ""You've got to have fun and embrace the game. You don't take it for granted. Go out and compete and have fun at the same time. It's enjoyable. You have to enjoy it."" Oklahoma City has won eight of 11 after a rough start to the season. The Thunder (16-15) are above .500 for the first time since early November.

""When he came back in the second quarter, his stretch was the decisive stretch of the game,"" Carlisle said. ""It got our crowd into it, energized the team. Nobody else on our team can make those plays like he can."" Harrison Barnes scored 25 points, Smith had 15 points and five assists and the Mavericks, last in the Western Conference, won for just the second time in eight games -- five of those losses without Smith.

They were right by us all night long."" Smith struggled against Jackson early, and the Mavericks started their rally with him on the bench. But they went ahead for good with him on the floor during his 11-point second quarter. ""I was just coming out trying to do what I do,"" Smith said. ""My legs were heavy at first.

"Patty Mills puts the Spurs up three late in the game over the Blazers. (0:34) PORTLAND, Ore. --  Short-handed on bodies but not competitive spirit, the San Antonio Spurs found a way to grind out a win against a Trail Blazers team desperate to end its home losing streak. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 22 points, and Pau Gasol had 20 points and a season-high 17 rebounds as the Spurs beat Portland 93-91 on Wednesday night. San Antonio, which trailed by six in the fourth quarter, took an 86-85 lead with 5:04 remaining on a layup by Manu Ginobili, but didn't secure the victory until C.J. McCollum's 3-point shot glanced off the rim at the buzzer. The Spurs (22-10) were without starters Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker. Recovering from quadriceps injuries, both were rested on the first night of a back-to-back. Portland, coming off a 3-2 road trip, lost its fifth consecutive home game. The Blazers (16-15) are the only NBA team with a winning overall record but a losing mark at home. San Antonio also overcame a season-high 22 turnovers, and lows in free throws made (five) and attempted (six). ""I told them if I could bottle that effort at the end of the game, they'd win 82 games,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I thought we hung in there pretty good. Didn't play great, but I'm really proud of the effort."" San Antonio persevered by outrebounding Portland 53-38 and getting strong shooting performances from Aldridge and Gasol. ""He played big down there. He was more determined to get to the rim, and (was) making strong moves for us,"" Aldridge said of Gasol. The sloppiness wasn't lost on the Spurs, however. ""We didn't take care of the ball. That's what kept them in the game for the most part. We've got to do a better job of being aware of the value of the ball and make better decisions,"" Gasol said. Patty Mills and Ginobili came off the bench to score 10 points apiece for San Antonio. The Blazers struggled offensively, as their starting backcourt of McCollum and Damian Lillard combined to shoot 11 of 39. Lillard, hobbled throughout most of the second half by a sore knee, led Portland with 17 points. Jusuf Nurkic scored 15, while Evan Turner and Shabazz Napier scored 14 each for the Blazers. McCollum, who was 5 of 22, had 13 points. Portland coach Terry Stotts said Lillard's lack of mobility affected his play-calling late in the game. ""I think if I'm able to play, we win that game. No question about it,"" Lillard said. San Antonio led 54-46 at halftime after a torrid first half from Aldridge and Gasol, who combined to shoot 15 of 20 from the floor. The Spurs withstood a rough stretch during the third quarter, when Nurkic scored 11 points during a 17-4 run that gave the Blazers a 64-61 lead. But the Spurs recovered, grabbing a 74-72 lead after three quarters on Kyle Anderson's buzzer-beating 3-pointer. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio attempted only one free throw in the first half.

Durant added 22 points, eight rebounds and two blocked shots as Golden State was down five regulars again, including two-time MVP Stephen Curry out for his sixth straight game with a sprained right ankle. ""Obviously we want our whole team back,"" Durant said. ""Coach knows how important guys coming off the bench are. It's only going to be good for confidence."" Thompson shot 10 for 16 overall and didn't miss until a 3-point try with 6:10 left before halftime. Curry tweeted in the midst of Thompson's hot start: ""Somebody is having a great game!"" Thompson received a rare technical -- his seventh in seven seasons -- with 10:22 left in the game for arguing when he thought he was fouled. ""Gotta keep my cool,"" Thompson said. ""Learn from it."" He didn't get as many touches after intermission. ""That's fine, we won. We'll take that result every time,"" Thompson said. Marc Gasol had 21 points, nine rebounds and five assists for Memphis, which started a stretch with seven of eight games on the road. The Grizzlies were 10 of 44 in the second half, shot 12 for 31 from 3-point range and committed 17 turnovers. ""I think we got a little more static in the second half offensively, a little more predictable,"" Gasol said. ""The ball didn't move as much."" The Warriors had their own issues after the break. ""We were stagnant, we had guys standing around, we didn't seem to be playing with much energy,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""Guys didn't want to run. We were standing constantly on the perimeter."" Omri Casspi came off the bench to contribute 12 points and six rebounds. Kerr would far prefer a healthy roster, but he appreciates the opportunities many of his role players are receiving to play more significant an important minutes. ""I like it,"" said Kerr, who certainly wasn't pleased with the 16 turnovers. The Warriors began a seven-game homestand in a stretch with nine of 10 games at home before next playing away from Oracle Arena on Jan. 3 at Dallas. WINNING STREAKS Golden State became the fourth team in NBA history to post double-digit winning streaks in five straight seasons. Also doing so were the San Antonio Spurs (from 2010-16), Boston Celtics (1970-75) and Seattle SuperSonics (1992-97). ""It just says we've had lots of talent,"" Kerr said. ""It's a good time to be a Warriors fan, obviously, or a Warriors coach."" CURRY ON COURT Curry did some light on-court work at morning shootaround a day after the Warriors said the two-time MVP would be out at least another week with the ankle injury. Kerr said it was Curry's first time moving laterally, and he wouldn't scrimmage or practice before being examined again. ""He had a good day today. He was working out with Steve Nash and Q (Bruce Fraser) and got a lot of good stuff and it looked like he was moving pretty well,"" Kerr said. ""A good sign."" Golden State has won all six games since Curry injured the ankle on Dec. 4 at New Orleans. Curry will miss two more games this week, as well as the Christmas Day showdown against Cleveland before getting evaluated again. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis beat the Warriors 111-101 at home on Oct. 21. Now, the Grizzlies started and will end Golden State's homestand, returning to Oracle Arena on Dec. 30. They play at Phoenix twice in six nights beginning Thursday, going home in the middle before a second visit to the desert next Tuesday. ... Rookie Ivan Rabb, who's from Oakland and attended California in nearby Berkeley, made a late appearance. Warriors: Thompson's first-half points were his most in any half this season. ... Also out for the Warriors were Andre Iguodala (flu-like symptoms), Draymond Green (right shoulder soreness), Shaun Livingston (sore right knee) and Zaza Pachulia (left shoulder soreness). Pachulia, who missed playing on his bobblehead night, could do contact work in practice as soon as Thursday when Green is expected to scrimmage after sitting out five of the last six games. ... Golden State had just two fast-break points. ... Damian Jones got his first action of the season, up from the G League.","400975215"
"LOS ANGELES --  Austin Rivers doesn't bother checking the Clippers' lineup these days. With so many injuries, he's never sure who's suiting up. Rivers scored 21 points, DeAndre Jordan grabbed 20 rebounds and Los Angeles beat the Phoenix Suns 108-94 on Wednesday night to end a three-game skid. ""We've got to stay in this until we get our guys back,"" Rivers said. ""Whoever is on the floor, let's just attack."" Back home from a 1-4 road trip, the injury-depleted Clippers had lost seven of 10 before leading all the way against a young Phoenix team that has its own injury woes. The Clippers' lineup included rookies C.J. Williams and Jamil Wilson. Williams had 12 points and Wilson scored 11. ""C.J. is solid,"" coach Doc Rivers said. ""Jamil can shoot the ball and he's learning everything else on the fly."" T.J. Warren led Phoenix with 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Josh Jackson added 17 points. The Suns dropped their ninth in a row to the Clippers at Staples Center. ""We were sloppy for most of the night,"" interim coach Jay Triano said. ""We lacked focus. A very subpar performance for us."" Ahead by 18 points at halftime, the Clippers extended their lead to 25 in the third quarter. They opened with an 18-11 run to go up 71-46, with Austin Rivers scoring nine points. The Suns answered with a 19-3 spurt to close to 74-64, getting points from five different players. ""That has been our season so far, trying to get over that hump,"" said Troy Daniels, who had seven points. ""We need to continue to keep pushing and I think we can get there."" The Clippers scored seven of the quarter's final nine points for an 81-66 lead going into the fourth. Willie Reed grabbed Montrezl Harrell's missed free throw and dunked, and Lou Williams followed with a jam. He finished with 18 points. ""We need to focus more on executing our offense,"" Jackson said. ""A lot of times we were just standing around a little bit, shot clock winding down and we end up putting up a bad shot."" Phoenix made a final stand in the fourth. Down by 22, the Suns used a 14-5 run to get to 98-85. Warren had 14 in the period, but the Clippers got six straight points from Jordan, who finished with 12, to put the game away. ""This is the best defense we've played all season,"" the younger Rivers said. SPARK PLUG Harrell scored 11 points off the bench, keeping up his pace in 10 games this month. He played 18 minutes, three more than his average. BACK WHERE HE BEGAN Clippers forward Sam Dekker next heads to Houston, where he began his NBA career after being drafted by the Rockets out of Wisconsin. He played two seasons there. ""I'm always going to have love for Houston because they gave me a chance,"" he said. ""Going to see some friends, get dinner with some familiar faces, which will be nice. But once we lace up on the court, it's all business.""

"CLEVELAND --  Once Isaiah Thomas slipped on his jersey and headband those familiar, warm feelings washed over him. His agonizing wait is almost over. After seven months away, countless days of rehab and wonder if he would play again, Thomas was again on an NBA court Thursday night. And although he only took part in the pregame layup lane, it was more than enough. ""It was everything,"" he said. ""I felt like a basketball player again."" Thomas dressed for the first time since coming to Cleveland in a trade and cheered from the bench on as LeBron James scored 34 points to lead the Cavaliers to their 12th straight home game, 115-112 over the Chicago Bulls. Kevin Love added 27 to help the Cavs improve to 19-2 since Nov. 11. But the biggest development for Cleveland was Thomas, who moved even closer to making his debut with the Cavs after injuring his right hip in the playoffs last May while with Boston. Earlier in the day, Thomas scrimmaged with the Canton Charge, the Cavs' G-League affiliate, before coming to Quicken Loans Arena. Thomas then put on his uniform, joined his teammates in their pregame prayer and took the floor for a warmup he won't forget. ""It just felt like I was a rookie again, like my first game,"" Thomas said. ""I haven't been in an arena like that where you're warming up, you're with teammates, that's so new right now. I've been down since May so just being out there put a smile on my face."" Thomas won't play in Cleveland's next game -- a Christmas Day marquee matchup with Golden State -- but the Cavs won't be without the All-Star point guard much longer. Thomas said his workout with Canton went well, and he'll wait for Cleveland's medical staff to clear him to play in a game. Thomas said facing the Warriors was never his goal. ""No, that was a target for my kids,"" he said. ""So they mad, but I'm fine with it. I have no rhythm, so there is no way I can play in an actual game right now and be very effective like I'm used to being. Slowly that will come back and I'll get a feel for it. I also gotta get in some shape. That was probably the toughest part today, the going up and down constantly, being a little winded."" Dwyane Wade had three steals and two blocks in the fourth quarter for Cleveland, which improved to 3-0 against the Bulls this season. With Cavs forward Jae Crowder guarding him closely, Denzel Valentine was short with a tying 3-pointer in the final second. Rookie Lauri Markkanen scored 25 points, Valentine had 18 and Nikola Mirotic 15 for the Bulls, who lost for the first time since Dec. 6. Chicago's win streak followed a 10-game losing skid. ""The last time we played in their gym, Cleveland absolutely drilled us,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""This shows the growth we've had as a team. We gave ourselves a chance to win and our effort was tremendous, especially after sitting on a plane when we got here for 40 minutes with no stairs (due to mix up at airport gate)."" The Bulls battled back from a 10-point deficit early in the fourth and were within four at 111-107 when James, who has been so clutch in the fourth quarter all season, sank a fadeaway baseline jumper. Chicago pulled to 113-112 on Valentine's layup before James made his two free throws and Cleveland got the key defensive stop to end it. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue missed the game with an undisclosed illness. Assistant coach Larry Drew filled in for Lue, who conducted his usual media session about 90 minutes before tip-off and was in Cleveland's locker room before the team announced he was sick. ""I could see that he wasn't feeling 100 percent,"" Drew said. ""I knew there was a chance he may not be available tonight. Right as we met with the team, that's when I got word that he would not be available tonight."" SMITH OUT Cavs starting guard J.R. Smith was a late scratch with a sore left knee. Channing Frye started and Drew juggled his lineup and rotation. Smith's injury is not believed to be serious, but Drew didn't know if he would be available to play the Warriors. TIP-INS Bulls: Bulls: G Zach LaVine (left knee) and G Cameron Payne (right foot) have yet to play this season and remain out. ... Dropped to 3-13 on the road. ... Valentine, who has stepped up his game lately, made three consecutive 3-pointers early in the third. ... Chicago attempted just one free throw in the first half. Cavaliers: Cleveland has made at least 10 3-pointers in a franchise-record 22 straight games. ... James became the first player to appear in 800 games for Cleveland. ... Smith's knee flared up following the morning shootaround and he was kept out as a precaution. ... G Derrick Rose still isn't ready to return to the floor after being sidelined with an ankle injury that had him evaluating his future. Lue said Rose is doing some light workouts, but ""nothing too fast right now as far as on the court. But his spirits are great, great having him back. Just the most important part, just getting him back healthy.""","400975217"
"PHILADELPHIA --  With DeMar DeRozan knocking down 3-pointers early, Toronto Raptors coach Dwane Casey thought he was back in Seattle. Down the stretch, Casey watched DeRozan do what's made him a three-time All-Star: get to the foul line. DeRozan combined the two to score a career-high 45 points and the Raptors overcame a 22-point deficit to beat the Joel Embiid-less Philadelphia 76ers 114-109 on Thursday night. DeRozan, a career 28 percent shooter from 3-point range, set a career high with six 3s in nine attempts in Toronto's fifth straight win. ""I thought he was a young Ray Allen,"" Casey said about DeRozan's 4-of-4 first-quarter shooting from 3, reminiscing of his days as an assistant coach with the Seattle SuperSonics in the early 2000s. ""That's what we need from him. It opens up the floor, especially on nights when we just didn't have it. We were playing in mud in the first half."" DeRozan became more conventional in the fourth quarter. His jumper with 4:13 left put the Raptors ahead to stay after they trailed 76-54 early in the third quarter. He hit two free throws with 53 seconds left after Philadelphia's Robert Covington missed a go-ahead 3-point attempt, and then two more with 6.4 seconds left put it away. DeRozan finished 13 of 15 from the line to best the 43 points he scored against Boston last season. The Sixers only took 14 free throws as a team. ""That's been my career the past few years, getting to the free throw line,"" DeRozan said. ""Being able to close out the game and me understanding to slow the game down. Get the momentum going our way and try to kill them at the free-throw line."" Kyle Lowry added 23 points to help the Raptors to their 11th win in 12 games. ""Sometimes you're going to have games where you let your All-Star, your superstar, take over,"" Lowry said of DeRozan. Ben Simmons scored 20 points but had seven of the Sixers' 23 turnovers in their fourth straight loss. Covington added 19 points and Dario Saric had 18 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. Philadelphia, which blew a 16-point lead Tuesday night in a loss to Sacramento, fell to 1-7 without Embiid. ""We need to come and play dirty, play tough,"" Saric said. It was another day of uncertainty and false hope for the Sixers regarding their oft-injured franchise center, who went from questionable to probable to out in eight hours. Embiid missed two games with back tightness after logging a career-high 49 minutes in a triple-overtime loss to Oklahoma City last Friday. But the big man participated in shootaround and coach Brett Brown said less than two hours before tipoff that Embiid was ""probable"" and would play barring a setback in warmups. Embiid didn't show any discomfort during pregame drills, but was ruled out about 30 minutes before tipoff. ""He felt OK in the morning and then half an hour before the game, we learned he didn't feel comfortable playing."" Brown said. ""So we decided to rest him again."" The Sixers were also without starting shooting guard JJ Redick (right hamstring), but used Covington's 5-of-7 shooting from 3-point range to race ahead by 22. Things quickly fell apart. Lowry and Delon Wright (12 points) got hot in a 22-2 run that included bad passes and poor shots by the Sixers. ""We're going to get healthy,"" Brown said. ""We're going to get better."" TIP-INS Raptors: F C.J. Miles (dental procedure) missed his second straight game. 76ers: Former Raptors C Amir Johnson started in Embiid's place. ... Redick is doubtful for Saturday's rematch in Toronto. FRAGILE EMBIID Embiid has played in 54 of a possible 277 games since being the No. 3 overall pick in the 2014 draft. That includes two lost years to foot injuries and last season being cut short by knee surgery. He's yet to be cleared to play on consecutive days because of his knee, and his back has been an on-and-off problem.","400975218"
"NEW YORK --  Michael Beasley started heating up in the third quarter, and he really poured it on the fourth. So when did he know he had the hot hand? ""Jan. 9, 1989,"" Beasley said. Yes, Beasley started believing he would make every shot he took on the day he was born. He made most of them in the second half Thursday night, when he scored 28 of his season-high 32 points to help the New York Knicks shake off a dismal return by Kristaps Porzingis and beat the Boston Celtics 102-93. Beasley went back to the bench with Porzingis back from a knee injury, but he was on the floor in the fourth quarter while Porzingis watched from the sideline as the former No. 2 overall pick punished the Celtics inside and out to help the Knicks pull away. Porzingis was 0 for 11 from the field and finished with one point after missing two games with a sore left knee. The ""MVP! MVP!"" chants he has heard this season instead went to Beasley, who also had 12 rebounds. ""I'm just out here doing what I got to do,"" Beasley said. ""It's nice to hear but I am pretty sure it's for KP."" He surpassed the 30 points he scored last Saturday against Carmelo Anthony and Oklahoma City with a jumper with 1:06 remaining that stopped a little run by Boston and gave New York an eight-point lead. The Knicks held on for their fifth victory in six games. The Celtics appeared to be taking control in the third quarter. Kyrie Irving made three 3-pointers and one by Jayson Tatum gave Boston a nine-point lead midway through the period. Beasley then made three consecutive Knicks baskets late in the period to keep it close and it was 68-all going to the fourth. It was still tied before Beasley outscored the Celtics 11-4 to give New York an 86-79 lead, and Boston never got closer than six again. Asked what changed for his team, coach Brad Stevens responded: ""Beasley made every shot."" ""This is something that I don't lose too much sleep over, to be honest,"" he added. ""You make it as tough as you possibly can and sometimes guys make baskets and that was the case tonight."" Not for Porzingis, who said his struggles had nothing to do with his knee. ""Not at all. Just wasn't in rhythm,"" he said. ""Early on the game just didn't come to me. I tried to make some passes and I think I did the right thing a lot of times, but I just missed a few of my shots and then was out of the game."" Irving scored 32 points for the Celtics, who played without starter Jaylen Brown because of left Achilles tendon soreness. Tatum added 17 points. The Knicks were blown out in Boston to cap their 0-3 start but have since turned things around behind a home-heavy schedule. They have 15 of their 17 victories at Madison Square Garden, where a sellout crowd of 19,812 grew louder with every Beasley basket against the Eastern Conference leaders. Boston dropped two in a row for the first time since its 0-2 start. ""It is what it is. It happens,"" Irving said. ""So for now, presently, where we are, just pick ourselves up and move on to I believe, Chicago (on) Saturday."" TIP-INS Celtics: Brown had appeared in 32 of Boston's 34 games, all starts. Stevens said Brown told the team recently he had been feeling soreness for a little bit and the decision to rest him was the team ""told been bothering him for a little bit couple days ago, just getting out ahead of it. ...

"PHOENIX --  Troy Daniels knew his shot was going in the moment it left his hands, and he knew exactly where he was on the court -- right in front of his former team's bench. Troy Daniels hit a 3-pointer with 17.6 seconds to play to give Phoenix the lead, and the Suns held off the Grizzlies 97-95 on Thursday night for their third victory in four games. ""We work each and every day for moments like this and I just happened to hit the shot,"" Daniels said. ""It feels great, I'll tell you that. I rather for it to be on them (the Grizzlies) then anyone else."" T.J. Warren led the Suns with 27 points, and Daniels -- acquired from the Grizzlies in September -- added 14 off the bench.

Neither team scored from the 3:45 mark of the fourth quarter until Daniels' key 3. Memphis had two chances to tie or take the lead, but Evans' 26-footer at the buzzer missed. I thought I could have got to the basket but I kind of stepped back and shot the 3,"" Evans said. ""It shouldn't have came down to that. We had the early lead in the game.""

Warren had 17 of his points at halftime, and the Suns led 60-51 at halftime. The Grizzlies erased a 12-point third quarter deficit and took a 76-75 lead on Evans' layup, then Kobi Simmons got a steal and layup for a three-point Grizzlies lead with 2:25 left in the third.

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Missing their leading scorer for the second consecutive game, the Utah Jazz needed Rodney Hood to score in bunches. He did exactly that, including 11 fourth-quarter points to help Utah end a three-game losing streak. Hood had 29 points and the Jazz fended off multiple comeback attempts by San Antonio to beat the Spurs 100-89 on Thursday night. Utah played without rookie guard and top scorer Donovan Mitchell, who missed his second consecutive game with a bruised right big toe. ""When Donovan is out, I have to be a lot more aggressive,"" Hood said. The Jazz led most of the way, but the Spurs fought back each time it appeared Utah was ready to put the game away. Hood took over in the fourth quarter after San Antonio cut the lead to 82-81. Utah went on a 13-2 run with Hood scoring nine straight points, including a contested pull-up 3-pointer from the corner and a spinning, mid-range jumper to push the lead to 12. ""You noticed he was pretty good, huh?"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I thought they did a really good job in pick-and-roll, attacking and getting the ball to really open shooters. The last two 3s he hit, they were contested pretty well and he made great shots. ""In general they did a great job executing and finding the open man out of pick-and-roll and they really sliced and diced us in that regard. That was nice to watch in a weird sort of way."" Ricky Rubio had 11 points and 11 rebounds, while Derrick Favors finished with 14 points and nine rebounds. Bryn Forbes led the Spurs with 12 points. The Jazz led 50-38 at halftime thanks to a 14-point half by Hood. Utah used a 17-3 run spanning the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second, highlighted by back-to-back 3s from Joe Johnson and Rubio, to take a 30-17 lead. The Spurs opened the third quarter with an 11-1 run as LaMarcus Aldridge warmed up and cut the lead to two. San Antonio answered each time the Jazz tried to pull away before Hood finally sealed it. ""We knew they were going to go on a run,"" Hood said. ""I saw daylight and just had to rise up and shoot the ball and make the right play when they started trapping me and blitzing me."" The loss broke a three-game winning streak for the Spurs. ""There really shouldn't be (any) excuses for mental mistakes,"" San Antonio guard Patty Mills said. ""We understand this is a long season and a long grind ... but the other team is going through it as well. ... We just had too many of those tonight.""

Coming home is nice, but the Jazz were still on the second night of a back-to-back and down two starters. ""I think there is a competitiveness to our group that is going to be there regardless,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said when asked about the team's energy level. ""Fatigue is something that everybody deals with. The challenge for us is not to lose any kind of emotional energy and to get despondent about schedule or lineups or injuries.

"DETROIT --  For a few moments Friday, Stan Van Gundy thought his Detroit Pistons were going to fall back into the same bad habits that plagued them early in December. After leading for most of the game, the Pistons found themselves trailing the New York Knicks by four with 1:48 to play. A loss would have dropped them to 3-9 in December and a game behind the Knicks in the Eastern Conference standings. Instead, Detroit finished with a 9-2 run to post a 104-101 victory and a fourth win in five games. ""Down four in the last two minutes is a bad situation, but I was very happy with the way we closed out the game,"" Van Gundy said. ""We made some big defensive plays and Reggie (Jackson) attacked on the offensive end."" Jackson's runner in the lane made it 101-101 with 44 seconds left, and Ron Baker turned the ball over at the other end. Jackson then split a pair of free throws to give the Pistons a one-point lead with 23.7 seconds to go. Stanley Johnson forced Courtney Lee into a bad shot, then hit two free throws to put Detroit up 104-101. ""I was going to attack the rim, but they cut me off, so I tried to step through and take the shot,"" Lee said. ""I thought there was contact, so I leaned in, but they didn't call the foul."" Kristaps Porzingis missed a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer. ""At the end of the game, we were going to switch everything to make sure we always had someone on Porzingis,"" Van Gundy said. ""He's 7-foot-3, so he can shoot over anyone, but our guys were making it as tough as possible."" Andre Drummond finished with 18 points and 15 rebounds, while Tobias Harris scored 24 points. The Pistons had seven players in double figures, including reserves Johnson and Ish Smith. ""The loss (Wednesday) in Dallas really hurt, because we didn't play with any energy in the second half, and we let them have a good run,"" Drummond said. ""Tonight, we tried to come out and put a lot of effort into the game."" New York had won five of six, including a victory Thursday night over the Boston Celtics. Porzingis finished with 29 points on 28 shots, and Enes Kanter added 22 points and 16 rebounds. ""We weren't able to get going downhill all night,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""We only got six free throws, so there wasn't a lot of penetration and we took a lot of outside shots."" The Pistons pulled down four offensive rebounds in the first two minutes on their way to a 12-2 lead. Drummond had six points and six rebounds early, but the Knicks got back into the game when he went to the bench with two fouls. Drummond was limited to seven minutes in the half, but the Pistons still led 52-44 at intermission. Harris and Anthony Tolliver each scored 10 points, while Porzingis had 10 points and six rebounds for the Knicks. Kanter's follow shot gave the Knicks a 69-68 lead with three minutes left in the third, and he followed with another on the next possession. New York finished with an 18-2 run to move the margin to 75-70, but the Pistons scored the quarter's final four points to get within one. ""We really have to work on our third-quarter defense, because this is three games in a row where it has gotten us into trouble,"" Van Gundy said. ""It's really the whole second half, but especially the third quarter."" Detroit kept that surge going in the fourth, starting the period with a 10-4 run to lead 84-79 with 10:03 to play. The Knicks tied the game with 3:45 left when Drummond was called for goaltending, and Porzingis followed with a mid-range jumper to put New York ahead 95-93. After the teams traded baskets, Harris missed and Jarrett Jack hit a short jumper to make it 99-95 with 1:48 to play. TIP INS Knicks: Guard Tim Hardaway Jr. missed the game with a leg injury, but was called for a first-quarter technical for arguing a call. His father was on the opposite bench as one of Van Gundy's assistant coaches. Pistons: Avery Bradley missed his fourth straight game with a groin injury and is expected to be out until at least New Year's Day.","400975222"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The New Orleans Pelicans were encouraged by holding an opponent under 100 points, even though it was the struggling Orlando Magic. DeMarcus Cousins had 26 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, and the Pelicans never trailed Friday night in a 111-97 win over Orlando. Anthony Davis added 20 points and 11 rebounds, and Jrue Holiday had 24 points for New Orleans, which had given up 108 points or more in 12 straight games, including eight losses. ""When we defend, it gives us a chance to get out and run,"" Davis said. ""When guys get looks in rhythm, they get easy looks at the rim. If we defend, nine times out of ten we're going to have a great game offensively."" The loss was the seventh straight for the Magic, who have not led at any point in their last three games. Jonathon Simmons led the Magic with 22 points. Nikola Vucevic added 21, and Elfrid Payton had 18 points and six assists. The Pelicans (16-16) shot 50 percent and had a 48-40 rebounding advantage. Playing without three of their top six scorers, the Magic shot 4-for-20 from 3-point range. ""We don't have a lot of good shooters in our lineup, so our shooters have to hit shots,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""They didn't tonight."" Davis made 9 of 11 shots and scored 18 points while leading New Orleans to a 60-50 lead at the end of a first half in which the Magic were called for four technical fouls. Holiday and E'Twaun Moore hit 3-pointers as the Pelicans opened the game with a 9-0 run, and they led by 18 early in the second quarter. Simmons' layup early in the second half reduced New Orleans' lead to seven, but Holiday and Cousins answered with 3-pointers and the Pelicans pulled away to a lead that reached 27 in the fourth quarter. ""Some of our best players are out, but we have to find a way to compete and stay close in games,"" Vucevic said. Marreese Speights, who came off the bench with six 3-pointers in Orlando's victory at New Orleans on Oct. 30, got his first start for the Magic (11-22). He scored seven points in 17 foul-plagued minutes. WORST DEFENSE IS A BAD OFFENSE The game was a matchup of two of the NBA's poorest defensive teams, although Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry believes the ranking is misleading. ""Our biggest defensive problem is our offense,"" he said. ""The toughest thing to defend in this league is the live turnover."" TIP-INS Pelicans: No starter played more than Cousins' 32 minutes, 45 seconds. ... G Rajon Rondo, who did not play in the Pelicans' earlier loss to the Magic, had eight assists in 23 minutes. Magic: The Magic used its 13th starting lineup of the season. ""We don't have our starting lineup available to us, so we have to look at different combinations,"" Vogel said. ... F Aaron Gordon, F Jonathan Isaac, G Evan Fournier and G Terrence Ross did not play and are doubtful for Saturday night.","400975223"
"NEW YORK --  One of the NBA's best backcourts sure didn't play that way. And with John Wall and Bradley Beal shut down, the Brooklyn Nets led the Washington Wizards by as many as 40 points in a 119-84 victory on Friday night. Wall scored 10 points and Beal had only four as the pair combined to miss 20 of its 26 shots. ""You're not going to expect that type of performance from them,"" Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie said. ""They are who they are for a reason. They're great players, All-Stars obviously. Just good preparation and we obviously got lucky a little bit, too."" Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Nets. Caris LeVert scored 17 points, while DeMarre Carroll, Dinwiddie and Nik Stauskas added 15 apiece to help Brooklyn snap its four-game losing streak. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 13 points for the Wizards. ""It was terrible,"" Beal said. ""We couldn't make shots, get around or defend anybody. It was bad. It was really bad. It's really one of those games you want to forget about and move on to the next one."" The Nets never trailed in the game, taking an early 10-point lead before settling for a 26-23 advantage after the first quarter. A layup by Hollis-Jefferson with 2:36 left in the second quarter gave the Nets an 11-point lead, and they went into halftime ahead 53-43. Hollis-Jefferson finished the first half with 15 points and eight rebounds. ""You want to come out, you want to compete. You want to be fierce. You want to be someone that the guys look to as far as energy and competitive spirit,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. ""I feel this is the start of something new."" Dinwiddie, who did not score in the first half, scored 11 straight to give the Nets a 64-47 lead with 9:24 left in the third quarter. That was followed by a three-point play by Carroll as Brooklyn went up by 20. Later in the quarter, Jarrett Allen put together a six-point streak to put the Nets up by 30 points and they went on to an 88-61 lead heading into the final quarter. Dinwiddie scored all of his points in that decisive third quarter. The lead continued to grow, this time with Stauskas taking the lead role. He made three consecutive 3-pointers, added a free throw and hit a driving layup with 3:32 remaining to give the Nets a 116-76 bulge. ""We got our butts kicked, myself included,"" said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. ""We just seemed a step slow all the way. We've got to show more resolve and we didn't do that tonight."" Allen finished with 10 points. Wall only played 16 minutes. He missed nine games (Nov. 25-Dec. 12) with a sore left knee and Washington went 4-5 during that span. ""I was going to play him just eight minutes in the first half and get him most of his minutes in the second, but we didn't keep the game close,"" Brooks said. Overall, Washington shot 36.6 percent, while Brooklyn connected on half its shots. TIP-INS: Wizards: Washington has dropped both games to the Nets this season. The Wizards defeated Brooklyn in all four meetings last season and in all three games during the 2015-16 campaign. Nets: Brooklyn hadn't won since beating the Wizards 103-98 on Dec. 12. The Nets hadn't beaten Washington in consecutive games since March 8 and April 15, 2013. ... The Nets are 7-0 this season when holding opponents under 100 points. WIZARDS WITH WALL Wall did not play in the first meeting between the teams. ""We're like a different team tonight,"" the Wizards' Markieff Morris said before the game. ""I hope they prepared for us."" SEE YOU NEXT YEAR Friday's game was the Nets' last home contest of 2017. They will play five road games before returning to Barclays Center on New Year's Day to host Orlando. STANDING ALONE LeVert is the only Net to play in each of the team's 31 games this season. In contrast, four Wizards (Beal, Oubre Jr., Marcin Gortat, Jodie Meeks) have played in all 32 of Washington's games.","400975224"
"MIAMI --  Wayne Ellington was able to stay with Miami this season largely because the Heat made a trade with Dallas over the summer and freed up the money needed to keep him around. The Mavericks probably regretted that Friday night. Ellington tied a career high with 28 points and set a career-best by connecting on eight 3-pointers, and the injury-ravaged Heat never trailed on the way to beating the Mavericks 113-101 -- shooting 64 percent, the second-best mark in franchise history. The Heat opened both halves on 12-0 runs. Getting outscored ""12-0 to start the game, 12-0 to start the second half. You combine it, it's ridiculous,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Their level of force was greater from start to finish. We made some good runs but when you're swimming against the current the whole game, it's difficult to get over the hump."" Ellington was 10 for 16 from the field, 8 for 12 from 3-point range. He has endeared himself to the Heat coaching staff since the moment he arrived in Miami. He takes more than 100 shots in his pregame routine, which usually ends about a half-hour before game time and always under the watchful eye of Heat assistant coach Octavio de la Grana. ""He behaves like a champion before he's a champion,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""I love it. ... It's beauty in motion."" Miami guard Dion Waiters left in the first quarter after turning his long-problematic left ankle on a drive, meaning the Heat now have seven players dealing with injuries. Hassan Whiteside, Goran Dragic, James Johnson and Justise Winslow all remained out with various injuries, Rodney McGruder and Okaro White are likely not returning anytime soon, and now Waiters is ailing again. Waiters missed the final 13 games of last season with a left ankle sprain, and it's nagged him at times ever since. That meant more minutes for Ellington, and he delivered. ""We were going to have to step up collectively,"" Ellington said. ""Everybody's play was going to have to elevate and I definitely took it upon myself as well to elevate my game."" Josh Richardson scored 24 points, Tyler Johnson scored 19 and Bam Adebayo scored 14 for Miami. The Heat went 16-for-25 from 3-point range. Yogi Ferrell scored a season-high 23 for the Mavericks. Dirk Nowitzki and Harrison Barnes each had 20 for Dallas, which got outrebounded 35-22. The 22 rebounds were the fewest by an NBA team this season. ""They just compete. That's their DNA down here,"" Nowitzki said of the Heat. Richardson made 11 of 14 shots for Miami, which has won four of its last five. TIP-INS Mavericks: Devin Harris played only eight minutes before leaving with an illness. ... Dallas was denied a two-game winning streak, which would have matched a season best. The Mavs are 2-7 in the game immediately following a win. Heat: X-rays on Waiters were negative. ... Adebayo, who was 1 when Nowitzki made his NBA debut, spent some time guarding the longtime Dallas star. Adebayo was plus-28 in 37 minutes. ... Kelly Olynyk scored 11 for Miami. ALL TIED UP Including two NBA Finals matchups, the Heat and Mavericks have now played 74 times -- with each team winning 37 of them. UD-DIRK MEMORIES Nowitzki and Heat forward Udonis Haslem have been going head-to-head for more than a decade -- since the 2006 NBA Finals, at least, and the respect the veterans have for one another is clear. They shared some pleasantries before tip-off Friday, and then found themselves guarding one another briefly during the game. MCROBERTS REPORT Josh McRoberts, who was the player Miami traded to Dallas in the move that essentially meant the Heat would keep Ellington, still hasn't played for Dallas because of foot problems. Saturday is the one-year anniversary of his last NBA appearance, though he did play 5-on-5 earlier this week against some Mavericks interns. ""He's been a great guy to have around our club,"" Carlisle said.","400975225"
"HOUSTON --  After Austin Rivers scored just six points in the first half on Friday night against the Houston Rockets, his Los Angeles Clippers teammates had a message for him. ""Austin, you've got to be more aggressive,"" Rivers recalled them saying. He certainly took their advice, scoring 30 of his career-high 36 points after halftime to allow the Clippers to withstand James Harden's second straight 51-point performance in a 128-118 victory. ""If we were going to win I had to start being in attack mode,"" Rivers said. ""And right from the get-go my whole attention was to just be aggressive and take the fight to them."" The Rockets, who had a 14-game winning streak snapped by the Lakers on Wednesday, lost consecutive games for just the second time this season and the first since Oct. 28 and 30. Rivers made a 3-pointer with just under three minutes to play that pushed the lead to 117-111. Ryan Anderson made two free throws for Houston before C.J. Williams added a layup for the Clippers. Former Rocket Lou Williams, who had 32 points off the bench, then made his fourth 3-pointer of the quarter to make it 122-113 before a turnover by Harden spurred coach Mike D'Antoni to call a timeout. Rivers made another 3-pointer after the timeout and Harden made a layup before fouling out a few seconds later. He received a technical for arguing about the call and was ejected from the game. ""They played well and they hit big shots,"" D'Antoni said. ""We did not do what we were supposed to do."" It was Harden's third 50-point game this season and he became the first player in franchise history to have two straight 50-point games. He's the first NBA player to score 50 or more in consecutive games since Kobe Bryant did so in four straight in March 2007. Harden wasn't interested in any of that since it didn't help the Rockets win. ""We lost,"" he said. ""None of it matters."" This game lacked much of the intrigue it could have had with Chris Paul sitting out in the first meeting against his former team because of a groin injury. The nine-time All-Star spent the last six seasons with the Clippers before a blockbuster trade brought him to the Rockets this summer. Patrick Beverley, who was the highest-profile Rocket involved in the trade, also missed the game while recovering from knee surgery. The Rockets were without two starters, with center Clint Capela missing a second straight game because of a bruised left heel. The Clippers have been dealing with injuries all season after losing Beverley for the season in November and playing without All-Star Blake Griffin for the last 12 games because of a knee injury. Williams made three 3-pointers in just over a minute to power a 9-2 run and the Clippers, who trailed by as many as 15 points in the first half, were up by nine after a dunk by Sam Dekker with about seven minutes remaining. Harden led Houston with five points during a 10-3 run to cut the lead to 108-106 with about 4 1/2 minutes left. Houston led by 12 early in the third quarter before the Clippers used a 10-2 run, with the last five points from Rivers, to cut the lead to 71-67 with 8 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. Eric Gordon made a 3-pointer after that before Los Angeles made the next seven points. Rivers led the team in that span, too, scoring the last five points to tie it at 74 with about five minutes left in the third. The Clippers used a 10-2 spurt, capped by consecutive 3s from Williams to take their first lead of the game, 84-82. They were up 87-85 entering the fourth quarter. Houston led 65-52 at halftime after Harden made a 3-pointer at the buzzer. TIP-INS Clippers: DeAndre Jordan had 15 points, 20 rebounds and two blocks. ... The Clippers made a season-high 18 of 42 3-pointers. Rockets: Gordon added 28 points and made six 3-pointers. ... Paul is listed as day to day and the team doesn't think the injury is serious. This injury comes after he missed 14 games early this season with a knee injury. ... Nene started in place of Capela and had three points and two rebounds. WELCOME BACK The Rockets honored Beverley with a tribute video during a timeout in the first quarter. The video featured many of his highlights from his five years in Houston and Beverley beamed as he watched it from the Clippers bench. When it was done the home crowd greeted him with a standing ovation and he stood and waved to the fans. ROOKIE LOVE Coach Doc Rivers and Austin both raved about the defense of rookie Jawun Evans on Harden despite his big night. ""Jawun was probably my favorite player tonight ... the stuff he did down the stretch, irritating him, playing defense was special,"" Austin said. ""So for Jawun to be a rookie, 5-foot-10, 5-11 ... 160 pounds guarding probably the MVP this year. Come on, man. That was incredible."" The coach agreed and said: ""I thought his defensive pressure gave us time to get back out on all their other shooters.""","400975226"
"MILWAUKEE --  With Dwight Howard going out early, Kemba Walker did his best to give the Charlotte Hornets a chance to grab a road victory against the Milwaukee Bucks. But when Walker went down with an apparent injury late in the fourth quarter, the Bucks capitalized, closing on a 9-0 run for a 109-104 victory Friday night. ""This was a tough game,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""There were a lot of emotions in the last game we played. Charlotte is playing extremely well and hard, especially with their coach out. ... They were right there and we found a way down the stretch to make plays on both ends."" After Walker gave Charlotte a 104-100 lead with 2:24 remaining, Milwaukee held the Hornets scoreless the rest of the way. The Bucks tied it on dunks by Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton and took the lead on Eric Bledsoe's layup. Middleton scored 28 points, Antetokounmpo had 26, and Bledsoe had 24 points and 10 assists in the first game of the home-and-home set. Walker had 32 points before leaving with an apparent injury after losing the ball and falling to the floor with the game tied at 104 with 1:42 to play. He also went to the ground in pain in front of the Hornets bench just 39 seconds into the fourth quarter and did not return until there was 5:37 left. ""That's tough for them,"" Middleton said. ""He's their leader, he's their fourth-quarter player and late-game player, makes big shots and big plays for them, so we got a little luck with him going out. We did a great job of taking advantage. The Hornets did not provide an update as to why Walker left the game. Howard played just five minutes after dislocating his left ring finger in the first quarter. Hornets interim coach Stephen Silas was unsure as to if either of his top two scorers would play when the two teams meet in Charlotte on Saturday. ""Those are our two main guys,"" Silas said. ""If we could get healthy, and try to figure out the (Bucks) small lineup, I don't think we did a good job of that today."" Former University of Wisconsin star Frank Kaminsky added 16 points for Charlotte, and Marvin Williams had 15 points and 10 rebounds. The Hornets opened a 75-64 lead with 5:50 left in the third quarter. Milwaukee then went on a 12-0 run to take a 76-75 advantage on Middleton's dunk with 3:16 left in the third. Milwaukee took the lead twice in the final minute of the third quarter, but Walker answered with 3-pointers each time to give the Hornets an 85-83 lead heading to the fourth. TIP-INS Hornets: Kaminsky received a loud ovation when he checked into the game for the first time. ... Guard Treveon Graham missed a third consecutive game due to back spasms. Bucks: Guard Tony Snell returned to the starting lineup after coming off the bench in his first game back from left patellar tendinitis. ...  Signed to a two-way contract Monday, Sean Kilpatrick made his Bucks debut, scoring five points in 10 minutes. HOWARD EXITS Howard suffered the injury less than two minutes into the game and temporarily stayed in after having the finger taped during a timeout. He exited with 7:24 left in the first quarter and did not return. ""I have no idea what happened,"" Howard said. ""I went to take the ball out, I looked down and my finger was bent all the way to the side. They put it back in place, I went back in to play, but it just kept popping out."" HALL OF FAME Kidd was named a nominee for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2018 on Thursday. Finalists will be announced during NBA All-Star Weekend in February, with the Class of 2018 unveiled at the NCAA Final Four in April.","400975227"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder like their chances with the ball in Russell Westbrook's hands at the end of a game. Westbrook hit a 3-pointer with 1.7 seconds left to cap a 30-point, 15-assist outing, and the Thunder held off the resilient Hawks 120-117 on Friday night. Carmelo Anthony added 24 points on 7-of-12 3-point shooting and Paul George scored 17 for the Thunder, who have won five of their last six after a 12-14 start. ""I think we know now how to close and where we're going to to close,"" George said. ""Russ is our leader. ... We knew that we could kind of mess them up with the play that we had, cause some confusion. They backed off and Russ had an easy, open opportunity. Russ is as good as anybody when it's closing time."" Atlanta, in last place in the Southeast Division, made Oklahoma City work for this one, rallying after falling behind by 16 points in the first half, and again by seven in the final minutes. Marco Belinelli scored 30 points to lead Atlanta. Ersan Ilyasova added 22 points for the Hawks, who went 15 of 32 from 3-point range. ""There are a lot of things you can learn from a game like tonight,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It's tough to not have the shot or the bounce at the end of the game, but to compete and play the way we did, really both halves, but particularly the second half ... hopefully our team can take something from tonight about how we played."" The Hawks led 92-88 with 8:49 left after a basket by Kent Bazemore. Westbrook re-entered the game and led the Thunder on a 16-5 run. Anthony's 3-pointer with 5:34 left gave Oklahoma City a 104-97 lead. The Hawks came back again, eventually tying the game at 117 on two free throws by Ilyasova with 11.1 seconds left. After a timeout, George inbounded to Westbrook, who made the final shot over Atlanta's Taurean Prince. Without a timeout, the Hawks could manage only a desperation heave at the buzzer. ""We put ourselves in position to (win) the basketball game with the last shot and it went down,"" a hoarse Westbrook said. The Thunder dominated the second quarter. They broke a 28-28 tie with a 14-2 run to start the quarter, with Raymond Felton and George each hitting two 3-pointers. After the Hawks pulled within 51-43, Oklahoma City went on a 13-5 run and led 64-50 at halftime. Atlanta scored 11 straight points to cut the Thunder lead to 74-70 midway through the third quarter. Oklahoma City made only 19 of 31 free throws. TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta played without G Dennis Schroder, who sat out with a left ankle injury and was replaced in the starting lineup by Belinelli. Schroder had started and played 32 minutes Wednesday vs. Indiana. ... Prince went 1 of 3 from 3-point range and now has at least one 3-pointer in career-best 14 straight games. ... Belinelli extended his streak of consecutive free throws to 28 ... Atlanta is 2-7 vs. Western Conference teams this season. Thunder: Westbrook was called for an unsportsmanlike technical foul with 3:24 left in the second quarter for shoving Malcolm Delaney after Delaney had fouled him. ... Steven Adams had 16 points and 10 rebounds. ... The Thunder now trail only 66-65 in their all-time series with the Hawks, including the franchise's time in Seattle. ... George and Westbrook entered the game ranked first and second, respectively, in the NBA in steals at 2.45 and 2.10. George had three steals against the Hawks, and Westbrook had two. DEFENDING WESTBROOK The Hawks' defensive options on the final play were somewhat limited by Westbrook's skill set, Budenholzer said. Try to guard him closely and he might race by the defender. Give him space, and he could knock down a 3-pointer. ""With his speed and explosion, it's tough to get into him from that far away from the basket,"" Budenholzer said. ""When he's attacking and getting downhill, that's not easy. So when he pulls up from three or four feet behind the 3-point line, no doubt he's capable of doing it. He's done it a lot of times and he did it tonight, so you tip your cap to him and you've just got to take it.""","400975228"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- <U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD> Denver has gone through four coaches and has only three players remaining from the last time it won in Portland. The wait for another victory is over. Nikola Jokic scored 27 points and the Nuggets beat the Trail Blazers 102-85 on Friday night, their first victory in Portland since 2013. Jokic hit 12 of 21 shots and grabbed eight rebounds as the Nuggets ended a nine-game losing streak to the Blazers in Portland. Wilson Chandler scored a season-high 21 points, and grabbed 11 rebounds. Denver coach Michael Malone said he asked the team during the morning shootaround what happened on Feb. 27, 2013, the last time Denver beat the Blazers in Portland. ""Everybody looked around like I had no idea,"" Malone said. The Nuggets did it with an inside-first philosophy, pounding the Blazers with Jokic and Chandler. Denver didn't score its first basket outside the paint until midway through the second quarter. ""We wanted to get to the paint just because that will open the 3s, that will open the easy passes. That is our game plan every game, but tonight we kind of did it all as a team,"" Jokic said. Portland played without Damian Lillard, who strained his hamstring strain in Wednesday's game against San Antonio. Lillard is the Blazers' leading scorer at 25.2 points a game. The Blazers, who lost their sixth consecutive home game, heard scattered boos from crowd during the fourth quarter. ""We didn't play a very good game. They won every quarter. We didn't do very many things well enough to come close to winning the game,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. C.J. McCollum led Portland with 15 points, while Shabazz Napier had 14. Rookie Zach Collins scored a career-high 10 points, but fouled out after playing 18 minutes. Gary Harris scored 17 points for Denver, but more important to Malone, he kept McCollum under wraps. On a night when the Lillard-less Blazers desperately needed McCollum, he shot just 3 of 11 during the first half. ""Any time C.J. was in the game, we had Gary match up with him. I thought Gary embraced the opportunity to guard him. He was relentless in his pursuit,"" Malone said. The Nuggets led 52-41 at halftime as Jokic scored 18 first-half points. They separated themselves from Portland late in the second quarter with a 10-0 run. Denver continued to punish Portland inside during the third quarter, as Chandler scored eight points and Jokic seven in taking an 80-66 lead. The Nuggets led by as many as 19 points during the third quarter. Jokic drew his fourth foul early in the third quarter, but Malone said he was ""not close"" to pulling him from the game. ""I knew if I pulled him at that point, I felt things would go south very quickly,"" Malone said. Portland was unable to get closer than 10 in the fourth. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver scored its first 16 baskets in the paint. ... Harris returned to the starting lineup after missing one game (elbow contusion). ... Denver avoided its first three-game losing streak of the season. It was also just the Nuggets' third win over Portland in the past five seasons. Trail Blazers: Lillard is unlikely to play in Saturday's game at the Los Angeles Lakers, though Stotts said he would make the trip. ... Jake Layman, who has played the fewest games (13) and minutes (83) on the roster, made his first start of the season, and second of his two-year career. ...

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Steve Kerr had been waiting to see rookie Jordan Bell play significant minutes alongside Kevin Durant and Draymond Green. With Green back to full strength, Bell got to shine -- and the Golden State Warriors needed every little thing he provided on both ends. Now Kerr just wants to add a healthy Stephen Curry back to the mix and give that lineup a nice long look. Durant had 33 points, seven rebounds, seven assists and four blocks, and the Warriors held off the Los Angeles Lakers 113-106 on Friday night for their 11th straight victory. Bell recorded his first career double-double with season bests of 20 points and 10 rebounds, making a key layup with 2:45 to go and dunking a minute later. ""They're the main guys on this team so the fact he wants to see me play with them more is a good sign for me in the future,"" Bell said of Kerr, who loves the rookie's instincts and wants him to keep learning at this level. Klay Thompson scored 16 points and Green added 13 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists as he came back from a shoulder injury for the defending champs. Kyle Kuzma scored 27 points and fellow rookie Lonzo Ball had 24 points with five 3-pointers in his first visit to Oracle Arena. Julius Randle added 21 points off the bench for Los Angeles, which snapped the Rockets' 14-game winning streak Wednesday night in Houston. Durant shot 9 for 20 in the Warriors' 10th win in a row at home against the Lakers and sixth overall after Golden State outlasted the Lakers in overtime Monday night in Los Angeles. Kerr and Lakers coach and former top Golden State assistant Luke Walton had a nice chat near the Warriors bench after the final buzzer. Still without two-time MVP Curry, Golden State got some much-needed reinforcements. Green returned after missing five of six games with soreness in his right shoulder, while Andre Iguodala also was back after sitting out Wednesday night's win against Memphis with flu-like symptoms. ""That was huge. I don't think we win that game without Andre and Draymond,"" Kerr said. ""It's great to have Draymond back after his absence. He brings an energy to the game that otherwise was lacking last game."" The Lakers, who trailed by as many as 23 in the third quarter before getting within 84-72 going into the final 12 minutes, briefly took their first lead of the night at 89-88 on Randle's 3-pointer with 7:43 remaining. Los Angeles cut the lead to 86-81 on a steal by Josh Hart and Kuzma's layup with 9:39 left, then 88-86 when Kentavious Caldwell-Pope hit a 3-pointer at the 8:09 mark. ""The way they compete night in and night out playing against some really good teams lately is really impressive,"" Walton said. TIP-INS Lakers: C Brook Lopez missed his second straight game with a sprained right ankle. ... Los Angeles shot 11 for 29 from long range after making 15 3-pointers against the Rockets two days earlier. The Lakers shot 33.3 percent in getting outscored 34-20 in the second quarter to fall behind 61-44 at halftime. Warriors: Durant went 12 for 13 at the line -- making his first seven -- to go over the 1,000 mark for career free throws. ... Shaun Livingston (sore right knee) and Zaza Pachulia (left shoulder soreness) were still out for Golden State. Pachulia missed his sixth straight game and seventh in eight, while Livingston sat out his third in a row. ... Golden State went 13 for 24 (54.2 percent) in the second. UNDER CAREFUL WATCH Caldwell-Pope started and had 10 points, five rebounds and four assists but was 4 for 16 and missed nine of his 10 3s. He is serving a 25-day sentence at an Orange County detention center after violating his probation on a drunken driving arrest, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday. ""Obviously it affected him tonight,"" Walton said. Caldwell-Pope is allowed to leave the Seal Beach Police Department Detention Center for practice and Lakers games in California under a work-release program, but must wear a GPS monitor outside the facility. He said he has been getting extra work with the ball boys and interns. ""It's not hard. I can still get in and do my work, practice, get shots up. I just have to continue to stay in the gym,"" he said. ""It's tough but I'm back with them now and I feel good."" Caldwell-Pope had missed two road games, and wasn't to travel for games in Houston on Dec. 31 and Minnesota on Jan. 1. NO CURRY FOR CHRISTMAS While Curry could test his sprained right ankle with some on-court work Sunday, Kerr said it would be ""irresponsible"" to play him Christmas Day against the Cavaliers in the NBA Finals rematch. ""As much as everybody wants to see him, as much as I want to see him on the floor, we have to be smart with this -- 99.999 percent that he's out,"" Kerr said.","400975230"
"TORONTO --  Joel Embiid's return wasn't enough to get the Philadelphia 76ers out of their recent rut. DeMar DeRozan scored 29 points, Serge Ibaka had 17 and the Toronto Raptors beat Philadelphia 102-86 on Saturday for their 10th straight home victory. Embiid, Philadelphia's leading scorer and rebounder, returned after missing the previous three games because of a sore lower back. ""It wasn't feeling the best but I really wanted to play tonight,"" Embiid said. Embiid had 14 points and eight rebounds in 23 minutes, but the 76ers lost for the 18th time in 19 meetings with the Raptors. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said he could tell Embiid, who got a technical foul late in the third, was frustrated at not being able to perform better. ""He wants to do so much more and he can't,"" Brown said. ""He just hasn't practiced or, recently, played. There was a rhythm and a fluid side of his game that he was searching for."" Dario Saric scored 17 points, Amir Johnson had 12 and Ben Simmons scored 10 for Philadelphia, which has lost five straight and nine of 10. Brown insisted his players haven't been affected by the slump. ""They understand the sky isn't falling,"" Brown said. Simmons echoed his coach's assessment of the rotten run, which includes a triple-overtime loss against Oklahoma City. ""A rough few games,"" Simmons said. ""We just need to get back on track. Once we get that game under out belts, we'll be fine. There's no reason to panic."" Delon Wright matched his season high with 14 points while Kyle Lowry and Jonas Valanciunas each had 12 for the Raptors, who have won six straight overall and 12 of 13. Toronto is an NBA-best 12-1 at home, and its 10-1 December record is tied for best in the league with Golden State. ""I can see an air of confidence, especially here, and we've got to continue that,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. Embiid took Philadelphia's first six shots of the game. He scored eight points in the opening quarter, but Ibaka had 13 for the Raptors. The teams were tied at 27 after the first. Ther 76ers made five of 15 field-goal attempts in the second and committed 10 turnovers that led to 15 Toronto points. Lowry and Valanciunas each scored eight points in the second, and the Raptors led 55-46 at halftime. DeRozan scored 16 points in the third, and Toronto closed the quarter on a 13-3 run, taking an 81-63 lead into the fourth. ""You blink and they go whack, whack,"" Brown said. TIP-INS 76ers: G J.J. Redick (right hamstring) missed his second straight game. ... The 76ers finished with 22 turnovers, leading to 28 points for Toronto. Philadelphia's season high for turnovers is 24, set in an overtime win against Minnesota on Dec. 12. Raptors: C.J. Miles missed his third straight game after undergoing a dental procedure. ... Toronto is 8-2 when DeRozan makes multiple 3-pointers. WELCOME TO TORONTO Embiid played in Toronto for the first time in his NBA career. The oft-injured big man had missed his first seven career games north of the border, including one this season. MAGIC TOUCH Amir Johnson stopped to briefly rub Embiid's back as the 76ers big man was getting a massage on the baseline during pregame shooting. WITH OR WITHOUT YOU The 76ers are 13-11 when Embiid plays and 1-7 when he sits.","400975231"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  The Charlotte Hornets have been waiting for big-time production from their bench all season. They finally got it Saturday night. Dwight Howard had 21 points and 16 rebounds, and Charlotte's bench outscored Milwaukee's 50-28 as the Hornets battled back from an 18-point deficit to beat the Bucks 111-106. Treveon Graham had a career-high 14 points and Frank Kaminsky also had 14 as Charlotte's bench shot 16 of 27 from the field. Graham said the second team came with a defensive mentality, allowing the Hornets to chip away at the lead. ""We gotta want to,"" Graham said. ""When we get in the game, we can't let the intensity drop off. Even though we may not score as well as the starters, we can't let the defensive intensity drop."" Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas, who's filling in while coach Steve Clifford deals with a health issue, felt he had to play his bench more given the team's recent schedule. ""This has been a brutal stretch -- 12 games in 20 days or something crazy like that,"" Silas said. ""As much as I'd like to kind of stick to my word as far as shortening the rotation, you do what's needed to win the game. I was proud of the guys. In a situation like that, guys earn minutes and some of them did that tonight."" Kemba Walker had a rough night shooting (4 of 11), but still scored 19 points -- including four late free throws to help seal the game. Khris Middleton had 31 points, while John Henson and Eric Bledsoe each had 16 for the Bucks, who had beaten the Hornets the night before in Milwaukee. All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo did not play because of right knee soreness. The Bucks led by one at halftime and appeared ready to break the game open after starting the second half on a 19-2 run. But Charlotte, which missed its first six shots from the field in the third quarter, stormed back to take the lead with 3:46 left in the game after Howard backed down Henson in the lane and scored on a 3-point play and Marvin Williams converted two free throws. Middleton knocked down a 3-pointer from the corner with 6.4 seconds remaining, cutting the Charlotte's lead to 1. Walker, who had missed three of his previous five free throws, calmly stepped to the line and made two more free throws. Milwaukee didn't take a timeout after Walker's made free throw and pushed the ball up the side of the court, where Bledsoe missed 3-pointer from the left wing that would have tied the game. Walker was fouled and added two more free throws to put the game away. ANTETOKOUNMPO UPDATE Antetokounmpo had 26 points and seven rebounds while playing 36  1/2 minutes in Milwaukee's 109-104 victory over Charlotte on Friday night, but he developed soreness in the right knee and coaches decided to hold him out. ""We just have to be cautious in this situation,"" Antetokounmpo said afterward. ""We don't want to go deep into the season and this issue comes up again."" Antetokounmpo, who is second in the league in scoring at 29.6 points per game, said he hopes to be ready to play Tuesday night against Chicago. KIDD-GILCHRIST'S DEFENSIVE STOP Michael Kidd-Gilchrist has been Charlotte's best defender in recent years, and he showed why in the closing seconds Saturday night. The Bucks had a chance to tie it with 10 seconds left, but Middleton couldn't get to the rim while heavily guarded by Kidd-Gilchrist and settled for a fade-away 18-footer, which rimmed out. Michael Carter-Williams grabbed the rebound and was immediately fouled. He converted both free throws to make it a two-possession game with 8.4 seconds left. ""That was a big, big stop,"" Silas said. TOO MUCH FOULING Bucks coach Jason Kidd wasn't happy the Bucks sent the Hornets to the line 40 times. Charlotte made 30. ""It's hard to beat a team when you foul that much,"" Kidd said. TIP-INS Bucks: Were outrebounded 43-35. ... Shot 8 of 26 from 3-point range. Hornets: Howard now has 18 double-doubles this season and is the NBA's active career leader with 684.","400975232"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo dug the Indiana Pacers out of a hole again. He scored 38 points and was perfect from the free-throw line, helping the Indiana Pacers escape with a 123-119 overtime victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night. ""For whatever reason, it was tough for us in the first half,"" Oladipo said. ""In the second half, things started going our way. We picked it up and played at a high level on both ends."" Myles Turner had 23 points and nine rebounds and tied his career high with six blocks, and Bojan Bogdanovic finished with 17 points and six rebounds for the Pacers (19-14), who came back from down 19 to take an 85-84 lead on Lance Stephenson's free throw with 8:29 remaining in regulation. Spencer Dinwiddle led the Nets (12-20) and tied his career high with 26 points. He made three free throws with 19 seconds left in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 111 and force overtime. DeMarre Carroll finished with 20 points and 13 rebounds and made a 3-pointer to tie it at 119 with 45 seconds left in overtime. Oladipo made four free throws in two trips to the line in the final 29 seconds to seal the win. ""Oladipo, gotta give the guy credit,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""He is playing elite, elite basketball. He's one of the best players in the league right now. (And) they were just the more aggressive team to start the third quarter."" An 11-2 run in the second quarter put the Nets ahead by 19 -- their largest lead of the game -- and Brooklyn led 57-41 by halftime. Indiana went on an 11-0 run to open the second half. Later, Darren Collison made a 3-pointer to cap off a 10-0 run and put the Pacers ahead for the first time since early in the first quarter. Indiana's slow starts and struggles at home have become a trend. The win snapped a three-game losing streak at home, where the Pacers are 11-7 this season. ""We've got to figure it out,"" Oladipo said. ""We've just got to do a better job at home. We're less comfortable at home than we are on the road, honestly. This team's not perfect and we've got a lot of room to grow. But we're figuring it out. It's a long season."" The Pacers are having little trouble with Brooklyn, though. Indiana has won six straight against the Nets, including three this season. The two teams meet for the final game of the four-game regular-season series on Feb. 14 in Brooklyn. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn made 16 3-pointers. ... The Nets won the rebounding battle, 51-41. ... Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 18 points and eight rebounds. Pacers: Indiana shot 52.2 percent from the field. ... Oladipo had six assists. ... Collison finished with 14 points and nine assists, and Stephenson scored 11 points off the bench.

Zeller started the game and created a spark, scoring all six of his points to help the Nets take a 13-7 lead early in the first quarter.","400975233"
"WASHINGTON --  One night after a humiliating defeat, the Washington Wizards set a season high for points and rolled to an easy win. Mike Scott scored 18 points, Otto Porter Jr. and Bradley Beal each had 17, and the Wizards beat Orlando 130-103 on Saturday to hand the injury-ravaged Magic their eighth straight loss. Seven players scored in double figures as Washington rebounded from a 35-point rout at Brooklyn on Friday. Markieff Morris and Kelly Oubre had 16 points apiece. John Wall added 10 points and 13 assists. Wizards coach Scott Brooks had no simple explanation for the two games. ""Welcome to the world of coaching,"" he said. ""(Friday) night's game was a horrible game. There was nothing positive about it."" Orlando, which has lost 19 of 22, was led by Elfrid Payton's career-high 30 points. Magic center Nikola Vucevic broke his left index finger with about seven minutes remaining in the first quarter and will be out indefinitely. Vucevic joins three of Orlando's opening-night starters on the sideline with injuries. Evan Fournier, Aaron Gordon and Terrence Ross are also hurt. Vucevic said he got tangled up with Washington center Ian Mahinmi. ""I tried to get out,"" Vucevic said. ""As I went away I think he might (have) pulled my finger, I'm not sure. I heard it pop when it happened."" Washington took the lead late in the first quarter and was up 37-29 after one. The Wizards led 72-48 at halftime. TIP-INS Magic: Fournier (ankle) sat out his eighth straight game. Gordon (calf) missed his fourth in a row, and F Jonathan Isaac (ankle) was out for a second consecutive game. Orlando coach Frank Vogel wouldn't guess how long they'll be out. ""We've got two days until the next game,"" Vogel said. ""There's a chance they're all back. There's a chance none of them are back."" ... Ross hasn't played since injuring a knee Nov. 29. ... The Magic briefly led in the first quarter. They hadn't led in their previous 15 quarters. Wizards: Brooks said Wall, who missed nine games with a left knee injury and played just 16 minutes Friday night, won't be on a minutes restriction soon. By the time Washington plays its next set of back-to-back games (Jan. 5-6), Brooks won't have to worry about Wall's minutes, he said. ... Wall and Morris were assessed technical fouls in the first five minutes. MISSING VUCEVIC Without Vucevic, the team's third-leading scorer and top rebounder, Vogel said Bismack Biyombo would get the bulk of the playing time. ""You feel bad for him,"" Vogel said. ""I don't feel bad for our team and for what we're trying to get accomplished. We can't hang our heads and look at all the guys we have out."" Vucevic reacted with relatively little emotion. ""I've never been a part of a team with this many injuries,"" he said. ""We can't catch a break from injuries at all."" BALANCED SCORING Washington's starters and reserves each contributed 65 points. ""We have so many guys who can shoot the ball,"" Beal said. ""When we're moving it and get body movement and player movement and ball movement, that's great for us rather than just iso ball."" GREAT SCOTT Scott, who was 9 for 10 from the field on Dec. 15 against the Los Angeles Clippers and 11 for 15 against New Orleans on Tuesday, hit seven of his eight field goal attempts. Scott, who is in his sixth season, says it's the best he's played in his career. ""Healthy, confidence, work on my game a lot,"" he said. ""With a lot of repetition comes confidence.""","400975234"
"ATLANTA --  Dennis Schroder scored every which way Saturday night. The point guard equaled his career high with 33 points, including 27 in the second half, to help the Atlanta Hawks beat the Dallas Mavericks 112-107 in a matchup of last-place teams. After missing Friday night's loss at Oklahoma City with a sprained ankle, Schroder hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 1:21 left to put Atlanta ahead 110-107. Schroder shot 10 of 14 in the second half, 4 for 5 on 3-pointers, and Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer was convinced the young German motivated himself by scoring his team's first seven points in the third quarter to tie it at 55. It was a particularly rewarding night for Schroder, who drove to the basket repeatedly as Atlanta topped the Mavericks and fellow German Dirk Nowitzki for the ninth straight time. ""Yeah, that (early) layup might be the reason that I started going, and I was just aggressive and attacked Nowitzki and their big guards,"" Schroder said. ""Nowitzki is kind of slow now, getting older, and that works for me to be aggressive. If help comes, just look (to pass) in the corners."" Ersan Ilyasova added 19 points and seven rebounds for the Hawks (8-25), who got 13 points off the bench from rookie John Collins and won for just the second time in eight games. Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks (9-25) with 22 points. Nowitzki scored 18, and J.J. Barea had 15 points and 12 assists off the bench as Dallas lost for the eighth time in 10 games. Atlanta, which opened the season with a 117-111 victory in Dallas, has swept the season series from the Mavericks in each of the last four years. ""We didn't have an answer for Schroder,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He beat us on drives. He beat us on pick-and-rolls. He beat us on traps. He had a great game, particularly in the second half."" The Mavericks led 53-48 at halftime before Schroder warmed up in the third quarter with 12 points to help Atlanta take a 10-point lead. He scored 15 more in the fourth, making three 3-pointers. Dallas shot 50.6 percent and rang up 31 assists, but it wasn't enough to overcome Schroder, who tied his career highs for field goals (13 of 22) and 3-pointers (4 of 8). Atlanta is 4-1 when he scores 30 or more points. ""We shot the ball pretty well. We were moving the ball pretty well,"" Nowitzki said. ""Schroder was fantastic tonight. ... Schroder came out in the third quarter and really put it on us. It was incredible. He made that run almost by himself."" Dallas countered several times and last tied the game on a 3-pointer by Barea with 2:28 remaining. The Mavericks scored just two points the rest of the way. The Hawks don't play again until Wednesday, when they will try to win back-to-back games for the first time this season. TIP-INS Mavericks: Wesley Matthews, who leads the team in 3-pointers with 79, didn't hit one until there was 7:28 left in the third quarter. Dallas was just 9 for 33 from beyond the arc after making 17 of 35 in Friday's 113-101 loss at Miami. Matthews went 1 for 7. ... Dallas is 1-5 in the second game of back-to-backs. Hawks: Collins went 6 for 9 and has shot at least 50 percent from the field in 14 consecutive games, stretching his franchise rookie record beyond Stacey Augmon's 11 straight games in 1991-92. The first-round draft pick from Wake Forest scored 10 points in the first half. ... One night after scoring a season-high 27 points in his first start of the season, Marco Belinelli was scoreless in the first half off the bench and finished with two points. ... Malcolm Delaney also set a season high Friday with 20 points. He had seven on Saturday. ... Atlanta is 1-7 in the second game of back-to-backs. THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES The Mavericks look like a team with enough talent to be better than 9-25, and they seem to know it. Their defense is a problem, however, and that explained much of Saturday's result. The Hawks shot 56.8 percent and went 10 of 24 from 3-point range. ""This season has been difficult,"" Barnes said. ""Coaches, players, media -- everyone tries to figure out a reason for that. ... Playing these nights where we have 30 assists, or offensively we get it going, or Dirk has a good game going ... it's difficult not to capitalize on that.""","400975235"
"BOSTON --  Kyrie Irving makes spinning baskets off the dribble and converts drives in the lane while leaning in all sorts of different directions. It's the simple jump shot that earns praise from Boston coach Brad Stevens. Irving scored 25 points, Jaylen Brown had 20 and the Celtics coasted to a 117-92 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night. Well known for his acrobatic moves, Irving shot 9 for 15 from the floor against Chicago -- including 5 of 7 from beyond the 3-point line. ""I think that's the one thing that gets lost in all the handles and all the different moves, and the plays that end up on YouTube, is how skilled he is shooting the ball,"" Stevens said. ""He's just a tremendous shooter. He doesn't miss when you're just shooting without defense. He's an elite shooter."" Thanks to Irving's sweet shooting, the Celtics (27-9) halted a two-game skid. They haven't lost three straight all season. ""He's one of the best -- a true point guard that comes out, makes the right plays, the right decisions,"" Brown said. ""He's assertive. He makes it easier for us."" Jayson Tatum added 13 points, and Al Horford and Aron Baynes each had 10 for the Eastern Conference leaders as all five Celtics starters were in double figures. Reserve guard Marcus Smart scored 11 points and rookie Daniel Theis grabbed a season-high 15 rebounds to go with 10 points. Bobby Portis paced the Bulls (10-22) with 17 points. Robin Lopez and Lauri Markkanen both scored 10. Chicago lost its second straight after a seven-game winning streak. The Celtics avenged a lopsided defeat in Chicago on Dec. 11, when they lost by 23. Irving didn't play in that game because he was rested. ""We knew they were going to come out and try and be aggressive because of that,"" said Bulls guard Kris Dunn, who went 1 of 12 from the floor. Boston shot 5 of 7 from beyond the arc in the third quarter and outscored the Bulls 38-18. ""They just had more edge than us, specifically that stretch in the third quarter,"" Lopez said. ""They seemed pretty comfortable out there, especially on offense."" Brown nailed a pair of 3-pointers and scored seven points as the Celtics opened the third with a 13-2 run, pulling out to a 73-60 lead. After the teams alternated baskets for a couple of minutes, Boston took charge by scoring 15 of the next 19 points. Irving had a pair of 3s during the run and Tatum added one. Boston led 98-76 after three. Chicago missed 12 of 18 shots overall in the third and committed six turnovers. TIP-INS Bulls: Had scored 100 or more in eight straight games. ... Portis scored 15 points in 11 minutes during the opening half, including six straight. ... Chicago didn't commit a foul in the opening quarter until the final minute. ... Dunn, who played nearby at Providence College, got a nice ovation during pregame introductions. Celtics: Brown was back in the lineup after missing the previous game with a sore left Achilles. ... Boston made 13 of its first 18 shots, missed 11 of 16 and then hit six of nine. FEELING GOOD HERE During a postgame interview on the court, Irving talked about how much he's enjoying playing in Boston. ""It's a feeling that I can't wait to get used to for a long time,"" he said. The star guard was acquired during the offseason from Cleveland in a blockbuster deal between the Eastern Conference finalists last season. TRICK SHOT Chicago guard Jerian Grant slipped to the floor in the closing seconds of the third just inside the foul line to the right of the lane. When no one got up close to him, he flipped a scoop shot that went in as the buzzer sounded. IMPRESSED Stevens talked glowingly before the game about the Bulls' team speed when he watched them on film. ""They were flying around, moving the ball,"" he said.","400975236"
"MIAMI --  The law of averages was on full display. DeMarcus Cousins and Jrue Holiday couldn't keep losing in Miami forever. And the Heat, a night removed from one of the best shooting performances in franchise history, sputtered. The result: Everything seemed to work for New Orleans. Ian Clark scored 19 points, Anthony Davis added 17 and the Pelicans used a big second-half run to beat the Heat 109-94 on Saturday night. Cousins had 16 points, eight assists and seven rebounds for the Pelicans, who were 15 for 25 from 3-point range and shot 53 percent overall. ""I thought we did a good job offensively of finding the open guy,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""DeMarcus only took seven shots. A.D. took less than 10."" Davis actually took 11, but Gentry's point was made. The Pelicans had 27 assists on 39 field goals, and Clark scored 14 points in the second half. E'Twaun Moore finished with 15 and Holiday had 13 for New Orleans, which held Miami to a 4-for-16 effort from 3-point range after halftime. ""We did a really good job defensively,"" Gentry said. Tyler Johnson scored 20 points for Miami. A 17-2 run put New Orleans up by 17 late in the third, and the outcome was not in doubt from there. ""They never looked back,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Goran Dragic and Wayne Ellington each scored 13, and Josh Richardson had 12 for Miami. A night after the second-best shooting game in team history, Miami shot 42 percent. And coming off a 16-for-25 effort from 3-point range in that win over Dallas, the Heat went 10 for 32 from behind the arc. They were apparently due to go cold. And Cousins and Holiday were apparently due to win in Miami. Holiday was never part of a victory in any of his first 14 appearances at Miami. Cousins had played in Miami seven times, also with no wins. Finally, those streaks ended. ""We take pride in not making any excuses,"" Ellington said. ""But it was a rough night for us. You can absolutely say that it was a rough night for us."" Miami got Dragic and James Johnson back from injuries -- albeit briefly in Johnson's case. He aggravated his case of right ankle bursitis and left after eight minutes, eventually retreating to the locker room for treatment and not returning. Dragic was also clearly laboring, wearing a sleeve on his strained left elbow and flexing it often. Dion Waiters was out with his sprained left ankle, while Hassan Whiteside and Justise Winslow remained sidelined for the Heat. TIP-INS Pelicans: It was New Orleans' 44th and final road game of 2017. The Pelicans went 18-26 in those contests. ... Cousins' streak of eight consecutive games with at least 23 points ended. ... The Pelicans love working weekends. They're 5-1 on Saturdays this season, 2-0 on Sundays. Heat: Miami still has not had more than two consecutive home wins this season. ... Udonis Haslem got in for the second consecutive night and immediately made an impact, drawing three fouls in his first two minutes on the court. GENTRY SPEAKS Gentry, who briefly coached the Heat in 1995, still has high regard for the franchise -- and lauded the way Miami has handled all its injury woes. ""The personality of this team is that they play extremely hard,"" Gentry said. ""They really don't worry about who's not playing. They worry about who is playing."" FOUL WOES With Whiteside out, the Heat relied in large part on Kelly Olynyk and Jordan Mickey for defense against Davis and Cousins. Olynyk got his fourth foul early in the third, and Mickey had five fouls by the end of the third.","400975237"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies haven't won many games lately, and those few victories have featured drama in the closing seconds. Tyreke Evans had 30 points and 11 assists, Marc Gasol had 17 points and a season-high 15 rebounds and Memphis snapped a three-game losing streak with a 115-112 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night. The Clippers had the ball with a chance to tie in the closing 21 seconds, but a tough Memphis defense forced a bad pass from Lou Williams, and Evans ran the ball down in the backcourt as the horn sounded. The victory was only the third for Memphis in the last 22 games. In each, the opponents failed to convert shots for a tie or victory on the final possession. ""You take the win any way that you can,"" Memphis interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We've got to be better in those moments, though."" Austin Rivers had 38 points, his second straight game setting a career high, while Williams finished with 36. But no other Clippers player reached double figures. DeAndre Jordan, the league's leading rebounder, had 18 boards. ""It was a great comeback at the end when you're down that many,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. Memphis had its largest lead of the game with 5 minutes left, 109-93, before Austin Rivers and Williams began chipping into the advantage. Eventually, the guards helped craft a 19-6 run, pulling the Clippers within 115-112 with 1:00 left after a 3-pointer from Williams. After a couple missed attempts by Memphis, Doc Rivers called timeout with 21 seconds left. But Los Angeles never got off a shot in the ensuing possession. ""I didn't like the last play at all,"" the Clippers coach said. ""I thought we were looking for the 3, which we wanted, but we also could have gotten a quick 2. But we basically just dribbled the clock out."" Memphis has struggled in at least one quarter in games throughout the losing skid. This time, Memphis used a strong third quarter to stretch its 63-59 halftime lead to as many as 12. The 16-point advantage in the closing 5 minutes was enough of a cushion for Memphis. For the Clippers, playing the second night of a back-to-back after a win in Houston on Friday, there wasn't quite enough energy to overcome the deficit. ""Emotionally, on defense, we weren't communicating,"" Austin Rivers said. ""We weren't into it. They got too many buckets, and it cost us down the stretch."" TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles fell to 6-12 on the road. ... The Clippers, as they have been in recent games, were without F Blake Griffin, G Patrick Beverley, F Danilo Gallinari and F Wesley Johnson. That represents an average of 56.1 points per game on the injured list. ... Jordan reached double figures in rebounds for the 20th time this season. Grizzlies: The 63 first-half points were two short of Memphis' season high for a half. ... Evans has scored at least 20 points in 15 games this season, and his six 3-pointers were a career-high. ... Gasol's 15 rebounds were one short of his career-best 16 against the Pelicans on Jan. 16, 2015. ... Memphis had 28 assists on its 40 made field goals. ... The 115 points were a season high for Memphis. BUM HIP Gasol played after being listed as doubtful before the game with left hip soreness. The hip has bothered him since the closing seconds of a Dec. 15 win over Atlanta. He said it was sore enough when he woke up Saturday that he questioned whether he would play. ""We need this,"" Gasol said of the victory. ""We need wins, and we need home wins and something to build on. ... Even though I didn't play great, it was worth it because we won."" BACK-TO-BACK FATIGUE The Clippers won an emotional game in Houston on Friday, expending a lot of energy while scoring 76 points in the second half to erase a 15-points Rockets lead. Doc Rivers was concerned about the impact of Friday's game even before playing the Grizzlies. And the fatigue was a factor. ""This is the first time in 10-15 games that I can say the other team played harder,"" Rivers said. ""They got to every loose ball. ... I just didn't think we had it.""","400975238"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder got the kind of night they envisioned when they brought in Paul George and Carmelo Anthony to join reigning MVP Russell Westbrook. Westbrook had 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Thunder won their fourth in a row with a 103-89 victory over the Utah Jazz on Saturday night. Utah had no answer for Westbrook, George and Anthony, who were playing the second night of a back-to-back. ""We're just finding it,"" Anthony said. ""Everybody's doing what they're supposed to do. Everybody's playing their game. We're not playing as tense and thinking so much out there on the basketball court as we were a couple weeks ago. The flow of the game is starting to become better and better for everybody. Guys are starting to be comfortable with what's being asked of them and kind of just accepting it. ""Just playing basketball at this point."" Westbrook had his 11th triple-double of the season. George had 26 points, five rebounds, a season-high six steals and two blocks, and Anthony added 16 points. Rookie Donovan Mitchell scored 29 points for the Jazz after missing the last two games with a big toe contusion. It was his 11th 20-point game of the season, the most among NBA rookies. ""Russell had a really good all-around game from start to finish,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""Thought we had a great night from Paul. Carmelo didn't maybe shoot the ball as well as he has the last couple games, but he got the kind of looks that (we like). He got 10 3s up, which was great."" The Thunder controlled the game most of the night and weren't threatened after a spurt by George and Westbrook that pushed their lead to 13 in the third quarter. Westbrook's pull-up jumper was lethal, and back-to-back 3-pointers by George seemed to take all the energy from Utah. The Jazz never got closer than nine points the rest of the way. ""I didn't feel like we executed offensively,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""When you play a team that's long and athletic defensively, you need each other even more. You have to execute with even more force and commit and we weren't able to do that."" Oklahoma City outscored Utah 29-21 in the third. The Jazz held their only lead of the game at 4-3. ""They take you out of your offense,"" Mitchell said. ""They're aggressive. As you saw, I made a few passes that, against certain teams, are open. But when you have guys who are long and athletic and quick, those passes aren't there. ""That's the one thing we have to accept, the aggression, and then counter it. I don't think we did that until we got toward the end of the game."" TIP-INS Thunder: Oklahoma City held the Jazz to 23.1 percent shooting from behind the arc. Jazz: Raul Neto missed his seventh straight game with a concussion. ... Rodney Hood started the game 0 for 7 and finished with nine points after scoring 29 on Thursday. ADJUSTING The Thunder have won 10 of 13 as Westbrook, George and Anthony have gotten more comfortable playing together. ""I still think we're going to continue to grow and get better,"" Donovan said. ""These guys are working hard to try to figure it out. They've all played a certain way for their entire careers, and they all have to adjust because when you play, you're playing inside of a team. It requires adjusting. And sometimes those adjustments are hard. ""In a lot of ways they're being taken out of their element and being asked to do things maybe they haven't had to do before. ... When you get inside of a team, you have to play to the identity of what's going to best suit the team.""","400975239"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Warriors coach Steve Kerr didn't see much passion from his team Saturday. Golden State better find some fast for Christmas Day, when LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers come to town for a prime-time holiday rematch of the past three NBA Finals. Gary Harris scored 19 points to lead a balanced Denver offense and the Nuggets stopped the Warriors' 11-game winning streak with a second impressive road victory in two nights, beating Golden State 96-81. ""It didn't feel like we were into it emotionally tonight. Sometimes after a long winning streak, whatever reason, you let your guard down a little bit. It wasn't there,"" Kerr said. ""The biggest concern for me tonight, I didn't see a lot of joy. ... We weren't having much fun."" Nikola Jokic added 18 points and nine rebounds and Jamal Murray had 14 points, six rebounds and five assists for the Nuggets after their Friday win at Portland. They held the defending NBA champions to a season low for points. Kevin Durant had 18 points and six rebounds in a particularly poor shooting performance for the typically efficient NBA Finals MVP. He was 6 for 17 and missed all five of his 3-point attempts as the Warriors shot 38.6 percent. Draymond Green had 10 points, six assists and five rebounds in his second game back after missing five of six with soreness in his right shoulder. He took a sharp elbow to the face from Jokic with 7:27 remaining and went down hard, then was getting X-rays on his left elbow afterward. Klay Thompson scored 15 for the Warriors but was 6 for 21 overall and 1 of 10 on 3s as Golden State went just 3 for 27 from deep. A night after posting his first career double-double with season bests of 20 points and 10 rebounds, Warriors rookie Jordan Bell contributed seven points and 10 rebounds. Patrick McCaw's floater with 7:13 to go pulled Golden State to 82-71, but the Warriors couldn't do much more to fight back. ""I can't remember seeing many teams hold that team to 3 of 27 from the 3-point line,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""So it's a hell of a win for us and it's going to make Christmas obviously that much merrier."" The Warriors were sloppy, lacked a flow on offense, looked a step behind most of the night and never got rolling trying to play catch-up much of the evening. Fans headed for the exits with a few minutes left, a rare sight at Oracle Arena. ""When you're missing shots, you don't let it affect your defense, but this is a feel-good game,"" Durant said. ""You want to make shots, that's what gets us going, that's what gets the crowd going."" Golden State has regularly relied on big third quarters this season, and Saturday it couldn't even muster a strong fourth after going into the final period down 73-62. It was also the second night of a back-to-back for the Warriors, who beat the Lakers at home on Friday. They fell behind 53-41 at the break Saturday. Harris had his second strong game after missing one with a bruised elbow. The Nuggets had lost five straight on Golden State's home floor dating to a 100-99 win at Oracle on April 10, 2014. It was an especially slow start for Golden State, which began 6 for 18 -- with Durant going 1 for 5 and Thompson missing his initial four shots as the Warriors shot 7 for 21 in the opening quarter. CURRY UPDATE Stephen Curry did extensive on-court work during pregame warmups and appeared to be moving well on his sprained right ankle, though the two-time MVP isn't going to play Monday. ""If we weren't playing Cleveland on Christmas and I told you Steph hasn't even played in a 3-on-3 game, hasn't had any contact at all and the game was 48 hours from now, you would say that `Steph's not going to play,' but because it's the magnitude of the game and everybody wants to know, but we can't let that affect our judgment,"" Kerr said. ""He can't play. It would be completely irresponsible if he did."" Curry has missed seven straight games. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver capitalized on the Warriors' mistakes, turning 19 turnovers into 21 points. ... Trey Lyles had 15 points and six boards off the bench. Warriors: Golden State's 88 points in a 92-88 loss at Boston on Nov. 16 was its previous season low. ... C Zaza Pachulia went through what he called a tough workout Saturday morning to test the soreness below his left shoulder and remained hopeful of playing Monday. ""We'll see,"" Pachulia said. ""I'm going to have another great workout tomorrow."" He missed his seventh consecutive game and eighth in nine. ... Shaun Livingston sat out his fourth straight game with a sore right knee but got in a solid pregame workout and looked strong running. ... Kerr stuck with his winning starting five from Friday after Golden State used eight different starting lineups over the previous nine games.","400975240"
"PHOENIX --  The scoring was balanced but there was no doubt who led the Minnesota Timberwolves over the Phoenix Suns. ""Jimmy Butler was not going to let us lose that game,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You can't say enough about what he has done for this team. He has changed everything for us."" Butler scored 32 points to lead six Minnesota players in double figures and the Timberwolves never trailed in a 115-106 victory over the Suns on Saturday night. ""I don't like to lose,"" Butler said. ""I feel like I am in a rhythm right now. I feel like whenever we guard as a team we share the ball, but whenever I need to shoot it I have to. I've got to be prepared to play and make plays for everybody, including myself."" Northwest Division-leading Minnesota has won three of four and six of eight and, at 20-13, is off to its best start after 33 games since opening 22-11 in 2003-04. But the Suns have given the Timberwolves trouble this season, beating them twice, including just a week ago in Minnesota. They eventually made this one interesting, too. The Suns cut a 22-point deficit to two late in the third quarter, but the Timberwolves used a 12-0 run to end the third and the start the fourth and held Phoenix off from there. Andrew Wiggins added 17 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 16 points and 14 rebounds. T.J. Warren scored 24 points for the Suns in their ninth and probably final game before Devin Booker returns from injury. Troy Daniels added 18 for the Suns, going 6 of 12 on 3-pointers. Isaiah Canaan had 15 points and nine assists off the bench for Phoenix in just his fifth game joining the team. The Timberwolves, winners of four of five and six of their last eight, led by as many as 16 in the first quarter and 22 in the second. Minnesota was up 64-43 at the break. The Suns, who had won three of four, opened the third quarter with a 22-6 outburst to cut the Minnesota lead to 70-65 on Warren's driving layup with 5:25 to play. The Timberwolves responded with a 9-2 run, Butler starting it with a three-point play and ending it with a dunk that had the Minnesota up 79-67 with 3:34 left. Then came a flurry of 3s -- two by Daniels, one by Canaan -- and Dragan Bender's two free throws with 1:30 left sliced the Timberwolves' lead to 80-78. The teams traded baskets before Minnesota scored the final four of the quarter, Crawford's driving layup sending the Timberwolves into the final quarter leading 86-80. Butler began the fourth with an 18-footer, Gorgui Dieng and Tyus Jones sank 3s and Minnesota led 94-80. The Suns never got closer than five again. ""They didn't do anything strategic other than give it to their all-star players and say go one-on-one, and we're going to struggle with that for a little bit,"" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. ""But I didn't think we put up a lot of fight. We addressed it at halftime and we played better in the second half, but we dug too big a whole."" BOOKER BACK? Barring any setbacks, Phoenix scoring leader Booker is expected to return when the Suns are home against Memphis on Tuesday night. Booker has missed nine games with a left adductor sprain. He's averaging 24. 3 points per game and scored at least 30 in 10 of his last 20 games before he was hurt. Phoenix has gone 3-6 in his absence. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota's 20-13 start is tied for third-best after 33 games in franchise history. Only 24-9 in 2001-02 and 22-11 in '03-04 were better. ... Butler's season high is 38 against Philadelphia on Dec. 12. Suns: With Canaan taking his playing time, point guard Mike Smith was waived by Phoenix. ... Triano needs one more victory to reach 100 as an NBA head coach. ... Suns erased double-digit deficits to win three of their previous four games. ... Phoenix didn't make a field goal until game was 5:10 old.  .... Suns had their highest-scoring third quarter of the season (37) after scoring 43 in the first half.","400975241"
"LOS ANGELES --  Portland Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts was saluting the bench players responsible for ending his team's three-game losing streak when he realized he had made one glaring omission. Stotts left out Maurice Harkless, who scored 13 points in the fourth quarter -- including the go-ahead three-point play with 21.4 seconds remaining. ""I knew I was missing somebody,"" Stotts said. Harkless scored 22 points and the Blazers extended their winning streak over the Los Angeles Lakers to 14 games with a 95-92 victory Saturday night. Harkless followed up CJ McCollum's miss and scored through contact after Lonzo Ball hit a 3-pointer to tie it at 91 with 1:45 remaining. Shabazz Napier added 21 points and McCollum had 17 for Portland. But it was the Blazers' bench led by Harkless and Zach Collins that made up for the absence of injured star Damian Lillard, who missed his second straight game with a strained right hamstring. Harkless and Collins combined for the Trail Blazers' first 11 points to open the fourth quarter, with Collins' turnaround leaner putting Portland ahead 74-73 with 10:17 left. Collins finished with 11 points and six rebounds. ""The four guys off the bench really made a great contribution, and I was really happy for Mo. He hasn't been playing much and came through with a lot of big plays,"" Stotts said. Kyle Kuzma and Jordan Clarkson each scored 18 for the Lakers, who were missing ailing forward Brandon Ingram. Ball had 10 points, eight rebounds and 11 assists. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a 3 with seven seconds remaining for Los Angeles. ""They just had a little more grit than us,"" said Lakers guard Josh Hart, who had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Portland used a 10-2 run over the final 1:38 of the third quarter to tie the game. Napier hit a 3-pointer with 4.5 seconds left to make it 70-all and missed a shot at the buzzer after stealing the ball from Julius Randle. ""We just let them hang around too long,"" Ball said. ""We had opportunities to blow the game out and we never took those opportunities"" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: McCollum and Napier combed for 17 points in the second after making all seven shots from the field. . F Noah Vonleh was inactive with a right hand injury. Lakers: Kuzma was 6 of 19 from the field after shooting 58 percent (47 for 81) in his previous five games. ... C Brook Lopez missed his third consecutive game with a sprained right ankle. SEASON'S BEATINGS Trail Blazers C Jusuf Nurkic was inadvertently backhanded by Randle on a layup in the first quarter. Nurkic was down on the court for several minutes holding his face. He had four points, two rebounds and one assist before exiting, and did not score again despite returning late in the second quarter. Ball went to the locker room late in the second quarter with a shoulder injury, but was able to play though it. He said he felt a ""pop"" but expects to be available on Christmas. INGRAM HOBBLED Ingram didn't play because of a bruised right quadriceps and tendinitis in his left quadriceps, and Lakers coach Luke Walton said the second-year forward was day to day. Ingram played 35 1/2 minutes against the Golden State Warriors on Friday, his lightest workload during a busy eight-day stretch. Los Angeles also played road games at New York and Cleveland, a home game against Golden State and a game at Houston before playing in Oakland. ""He's been playing a lot of minutes and putting on a heavy load for us, so part of our responsibility is to do injury prevention with our guys,"" Walton said.","400975242"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  San Antonio point guard Tony Parker didn't hesitate when he sped around Sacramento center Kosta Koufos for an easy basket in the fourth quarter. Manu Ginobili did pretty much the same thing in the third with a pair of uncontested layups. And then there was 37-year-old center Pau Gasol, who had his first triple-double in two years. These Spurs may have a few more gray hairs than before, but they remain a force in the West. LaMarcus Aldridge had 29 points and 10 rebounds, and San Antonio bounced back from a disappointing loss to beat the slumping Kings 108-99 on Saturday night. ""I think we're getting younger,"" Ginobili joked. ""Of course I'm getting older, and Tony and Pau maybe. Tony's been good since he's been back and Pau played a terrific game. We try to blend in with the young guys."" Gasol had 14 points, 11 rebounds and a season-high 10 assists for San Antonio, which won without star forward Kawhi Leonard. It was the 10th career triple-double for the 7-footer, who was questionable with a groin injury but wound up getting extended minutes because Sacramento had two big men on the court most of the night. Three days earlier Gasol put up 20 points and 17 rebounds against Portland before sitting out against Utah on Thursday. ""It's always nice when teams stay big because it helps us to stay big as well,"" Gasol said. ""(Coach Gregg Popovich) doesn't have to make that call to go small or stay big. Normally we go the other route. It's nice. It's refreshing, even, to see teams play with two bigs."" Parker had 10 points and six assists, and Ginobili scored 15 as the Spurs extended their winning streak over the Kings to 11 games. Aldridge did most of his scoring in the first half, but San Antonio didn't pull away until the third quarter when the five-time All-Star had eight points. Ginobili added six points in the period, including a pair of uncontested layups. Former Kings player Rudy Gay scored seven of the Spurs' first nine points in the fourth quarter when San Antonio went up by 14. ""Every team wants to get to the point where no matter who is healthy, who is not, you come out and play your best,"" Popovich said. ""We've done that quite often and tonight is another good example of that."" Buddy Hield had 24 points to pace Sacramento. Willie Cauley-Stein added 22 points and 11 rebounds, and Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 15 for the Kings, who were coming off back-to-back road wins over Brooklyn and Philadelphia. It was a much-needed lift for the Spurs, who had a fourth-quarter meltdown while losing to Utah 100-89 on Thursday. Aldridge spent much of the night going against Zach Randolph, his former teammate in Portland. The two big men traded buckets early before Aldridge made a short jumper to begin a 16-6 run just before halftime that put the Spurs up by 13 at the break. Sacramento scored eight straight points to open the third, but the Kings had no answer for Aldridge's fadeaway and turnaround jumpers. Ginobili also took advantage of Sacramento's sluggish defense when he easily drove through the lane past multiple defenders. ""They just took us to school,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""They were not feeling us. We were kind of chasing a team that has been doing it for a long time."" RUDY'S RETURN Gay had seven points on 3-of-8 shooting with four rebounds in his first game against his former team. Gay spent the past 3 1/2 seasons in Sacramento but declined the Kings' attempt to re-sign him in the offseason. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio made nine 3-pointers in the first half but only two after that. ... Leonard was held out after playing nearly 21 minutes against Utah on Thursday, part of the team's plan to ease him back from a quadriceps injury. Danny Green (groin tightness) also sat out. Kings: Sacramento's usually reliable bench was outscored 43-22. ... De'Aaron Fox missed his second consecutive game with a partially torn right quadriceps. He will be re-evaluated in early January. ... Sacramento last beat San Antonio on Nov. 15, 2014.","400975243"
"DETROIT --  A few days back, Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy had a heart-to-heart talk with forward Tobias Harris. Van Gundy's message to Harris, who was struggling with his shot, was to get out of his own head and just be in the moment. ""He just told me to clear my head and go out there and enjoy the game and just play off everything that happens,"" Harris said. ""That's what I've been able to do and it's been working."" It worked to near perfection Tuesday night. Harris scored 30 points as the Pistons downed the Indiana Pacers 107-83. Harris was 10-of-11 from the floor, including making seven of eight 3's. ""It's a new approach I have, since I was not shooting as well as I was before, so I'm just letting the game come to me and just try to feed off what the game brings,"" Harris said. ""You go on with a better mindset playing in the game. ""I'll stick with it."" Harris scored 21 points in the first quarter, as the Pistons rolled to a season-high 40 points and a 40-19 lead. ""Obviously, Tobias had a heck of a first quarter, but it all was clicking, on all cylinders,"" Pistons center Andre Drummond said. ""Everybody was scoring."" Drummond finished with 21 points and a game-high 18 rebounds. The entire starting five for the Pacers combined for just eight rebounds and their offensive output was a season low. ""I have no explanation for that, absolutely none,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We're just digging a hole for ourselves."" Ish Smith (12 points) and Reggie Bullock (11) also reached double digits for Detroit. Victor Oladipo led the Pacers with 13 points. Domantas Sabonis, Bojan Bogdanovic and Myles Turner each scored 10 points. The victory moved the Pistons (19-14) past the Pacers (19-15) into second spot in the NBA's Central Division and gave the Pistons a 3-1 decision in the season series between the two teams, the first time Detroit had won the season set from Indiana since going 4-0 against the Pacers in 2007-08. ""That's a team we're looking forward to playing in the playoffs, so to get that advantage is huge for us,"" Drummond said. SLOWING VICTOR Even though it was the sixth straight game that he'd led the Pacers in scoring, Oladipo, who came into the night averaging 25.3 points per game, was held to a season low on the scoresheet. ""You're not going to shut the guy down, but I think we did about as good a job as we could,"" Van Gundy said. ""And then you hope he misses some shots, and he did."" JACKSON INJURED The Pistons lost starting guard Reggie Jackson to an ankle injury in the third quarter. Landing after making a jump pass, Jackson came down awkwardly on his right ankle. He had to be helped from the court and did not return. ""The x-rays were negative,"" Van Gundy said. ""He's got an ankle sprain. We'll get an MRI and see tomorrow where we are."" Jackson finished the night with 13 assists against one turnover in 21:15 on the floor. ""He was unbelievable,"" Van Gundy said. Tip Ins Pacers: Indiana's McMillan (539) and Detroit's Van Gundy (503) are two of six active NBA head coaches with 500 or more wins in the league. .

"DALLAS --  J.J. Barea has fresh memories of San Antonio scoring the final 13 points in a recent Dallas loss, and Atlanta getting the last five with the score tied in the Mavericks' most recent game. The diminutive guard was happy to have a key role in a different ending for the last-place team in the Western Conference. Barea scored 20 points, including a clinching layup in the final seconds, and the Mavericks ended another six-game winning streak by the Toronto Raptors with a 98-93 victory on Tuesday night. The Mavericks held DeMar DeRozan and the Raptors to season lows in shooting percentage as Toronto lost for just the second time in 14 games, with each loss coming after six straight wins. ""I was thinking about our problems closing out, last three minutes, I was like, (hoping) it doesn't happen again,"" said Barea, who tied the team high with four assists. ""Something we've got to learn. We've got to do a better job of getting some important buckets at the end."" Dirk Nowitzki scored 18 points and fellow German Maxi Kleber had 15 points and matched his rookie season bests with five blocks and eight rebounds. Harrison Barnes had 16 points and 10 boards. Kyle Lowry led Toronto with 23 points but didn't score in the fourth quarter, while DeRozan couldn't get going at all after averaging 37 points on a three-game road winning streak that ended. Hounded by Dallas defensive specialist Wesley Matthews most of the game, DeRozan scored eight points while shooting 19 percent (3 of 16). His previous low was 20 percent (1 of 5) in his only other single-digit game this season -- two points in a 112-78 win at Atlanta in November. ""A lot of shots I took that were in the paint, normally shots that I make,"" said DeRozan, who averaged 32 points during the most recent six-game winning streak. ""Missed a lot of floaters, easy things. One of them nights."" The teams combined to make just five of 31 shots in the final 8 minutes -- including two misses by Serge Ibaka with the Raptors trailing by three before Barea hit a layup with 10 seconds left after dribbling out most of the shot clock. The Raptors (23-9) came into the game with the best winning percentage in the Eastern Conference but shot under 40 percent for the first time this season. Jonas Valanciunas had 17 points and 11 rebounds for Toronto, and Ibaka added 12 points and 12 boards. Barea scored the first six points and hit a capping 3-pointer on a 17-0 run that put the Mavericks in front 83-73 late in the third quarter. TIP-INS Raptors: G/F C.J. Miles, a former Dallas high school player, hit a 3 in 10 minutes after missing three games because of a dental procedure. ... Coach Dwane Casey said C Lucas Nogueira was available after missing 11 games with a right calf injury, but he didn't play. Mavericks: Nowitzki, in his 20th season, has at least 18 points in five of the past seven games after scoring that many just twice in his first 28 games. ... Barnes tied his career high with his sixth double-double. He did in Golden State's championship season of 2014-15. DEFENSIVE FOCUS DeRozan played 35 minutes to Matthews' 36. And wherever DeRozan went, Matthews followed. The results showed offensively for Dallas' defensive specialist. He was 2 of 9 from the field for five points. ""He has an iron will to make it as hard as possible on these great players,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He expended so much energy defensively, his shooting was out of rhythm. That's going to happen."" UGLY QUARTER The fourth quarter score was 16-13, Toronto. Both teams shot 26 percent in the quarter (5 of 19 for the Raptors, 6 of 23 for the Mavericks). Barea (3 of 5) was the only player with more than one field goal. The teams were a combined 3 of 17 on 3-pointers. THE OTHER GERMAN Kleber, also from Nowitzki's hometown of Wurzburg, Germany, matched Barnes for the team high with 13 points in the first half. It was capped by an alley-oop dunk when Yogi Ferrell grabbed a defensive rebound with 6 seconds left, raced the length of the court and tossed it to Kleber for the slam with a couple of seconds to spare. GERMAN BLOCKADE Kleber (four blocks) and Nowitzki (three) combined for seven blocks in the first half. It was already a season high for Nowitzki, and Kleber matched his season best early in the third quarter. The Mavericks had a season-high 11 blocks.","400975245"
"MIAMI --  Wayne Ellington doesn't play video games, so he doesn't know what a cheat code is. He gets the term now. Josh Richardson scored 14 of his 20 points in the final quarter, Ellington made four 3-pointers in that game-deciding period and the Miami Heat finished with a flourish to beat struggling Orlando 107-89 on Tuesday night -- beating the Magic for the first time in the teams' last five meetings. ""We needed that one,"" Heat guard Goran Dragic said. ""Huge win for us."" It was tied going into the fourth, and Miami -- which trailed Orlando by 10 in the second half -- outscored the Magic 39-21 in the final 12 minutes. All four of Ellington's late 3s came in a span of 3 1/2 minutes. ""He's a cheat code,"" Orlando's Jonathan Issac said, using the term video-gamers know as something that gives them special powers while playing.

Tyler Johnson added 17, Kelly Olynyk scored 15 and Dragic had 14 for the Heat, who had their biggest margin in a final quarter this season.

"MILWAUKEE --  The Chicago Bulls have been a much better team since Nikola Mirotic got healthy. And not just on offense. The big forward came off the bench to score 24 points in 28 minutes as the resurgent Bulls won for the eighth time in 10 games, beating the Milwaukee Bucks 115-106 on Tuesday night. Chicago's surge coincides with the return of Mirotic, who missed the beginning of the season after suffering facial fractures in an October fight with teammate Bobby Portis. Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg cited the return of Mirotic and guard David Nwaba for the team's recent success. ""You look at our defense since Niko's come back and since David's come back and it's been a big difference for our team,"" Hoiberg said. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 28 points and Eric Bledsoe had 22 to pace the Bucks, but Antetokounmpo took only two shots and scored four points in the decisive fourth quarter. ""You're not going to completely stop him but we were better in the fourth getting back in transition,"" Hoiberg said. Kris Dunn rebounded from a 1-for-12 shooting game Saturday against Boston with 20 points and 12 assists in 33 minutes for the Bulls (11-22). ""Bad games happen to everybody,"" Dunn said. ""I'm not going to keep my head down. This team believes in me, the coaching staff believes in me, so I'll just keep playing my game and being aggressive."" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said expectations were ""a little bit too high"" for his team, which has lost five of seven. ""At the end of the day, we're a young team,"" Kidd said. ""This is going to be a team that's going to go up and down."" Mirotic, averaging more than 18 points per game, led Chicago's bench in outscoring Milwaukee's reserves 54-25. It was the second time the Bulls won at Milwaukee in 12 days, including a 115-109 victory on Dec. 15. Nwaba tipped in a rebound to cap an 8-2 run that gave the Bulls a 100-92 lead with 6:16 to go. The closest Milwaukee got the rest of the way was 109-104 with 1:11 left. Chicago took the lead for good, 86-85, on a 3-pointer by Mirotic with 10:59 left. ""That's what great players do -- they rise to the occasion,"" Bucks center John Henson said. ""He did that tonight."" REBOUNDING WOES Milwaukee allowed 11 offensive rebounds in the second half and was outrebounded 47-41 overall. ""That's just who we are; we can't rebound the ball,"" Kidd said. ""We just hope and pray that someone gets it. When that happens we're going to get killed, and we got killed again."" EJECTIONS Dunn and Milwaukee's Khris Middleton got tangled up on the ground with 16 seconds to go. Both were assessed double technical fouls and ejected. ""I was protecting myself,"" Dunn said. ""We got tangled up and I'll leave it at that."" KNEE CONCERNS CONTINUE Kidd said the Bucks will take it day to day with Antetokounmpo's knee, saying he will ""just worry about today and then talk about tomorrow after the game."" Antetokounmpo missed Milwaukee's 111-106 loss at Charlotte on Saturday. FULL CONTACT Chicago G Zach LaVine (left ACL) was slated to practice with Windy City of the G League on Tuesday night. Hoiberg said LaVine, who sustained a minor back strain about a week ago, will practice with Chicago on Thursday and begin six straight days of practice with contact on Saturday. ""He's got a lot of hurdles to clear yet in the process, but it's going to be good to get him back with consecutive days of full-contact practice and we'll see how he responds,"" Hoiberg said. TIP-INS Bulls: Rookie F Lauri Markkanen missed the Dec. 15 game in Milwaukee due to back spasms. He had three points and seven rebounds in 20 minutes Tuesday night. Bucks: Antetokounmpo opened the game by making all five of his shots and a pair of free throws in the first 6:27, but picked up his second foul a minute later and went to the bench.","400975247"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs' first game with every player healthy and available went as the team expected. There was some hesitation and a rash of early turnovers, but they grew comfortable as the game progressed. Kawhi Leonard scored 21 points, LaMarcus Aldridge added 20 and San Antonio beat Brooklyn 109-97 on Tuesday night, its 15th straight win at home over the Nets. ""(The rash of injuries is) very unusual for us, but we still have a month and a half until the rodeo (road trip) starts,"" Spurs veteran Manu Ginobili said. ""This is a good time to get everybody playing, everybody feeling good. Get Kawhi and Tony (Parker) back to their usual selves, back to their rhythm, feeling good and I think we are accomplishing that. Slowly, because they haven't been back for so long, but they are really showing progress."" San Antonio is third in the Western Conference at 24-11 despite being without Leonard and/or Parker for 30 games this season. Aldridge has led the team during the duo's absence and his resurgent season has not slowed with their return. The 6-foot-11 forward was 7 for 15 from the field and had nine rebounds against Brooklyn. ""You know, obviously, watching (Aldridge and Pau Gasol) play and see them do the things they do for our team is great, and it inspires everyone on the bench, me, even guys playing,"" Leonard said. ""But just with me, just taking it slow and trying not to skip any steps, like I said before, so I can be healthy down the road."" Playing in just his fifth game, Leonard was 8 for 17 from the field in scoring a season high. He made his first appearance in the fourth quarter, scoring four points in three minutes. ""When Kawhi checked into the game in the fourth quarter, that wasn't a welcome sign,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It just changes the game. He makes such a difference. Defensively, it's just unbelievable. I felt like he was guarding our whole team at times."" Playing with a full roster for the first time led to some indecision, as the Spurs scored just 19 points in the opening quarter while trying to involve all their scoring options. ""We went to being too careful,"" said reserve guard Patty Mills, who scored 11 points. ""That caused us to turn the ball over."" San Antonio had nine of their 12 turnovers in the first half, but offset that by holding Brooklyn to 36 percent shooting. Gasol added 15 points, Parker had 14 and Ginobili had 11. The Nets kept pace early despite injuries to their top two point guards, D'Angelo Russell and Jeremy Lin. Caris LeVert led Brooklyn with 18 points and Allen Crabbe added 15. ""I like the process. The results weren't great offensively but we did some good things,"" Atkinson said. TIP-INS Nets: Russell has not played since Nov. 11, missing his 20th straight game. He is expected to be back in the first half of January after undergoing left knee surgery Nov. 17. ... The Nets are 4-41 on the road against the Spurs in franchise history. Their last win in San Antonio in the regular season was a 92-86 victory on Jan. 22, 2002, at the Alamodome. ... Atkinson was assessed a technical foul with 6:45 left in the third quarter after bolting from his seat and running to midcourt to protest an offensive foul call on Crabbe. Spurs: San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich has 1,174 career victories, placing him one shy of tying George Karl for fifth all-time. ... Gasol collected his 10,817th rebound, moving him past Jack Sikma for 30th in league history. ... Aldridge has led the Spurs in scoring 28 times in 33 games after doing so a combined 37 times in his first two seasons with the team. ... The Spurs are 16-2 at home, the league's best home record. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE Popovich shrugged off any difficulties he could face while trying to decide on rotations and minutes now that the Spurs roster is fully available. ""It's basketball, it's not the Middle East peace process,"" Popovich said. ""It's not figuring out why our democracy is being eroded. It's pick-and-roll. Big deal.""? TIME WILL TELL Ginobili said the team hopes to gel completely during the team's annual rodeo road trip, a monthlong excursion in February while the AT&amp;T Center is hosting the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo. ""That's when we usually start getting the shape that we want in the playoffs,"" Ginobili said. ""So, that's when it starts and hopefully this year we are in the same mode and from there we keep building until April comes.""

"DENVER --  Jamal Murray was given the job as Denver's starting point guard before the season began. He is proving to be a worthy choice. Murray scored 13 of his 22 points in the first quarter and the Nuggets overcame the ejection of Nikola Jokic to beat the Utah Jazz 107-83 on Tuesday night. Murray has scored 20 or more points 11 times this season and is averaging 17.7 points per game in December while running Denver's offense. He scored five straight points when the Jazz cut a 21-point lead to 14 after Jokic was ejected. ""Jamal's a confident player,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""He's not scared of the moment. He made some big plays and some athletic plays, and it was great to see."" Jokic had 13 points and seven rebounds before getting tossed in the fourth quarter. Wilson Chandler and Gary Harris scored 15 apiece to help Denver win its third in a row. Despite the rout, Jokic got tangled up with Jonas Jerebko early in the fourth and was called for a flagrant 2 foul and ejected from the game. ""We were running together and he started bumping into me,"" Jokic said. ""First time, second time, third time, and I tried to swim over him and I hit him. If I'm going to hit the guy I'm not going to hit him (like that). I didn't do it on purpose. I was surprised I got ejected."" The Jazz cut it to 79-65 after Jokic left, but Murray converted a three-point play and Trey Lyles had a driving dunk to push the lead to 90-72 with 5:38 left. Derrick Favors had 20 points, and Jerebko and Donovan Mitchell each scored 13 for the Jazz. ""They broke us. We weren't consistent,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""We didn't string together possessions where we had two, three, four, five, six possessions with stops. And when we did have a few possessions where we got stops, we weren't able to convert on the other end."" The Nuggets showed no sign of complacency after big road wins at Portland and Golden State last weekend. They used a 12-0 run late in the first quarter to take a 13-point lead, and another big spurt at the end of the second to lead 50-34 at halftime. Unlike the two meetings in Utah this season, Denver didn't collapse in the second half. The Nuggets led by 21 less than four minutes into the third and maintained a comfortable lead throughout the second half to improve to 12-3 at home. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell entered second in the NBA in scoring among rookies at 18 points per game. Lakers G Kyle Kuzma (18.1 ppg) is first. ... G Raul Neto missed his eighth straight game with a concussion. ... C Rudy Gobert (left knee sprain) was with the team but sat out for the sixth straight game. Nuggets: G Emmanuel Mudiay was active after missing four straight games with a sprained right ankle. He entered in the final two minutes and scored seven points.

Denver held the Jazz to 28.9 percent shooting in the first half and a season-low 34 points over the first two quarters. ... Lyles had 16 points and eight rebounds against his former team. HEADS UP Lyles enjoyed beating his old team, but it wasn't all fun. Late in the fourth quarter he and Utah rookie Nazareth Mitrou-Long knocked heads, leaving Lyles with a sizable knot while Mitrou-Long needed nine stitches. ""Luckily, got away with the lesser of two evils,"" Lyles said. Mitrou-Long shook off his injury. ""It is not as bad as it looks,"" he said. ""I have no hockey in my background, but I was a bouncer before so I got hit in the head a couple of times.""","400975249"
"PHOENIX --  Tyson Chandler learned of the Suns' crafty inbounds play when Jay Triano took over as coach early this season. With 0.6 seconds left in a tie game Tuesday night, he asked Triano during a timeout if Phoenix was going to run it. Triano said yes. Dragan Bender and Chandler did the rest. Bender threw a perfect pass at the rim from the opposite sideline, Chandler jumped over the Grizzlies' Brandan Wright to slam it down with 0.4 seconds remaining, and the Suns beat the Memphis Grizzlies 99-97. After replay review for offensive goaltending, the basket counted, and the Grizzlies couldn't get off a decent shot before the final buzzer. ""My job was to punch it in. It was close,"" Chandler said. ""It might have hit the back rim but I caught it over the cylinders because I knew there was no goaltending."" Triano described his plan. ""I told our guy (Bender) to shoot the ball in the basket and all Tyson has to do is touch it on the way down or grab the rim and have it hit your knuckle and go in,"" Triano said, explaining the no-goaltending-from-out-of-bounds rule that made the basket good. Had Chandler not touched Bender's pass and it went through the hoop, the basket would not have counted. ""He got a little push. They usually don't call that stuff at the end of the game. I went up and my hand went under and through the rim, so it kind of messed my timing up a little bit,"" Wright said. ""I had to pull it back out because I didn't want to get a goaltend. They just made a play, a perfect pass."" Devin Booker scored 32 points in his return from a three-week injury absence before fouling out in the final minute, but the Suns needed one final play after Jarell Martin slammed in a rebound with 0.6 seconds remaining to tie it at 97. ""It is what it is,"" Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. The Suns beat the Grizzlies in a tight game at home for the second time in six days after handing them a 97-95 defeat on Dec. 21. Phoenix has won four of its last six games while Memphis has lost nine of 11. The Suns used a 13-0 run to turn a four-point deficit into a 91-82 lead midway through the fourth quarter. The Grizzlies went nearly six minutes without a point. But Booker fouled out with 41 seconds to go and Memphis cut it to 96-95 when Tyreke Evans made a layup with 6.2 seconds left. Evans said he hurt his knee in a collision on his drive that led to the tying basket and had to sit out the final play of game, subbed out for Wright. T.J. Warren scored 17 points for the Suns. Evans had 25 points for the Grizzlies, who got 18 from Marc Gasol. Booker hit his first shot of the game, a 16-foot jumper 13 seconds after tipoff. He made 9 of 21 shots and 11 of 12 of free throws. ""This is better than Christmas for me,"" Booker said. ""Getting a chance to be back out on the floor, playing with my brothers and coming out with a close win makes it that much better.""

Suns: Triano reached 100 career victories as an NBA coach. He has 13 with the Suns and 87 with Toronto. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  The Los Angeles Clippers don't care where their points come from right now. Down three starters, as they have been for most of the season, they will take them from anybody available. There were all types of sources Tuesday night in their 122-95 rout of the Sacramento Kings. Reserve Montrezl Harrell scored 22 points. Lou Williams added 21 more from the bench. DeAndre Jordan added 13 points and 15 rebounds. And Jamil Wilson, a 27-year-old rookie who has played in Puerto Rico, Italy and the G League, started and scored a career-high 17 points. ""At the end of the day, it's still basketball,"" Wilson said. ""The ball is still orange, the goal's still 10 feet. You try to use that to bring everything down to Earth. I've been playing the game my whole life."" The Kings stayed with the Clippers early. It was a 30-all game at the end of the first period, but Los Angeles went on a 37-14 run to close the half and was never threatened again. The Clippers bench outscored their Kings counterparts, 72-43. ""They got to penetrate the lane and spread out the 3, get to the line, and they just really controlled the game offensively,"" said Sacramento center Willie Cauley-Stein. ""They got to do whatever they wanted."" The Clippers also got a career-high 10 assists from guard Milos Teodosic. ""He is just a spectacular passer,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. TIP-INS Kings: After losing nine consecutive road games early in the season, Sacramento entered Tuesday's game having won five of their last nine away from home. Said coach Dave Joerger: ""We settled in on a rotation. Guys are getting used to the league a little bit. They'd been scouted for the first time and have to be able to make those adjustments. And guys are continuing to improve on a daily basis."" Clippers: Rivers said F Blake Griffin could return Friday against the Lakers. When Griffin sprained his medial collateral ligament in his left knee on Nov. 27, the team said he could be out eight weeks. Rivers on his early return: ""I just know his work ethic has to have something to do with it. He gets a lot of heat for getting injured, but no one gives him credit for getting healthy. He works his butt off like no one I've ever seen."" ... F Wesley Johnson (foot) could also return Friday. MAKING THEM COUNT The Clippers have won three of their last four, but are currently three games out of a playoff berth. ""We have to really show up and play,"" said guard Austin Rivers. ""We're undermanned, still have guys out. Regardless, we have to compete. ""I don't care who we play, we need to win. We can't just show up to play. That's how you drop games. We can't afford to drop games. We don't want to be playing catch-up the whole season."" UNCERTAIN FUTURES Despite their success, the immediate prospects of Harrell and Wilson are somewhat precarious with Griffin and Johnson expected back from injury soon. Wilson said he can only concern himself with the present. ""It's always good to play well individually,"" he said. ""But on a night like this when everyone plays well collectively, we're a hard team to beat, even though we still have guys out."" DEFENSIVE FAILINGS The Kings are in the middle of the pack in points allowed in the NBA, but feel like something is still missing from their defense. ""We have to figure out a way to make a stand and play the right way defensively,"" said Sacramento guard Garrett Temple. ""We have a couple of young guys in there, but that's no excuse.""","400975251"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Rookie Jayson Tatum said he is beginning to feel more comfortable with the NBA game. It's beginning to show, too. Tatum scored 10 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter, helping the Boston Celtics beat the Charlotte Hornets 102-91 on Wednesday night. ""Tatum stepped up for us,"" said Al Horford, who had 20 points and 11 rebounds. ""He's not afraid of the moment. One thing that helps him is he stays poised, very focused. It doesn't matter how the game has been going up until that point. He seems to make the right plays down the stretch."" Tatum had two fast-breaks dunks and a nifty baseline drive in which he blew past Dwight Howard before drawing a foul as the Celtics broke open a tight game in the fourth. ""It comes with the amount games we've played,"" Tatum said. ""Each and every day I'm getting more comfortable and getting into a rhythm."" Kyrie Irving led Boston with 21 points. The Celtics had dropped three of four, including a 111-103 loss to visiting Washington on Christmas Day. Kemba Walker scored 24 points and Howard had 12 points and 17 rebounds for the Hornets, who are in the midst of a freefall down the Eastern Conference standings. Charlotte has lost 13 of 17 ahead of a four-game West Coast trip beginning Friday night at Golden State. With Boston leading by four early in the fourth quarter, Tatum scored on an alley-oop dunk on a fast break. A few possessions later he scored on a reverse layup, and then added a block at the other end. Tatum was able to pick his spots because the Hornets shifted their focus in the fourth quarter to blitzing Irving when he had the ball. ""Kyrie is drawing a ton of attention in that moment and Al draws a lot of attention, so a couple of Jayson's baskets were off of that,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. Irving said Tatum has tremendous patience. ""Understanding what we're trying to accomplish and knowing that when the game has to slow down, the spots that he needs to be in, the spots that he can take advantage of and being able to have the confidence to be put in that position,"" said Irving, who had eight assists. ""He's taking full advantage of it."" The Hornets trailed by as many as 20 in the first half, but cut the lead to one entering the fourth quarter after holding the Celtics to 7-of-23 shooting in the third. But Charlotte never led. Terry Rozier, who had 15 points, knocked down a 3-point to start the fourth and Horford scored inside to give the Celtics some breathing room. Aron Baynes played a pivotal role on defense, helping hold Howard to 3-of-10 shooting from the field. Baynes consistently pushed Howard away from the low block, forcing him to take difficult shots and finished with nine rebounds. TIP-INS Celtics: Have beaten the Hornets in six straight meetings and 10 of the last 11 dating to February 2015. ... Had 15 fast-break points to Charlotte's eight. Hornets: Walker has scored at least 20 points in 19 games this season. ... Outrebounded the Celtics 52-43. ... Shot 36.8 percent from the field.

ROAD TRIPPING The Hornets face the Warriors, Clippers, Kings and Lakers on their upcoming road trip. Charlotte is just 2-12 away from home this season. ""It hasn't been the most friendly out there on the road for us,"" forward Marvin Williams said. ""We've got a lot of ground to make up.

Ferrell, an Indianapolis native, hit a key 3-pointer to take a four-point lead with 2:09 remaining. The Pacers led 90-84 with 5 minutes remaining. ""We never got down on ourselves, especially in the first half when they were shooting the heck out of the ball,"" Ferrell said. ""We just brought it right back at them and tried to score and in the second half we just wanted to make it a lot harder for them to make shots."" Lance Stephenson, Myles Turner and Darren Collison had 16 points apiece for the Pacers, who played without injured leading scorer Victor Oladipo for the first time and struggled down the stretch. ""We were right there,"" Stephenson said. ""I'm not going to say (the loss) was because (Oladipo) was out. We were right there."" Stephenson's layup tied it at 94, but he committed a costly turnover on the Pacers' next possession with 28 seconds remaining that the Mavericks converted into an uncontested layup. ""We just couldn't get shots that we needed down the stretch to convert,"" Collison said.

""Everybody was just locked in for 48 minutes,"" Schroder said. ""That's the key, and we played together."" Schroder scored 21 points, Ersan Ilyasova added 20 and the Hawks won consecutive games for the first time this season with a 113-99 victory Wednesday night over the mercurial Washington Wizards. The Wizards were coming off their best win of the season, a high-energy 111-103 victory at Boston on Monday, but they have been unable to shake a reputation for playing down to the competition. Marco Belinelli scored 19 points in 20 minutes for Atlanta, the NBA's worst team at 9-25. Bradley Beal had 20 points for Washington (19-16), which was trying for its first three-game win streak since mid-November. Markieff Morris had 18 points and eight rebounds, and John Wall finished with 10 points and 11 assists. Already saddled with home losses last month to Phoenix and Dallas, the Wizards were beaten twice this month at Brooklyn, the latest a 35-point setback last week. Losing to Atlanta dropped Washington to 9-10 against teams under. 500. ""I think as a team we think that certain teams we play are going to lay down against us, but they come out and compete every night,"" Wall said. ""This is their job. This is what they're going to do."" The Wizards fell behind for the first time when Belinelli hit three free throws at the 4:54 mark of the third. The lead changed hands a couple of times before John Collins' tip-in at the period buzzer put the Hawks up for good at 78-76. ""A tip like that can do a lot,"" Collins said. ""I wasn't expecting everybody to get as excited as they did, but I guess in the moment I was just playing. I'm happy I could be of assistance."" Washington coach Scott Brooks went with a three-guard lineup midway through the fourth with Wall, Beal and Jodie Meeks joined by Otto Porter Jr. at forward and Morris at center. It didn't work. Down by nine, the Wizards pulled within four on Beal's 14-footer and Morris' dunk with 6:17 remaining, but they lost focus as Schroder hit a layup and immediately stole Wall's inbound pass to set up Ilyasova's two free throws. Ilyasova followed with a 3, Schroder hit two free throws and Miles Plumlee had a tip-in to make it 101-90. The Hawks' biggest lead was 18 in the fourth. ""It doesn't matter if we're playing away or home,"" Meeks said. ""We have to win games like this."" TIP-INS Wizards: The worst part for Brooks was watching the Hawks outhustle his team. Despite a bigger, deeper lineup, Washington was outrebounded 53-40. ""We couldn't get any stops, we were taking bad shots and then we gave them hope,"" he said. ""Once that happened, we couldn't turn it off. They were making shots and playing at a higher speed than us. We've got to figure it out.""... Washington missed a chance to have 10 road wins and 10 home wins before Jan. 1 for the first time since 1978-79. Hawks: Were coming off a 112-107 victory over Dallas, the worst team in the West. ... C Dewayne Dedmon has been cleared to resume basketball activities after missing the last 14 games with a stress reaction in his left tibia. Coach Mike Budenholzer said a CT scan showed the bone is healing on schedule, though Dedmon might need another 10 to 14 days before he is ready to play.","400975254"
"CHICAGO --  The Chicago Bulls struggled for long stretches. They looked fatigued at times on the second night of back-to-back games. And they found a way to win anyway. Kris Dunn scored 17 points, including two clutch free throws in the final seconds, and the surging Bulls rallied to beat the New York Knicks 92-87 on Wednesday. Chicago trailed by as many as 15 in the first half, but shut down New York down the stretch of its ninth win in 11 games. The Knicks managed just three points in the final 5 1/2 minutes. Lauri Markkanen scored 12 points for the Bulls (12-22), who were coming off a 115-106 win at Milwaukee. Justin Holiday and Robin Lopez had 11 points apiece. ""I did think we hung in there,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""We spent a lot of energy (Tuesday) night. I don't think we came out with great energy, our focus wasn't great, we were turning the ball over. We did things we had not been doing."" Kristaps Porzingis led the Knicks with 23 points, and Courtney Lee had 17. New York (17-17) has dropped three straight. Porzingis, guarded mostly by Markkanen, was shut out after he made a jumper with 6:58 left. ""We got content to walking it up the court,"" New York coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""We weren't able to get into easy early stuff. Instead we were setting up, they were switching and we were spending too much time looking for KP and then the shot clock would start going down."" The Knicks led for most of the night before Holiday hit a corner 3-pointer that tied it at 86 with 3:01 left. Neither team scored for the next two-plus minutes before Dunn found Markkanen ahead of the field for a dunk. New York's Jarrett Jack was fouled with 8.5 seconds left and had a chance to tie it, but converted just 1 of 2 free throws. Dunn was fouled with 7.8 seconds to go and made both for a 90-87 lead. Following a timeout, Enes Kanter's 3-point attempt missed badly and bounced out of bounds. Holiday then iced the game with a pair of free throws. The Bulls posted a 104-102 victory in the first meeting between the teams on Dec. 9 at the United Center, with Dunn hitting a pair of free throws with 2.9 seconds left. ""There are gonna be games that are ugly, but it all comes down to stops,"" Dunn said. ""We take pride in our defensive stops. I think we're very resilient."" OFF NIGHT Chicago forward Nikola Mirotic was held to just four points. He averaged 18.5 points in the previous 10 games. FRENCH CONNECTION New York rookie Frank Ntilikina has had Thursday night's game at San Antonio circled since the schedule came out. It will be his first opportunity to meet countryman Tony Parker. ""He's the best French player in history, so it's going to be challenging to play against him,"" Ntilikina said. TIP-INS Knicks: F Doug McDermott made his first start of the season and finished with three points in 37 minutes. F Lance Thomas had started 10 games with Tim Hardaway Jr. sidelined with a stress injury of the lower left leg. ... C Joakim Noah was inactive for the second time in the last four games. The former Bull also was inactive for the Dec. 9 game. Bulls: With his performance at Milwaukee on Tuesday, Dunn joined Michael Jordan as the only Bulls player with at least 20 points, 12 assists, four steals and two blocks in a game. Only 18 players total have amassed that stat line in an NBA game. ""It was good to see him bounce back after probably his toughest game of the season in Boston (on Saturday) where he was 1 for 12,"" Hoiberg said. ""It didn't rattle him that he had a tough night in Boston.""","400975255"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Jimmy Butler played the type of game Tom Thibodeau was thinking about when he brought the veteran guard to Minnesota in the offseason. Butler scored 12 of Minnesota's 14 points in overtime and finished with a season-high 39 to lift the Timberwolves to a 128-125 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night. Thibodeau, Minnesota's coach and president of basketball operations, gave up a first-round draft pick and two players -- both former first-round picks -- to acquire the Olympian and three-time All-Star from Chicago, where Thibodeau coached him from 2011-15. ""He's got an unbelievable will to win, and that's what makes him so special,"" Thibodeau said. ""When his best is needed, he's always at his best. Always been that way, and that's not going to change."" Butler scored Minnesota's first 11 points in overtime. Then with the game tied 125-all and 50 seconds to go, he drove to the basket again before kicking it out to Jamal Crawford, who drained the go-ahead 18-foot jump shot. ""I really was going to shoot the ball, I won't lie to you,"" Butler said. ""But if Jamal screams `Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!' three times, that means pass it to him, he's open. He did what he's done for us all year: make some shots."" After the Nuggets missed on the other end, Butler skied for the defensive rebound, brought the ball down the court and drew a foul. He hit one of two free throws, and Denver's Trey Lyles missed a desperation 3-point attempt at the buzzer to help Minnesota hang on after blowing a 19-point lead. ""That's an All-Star. He showed his worth right there,"" said Lyles, who finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds. ""He done it to us in the earlier game, too, and when a guy gets going like that it's tough to stop him, and kudos to him. We kind of threw everything we had at him, and he was able to take it and still finish."" Will Barton scored 28 points and Nikola Jokic had 22 for the Nuggets, whose three-game winning streak ended. Andrew Wiggins made five 3-pointers and scored 21 points for Minnesota, which won its fifth straight. Taj Gibson added 20 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns had 14 points and 13 rebounds. The Wolves played the overtime period without Towns, who fouled out late in the fourth quarter, and point guard Jeff Teague, who limped off the court in the final 20 seconds with what appeared to be a left leg injury. Gibson fouled out on Denver's first possession in overtime, leaving the Wolves without three starters for the game's most crucial stretch. But as long as one of them was Butler, they were in fine shape. ""I hope everyone's recognizing how special he is,"" Thibodeau said. ""He's changed everything for us. Big play after big play. Guards everyone. Hustle plays. Tough rebounds. In traffic. Passes, shots, free throws. Everything."" Minnesota led by as many as 19 points and was ahead 109-100 after Wiggins' four-point player with just under three minutes to play in regulation. But Denver stormed back and Barton hit a pair of free throws to send the game to overtime tied at 114. ""Down 19 points, second half, second night of a back-to-back, we could've very easily have folded and just rolled over,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""I loved the fact that our guys never did that. We competed."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Lyles has scored in double digits in Denver's last seven games. ... The Nuggets are 2-4 on the back end of back-to-backs this year. After beating Utah on Tuesday, they are 5-1 on the front end. ... Denver had held its previous three opponents below 86 points, its longest such streak since 2012. Timberwolves: F Nemanja Bjelica played his second straight game after missing the previous 15 with a sprained foot. He finished with one point and three rebounds in 10 minutes. ... Minnesota's 71-point first half was its highest-scoring half this season. ... Minnesota improved to 19-6 against the Western Conference and 7-1 against the Northwest Division. GOING DEEP The Timberwolves came into the game 29th in the NBA in 3-pointers made per game at 8.1, but they already had nine (on 18 attempts) by halftime and finished the night 12 for 29 from beyond the arc. They made their first five 3-pointers on consecutive shots by Towns, Teague, Wiggins (twice) and Butler to build an early lead. That included a 4-for-4 start by Wiggins, a 30 percent 3-point shooter on the season who had made just 13 of 50 3-pointers in December going into Wednesday's game. His five on the night were the most for any Timberwolf this season.","400975256"
"NEW ORLEANS -- It took Rajon Rondo 20 games in a Pelicans uniform to rewrite the franchise record books. As Rondo gains more comfort with his new team -- and its unusual lineup featuring two dynamic All-Star big men -- his ability to recognize mismatches and put talented scorers in advantageous spots could be exactly what New Orleans needs. Rondo set a franchise record with a career-high 25 assists in just 30 minutes on the court, Anthony Davis had 33 points, 11 rebounds and 6 blocks, and the Pelicans beat the Brooklyn Nets 128-113 on Wednesday night. ""The No. 1 thing is we got the win. And then me, personally, I love passing the ball,"" Rondo said. ""I've been blessed to play with a lot of great players, and what I take pride in is making those guys' jobs easier."" Rondo is the only active player with 25 assists in a game and is among only seven players in NBA history to reach the mark, with the others being Scott Skiles, John Stockton, Jason Kidd, Kevin Johnson, Nate McMillan and Isiah Thomas. The last to do it was Kidd in 1996. ""It's definitely an honor to be mentioned with those guys, especially with passing the ball, which I take pride in,"" Rondo said. ""But I couldn't have done it without my teammates making shots, so I've got to give those guys the credit."" Rondo created 58 points with his assists, the most by any player in a game over the past 20 seasons, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. However, he scored only two points himself, the fewest in a 25-assist game, according to Elias. Rondo got his 25 assists in the shortest amount of time (30 minutes) and is the oldest player to do so (31 years, 308 days), Elias reports. DeMarcus Cousins had 27 points and 14 rebounds, and Jrue Holiday scored 23 points for the Pelicans, who have won three straight -- all by 14 or more points. Rondo was quick to point out that his whole team moved the ball well and shot accurately. The Pelicans had a record 40 assists as a team on 48 total field goals. ""That speaks for itself. It wasn't just me,"" Rondo said. ""The ball was hopping, and we were making plays for one another."" Cousins said Rondo made it look ""easy."" The Pelicans ""looked like the Harlem Globetrotters at one point,"" Cousins added. ""It's fun to play that way."" Davis even credited Rondo, who missed the start of the season because of an abdominal injury, for improving team defense. ""He's been getting on me about not blocking shots, so for the last couple games, I've been trying to just go after everything,"" Davis said. Sitting on the edge of the Western Conference playoff picture, the Pelicans entered their current three-game homestand looking to string together victories against teams that have struggled on the road. They got off to a solid start against Brooklyn, leading by as many as 16 in the first quarter, 23 in the second and 33 in the third. ""We just did not have the defensive mentality and defensive discipline to get stops. They are a potent offensive team,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We should have more resiliency, more understanding of the situation. Sure, they are a big team, but you can negate that with your activity. You can negate that by denying passes, by getting deflections."" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry pulled his starters in the third quarter, only to have to put them back in following a 17-0 Nets run that trimmed New Orleans' lead to 91-75 heading into the fourth. Caris LeVert scored 22 points, Nik Stauskas added 21, and both were instrumental in Brooklyn's brief surge. But the Pelicans' lineup of Davis, Cousins, Holiday, Rondo and E'Twaun Moore, who had 20 points, quickly created separation again and set up a stress-free finish. ""When their starters came back in, they kind of punched us in the mouth again. But at least we tried our hardest and made the game respectful,"" Stauskas said. ""What I have learned in my four years in the league is when you are out there, you have to compete."" The only drama in the latter stages of the fourth quarter was whether Rondo would eclipse franchise and career marks for assists. He broke Chris Paul's mark with his 22nd assist and set a new personal best with his 25th, then came to the bench to a standing ovation and a congratulatory handshake from Gentry. TIP-INS Nets: Quincy Acy scored 18 points and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson 15 points. ... The Nets fell to 5-12 on the road. ... Brooklyn shot 19-of-38 (50 percent) from 3-point range. Pelicans: Davis was 4-for-4 from 3-point range, and the Pelicans went 17-of-33 (51.5 percent) from deep overall. ... Injured small forward Solomon Hill, who has been away from the club in Los Angeles while rehabilitating from surgery to repair an offseason hamstring tear, attended the game and sat on the bench in street clothes. It remains unclear when he'll be cleared to play, but when the season began, he was not expected back until February.","400975257"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Oklahoma City Thunder are having fun playing basketball and that's translating into a long winning streak. Paul George went 7 of 10 from 3-point range -- tying the Thunder record for 3s in a game -- and scored 33 points and Russell Westbrook added 30 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds as Oklahoma City won its sixth straight game, beating the red-hot Toronto Raptors 124-107 on Wednesday night. Carmelo Anthony and Steven Adams had 18 points each for Oklahoma City, which is 12-3 in December and is five games over .500 after an 8-12 start. The Thunder are alone in second place in the Northwest Division, two games behind Minnesota. ""The biggest thing is on the court, we're expecting to win,"" George said. ""That just changes really everything, your whole outlook stepping into a game, to preparation, to getting each other ready. We're just stepping on that floor and we're expecting to win."" The Thunder won despite being on the wrong end of a 23-2 run in the first half, during which the Raptors built a 12-point lead in the second quarter. C.J. Miles led the Raptors with 20 points, while Jonas Valanciunas added 16 and DeMar DeRozan had 15. Kyle Lowry went 3 of 10 from the field but had a double-double with 13 points and 10 assists. Toronto entered the game as the hottest team in the Eastern Conference, but lost its second game in as many nights and fell to 10-3 in December. Miles went 6 of 12 from 3-point range but the Raptors otherwise struggled from behind the arc, finishing 11 of 38. The Thunder posted a sizable 52-34 edge in rebounding. ""We ran into a well-oiled machine tonight,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. ""We had stretches but just didn't have the juice or the energy to come in. It's a difficult part -- two in a row. We should hurt, we should be down, be upset that we lost two in a row. We didn't earn either game. We didn't earn last night the way we played and we didn't earn the game tonight in the stretches we played bad. We've got to put a full game together."" Oklahoma City rallied to take a 66-63 halftime lead and outscored Toronto 18-10 over the final 5:41 of the third quarter. The Thunder went up 102-88 on a late 3-pointer by Raymond Felton, then pulled away in the fourth quarter, their lead peaking at 117-96 with 4:47 left on a 3-pointer by George . ""We played like crap,"" DeRozan said. ""As a team. Down the line individually. And it showed."" Oklahoma City jumped to a 32-23 lead with 2:30 left in the first quarter, but the Raptors seized control with a 23-2 run and led 46-34 after Deion Wright's three-point play with 9:55 left in the half. The Thunder rebounded to take a seven-point lead before settling for a 66-63 halftime lead. ""We just stuck to the game plan,"" George said. ""We knew we needed to be more aggressive. That wasn't how we wanted to end that first quarter after we played so well (to start). We knew we had to kick it up another notch. That's a really good, explosive offensive team. We just couldn't allow them to get comfortable."" TIP-INS: Raptors: Serge Ibaka, a fan favorite during his seven seasons for the Thunder before being traded in June 2016, received a hearty ovation during pre-game introductions and waved to the crowd. ... The Raptors went 24 of 26 from the free-throw line, with Jakob Poeltl responsible for both misses. ... Lucas Nogueira got in the game late in the fourth quarter, after missing the previous 11 games with a right calf injury.

The Raptors' 38 points were the most in the first quarter by a Thunder opponent this season. ... The game was delayed about 3 minutes in the third quarter after a small electrical fire by one of the catwalks at Chesapeake Energy Arena. QUOTABLE: George, on the brief delay due to the electrical fire: ""We were on fire. The roof was on fire. I think we had something to do with that. . The energy was amazing. From the energy we generated on the floor to the fans giving us energy to keep going. It was too much energy -- lights were blowing out."" NEXT UP: Raptors: Host Atlanta on Friday.

"Vince Carter nets 24 points on 83 percent shooting, the second highest percentage of his career, to lead the Kings to a victory over the Cavaliers. (0:44) SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Vince Carter delivered a big performance for the Sacramento Kings. Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue wasn't surprised. Not one bit. Carter scored a season-high 24 points, and the Kings handed the Cavaliers their second straight loss with a 109-95 victory on Wednesday night. ""He's always been a guy, big stage, big moment, that's been his time to shine,"" said Lue, who faced Carter during his playing days. ""Couldn't stop him tonight. He had it going."" The 40-year-old Carter had missed the previous three games due to a rib injury and coach's decision. The former dunk king gave Cleveland all kinds of problems in his return, shooting 10 of 12 in 30 minutes. It was the first time in NBA history that a 40-plus-year-old reserve scored at least 20 points in a game, according to the Kings. ""The shot was falling tonight but it was our ball movement, and the ball found the open guy,"" Carter said. ""It just made it fun to watch. If we play that way we could be a pretty good basketball team."" Carter made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to give Sacramento an 85-80 lead heading into the fourth quarter. He connected again from long range to make it 101-87 with 5:38 left, and then made a 16-foot double-pump shot over Jae Crowder before leaving to a standing ovation with 20.1 seconds left. ""He had some bombs,"" Cleveland's LeBron James said. ""Once he got going, we couldn't slow him down."" James had 16 points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists for the Cavs, and Kevin Love scored 23 points. Cleveland was coming off a 99-92 loss at Golden State on Christmas Day, stopping the Cavaliers' 26-game streak with 100 points or more. Cleveland had not dropped consecutive games since a four-game slide from Oct. 25-Nov. 1. ""They out-scrapped us,"" Lue said. ""They changed their lineup. We didn't prepare for that but that's no excuse."" James cited the team's transition defense as the primary reason for its loss to Golden State. This time it was an inconsistent offense and a big night by Carter that did in the reigning Eastern Conference champs. Cleveland has lost three of four after winning 18 of the previous 19. ""We had zero rhythm,"" James said. ""Had some early in the first, had some in the third when we cut the lead but other than that we just didn't have rhythm."" Willie Cauley-Stein had 17 points and nine rebounds for Sacramento, and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 16 points and eight assists. Zach Randolph had 14 points and seven boards. WAITING ON I.T. Isaiah Thomas' long-awaited debut for Cleveland was held off for at least for another game. The veteran point guard, who is coming back from a right hip injury, worked out before the loss and there was speculation he might play against the Kings before being ruled out. Lue left open the possibility that he could be activated for Saturday's game in Utah. BENCH COMES THROUGH Carter wasn't the only Sacramento reserve that came up big. Cauley-Stein was a rebound shy of a double-double while Bogdanovic shot 6 of 9 with three 3s. ""We had a lot more zip to us tonight,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""You don't beat a team like that without having everybody contribute, and they did."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cleveland had won five of the last six against the Kings. Unlike the first game between the teams this season when the Cavs rallied in the second half to win, Lue's team was outscored 47-40 in the second half. Kings: Rookie Frank Mason scored four points in his first start of the season as part of Joerger's decision to go with a small lineup against the bigger Cavs. Malachi Richardson also made his first career start and also scored four points.","400975259"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Even after his Golden State Warriors scored 42 points in the third quarter, coach Steve Kerr was most pleased with their defense. ""I thought the defense in the third quarter was tremendous, triggered our offense,"" Kerr said. ""There was a different energy in the building in the second half."" Kevin Durant scored 21 points, Draymond Green flirted with his second straight triple-double and the Warriors used that big third quarter to zoom past the Utah Jazz, 126-101 on Wednesday night for their 13th win in 14 games. The game was the 10th straight the defending NBA champs played without two-time MVP Stephen Curry, sidelined by a sprained right ankle. The team redefined itself, Kerr said, and won nine of them. ""I love what we've become, morphing into this defensive juggernaut,"" he said. Durant, who blocked three shots and has swatted at least two in 10 straight games, said the team knew life would be different without Curry. But the Warriors held teams to an average of 95.2 points during the stretch. ""Defensively is where we kind of knuckled down because we knew offense was going to be a little tougher,"" Durant said. Durant also said he expects Curry to be back soon. He is scheduled to scrimmage 5-on-5 on Thursday and will be evaluated Friday before the Warriors' game against Charlotte. ""I see the look in his eyes and I know he's ready to play,"" Durant said. The game was the first between the teams since the Warriors' four-game playoff sweep in the Western Conference semifinals last spring, winning each game by double digits. Green finished with 14 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in three quarters, two nights after tying the franchise career record with his 20th triple-double. Patrick McCaw added 18 points. Jazz coach Quin Snyder wasn't surprised by the way Golden State came out after halftime. ""They're the best team in the league in the third quarter,"" he said. ""We didn't turn it over, but we had some breakdowns. They're a team, if you make a mistake they'll make you pay."" The Warriors' 42-22 margin in the quarter marked the fifth time this season they have outscored an opponent by at least 20 points in the third period. Rodney Hood scored 26 for Utah. TIP-INS Jazz: C Rudy Gobert (left PCL strain and bone bruise) missed his seventh straight game. ""They're different because Gobert's out,"" Kerr said. ""That changes everything."" . G Raul Neto (concussion) was sidelined for the ninth straight game . Rookie Nazareth Mitrou-Long received nine stitches above his left eye Tuesday night after a late-game collision with the Nuggets' Trey Lyles. He did not play Wednesday.

Durant has averaged 29.0 points, 8.6 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 3.1 blocked shots in the 10 games the Warriors played without Curry . Center Zaza Pachulia, who missed eight games with shoulder soreness, started for the first time since Dec. 6. 2-MINUTE DEBATE The day after the NBA acknowledged four missed calls in the final two minutes of the Warriors-Cavaliers game on Christmas Day, Green called the practice of releasing the two-minute officiating reports ""pointless."" The league acknowledged that game officials missed three fouls on Durant and one on LeBron James. Green was critical of the reports, suggesting, ""It makes no sense. Like, LeBron can't go back and get the play over and get the two free throws. So who does it help?"" Kerr, declining to be drawn into the debate, said he appreciates the league's transparency, but added, ""I haven't looked it at all year.""","400975260"
"LOS ANGELES --  Tyreke Evans started his career by being voted the NBA's Rookie of the Year in 2010 after averaging 20.1 points for Sacramento. The next six years were difficult. He battled knee problems and missed games, and his scoring average plummeted to 10.3 points per game last season. But Evans is finding his game again with Memphis, which the Lakers could attest to after he scored 32 points Wednesday night to lead the Grizzlies to a 109-99 victory over Los Angeles. ""He's really good,"" said Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff. ""He's been given an opportunity here that he hasn't been given in a while, probably not since his rookie year in Sacramento. ""We're depending on him to do everything. We all know he has the ability to score but his playmaking is huge because it gives his teammates confidence."" Evans has taken over the starting point guard spot for the injured Mike Conley, and Wednesday he added seven assists and seven rebounds. Jarell Martin added 20 points for the Grizzlies, who had lost four of five and were coming off their loss in Phoenix a night earlier on Tyson Chandler's dunk with 0.4 seconds left. Andrew Harrison scored 15 and Deyonta Davis had 14. The Lakers, who were again playing without rookie point guard Lonzo Ball, lost their fourth straight. Brandon Ingram scored 23 points, but the Lakers shot only 37.6 from the field and were just 21 of 33 from the free throw line. ""I just didn't feel like we were making the extra pass consistently and Memphis did a really good job of being physical with us and they clogged up the paint,"" said Lakers coach Luke Walton. The Grizzlies blocked nine shots. Marc Gasol had three alone with his 11 points, nine rebounds and five assists as Memphis bounced back from the loss in Phoenix. ""It's just the way it is, you have no choice,"" Gasol said. ""You kind of lick your wounds and move on to the next game.""

Bickerstaff said he wasn't concerned how his team would respond after losing to the Suns on the late lob: ""It's frustration, but this team is resilient. It's a tough group mentally."" Lakers: Ingram was cleared to play after missing the past two games with a right quad bruise and left quad tendinitis. With Ball missing his second consecutive game with a left shoulder sprain, Walton was grateful to get Ingram back. Said Walton: ""He's the best we have at putting pressure on the rim."" EVANS ROLLING He has started in his last 15 games and now leads the Grizzlies with a 19.4 scoring average. ""The coach tells me to be aggressive and it helps to look for your teammates, and that's what I was trying to do every chance I got,"" Evans said. ""I was going downhill, attacking and finding open guys."" KUZMA OFF Rookie Kyle Kuzma had been on an offensive roll. He scored 31 points on Christmas against the Timberwolves, connecting on 6 of 11 3-pointers. But against the Grizzlies, he was just 4 of 24 from the field, going 1 of 11 from 3-point range. ""He shot short some of the threes,"" Gasol said. ""Most of them were good looks for him, I guess. It happens. It's part of the NBA. You have better shooting nights, worse shooting nights, and you just have to be OK with the shots you've taken."" NEXT UP Grizzlies: Visit Golden State on Saturday.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic got their first win in more than three weeks thanks to major contributions from some unlikely sources. Point guard Elfrid Payton and reserve centers Bismack Biyombo and Marreese Speights teamed up to spark the Magic to a 102-89 victory over Detroit that ended a nine-game losing streak. Payton had 19 points, eight assists and eight rebounds, while Biyombo and Speights combined for 28 points and 18 rebounds as subs for injured starting center Nikola Vucevic. Evan Fournier scored 17 points and Aaron Gordon had 14 for Orlando, but it was the Magic's backup centers who made the difference in the game. ""The last couple of games it's been about other guys trying to pick up the scoring load,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""Biz and Mo were both great tonight. We had our best passing game in a few weeks and it resulted in better shooting. ""And that stretch toward the end of the third quarter and into the fourth where the ball was really moving, the guys were not looking to force things and we got the payoff."" Speights helped the Magic seize control of the game at the end of the third period and start of the fourth. He scored Orlando's last nine points in the third quarter, nailed a 3-pointer to start the fourth quarter, then handed out an assist D.J. Augustin for another 3-pointer as the Magic turned a five-point deficit into an 86-73 lead. ""When you're in this league, you have to find something you're really good at and that's something I think I'm good at,"" Speights said after scoring 16 points and grabbing five rebounds. ""Now that (Vucevic) is out, I know I'm going to get the opportunity to play every night. So when you know you'll get to play, your routine can be good and you'll have confidence."" The Pistons, who rallied successfully from double-digit deficits early in the game, never got closer than eight points in the final nine minutes of the game. Tobias Harris scored 21 points for Detroit, which had won five of six. Andre Drummond had 17 points and 18 rebounds, and Ish Smith contributed 13 points, seven rebounds and five assists. But Detroit was slow at both ends of the court in the fourth quarter. The Pistons didn't cover the 3-point line at all and Orlando punished them with five 3-pointers in the final period. At the offensive end, Detroit hit just five of 20 shots (25 percent) and got outscored 25-16. Detroit's reserves were just 3 for 22 from the field for the game. ""We don't need everybody to have great nights, but we can't have that many guys have that bad a night and think we're going to get wins,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""I didn't think many of the guys brought very good energy."" TIP-INS Pistons: PG Reggie Jackson, who had a season-high 13 assists in the win over Indiana on Tuesday, suffered a Grade 3 ankle sprain in the third quarter of that game and will miss six to eight weeks. Smith has replaced him in the lineup. ... The Pistons have lost four of their last five games against Orlando. Magic: Gordon returned to the lineup after missing the last five games and seven of the last eight. ... Mario Hezonja hit 8 of 12 3-pointers the last time Orlando played Detroit. He is 4 of 17 from behind the line in the five games since. ... The Magic were 17 of 17 from the free throw line, a franchise record for most free throws in a game without a miss.","400975262"
"A pair of offensive fouls from James Harden in the final 10 seconds set up Al Horford's go-ahead basket as the Celtics steal a win with a 26-point comeback, which is the largest comeback in the NBA this season. (1:02) BOSTON --  Marcus Smart helped complete a furious comeback for Boston on two plays he never touched the ball. Smart drew an offensive foul on James Harden with 7.3 seconds left, getting the ball back in time for Al Horford to sink a hook shot with 3.7 seconds left, and the Celtics rallied from a 26-point deficit to beat Houston 99-98 on Thursday night. ""It just shows the value of Marcus Smart to our group and what he does for our team. It all started with him in the second half,"" Horford said. ""It was just a domino effect. That's how special he is. And when he plays at that level we're just a different team."" After Horford's shot, Smart did it again when he drew another foul on Harden and the Rockets ran out of time. Kyrie Irving scored 26 and Jayson Tatum finished with 19 for the Celtics, who held Houston to just nine field goals in the second half while tying the largest comeback in the NBA this season. ""I've had a few comebacks, but this is a special one. From just how we started, it was just so ugly,"" Irving said. ""They came out firing. We just had to battle back. It took a lot. It took everybody."" Smart and Terry Rozier had 13 points apiece and Horford finished with nine points and eight rebounds. Tatum made a layup with seven seconds left to pull the Celtics within 98-97, then Smart had position on Harden for an offensive foul that gave Boston the ball. Horford converted from the lane to put Boston up for the first time in a game Houston had led throughout and dominated until midway through the third quarter. Harden finished with 34 points and 10 assists. Eric Gordon scored 24 points for Houston, which shot 25 percent in the second half and lost its fourth straight. ""It was the tale of two halves,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We were kind of like them in the first half and they were like us in the second."" The Rockets had one last chance after Horford's go-ahead hook shot, but Harden was called for another offensive foul and time expired after Horford missed his second free throw. Houston opened the game on a 12-0 run and led 62-38 at halftime. After committing six turnovers in the first half, Houston had seven in the third quarter and Boston capitalized by outscoring the Rockets 31-16. Irving scored 12 in the third quarter as Boston picked up its defense, holding Houston to just four field goals in the period. Boston got within a point a couple times in the fourth, but couldn't quite catch the Rockets until the final seconds. After Smart drove for a layup and pulled Boston within 96-95 with 13.5 seconds left, Harden drew a foul and made both free throws to put the lead back at three. Rather than going for the 3-pointer, Boston went to Tatum for another layup, then Smart took an offensive foul by Harden on the inbounds play. ""You know they were going to deny the ball and we knew that,"" Gordon said. ""We always have all the guards try to go after the ball, but it's just tough to play basketball toward the end of the game like that when things are going the other way."" Houston's lead was in the 20s for nearly all of the second quarter and much of the third before Boston pulled back within range on a 12-0 run. TIP-INS Rockets: Veteran swingman Gerald Green, who signed a free-agent deal with the Rockets earlier Thursday, finished with two rebounds and no points in 11 minutes. ... The Rockets' 62 points in the first half were the most scored on the Celtics in the first two periods of a game this season. ... Houston point guard Chris Paul missed his third straight game with a groin strain and the Rockets fell to 10-7 without him. ... The Rockets were also without center Clint Capela, who has a right orbital fracture. Celtics: Were just 5 of 19 in the first quarter while scoring 12 points, the second-lowest total for a quarter by the Celtics this season. ... Boston committed eight turnovers in the first quarter. 2-MAN CREW Referee Mark Lindsay missed the game with a sore back, leaving Tony Brothers and Gediminas Petraitis to officiate the game on their own. There were plenty of disputed calls throughout, including one that got Boston coach Brad Stevens and Marcus Morris technicals with 1:56 left in the third. Harden was the most vocal about the officials being down a man for the entire game. ""You can't have two officials in a professional game,"" Harden said. ""There was a lot of no-calls that needed to be called because it changed the dynamic of the game. You got fast-break points, no calls, turnovers or whatever the case may be. This is a professional game on national TV. It can't happen.""","400975263"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks silenced the boos with a big victory. Eric Bledsoe scored 26 points and Giannis Antetokounmpo added 22 points and 10 rebounds to help the Bucks rally from a 20-point deficit and win back their crowd with a 102-96 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday night. ""I didn't hear the boos, but I don't hear the cheers either,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""That's what the fans come to see. The game is about runs."" None were bigger than Bledsoe's final push. Bledsoe had six points and two key assists down the stretch and the Bucks found their missing defense, holding the Timberwolves to a season-low 12 points in the fourth quarter. Minnesota went cold over the last 4:21 and had its five-game winning streak snapped. Bledsoe took a pass from Antetokounmpo and made an open 3-pointer from the corner to give the Bucks their first lead of the game at 95-93 with 2:25 to go. Bledsoe followed with a three-point play and then found Antetokounmpo under the basket for an easy two points, pushing the lead to 100-93 with 1:04 left. Khris Middleton and John Henson added 14 apiece for Milwaukee. Minnesota perhaps wore down a night after a 128-125 overtime victory over Denver and had a four-game road winning streak snapped. Jamal Crawford, who scored 11 points, didn't think that was the case. ""I won't make excuses to be honest with you,"" he said. ""You can say that, but we still built a big enough lead where we should have finished that game."" Karl-Anthony Towns scored 22 points and tied his season high with four 3-pointers for Minnesota. Andrew Wiggins, who was sidelined briefly in the third after turning his ankle, finished with 21. Towns' driving layup gave the Timberwolves a 74-54 lead in the third, but the Bucks used a 21-10 run to end the quarter trailing by five points. The Bucks opened the fourth with a 13-4 run and tied it at 88 on a 3 by Middleton with 7:06 to play. The Timberwolves were without point guard Jeff Teague and had some other bumps and bruises in the second half. ""Once we had the lead up to 20, (Wiggins) sprained his ankle, so that hurt us some,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We had a stretch where Tyrus (Jones) dislocated his finger. So, we didn't play well down the stretch."" Jimmy Butler, who had a season-high 39 points against the Nuggets, finished with 20 points and seven assists. Jones made his fourth start of the season at point guard, filling in for the injured Teague. Teague missed the game with a sprained left knee. He got caught in a scramble of players in the final seconds against the Nuggets and limped off the court. TIP-INS Timberwolves: F Nemanja Bjelica played his third straight game after missing the previous 15 with a sprained foot. He was scoreless. ... Minnesota, one of only four Western Conference teams with a winning road record, slipped to 3-8 against the Eastern Conference and 0-4 against the Central Division. Bucks: The Bucks had six turnovers in the first quarter and four more in the second. ... Milwaukee extended its season-best streak of scoring 100-plus points to 17 games. BUCKS OWN THE PAINT The Bucks outscored the Timberwolves 62-32 in the paint. ""That is their strength,"" Crawford said. ""It's getting to the hole. We should have made them make more outside shots. That falls on us. We knew that going into it. We got to do a better job of that."" ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ""Sometimes you feel you're on the brink of being embarrassed,"" Kidd said. ""So, you tend to turn it up. The guys stayed together. The best part of the night was they kept talking to each other."" BIGGEST COMEBACK WIN The victory was Milwaukee's biggest comeback win of the season. The previous was 14 points down against the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 11.","400975264"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Two nights after playing with a full roster for the first time all season, San Antonio had to adjust yet again. It's not what they want, but the Spurs are used to it. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 25 points and the Spurs beat the New York Knicks 119-107 on Thursday night. Pau Gasol added 17 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists as San Antonio's big men keyed the team's ball movement. ""We've always had an unselfish team that moves the ball, but now we've got to be a little more specific and find the advantages,"" Gasol said. ""That works. Now the defenses have to make choices. If the weak side has to come in, then you swing it to the weak side and now you get open 3s and now you tear them up and that's what I love to do."" The Spurs had 28 assists and just nine turnovers in improving to 17-2 at home and winning their third straight overall. The team effort helped San Antonio overcome playing without Kawhi Leonard and losing Rudy Gay to a foot injury after having a full roster Tuesday night. Leonard sat out for rest. Gay exited the game late in the third quarter with a sore right heel. There was no update on Gay's status. Gasol had 10 points, 10 rebounds and five assists for the fourth straight game. Only reigning MVP Russell Westbrook of Oklahoma City has had a longer streak (five) this season. ""They are the type of team that takes what the defense gives them,"" Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis said. ""They don't force things. That's a nice way to play basketball and I enjoy watching them. Today, they kind of did that to us."" Tony Parker scored 14 points, including 10 in the first quarter as San Antonio bolted to an early lead. ""Tony had a great start,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He's obviously starting to feel pretty good."" The Spurs led by as many as 17 points in an uncharacteristically high-scoring game for them. San Antonio was limiting opponents to 98 points per game, but New York was able to increase the pace. ""It's a hard team to guard,"" Popovich said. ""They move well. They're talented. Jeff (Hornacek, New York coach) got them playing hard. There's a lot of tough covers out there with all the movement. I think it took us the whole half to get used to it."" Reserve forward Michael Beasley led New York with 23 points. Courtney Lee and Porzingis had 18 points apiece, but Porzingis fouled out late in the fourth. Danny Green was 5 for 8, all on 3-pointers, in adding 15 points for the Spurs. ""They were able to, with the 3-pointers and the way they play, they were able to pick us apart a little bit,"" Porzingis said. TIP-INS Knicks: G Tim Hardaway Jr. missed his 14th straight game with a stress injury to his lower left leg. ... The Knicks are 5-9 in back-to-back games this season after losing both games for the third time. Chicago defeated New York 92-87 on Wednesday night. ... Porzingis was averaging 7.0 points in the fourth quarter, third in the league. He had two points in the fourth against the Spurs before fouling out with 2:30 remaining. ... Knicks are 2-12 on the road this season, having won Oct. 29 at Cleveland and Dec. 14 at Brooklyn. Spurs: Leonard was a late scratch from the lineup as his playing time remains limited following his return from a quad injury. It was the fourth time Leonard has sat out for what the Spurs listed as ""return from injury management."" ... Parker has scored in double figures in 930 career games. Among point guards, only Gary Payton (1,035) and John Stockton (1,061) have more games scoring at least 10 points in league history. ... Green is the 127th player in league history with 900 3-pointers. BEHIND HIM Kyle Anderson had 16 points and eight rebounds starting in place of Leonard. Popovich said the fourth-year player's game is reminiscent of former Spurs reserve Boris Diaw. ""It's in the same ilk, for sure,"" Popovich said. ""Boris had a little bit more experience and he had that post-up game to go with it with that big booty, but Kyle plays the same way. He understands what's going on on the court, moves the basketball and gets things done."" GREAT MOMENT New York rookie Frank Ntilikina had a season-high 11 assists. Accomplishing the feat in front of Parker, his childhood hero, was especially meaningful for 19-year-old from France. ""(Parker) told me he was happy for me and happy for what I'm doing,"" Ntilikina said. ""Hearing that from someone I was watching as I grew up, it's a blessing.""","400975265"
"Joel Embiid hits a 3-pointer from way downtown to make it a three-point game. (0:23) PORTLAND, Ore. --  Shabazz Napier was struggling so much against the Philadelphia 76ers that Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts sat him early in the third quarter. Good thing for Portland that Napier returned in time for the fourth. Napier, who started for injured guard Damian Lillard, scored 15 of his season-high 23 points in the fourth quarter and the Trail Blazers rallied for 114-110 victory Thursday night. ""The good thing about basketball is they say you've got the next game, but you always have two halves,"" Napier said. ""I felt like I was kind of lethargic out there in the first half and I felt like basically it can't get any worse, so I just went out there and tried to be positive."" CJ McCollum led all scorers with 34 for the Blazers, who snapped a six-game losing streak at home. Portland had a season-high 42 points in the fourth quarter. The Sixers, who led by as many as 18 points in the third quarter, have lost 10 of their last 12 games. Joel Embiid finished with 29 points and nine rebounds, while Dario Saric had 25 points and nine rebounds. The 76ers were hurt when Robert Covington went out in the third quarter with an injured finger on his left hand. ""It's a disappointing loss. We had an opportunity without Damian being here. I give them credit. They did not roll over,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We gave up 18 points when Covington went out. We really missed him, but we give them credit."" JJ Redick and Embiid made consecutive 3-pointers to narrow the gap to 103-99 with 2:06 left. Jusuf Nurkic had a pair of free throws before McCollum's pull-up jumper and it appeared the game was out of reach, but Embiid made another 3 that got the Sixers within 109-105 with 16 seconds left. McCollum made free throws with 3.4 seconds to go before Embiid added another 3-pointer to make it 111-108, but the Sixers weren't able to catch up. Nurkic finished with 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Portland won its fourth straight against the Sixers at the Moda Center. Napier scored 22 points after halftime. Lillard missed his third game with a strained right hamstring. Portland's top scorer, averaging 25.2 points per game, was injured in a 102-85 loss to San Antonio on Dec.  20. Lillard warmed up a couple of hours before the game and didn't appear hampered by the injury. On the other side, Embiid was questionable for the game with back tightness, but played. The 76ers were coming off a 105-98 victory over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Christmas that snapped a five-game losing streak. Nurkic made a layup with nine seconds left to give Portland a 52-51 lead at halftime. But he was furious in the third quarter when officials did not stop the game when he had a bloody nose. He collected his fourth foul before heading for the locker room. Nurkic knocked heads with Redick, who appeared to have a cut lip. Nurkic said he was angry. ""The more I get mad I play better,"" he said. ""I'm not saying every game `Hit me in the nose' but I just need to play with the same energy every game like this."" The Sixers stretched the lead to 75-59 with five minutes left in the quarter, outscoring Portland 24-7. But Ed Davis capped a 10-1 Portland run with a dunk to pull the Blazers to 79-70. Napier had a personal 7-0 run to close the gap to 88-81. Jerryd Bayless made a 3-pointer on the other end -- but it was later ruled no good because of a shot clock violation. Napier made two of three free throws and Nurkic added two more, before Napier's layup got the Blazers within 88-87. TIP INS 76ers: The Sixers beat the Blazers 101-81 in Philadelphia on Nov. 22. Embiid had 28 points and 12 rebounds in that one. ... Embiid had six 3-pointers. Trail Blazers: Portland is just 7-10 at home this season, but 10-6 on the road. Asked before the game if he'd ever been on a team with that kind of record disparity at home, coach Terry Stotts said simply ""No."" QUOTABLE: ""We just need to be accountable. We need to hold each other accountable for everything. I think that's what it comes down to. Making sure we stay on top of each other and make sure we're getting better.

"WASHINGTON --  The Houston Rockets won 25 of their first 29 games to notch the NBA's best record, then quickly entered their worst tailspin in nearly five years. Otto Porter Jr. scored 26 points, Bradley Beal and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 21 each, and the Washington Wizards beat the Rockets 121-103 Friday night for Houston's fifth straight loss. It's the longest skid for the Rockets since dropping seven straight from Jan. 9-19, 2013. NBA scoring leader James Harden matched his season low with 20 points for the Rockets. Chris Paul returned after missing three games with a strained groin and had eight points and six assists in 26 minutes. Houston had completed a 14-game winning streak before the alarming slide. ""We just haven't had a rhythm in these last five games, quite frankly,"" Harden said. ""We had pretty good spurts, but just a consistent, four-quarter game, we haven't had that. So hopefully we get back home and kind of buckle down a little bit."" A night after blowing a 26-point lead in Boston, the Rockets held their last lead midway through the first quarter en route to their worst defeat of the season. Houston has by far the most 3-pointers in the league this season but was held to 29.2 percent (14 for 48) from deep. Though Paul was back, the Rockets were missing center Clint Capela with an orbital fracture for the second straight game. ""Mentally we're fine,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We've got some tired legs and missing the big guy in the middle to give us a force to the rim. ... We've got all kinds of excuses, but that doesn't work. It doesn't matter. We lost. They won.

"TORONTO --  DeMar DeRozan washed away the sting of back-to-back road losses by leading the Toronto Raptors to another home victory. DeRozan scored 25 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 13 points and 11 rebounds, and the Raptors beat the Atlanta Hawks 111-98 on Friday night for their 11th straight win at Air Canada Centre. ""It's always great to bounce back after one loss, especially two in a row, to come back home, get back in our groove of things and get that feeling of winning back,"" DeRozan said. Toronto is 13-1 at home this season, best in the NBA. The Raptors are one win away from matching the longest home winning streak in franchise history, set between Jan. 18 and Mar. 6, 2016. ""It just means everything when we can be able to continue to do what we've been doing at home,"" DeRozan said. ""We've got to use that as our backbone."" Kyle Lowry scored 12 points, Delon Wright had 13 and Jakob Poeltl added 10 rebounds as Toronto finished December at 11-3, its best record ever in the month. Toronto snapped a two-game skid despite the absence of forward Serge Ibaka, who the Raptors suspended for one game following an altercation with a team staff member after Wednesday's loss at Oklahoma City. The Raptors lost at Dallas on Tuesday. Casey would not share details of the incident involving Ibaka but said the player and staffer had apologized to one another. Casey said the situation had been ""resolved."" ""It went over the limit and we've handled it,"" Casey said before the game. The Raptors have lost consecutive games three times this season but have yet to lose three in a row. ""That's what good teams do,"" Lowry said. ""You don't let a couple losses set you back from your long-term goal."" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said the Raptors looked hungry for a win. ""I think they picked up their energy and their aggressiveness,"" Budenholzer said. Taurean Prince had a career-high 30 points and 10 rebounds, but Atlanta's two-game winning streak ended. The Hawks posted consecutive victories for the first time this season by beating Dallas on Dec. 23 and Washington on Dec. 27. ""You're always disappointed when you lose but I think we competed for most of the game,"" Atlanta guard Dennis Schroder said.

"MIAMI --  Brooklyn took out two years of frustration on Miami, and did it in the span of about two quarters. Joe Harris scored a career-high 21 points, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 18 and Brooklyn simply embarrassed Miami 111-87 on Friday night, matching the biggest win any Nets team ever enjoyed over the Heat. The final score hardly showed how bad it was for Miami. The Heat led 18-8 early, then were outscored 85-37 over the next 28 minutes. Brooklyn led by 20 at the half, then pushed the margin to 38 late in the third and beat Miami for the first time since Dec. 28, 2015. ""Great job by the guys being ready,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Even at halftime you knew the Heat were going to come out with a lot of energy and we responded again. We didn't have a bad quarter defensively."" Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen each had 12 points for the Nets. LeVert added a career-best 11 assists.

We have a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde quality to us that's extremely perplexing. Sometimes we compete at an extremely high level. You can see it, you can feel it. And then we have these games that are unexplainable."" Josh Richardson scored 19 points and Hassan Whiteside added 17 for Miami. The Heat shot 3 for 26 from 3-point range, and 34 percent from the field overall -- the team's second-worst rate at home in the last 10 years. ""We've got to be better,"" Richardson said. The Heat started on an 8-0 run. That ended their list of achievements for the evening. Brooklyn scored 13 unanswered points, grabbed the lead by the end of the first quarter and never relented. ""We weren't perfect but we were more perfect than the other night,"" Atkinson said, referring to Brooklyn's Wednesday loss at New Orleans. ""The challenge for us is to do it more consistently. That's what we're searching for."" It was the fifth time this season the Heat trailed by as many as 30 in a game -- none of the previous margins as big as the 38-pointer the Nets enjoyed in this one. Spoelstra angrily called a timeout in the first quarter when Quincy Acy was left all alone for a 3-pointer, one that cut Miami's lead to 18-15. Even then, he could see trouble ahead. ""That possession was a microcosm of the entire game,"" Spoelstra said. ""The lack of urgency to get back, to scramble, to make a multiple effort. There's an open guy, let him shoot.

"CHICAGO --  Nikola Mirotic came in and started firing away. Lauri Markkanen took over for Chicago in the second half. The sharp-shooting big men just overwhelmed the Indiana Pacers. Markkanen scored a career-high 32 points, Mirotic finished with 28 and the surging Bulls beat the Pacers 119-107 on Friday night for their third consecutive win. ""We just keep believing in each other and playing for each other,"" Markkanen said. Led by Mirotic and Markkanen, Chicago made 18 of 39 3-point attempts in its 10th win in 12 games. Robin Lopez and Bobby Portis each scored 12 points, helping the Bulls to their seventh straight victory at home for their longest such streak since a seven-game run spanning two seasons in 2013. It was the first meeting between the teams since Indiana erased a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter of a 98-96 victory on Dec. 6. It was one of the low points so far this season for suddenly interesting Bulls (13-22), and they gained a measure of revenge by turning away another charge by the Pacers in the final period. ""Really since the last time we played Indiana on the road, when we had that devastating loss, our guys have really kind of found themselves, found each other,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. Darren Collison scored 30 points for Indiana (19-17), which has dropped three in a row and four of six. Lance Stephenson had 18 points and nine rebounds, and Domantas Sabonis finished with 14 points and nine boards. ""The effort was there sometimes, it just wasn't there for a whole 48 minutes,"" Collison said. ""We've got to do better, but we can't keep saying that. At some point we've got to just go out there and do it."" Stephenson started in place of Victor Oladipo, who missed his second straight game because of a sore right knee and is doubtful for Sunday's matchup with Minnesota. Oladipo, who is averaging a team-high 24.9 points in his first season with the Pacers, had an MRI that showed no structural damage. ""Basically what we've learned from that is that he needs some time,"" coach Nate McMillan said. ""There's some swelling."" The Bulls also played without a key guard after Kris Dunn was scratched with left knee tendinitis. But Jerian Grant had 11 points, 12 assists and seven rebounds after he found out right before the game that he was in the starting lineup. ""I've started games before so it wasn't too big of an adjustment,"" Grant said. ""I was ready."" Chicago opened a 103-84 lead on David Nwaba's layup with 7:46 left. Indiana then ripped off 11 of the next 14 points to close to 106-95 on Stephenson's basket with 4:49 remaining. But Mirotic responded with a layup and Markkanen hit two free throws to run the Bulls' lead back out to 15. BOUNCEBACK GAME Mirotic had a season-low four points on 2-for-4 shooting in Wednesday night's 92-87 win over the New York Knicks. But he made three 3-pointers in the first quarter on his way to 17 first-half points against Indiana. ""It's all about being consistent now,"" Mirotic said. ""That's my goal. That's been something I've been struggling (with) the last couple years."" TIP-INS Pacers: Stephenson was 8 for 19 from the field. He has scored in double figures in five of his last six games. ... Turner has at least one block in 27 of his 29 games this season. Bulls: Mirotic went 8 for 16 from 3-point range. Markkanen was 5 for 9 from beyond the arc. ... G Zach LaVine, who is coming back from left knee surgery, worked out Thursday and Friday. He is scheduled for six straight days of contact beginning on Saturday, including four days with Chicago's G League affiliate. ""Obviously it's a very important part of the process for Zach,"" Hoiberg said, ""and hopefully everything goes great, and you know we'll kind of take it from there.""","400975270"
"NEW ORLEANS --  The New Orleans Pelicans entered the game as the NBA's top 3-point shooting team. They couldn't match the Dallas Mavericks' long-range shooting Friday night. Rookie guard Dennis Smith Jr. had his first career triple-double and the Mavericks made a franchise-record 22 3-pointers in a 128-120 victory. ""We got into a shot-making groove,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. Smith had 21 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. He was 5 of 7 from 3-point range and 8 of 12 overall. ""I almost had a quadruple-double because I had a lot of turnovers (seven),"" Smith said. ""My teammates picked me up and told me to keep playing. My jump shot was falling tonight and that opened things up for everyone else."" Wesley Matthews made 4 of 7 3-pointers and scored 18 points, and Devin Harris hit 5 of 7 3-pointers and added 17 points to help Dallas win three consecutive games for the first time this season. Dwight Powell scored 15 points, J.J. Barea had 14 and Harrison Barnes and Dirk Nowitzki 13 each. ""We're the epitome of a team that needs each other,"" Carlisle said of the balanced scoring. Anthony Davis led the Pelicans with 33 points. DeMarcus Cousins had 32 points and 20 rebounds, Jrue Holiday added 23 points, and E'Twaun Moore had 16. ""We didn't play with any physicality,"" Davis said. ""They got easy layups, easy threes, a lot of dare shots in. They started getting hot because we allowed them to. We have to lock in defensively every night and the rest will take care of itself."" At 20 years, 34 days, Smith became the third-youngest player in NBA history to have a triple-double, behind Lonzo Ball and LeBron James. The Mavericks made 13 of 18 3-pointers as they built a 17-point halftime lead. ""You can't give up 22 3s and you can't have them shoot 55 percent from the field and 56 from 3 and think you're going to win,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""You give up 77 in the first half, you're going to put yourself in harm's way."" Holiday led a New Orleans push late in the third quarter, scoring seven of the Pelicans' last 11 points in the period. That cut the Mavericks lead to 109-101 after three quarters. Holiday made two free throws to cut the deficit to six at the outset of the fourth quarter, but Yogi Ferrell made a 3-pointer to give the Mavericks a 118-107 lead midway through the fourth. Davis scored six consecutive points as New Orleans got within 118-115 with 3:38 left. Nowitzki and Davis each made two free throws before Barea made consecutive 3-pointers to give Dallas a 126-117 lead with 1:57 left. ""We moved the ball really well,' Harris said. ""We didn't care who shot it. We gave up good shots to get better ones."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas had its highest-scoring first half of the season. ... The Mavericks' bench outscored the Pelicans' backups 60-10. ... Dallas' third consecutive victory gave it its longest winning streak of the season. Pelicans: The Pelicans' longest winning streak of the season ended at three for the third time. ... New Orleans committed just eight turnovers compared to 18 for the Mavericks. ...

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Even though he stepped out of bounds on the play, Giannis Antetokounmpo's basket with 1.3 seconds left counted, and that's all that mattered to the Milwaukee Bucks. Antetokounmpo scored 23 points -- including what proved to be a questionable game-winning basket which he scored over Russell Westbrook- and the Bucks ended Oklahoma City's six-game winning streak, beating the Thunder 97-95 on Friday night. Replays clearly showed Antetokounmpo stepped on the baseline on his drive. After a desperation heave by Westbrook fell short, Thunder coach Billy Donovan and several of his players pleaded for a review, but officials Derek Stafford, Ben Taylor and Leon Wood refused. Stafford later told a pool reporter that the play wasn't reviewable. ""In any reviewable matter, there has to be a whistle called on the floor,"" Stafford said. ""There was no whistle blown for the play, so we couldn't review it."" Donovan said the official told him they couldn't' review the play. ""I look at things totally differently,"" Donovan said. ""The league and the officials have to deal with that. That's what they're in control of or not. I'm more concerned about the fact that we didn't play well in the first quarter. There were some things that we needed to do better. Obviously, he stepped out of bounds. Everybody knows that. I did not get a chance to personally see the replay. I was trying to ask for a review. They couldn't review it, but that's something they have to deal with and the league has to deal with. I think the things I try to focus on is, what do we have to do to get better?"" Antetokounmpo said he hadn't yet seen the replay and wasn't aware that he'd stepped out of bounds. ""It was his ball to come up with a play for himself or make a play for someone else and we did the right thing,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said of Antetokounmpo's basket. ""I don't understand the whole protest. I can only worry about the score and then them trying to put time on the clock, getting the guys prepared to have a last-second play."" Westbrook led Oklahoma City with 40 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists and hit a game-tying 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds left. The Thunder had gone 11-3 in December before playing Friday without one of its stars, Paul George, who sat out with left knee soreness. Thunder players and their coach seemed resigned to their fate. ""I guess we'll see something on the ticker that says the referees missed that one,"" said Carmelo Anthony, who scored 12 points. ""We can't do nothing about that at this point, so we might as well forget about it and move on and get ready for ... who do we play Sunday? Dallas? Get ready for Dallas."" Khris Middleton scored 20 points and John Henson added 18 points for the Bucks, who completed a sweep of the Northwest Division's top two teams on consecutive nights. Milwaukee rallied from 20 points down in the third quarter on Thursday to beat Minnesota, then jumped to a 22-point first-half lead against Oklahoma City and held on. Oklahoma City had won four straight home games against Milwaukee and five of their last six overall against the Bucks, but the Thunder started the game by making just one of their first eight shots as the Bucks raced to a 16-2 lead. Milwaukee led 41-19 less than 30 seconds into the second quarter. Oklahoma City cut its deficit to 58-44 by halftime and pulled within 65-62 on Josh Huestis' 3-pointer with 4:33 left in the third quarter, but Westbrook missed a 3-point attempt that would have tied the game. Oklahoma City was within 76-69 with 10:47 left, but Middleton scored seven straight points to rebuild Milwaukee's lead to 14 points. The Thunder made one last run, tying the game at 95 on Westbrook's 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds left. TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee's streak of scoring 100 or more points ended at 17 games, its longest since doing so in 22 straight games in the 1986-87 season ... The Bucks' 38 points tied the most by a Thunder opponent in the first quarter this season, matching Toronto, which did so Wednesday. ... Eric Bledsoe committed four first-half fouls in eight minutes ... Antetokounmpo, who also had 12 rebounds, has 17 double-doubles this season. Thunder: Alex Abrines started in place of George. It was Abrines' fifth start of the season, but he was scoreless in 10 first-half minutes. Josh Huestis started the second half in his place. ... Westbrook scored his 16,000th career point, making him the 112th NBA player to do so.","400975272"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Phoenix coach Jay Triano's decision to move Devin Booker to point guard late in the fourth quarter worked out perfectly for the struggling Suns. A big night from T.J. Warren helped too, especially when Booker's own shot was off most of the game. Booker scored 13 of his 26 points over the final five minutes, Warren added a double-double and Phoenix came back to beat the Sacramento Kings 111-101 on Friday night. Booker missed nine games with a left adductor strain before returning to score 32 against Memphis on Tuesday. He wasn't as crisp against the Kings, shooting 9 of 25 from the field, but helped rally the Suns with his late scoring flurry that keyed a 17-4 run. ""Both of us are just natural scorers but in different ways,"" Booker said of he and Warren. ""Teams usually have one really good defender and sometimes they put it on me, sometimes they put it on him, and the other player gets to attack. It's a good 1-2 punch."" Warren had 26 points and 10 rebounds, Marquese Chriss added 14 points and seven rebounds while Tyson Chandler had six points and 11 rebounds for the Suns. Triano said he put Booker at point guard to free him up more in Phoenix's offense. ""I think he's going to take over anyway, and we want him to do that,"" Triano said. ""The idea is to put shooters around him and you could see how much space there was on the floor when (Troy Daniels) is on the floor and T.J.'s scoring the way that he was."" Phoenix led most of the game but fell behind early in the fourth after Sacramento scored nine consecutive points to go up 97-93. Booker brought the Suns back and scored the final seven points for Phoenix, including a layup past 7-footer Willie Cauley-Stein, a buzzer-beating 15-footer and a 3-pointer. ""He's a special player,"" Chandler said. ""You can see it. Just some players that come into this league that just have it. They're far and few in between, and he's one of those players."" Zach Randolph scored 14 points, Bogdan Bogdanovic had 13 and four others scored 12 apiece for the Kings. Sacramento, which beat Cleveland 109-95 on Wednesday, fell to 2-22 when trailing after three quarters. Phoenix closed the first quarter on a 14-2 run and Warren scored six consecutive points in the second to help the Suns to a 55-46 halftime lead. Warren made his first six shots and had 15 points in the first half. ""I'm really impressed with T.J.'s game,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""He picks his spots out on the court and says, `I'm just bigger than you,"" and then he shoots up over the top."" After Sacramento closed within 71-68 on Hill's two free throws midway through the third, Isaiah Canaan hit a 3-pointer and scored on a layup, and Troy Daniels added a 3 to push Phoenix's lead to 10. DEFENDING Z-BO Randolph scored 11 points in the fourth quarter to rally Sacramento past Phoenix when the two teams played at Golden1 Center on Dec. 12 but was shut out over the final 12 minutes this time around while being defended most of the night by Chriss. ""Zach is a beast and we know that,"" Triano said. ""We need to make him work for every single touch, and Marquese did that."" TIP-INS Suns: Chriss, the Sacramento native who was drafted eighth overall by the Kings in 2016 and traded that night to Phoenix, shot 5 of 6 and made all three of his 3-point attempts. ... Chandler was called for a technical while on the bench in the third quarter. Josh Jackson picked up a technical in the second. . Booker missed six of his first eight shots and had one blocked.

"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Dwight Howard was so good Friday night against the defending NBA champs that acting Charlotte Hornets coach Stephen Silas rode him to the finish line of a 111-100 victory over the Golden State Warriors. ""He was great,"" Silas said after Howard scored a season-high 29 points. ""I couldn't take him out in the second half."" The Hornets won just their third road game of the season. ""They've had a tough go this year,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""They came in and earned it. They took it to us."" Charlotte, beginning a four-game road trip, arrived with a 2-12 record away from home. ""To get this win here against this team the first game of the road trip means a lot,"" Silas said. ""Hopefully, we can carry that forward."" Six Hornets players scored in double figures, led by Howard, who also had 12 rebounds and seven assists. The veteran big man had his way inside, especially when the Warriors tried to defend him with rookie Jordan Bell, who was giving up two inches and 40 pounds. ""Obviously, we didn't defend well in general,"" Kerr said. ""Jordan was overpowered."" On the night before the Warriors expect Stephen Curry to return from his sprained right ankle, they lost for just the second time in their past 15 games. They are 9-2 without Curry. ""We've definitely been missing him,"" said Kevin Durant, who scored 27 points to lead the Warriors. ""We're going to definitely be a different team when he comes back."" Klay Thompson scored 24, 13 of them in the first quarter. Draymond Green had eight points, 11 rebounds and tied his career high with 16 assists. Kerr said the difference was an old story. ""Turnovers . they got 32 points off our turnovers, 18 of them,"" he said. ""What's discouraging is just so many of them feel careless and silly and pointless. Too many times we're going for the home run assist. We've got to just make simple passes and plays."" The league's best third-quarter team, Golden State trailed 79-75 after the Hornets outscored them 26-22 in the third. Two nights earlier, the Warriors scored 42 third-quarter points to bury the Utah Jazz. ""We're not going to do that every third quarter,"" Kerr said. ""We didn't bring the juice."" It didn't get any better for the league's defending champs. Golden State got no closer than three points in the fourth quarter, and Charlotte's lead reached 95-81 when Jeremy Lamb scored a layup off a feed from Howard to cap an 11-0 run with 6:30 left. CURRY'S RETURN: Kerr stopped short of a definitive promise that two-time MVP Curry will return Saturday night against Memphis after missing 11 games with a right ankle sprain. ""I would say most likely he'll play,"" Kerr said. ""We had a talk with him and he was feeling good. So we'll see how he's feeling (Saturday) morning."" Kerr said Curry likely will have a minutes limit, adding just his presence is a boost to the team. ""When he's around, everybody feels better,"" Kerr said. ""It's good to have him in the building, but it's more fun to have him on the floor."" TIP-INS Hornets: Guard Kemba Walker, who leads the team with a 21.6 scoring average, entered Friday's game mired in a bit of a shoot slump. He made just 37.7 percent from the field the previous eight games, including 29.5 percent on 3-pointers. He made just two of his first 12 against the Warriors, but warmed up to score 16 points. Warriors: Kerr seconded Green's endorsement of Kevin Durant as a possible Defensive Player of the Year. ""To be mentioned in that conversation is a huge testament to the work he's put in and what he means to our team,"" Kerr said. Durant, a four-time NBA scoring champ, has blocked at least two shots in 10 consecutive games . F Omri Casspi sat out two days after spraining his right ankle against Utah. ""It's not too bad. There's not much swelling,"" said Kerr, adding that Casspi could play Saturday against Memphis, but no later than Wednesday at Dallas.","400975274"
"LOS ANGELES --  An uncomfortable pattern has emerged the first half of the season for the Los Angeles Clippers. They cannot seem to approach being a healthy team. On a night they got Blake Griffin back for the first time in a month from a knee injury in their 121-106 victory Friday over the slumping Los Angeles Lakers, they lost guard Austin Rivers to an Achilles strain. Griffin returned to lead all scorers with 24 points, but Rivers injured his right Achilles in the third quarter and left the arena on crutches. They already lost guard Patrick Beverley for the season to a knee injury. Forward Danilo Gallinari is out for the second time with a glute injury. They only recently got starting point guard Milos Teodosic back from a plantar fascia injury. Like Griffin, all our starters. ""Now it looks like Austin,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, Austin's dad. ""We just keep rolling. It doesn't matter who is on the floor. We play like a team, we play hard, we defend hard. Our job is to figure it out each game until we get everybody back."" The Lakers have their own problems. The loss was their fifth straight and eighth and their last nine games. They fell behind 19-3 to open the game, for the second consecutive game making only one of their first 10 shots, and never could recover. Their defense lacking early, the Clippers never did trail. ""To me that's the No.1 thing we have to fix,"" said Lakers coach Luke Walton. ""It's what we've been able to hang our hat on all year. We get after it on defense, we get stops and we get out and run. Tonight we scored but we didn't play any defense."" Griffin hit only 6 of 15 field goal attempts, but connected on 11 of 12 free throws and added six rebounds and six assists. More importantly, he reported no issues with his knee. ""It felt good,"" he said. ""I didn't have any second thoughts, any moments when I didn't trust it. That was important."" Lou Williams, who will likely take over Austin Rivers' starting role, had 23 points off the bench for the Clippers and DeAndre Jordan had 16 rebounds. Jordan Clarkson led the Lakers with 20 points and Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle added 18 points each. TIP-INS Clippers: Rivers said before the game that Griffin (sprained left medial collateral ligament) would not be on a minutes limit in his first game back since Nov. 11. Said Rivers: ""Not really, I think it's a lung restriction. He'll probably get tired. Other than that, it's not anything we're worried about."" Griffin was originally expected to be out eight weeks. . F Wes Johnson (foot) also returned after missing three games. Lakers: Instead of practicing Thursday, the struggling Lakers held a team meeting. Walton called it a good meeting, but warned against placing too much significance to it. Said Walton: ""I've been on a championship team where we had meetings in the middle of the season, so this is nothing new in sports and I think every athlete knows that."" ... F Kyle Kuzma suffered a bruised right quad Wednesday but was cleared to play. . G Lonzo Ball (shoulder) missed his third consecutive game and Walton said would not play Sunday. LAKERS SHUFFLE LINEUP Randle, normally a 6-9 forward, started at center Friday. Clarkson, who had started for Ball in the Lakers last game, came off the bench Josh Hart started. ""We've been losing games and Julius has been great all year for us,"" Walton said. ""I wanted to give him a chance in there. If we'd won five out of six, we probably would have kept it how it is.""","400975275"
"DETROIT --  Before the game, Stan Van Gundy sounded like a coach with limited options as his undermanned Detroit Pistons prepared to face San Antonio. ""Some guys who haven't had to play primary scorers are going to have to step up tonight and guard better people,"" Van Gundy said. ""There's just no way around it. Guys are going to have to step up and take more defensive responsibility."" Van Gundy could hardly have imagined that a few hours later, he would be marveling at his team's defensive performance after the Pistons held the Spurs to their lowest point total of the season in a 93-79 victory on Saturday night. ""It was really a team effort tonight,"" Van Gundy said. ""Everybody we put in made a contribution."" Playing without starting guards Reggie Jackson (right ankle sprain) and Avery Bradley (sore right groin), the Pistons never trailed. Reggie Bullock scored 22 points for Detroit and rookie Luke Kennard added 20 -- both were career highs. Andre Drummond had 14 points and 21 rebounds for the Pistons. Kawhi Leonard scored 18 points for San Antonio, which shot 37 percent from the field and 5 of 26 from 3-point range. ""Stan had them prepared mentally,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""We tried to battle back, got back in it here and there, but kept making the same mistakes. So, the Pistons got a good victory. They deserved it."" Detroit led 24-13 after the first, which equaled San Antonio's lowest-scoring quarter of the season. It was 35-20 before the Pistons hit a dry spell of their own toward the end of the half. A 16-4 run by the Spurs left Detroit with only a three-point lead at halftime. The Pistons managed to maintain their advantage, though. Kennard's outside shooting gave Detroit a lift on a night when neither team was impressive offensively, and Bullock was sharp throughout in just his 12th start of the season. ""No matter who goes down, we've got other players that's able to step up,"" Bullock said. ""We're just doing it together as a team."" Detroit led 63-57 after three quarters, and it looked like it would be a tense game down the stretch, but the Pistons broke it open early in the fourth. A layup by Bullock after a San Antonio turnover made it 78-63. ON THE BOARDS All those missed shots by San Antonio left Drummond with plenty of rebounds -- 17 of his 21 were at the defensive end. Drummond had 10 rebounds in the first quarter and finished with at least 20 for the 39th time in his career. He also had six assists. ""It's commonplace with him to have a lot of rebounds, and so a lot of times, you don't give him enough credit,"" Van Gundy said. ""I thought that he was another guy, though, that his defensive disposition early in the game was the best it's been all year."" HIGHLIGHT Detroit's Ish Smith made a nifty play in the first half when he flipped the ball to himself, caught it while sailing through the air, and tossed an alley-oop to Drummond. QUIET NIGHT LaMarcus Aldridge scored only 15 points for the Spurs. It was just the eighth time this season he did not lead his team in scoring. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio was missing F Rudy Gay (right heel bursitis). ... The Spurs' lowest-scoring game previously was when they scored 86 points at Minnesota on Nov. 15. Pistons: In addition to Jackson and Bradley, Detroit was also without F Stanley Johnson (strained right hip flexor). ... Kennard's previous high was 14 points and Bullock's was 20.","400975276"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Tyler Johnson and Goran Dragic took over in the second half Saturday night, leading the Miami Heat back from an 18-point deficit in a 117-111 victory over the Orlando Magic. Johnson scored 22 points in the third quarter and Dragic had 14 in the fourth to help Miami avoid a second straight embarrassing defeat. Aaron Gordon scored 39 points for the Magic, who took a commanding lead with 24 fast-break points in a 66-point first half. ""They were running us out of the gym,"" said Johnson, who finished with a season-high 31 points. ""We couldn't seem to stop anything in transition. It was hard to get into an offensive rhythm because we were using all our energy trying to run back on defense."" Orlando got only two points off the break in the second half. ""In the second half we completely changed the game,"" said Dragic, who finished with 25 points and eight assists. ""We defended them in the halfcourt, and I think that was the ball game."" The Magic (12-25) lost for the 10th time in 11 games despite shooting 54 percent. ""This hurts,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""Our guys played their hearts out, played with great effort. I felt like they deserved to win, but you've got to get stops down the stretch and we weren't able to do that."" Just one night after a 24-point loss to Brooklyn, the Heat (19-17) shot 63 percent in the second half in winning for the eighth time in 12 games. ""Basically halftime was about them. I stepped back and let them talk and figure it out,"" Heat coach Eric Spoelstra said. ""It was a much different disposition in the second half. I was speechless after that game last night. I feel like that a little bit right now."" Orlando led 68-50 early in the second half when Johnson led Miami back into the game. He made 10 of 11 shots including a couple of 3-pointers. His only miss of the quarter was a long buzzer shot that left the Heat down 92-86. ""Tyler was tremendous, player of the game for us,"" Spoelstra said. ""Really inspiring. Other guys wanted to step up for him."" SLOW START FOR JOHNSON Johnson's big night started with a nearly invisible first half in which he missed three of four shots. ""Really the ball just started going in,"" he said. ""I felt like in the first half I wasn't very assertive, kind of like what I was doing early in the season when I wasn't putting my fingerprints on the game."" TIP-INS Heat: Johnson's 22-point third quarter was a season high for Miami and only three points short of his personal season high for a game before Saturday night. Magic: Rookie F Jonathan Isaac will be placed in an injury rehabilitation and conditioning program and will be out indefinitely. Isaac has played only 36 minutes in three games since spraining his right ankle Nov. 11.","400975277"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Jarrett Jack figured the Pelicans' defense was more concerned with Kristaps Porzingis than with him. Porzingis had just scored seven consecutive points to help the New York Knicks forge a tie with New Orleans in the final minute. With the Knicks looking to take the lead, Jack knew what to do. He found an opening between Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, drew a foul from Jrue Holiday and made two free throws with 9 seconds left to lead New York past New Orleans 105-103 on Saturday night. ""KP had just hit a couple of shots, so I knew they weren't leaving him,"" said Jack, a former Pelican. ""That left me with a nice lane to drive toward the basket. I made an aggressive play, got fouled and did my job by knocking down two free throws."" Jack's play completed a comeback from an eight-point deficit in the final 3 minutes. He finished with 15 points, scoring 13 in 17 minutes of second-half action after scoring two in the first half. ""That's why they have two halves in this game,"" Jarrett said. The Pelicans had a chance to tie or win at the end, but Davis, who had 31 points and nine rebounds, missed a 3-pointer just before the buzzer. ""That was one of the options,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said of the final play. ""We know we didn't need a three, but if the three was available to us, we were going to shoot it. It was a great shot. We just didn't knock it in, but I'll take that shot any time of the day."" Cousins had 29 points and 19 rebounds, Holiday scored 13 and E'Twaun Moore had 12. ""You have to close out a game like that,"" Gentry said. ""We had every opportunity to do it, and they did it. We didn't and they did. They came back and made some shots."" Holiday began the fourth-quarter scoring with a three-point play that started an 8-0 New Orleans run, giving the Pelicans an 86-79 lead. Frank Ntilikina started an 8-2 run that got the Knicks within 88-87 midway through the fourth. ""We missed a lot of open shots in the beginning of the fourth quarter, must have had five or six in a row we couldn't make and at the end we got down by eight,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""The team kept their poise and they made the plays. They didn't try to do anything they were incapable of doing."" The Knicks led by 11 at halftime, but Davis led a surge in the third quarter. He scored 14 points, including seven straight, as New Orleans got within 75-71. Holiday's 3-pointer helped the Pelicans get within 79-78 after three quarters. The New York bench outscored the New Orleans reserves 23-8 in the second quarter, and the Knicks led 56-45 at halftime. TIP-INS Knicks: New York entered the game having lost a season-worst four games in a row. ... Beasley scored 15 points to lead the way as New York's bench outscored New Orleans' backups, 42-10. Pelicans: After playing three home games in four nights, New Orleans plays six of its next eight games on the road. ... Cousins has had three games with at least 30 points and 20 rebounds this season, making him the first player to do that since Kevin Love in 2010-11.","400975278"
"ATLANTA --  Dennis Schroder knows his strength -- take the ball to the rim as often as possible. ""Whenever I see an advantage for me to attack, I try to do that,"" he said. ""I'm pretty fast. That's what I've been doing the last four years. I feel pretty comfortable now."" Schroder scored 18 of his 22 points in the second half, Marco Belinelli added 14 points and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Portland Trail Blazers 104-89 on Saturday night. Shabazz Napier finished with 21 points and CJ McCollum had 18 for Portland, which was coming off arguably its best win of the season, rallying Thursday from 18 down in the third quarter to beat Philadelphia. The Blazers led Atlanta, the NBA's worst team, by 11 early in the third, but coach Terry Stotts called timeout at 3:47 mark of the period after Schroder's 3 put the Hawks up 67-66. Atlanta didn't trail again, mostly because Schroder, the Hawks' rangy point guard from Germany, kept the Blazers on their heels the rest of the night. He played a team-high 33 minutes despite a left quad contusion. ""You've got to pick your spots and keep them guessing,"" Schroder said. ""I've gotten comfortable doing it now. Every time I do it, I try to do it with force."" The lead swelled to 12 on John Collins' three-point play and to 13 on Ersan Ilyasova's 3 before Schroder's three-point play made it 95-80 with 4:51 remaining. Stotts pulled all of his starters except Napier, who's filling in for leading scorer Damian Lillard, for the final three-plus minutes. The Blazers needed more consistency from McCollum, who went just 8 for 21 from the field. He scored 34 against Philadelphia. ""I think he was trying to draw some fouls that he wasn't able to get,"" Stotts said. ""It was a rough night for him offensively. He's been doing it for a while now, so there's not much I can tell him. Just needs to be strong with the ball and make good decisions."" Ilyasova and Tyler Cavanaugh had 13 points apiece, and Kent Bazemore and Taurean Prince each scored 12 for the Hawks (10-26). Atlanta became the last team to reach double digits in wins. Portland (18-17) dropped to 10-7 on the road. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard, who averages 25.2 points, missed his fourth straight game with a right hamstring injury. ... Portland had nothing to show for outscoring Atlanta 46-28 in the paint and a 24-14 advantage in second-chance points. ... Two nights after putting up a season-high 42 points in the fourth quarter, the Blazers had just 37 points in the second half. ... The bench was outscored 41-23. Hawks: Atlanta has won three straight at home for the first time this season. ... Belinelli's teammates had a good laugh when he missed two dunks in the second half instead of going for easy layups. ""In the future I'm going to try to (draw) a foul,"" he said. ""That would be more smart, I think."" ... After scoring a career-high 30 points in a lopsided loss at Toronto, Prince finished with 12 points and took just eight shots in 31 minutes. Prince went 4 of 7 beyond the arc and had 10 rebounds. ALL GOOD NOW Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said he and Raptors coach Dwane Casey have settled their differences after they argued at the end of Atlanta's 111-98 loss Friday at Toronto. With the Hawks dribbling out the clock, Budenholzer was annoyed when Raptors rookie OG Anunoby stole the ball and dunked with 17 seconds left. He yelled at Anunoby, Casey yelled at Budenholzer and Budenholzer yelled back at Casey with the coaches exchanging profanities. They refused to speak after the game, but Budenhozler was satisfied to settle the situation Saturday. ""I've exchanged texts with Dwane,"" Budenholzer said. ""I've apologized. They play hard. I have a lot of respect for Dwane. It's really kind of a non-issue, to be honest with you.""","400975279"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  There's no longer any surprise in the Jazz locker room when Donovan Mitchell takes over a game. Teammates have begun to expect it from the rookie, whose latest feat was to outduel LeBron James on the four-time MVP's 33rd birthday. Mitchell scored 29 points, and Utah handed James and the Cleveland Cavaliers their third straight defeat, 104-101 on Saturday night. ""Just have no conscience when it comes to certain things,"" Mitchell said. ""I missed a few shots that I normally make and just moving on to the next shot, making the right play at the right time. Just treating the last two minutes the same as the first two. ""If you overthink it, that's the first mistake right there."" James had 29 points, eight rebounds and six assists as his personal losing streak at Utah extended to seven games, four of them with Cleveland. The Cavs' three-game losing streak is their second this season. Mitchell blew by J.R. Smith and made a layup in traffic over James with 35 seconds remaining to give the Jazz a 100-97 lead. James then missed a layup, and Utah finished off the game from the free-throw line. The Jazz snapped a three-game losing streak. Mitchell shot 10 for 17 from the field. Ricky Rubio had 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. ""He's a player,"" James said. ""The kid had a lot of game and they've been riding that wave all season since they realized what they actually got. He's not afraid of the moment. They put him in situations where he can succeed and he tries to take advantage of it."" James did not record a point or an assist during the game-changing third quarter, which Utah opened with a 23-3 run. Cleveland connected on just 4 of 19 shots in the quarter. ""We turned the basketball over, we couldn't make shots,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. ""I just thought defensively we weren't very good. Second unit gave us a great boost and got us back in the game, moving the basketball, getting stops defensively. ""Tristan (Thompson) was great, (Dwyane) Wade was great, Jeff Green was great. So that was a good sign for those guys to get us back in the game."" James powered the Cavaliers' late rally, but the Jazz were able to hold on. The Cavs led by 10 at the end of the first quarter. Utah chipped away in the second and trailed 53-48 at halftime. ""We played very well defensively in the third quarter,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Thabo (Sefolosha), he's competitive. We know what kind of defender he is. He'd be the first person to tell you LeBron is special and there's nobody more unique. You just do the best you can and hope for the best."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Lue said Isaiah Thomas (hip), who has not played this season, looked good during a Friday scrimmage and felt good Saturday. Doctors have not yet cleared Thomas to play, Lue said. Jazz: C Rudy Gobert was re-evaluated Saturday and will miss at least two more weeks with a sprained PCL. BRUTAL STRETCH The Jazz had lost 10 of 12 while playing a brutal schedule that included 11 games against teams in position to make the playoffs. Snyder acknowledged there's been a psychological toll, but said the team is resilient. ""We try to make it about more than winning and losing,"" Snyder said. ""I think a focus on the process or improving and those things. ""I don't sense us being incredibly despondent. But that doesn't mean there's not some psychological toll that's taken a little bit."" BIRTHDAY MEMORIES James was in a storytelling mood at the pregame shoot-around when asked about his favorite birthdays. He enjoyed turning 18 but said there was ""this false notion that you're a grown man."" Even James couldn't do whatever he wanted. ""There was always certain clubs and stuff I used to go to and they were like, `Come on LeBron, we know you're not 21,"" James said with a laugh. ""`We cannot let you in here and mess up our liquor license.' So 21 was pretty cool, too. ... I turned 21 and went to Vegas and that summer. I was like, back then I was so happy to show my card! `I'm 21, let me up in here! I'm up in here!"" Fake identification wasn't an option, considering he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated before he was 18. ""I wish,"" James said. ""Who was I going to be?""","400975280"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Stephen Curry stood among the coaches during a third-quarter timeout pleading his case to keep playing, and Steve Kerr relented -- after a brief chat with the training staff, of course. And who could blame Curry? He was feeling it after waiting weeks to get back on the floor, even missing the marquee Christmas Day matchup against LeBron James and the Cavs. ""Third quarter, it was a quick look to him and I literally said `no way, no way,"" the two-time MVP said. ""... It felt like the first day of school again, for real."" Curry made a sensational return from injury by scoring 38 points with a season-high 10 3-pointers, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 141-128 on Saturday night with an energy and spirit that had been missing much of this month without him. Curry shot 13 for 17 and 10 of 13 from deep in just shy of 26 minutes for his ninth 30-point game this season after missing 11 games with a sprained right ankle. His mere presence brought an energy to the Warriors and all of Oracle Arena, and he spent much of the fourth quarter pacing, gesturing in delight while cheering his teammates with a towel draped over his head. Kevin Durant added 20 points, nine assists and five rebounds, and Klay Thompson scored 21 points as the Warriors wrapped up nearly three weeks at home in California. Zaza Pachulia scored a season-best 17 points and also had eight rebounds and six assists. ""It wasn't just him,"" Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of Curry. ""You look up and they've got guys that can make shots all over the floor. They were making shots that were contested."" Marc Gasol led six Memphis players in double figures with 27 points on 10-for-13 shooting. With his parents, wife and two daughters in attendance, Curry got his first points on a layup at 10:27 that put the Warriors out front 7-0 and led to a Memphis timeout. He hit a 3-pointer at 9:52 before Memphis scored its first points. Curry received roars from the sellout crowd during pregame introductions, and Durant threw his right arm into the air to cheer his pal's comeback. In the game's closing minutes, Curry hit a 3-pointer, held his follow-through and jubilantly hopped up and down on his left foot. At other moments, he pounded his chest. This marked Curry's ninth career game with 10 or more 3s, most by any player in NBA history. ""I was feeling pretty good. I think me and him had an understanding where the minutes would kind of fall as the game would go on and I would give him feedback how my body was feeling, and I felt amazing and it was me just saying that, I really did,"" Curry said of convincing Kerr he could stay in. ""He gave me that extra minute and a half and I made a shot, so it paid off."" Curry was all smiles during pregame warmups. He hoisted his signature tunnel shot, signed a few quick autographs when daughter Riley arrived to greet him and briefly held his arm around her before turning around to do his customary hallway sprint. His little girl cleared the way, and off her dad went to the locker room. He's healthy at last -- and it showed immediately. Kerr had hoped to play his star 20-25 minutes, and Curry hit another 3 just 30 seconds after conferring with the coaching staff during that timeout with 4:36 left in the third. ""Everything just looks better,"" Kerr said. ""The food in there is going to taste better tonight. My wife's going to be even better looking than she already is. My kids are going to be happy. Steph, he has that impact."" Memphis lost here 97-84 on Dec. 20, then watched the Warriors match their season high for points in a half this season by leading 78-67 at the break to the delight of the fired-up crowd. ""The energy was amazing tonight honestly, probably it was because of Steph,"" Pachulia said. ""Tonight was a total difference, so I guess they were waiting for Steph to come back."" GREEN GETS TOSSED Draymond Green was ejected with 9:45 left in the second quarter after a second technical foul in a 43-second span. Both were for arguing. The emotional forward has been ejected twice this season. Green had five assists and three points in 10 minutes. TIP-INS Grizzlies: The Grizzlies' 67 first-half points were their most in any half this season, while Golden State's 78 matched the most points ever allowed in any half by Memphis -- with Golden State also scoring 78 on March 24, 2010, on its home floor. ... The Grizzlies are one of two teams along with San Antonio to own a winning regular-season record vs. the Warriors since the start of the 2011-12 season at 13-12. ... Memphis completed a strange stretch in which it played at Golden State on Dec. 20, at Phoenix the following night, home on Dec. 23, back to Phoenix on Tuesday, in Los Angeles against the Lakers on Wednesday then returned to Oracle Arena on Saturday. Warriors: The Warriors' 141 points are the most scored against the Grizzlies ever by any opponent. ... Golden State's 14 first-quarter assists -- for 40 points -- were one shy of the franchise record of 15, done three times. ... The Warriors improved to 8-0 after a loss this season. Golden State is 40-7 since 2014-15 following a defeat. ... The Warriors went 13-2 in December and finished 5-2 on this season-long homestand. The 13 December victories match the franchise's most wins in the month during their West Coast Era, also done last season.","400975281"
"DENVER -- With Joel Embiid in a different city entirely, the Philadelphia 76ers got a spark from an unlikely source. Jerryd Bayless scored all of his 14 points in a key stretch in the second half, and the 76ers rallied from 13 down to beat the Denver Nuggets 107-102 on Saturday night. Dario Saric had 20 points and nine rebounds and keyed a second-half run, JJ Redick had 18 points and Robert Covington had 15 points and 10 rebounds. Philadelphia played without Embiid, their star center, who flew directly from Portland to Phoenix, where the team will join him for Sunday's game. Embiid is averaging 24 points and 11 rebounds per game. The 76ers are 2-7 when he does not play. ""To get one, on the road, without Joe, is a credit to a team effort,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. Bayless did his part in Embiid's absence. He scored all of his points in a span of 3:56, when the Sixers took the lead for good. ""It was huge,"" guard Ben Simmons said. ""He played really well and that's exactly what we need from guys like that -- hit shots."" Jamal Murray led Denver with 31 points and had eight rebounds; Nikola Jokic had 19 points, 13 rebounds and six assists; and Gary Harris had 17 points. Denver's offense went cold in the third quarter and didn't recover. ""We stopped hitting shots,"" Murray said. ""It wasn't their defense. Guys that normally make shots missed them today."" The Nuggets looked like they had control with 11 straight points to start the third to go up 72-58, but Philadelphia responded with a 25-4 run to lead 83-76. Trey Lyles gave Denver some momentum with a 37-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer to cut the deficit to three. Lyles finished with 16 points and eight rebounds. Bayless sparked Philadelphia with eight points in the first 1:06 of the fourth for a 91-80 lead. Jokic got Denver within 103-100 with two free throws with 1:01 left, and after Bayless missed on the other end, the Nuggets had a chance to tie. Will Barton missed a 3-pointer with 25 seconds left, and Philadelphia called a timeout after Saric grabbed the rebound. Covington drained two fouls shots with 19.5 seconds left to put the Sixers ahead by five and clinched it with a dunk after Murray hit two free throws. TIP-INS Sixers: Covington had his left middle finger taped but was able to play. He was listed as doubtful after the morning shootaround but got treatment and started. ... The Sixers improved to 9-10 on the road. ... Richaun Holmes had 14 points off the bench. Nuggets: Denver had four players in double figures by halftime. Murray led the way with 18. ... The Nuggets finished December 6-7 and failed to have consecutive winning months for the first time since 2012-13. ... Denver committed just four fouls in the first half. WINNING STRATEGY With Denver leading 76-75 the Sixers began intentionally fouling Mason Plumlee, who came into Saturday averaging 40.2 percent from the line. The plan worked. Plumlee was 1 of 7 from the line and the Sixers grabbed control. ""You have to make free throws,"" Plumlee said. ""That's inexcusable and I'm going to make free throws going forward."" LONG-TERM PLAN Philadelphia has decided to sit Embiid in one game of back-to-backs to not push him. He is dealing with a balky back and sat out the first two seasons with a broken foot after being selected third overall in the 2014 draft.","400975282"
"WASHINGTON --  Bradley Beal delivered when the Wizards needed him most. Beal scored 17 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter to lead Washington to a 114-110 win over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday. Beal scored 15 straight points in the fourth as the Wizards rallied from an eight-point deficit early in the period. He also had nine rebounds and tied a career high with nine assists. ""I didn't even know that,"" Beal said when asked about his spurt. ""That's just being in the zone, being locked in."" Beal became the second player this year to have at least 39 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook had 40 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists on Dec. 29. Beal has shown signs of taking his game to a new level this season. When backcourt mate John Wall was out with a knee injury, Beal had a career-high 51 points at Portland on Dec. 5, a night after the Wizards suffered a 47-point loss at Utah. ""He's able to stay aggressive and still be hot and also make the right reads at the right times,"" Wall said. Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said it was frustrating trying to defend Beal. ""We were trying to get it out of his hands there for a stretch,"" Hoiberg said. ""But they did a good job finding him, seeking him out."" Nikola Mirotic scored 21 points to lead Chicago, which had won 10 of its previous 12. Kris Dunn had 19 points and 11 assists. David Nwaba's two free throws with 1:26 to play gave Chicago a 108-107 lead, and Dunn hit a jumper with 54 seconds remaining. Wall's three-point play with 29.4 seconds left put the Wizards up 112-110. After Beal missed two free throws, Washington got the rebound and Wall added two free throws with 9.1 seconds to play. Wall had 21 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four blocked shots. The difference was 3-point shooting. Washington was 16 for 36 (44.4 percent) while Chicago was 8 for 35 (22.9 percent). The Bulls missed 17 of 20 3-point attempts in the first half. TIP-INS Bulls: Dunn returned after missing a game with left patella tendinitis. ... G Zach LaVine, who has yet to play this season following left knee surgery, is rehabbing for the next few days with G-League Windy City. Hoiberg said LaVine is essentially starting training camp. ""If he does well through this stretch, we'll all get in a room and put a plan together as far as when we want to see him back on the floor,"" Hoiberg said. Wizards: F Mike Scott returned after missing a game following the birth of his daughter. Scott scored 17 points. F Markieff Morris had a season-high 11 rebounds. Washington is now 10-10 against sub-.500 teams. BEAL AN ALL-STAR? Beal has never been an All-Star in his five NBA seasons, and coach Scott Brooks thinks he's deserving of the honor. ""Brad's an All-Star. I thought he was an All-Star last year,"" Brooks said. ""If you win games and you play for each other, the individual awards come. If you focus on that, you focus on the wrong things. I've talked to Brad many times, and he's not one time mentioned All-Star to me."" DON'T SELL BULLS SHORT Mirotic thinks many Bulls fans should believe in the team's recent improvement. ""I don't know what's going on with people. I don't know if they want us to lose,"" Mirotic said. ""Or if everybody is thinking, `OK, they're going to start losing, everything is going to be like before.' No.""","400975283"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Timberwolves never forgot about their loss to the Pacers early in the season. And it was all the motivation they needed to come out strong in Sunday's rematch. ""We watched film the last two days of their win earlier in the year and it definitely wakes you up,"" forward Jimmy Butler said. ""It was good to get back at them."" Butler had 26 points, six rebounds and five assists, and the Timberwolves never trailed this time around in a 107-90 victory. Karl-Anthony Towns had 18 points, 14 rebounds and six blocks, and Taj Gibson added 17 points and nine rebounds for the Timberwolves (23-14), who have won nine of their last 12. Joe Young scored a career-high 20 points off the bench and Bojan Bogdanovic scored all of his 13 points in the third quarter as the Pacers (19-18) dropped their fourth straight, equaling their worst skid of the season. Indiana also lost four in a row in early November. This time, the Pacers have been without guard Victor Oladipo, who averages a team-leading 24.9 points per game. He missed a third straight game with an injured right knee. Young is taking advantage of the chance to help fill the void. ""It's about being ready, and when your time comes, you have to be ready,"" he said. ""Like (teammate) Al Jefferson told me, you just have to be ready at all times. Your name could be called any second. I took that motivation and just stayed ready and my time has come."" It wasn't enough to help the Pacers put together a rally. After taking a 49-38 lead into halftime, the Timberwolves scored eight straight to open the second half. Gibson's 3-pointer at the end of an 11-2 run gave Minnesota a 73-53 lead with 4:40 left in the third quarter. ""Our starters got us off to a great start,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We're still striving to be a 48-minutes team. I thought what Jimmy did to get us going at the beginning (was big). I really liked the way he played."" Butler had 16 points by halftime and didn't play in the fourth quarter. ROUGH START Indiana missed 12 shots, turned it over five times, fell behind 17-0 to start the game, and didn't score until Domantas Sabonis' hook shoot at the 5:15 mark in the first quarter. The Pacers scored just 13 points in the opening period -- their season low for points in a quarter -- and all 13 points came off the bench. OPPOSITE NIGHT When the teams first met early in the season, the Pacers shot a franchise-record 66.7 percent from the field. On Sunday, Indiana shot 38.8 percent, its worst since shooting 33.7 percent in a 114-96 loss to Oklahoma City on Oct. 25. TIP-INS: Timberwolves: Butler was 10-of-11 from the free-throw line. ... Minnesota turned it over just eight times. ... Towns' six blocks tied his career high. ... The team finished with a 58-36 advantage in points in the paint. Pacers: Indiana's 90 points was its lowest scoring total at home this season. ... Indiana committed 17 turnovers. ... The 58 points off the bench was a season high.","400975284"
"BOSTON --  The Boston Celtics squandered several opportunities to put away the pesky Brooklyn Nets before Kyrie Irving ended the comebacks. Irving scored 28 points, hitting a pair of free throws with 7.7 seconds left after his teammates struggled from the line, and the Celtics held off the Nets 108-105 on Sunday. ""You've got to give credit to just how talented that team is. They play extremely hard for all 48 minutes,"" said Irving, who also had eight rebounds. ""We had to take the challenge on every single possession."" Al Horford had 10 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks, Marcus Morris added 15 points and Terry Rozier scored 14 as Boston closed 2017 by winning three straight and four of five. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 22 points and 12 rebounds and Caris LeVert scored 16 for the Nets, who could not overcome 10 turnovers in the second half. ""They're a team that's not going to give up,"" Rozier said. ""They've got a lot of shooters, which opens up a lot for them. They use it to their advantage. That's a tough team."" The Celtics won their seventh straight against the Nets, although Boston didn't have the game in hand until Irving made a pair of free throws with 7.7 seconds remaining. Boston went the final 4:27 without a field goal and struggled from the foul line, going 16 for 25 in the game, and missed several opportunities to put Brooklyn away. ""We stayed poised to make a comeback,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. ""That's basketball. Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn't. But for us now we're definitely competing. It starts with the starting unit, we've got to come out that way. And I feel like the effort's there."" Hollis-Jefferson pulled the Nets within 103-95 on a dunk, and then converted a three-point play with 2:05 left to cut the margin to 103-98. Quincy Acy hit a 3-pointer with 18 seconds left after the Nets grabbed two offensive rebounds, and Brooklyn was within 105-103. Marcus Smart made 1 of 2 free throws with 15.2 seconds left, and then Irving -- who went 4-for-4 from the foul line -- added two more to seal it. Acy scored 14 for the Nets, DeMarre Carroll and Allen Crabbe scored 12 points apiece and Spencer Dinwiddie had 10 points and nine assists. ""Sometimes you'll have a slip-up like we did at the beginning of the first quarter, but it's the overall outcome that you kind of want to base it on and we kind of stayed with it,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. ""Give them credit. Boston's a really good team."" TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn outscored the Celtics 31-23 in the second quarter and had one turnover in the first half. ... Brooklyn won consecutive games only once in December. ... The Nets outscored the Celtics in the paint 50-34. Celtics: Irving scored at least 20 points for the 11th straight game. ...

"HOUSTON --  With James Harden in the locker room with a hamstring injury and the Houston Rockets desperate to end their losing streak, Chris Paul came to the rescue. Harden scored 40 points before leaving with the injury late in the fourth quarter, and Paul scored 15 of his 28 points in overtime as the Rockets snapped a five-game skid with a 148-142 double-overtime win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday night. ""He just willed us to win, and great players can do that,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Certain guys can just say, `We're not losing,' and `Whatever it takes,' and that's what he said tonight and that's what he did."" Los Angeles led by as many as 17, but couldn't hold on as the team's season-long losing streak stretched to six games. Paul made a pair of free throws to tie it at 142 with about a minute left in the second overtime before Tarik Black blocked Kyle Kuzma's shot on the other end to give Houston the ball back. P.J. Tucker grabbed a rebound on a miss by Paul and put it back up to put Houston on top. Tucker blocked a 3-point attempt by Kuzma, and Paul added two more free throws to make it 146-142 with 3 seconds left. Paul made two more free throws after that to secure the win. The Rockets had hoped to limit Paul's playing time in his second game back after missing three games with a groin injury. But with Harden out, he ended up playing 42 minutes. ""We worked too hard to let that game go,"" Paul said. ""We had fought. Different guys had been in and out of the lineup. James carried us all game long and different guys had to step up and it's just will at that point. Let's just figure out a way to win it."" Julius Randle set season highs with 29 points and 15 rebounds, but fouled out with about three minutes left in the first overtime. ""It's obviously frustrating but ... we're short-handed right now and it would've been a lot easier to kind of just pack it in and individually go out and try to put up big numbers until we get healthy or until we get to an easier part of the schedule,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""Our guys really came together tonight and really played well for most of the game."" Los Angeles was up by 4 in the second overtime before a dunk by Black followed by a 3-pointer from Trevor Ariza made it 140-139 with 2 1/2 minutes remaining. The Lakers scored the next three points before Paul's free throws tied it. Ariza finished with a season-high 26 points. Paul gave Houston its first lead since the second quarter with a 3-pointer that made it 127-125 with 2:40 remaining in the first overtime. The Lakers got two free throws from Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart added a basket on a goaltending call to make it 131-129 with about a minute to go in the first OT. Black tied it up before Hart missed a 3-pointer to give Houston the ball back. Paul put Houston on top with a short jumper with four seconds remaining, but P.J. Tucker fouled Ingram and he made both free throws with 0.8 seconds left in the first overtime to tie it at 133-133. Paul had a shot to win it, but he missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Houston got a 3-pointer from Ariza followed by a three-point play from Harden to tie it at 119-all with about a minute left in the fourth. But Kuzma, who scored a career-high 38 points in his last game against Houston, made a 3-pointer a few seconds later to put the Lakers back on top. Harden was injured when he missed a layup after that and was taken to the locker room. Gerald Green tied it again with a 3-pointer with 17.7 seconds remaining. Kuzma followed with a missed 3-pointer, and the Lakers got the ball back with 0.7 seconds left, but they didn't have time to get a shot off. Houston center Clint Capela had seven points and seven rebounds in his return after missing two games with an orbital fracture. He wore a mask in the first half to protect the injured area, but it seemed to be bothering him and he took it off at halftime. TIP-INS Lakers: Rookie Lonzo Ball missed his fourth straight game because of a sprained left shoulder. He did not make the trip, remaining in California for treatment. ... The Lakers' 72 first-half points were a season high. ... Ennis had a season-high 20 points. Rockets: Capela, who is also dealing with a bruised heel, missed four of the previous five games. ... Gordon finished with 14 points. HARDEN'S HEALTH Harden has a strained left hamstring and had a noticeable limp after the game, but he hopes he won't have to miss any time. ""Hopefully it's not that serious,"" he said. ""Just a pull ... just got some treatment so hopefully day to day it gets better."" DOUBLE OT DELIGHT Sunday was Houston's first overtime game this season, and the Rockets have won six straight in double overtime dating to 2008. Five of those have been played at home.","400975286"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Mavericks rookie Dennis Smith Jr. made the plays down the stretch in a point guard matchup otherwise dominated by Thunder star Russell Westbrook. Smith scored 11 of his 19 points in the final 1:39 and Dallas closed 2017 with its season-best fourth straight win, beating Oklahoma City 116-113 on Sunday night. Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 24 points and Dirk Nowitzki added 13 for Dallas, which had lost four straight in Oklahoma City and seven of nine overall against the Thunder. ""He was great tonight,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said of Smith. ""He finished the game with a couple of big baskets, some big free throws. Look, it was an up-and-down night, there was a lot going on. ... He went through some situations that were very difficult but he kept his energy up, he kept his head up, he kept attacking and he kept encouraging everybody in the huddles during timeouts, too."" Dallas won despite Westbrook recording his 12th triple-double of the season with 38 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists. The Thunder had been 11-3 in December before consecutive home losses to Milwaukee and Dallas to end the month. Paul George scored 25 points and Carmelo Anthony had 21 for Oklahoma City, combining to go 8 of 14 from 3-point range. Despite their hot shooting, Westbrook took the big shots late for OKC and missed a trio of 3-pointers in the final 30 seconds. He was 0 for 4 from deep for the game and was mostly curt with reporters afterward. ""We just didn't get the stops we needed to,"" he said. Consecutive 3-pointers by Smith -- the second one banked in -- put the Mavericks up 111-108 with 1:17 left. Smith hit a driving layup with 30.4 seconds left to give Dallas a 113-110 lead, then rebounded a 3-point miss by Westbrook at the other end and made two free throws with 15.8 seconds left. ""I just saw an open shot and I took it, so I was like with the next one, I'm going to take it as well and they started to fall,"" Smith said. ""It might have been around the five-minute mark or somewhere around there that I realized it was time for me to get it going."" George made three free throws with 12.7 seconds left to pull the Thunder within 115-113, and then Smith made 1 of 2 free throws with 11.8 seconds left. Westbrook missed two more 3-point attempts in the final seconds. TIP-INS: Mavericks: Josh McRoberts was in uniform for the first time this season but didn't play.

"LOS ANGELES --  Clippers guard Lou Williams was trouble for the Charlotte Hornets from the moment he left the bench, making his first four shots, including three 3-pointers, and scoring 11 points before he was on the floor four minutes. Williams went on to score 40 points to lead Los Angeles to a 106-98 victory Sunday. ""I always feel like I can get it going, but to see it early, it puts me in a different mindset, in an attack mode,"" Williams said. ""Once I get two or three early, that way I can just get everybody else involved."" In an offensive struggle for both teams, the Clippers outshot the Hornets 47 percent to 39 percent to win for the fifth time in six games. ""We've gone through a lot this season with injuries,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""I just love coaching this team, though. This team is a resilient team, they're tough-minded, they're very close and they grind out games."" Blake Griffin added 25 points in his second game back after missing 14 with a left MCL strain. ""I play pretty well with Blake, especially in the two-man game, closing out quarters, closing out games,"" Williams said. ""We have good chemistry together."" DeAndre Jordan grabbed 15 rebounds to help the Clippers win their fifth in a row at home. The biggest surprise was Jordan, a career 44 percent free throw shooter, going 6 for 6 from the foul line. ""I've really been working on the shot, obviously,"" Jordan said. ""And tonight I was just trying to shoot the ball the same way. My teammates gave me a lot of confidence.' Kemba Walker scored 30 points for the Hornets. They fell to 3-13 on the road. ""Kemba was ready,"" acting Hornets coach Stephen Silas said. ""That happens in these 4 o'clock games. It's out of their routine and sometimes they come out flat. Not Kemba. He was Mr. Reliable.""

Griffin scored 12 points during the stretch. RIVERS ON THE MEND Austin Rivers, who left Friday night's game against the Lakers on crutches, sat out against the Hornets with a sore right Achilles tendon. Results of an MRI taken Saturday revealed no soft tissue injury or structural damage. Coach Doc Rivers said Austin ""could play"" in the Clippers' next game Tuesday night against Memphis. ""He's good,"" Doc Rivers said about son Austin. ""When you hear the word `Achilles' you never think anything positive, especially the way it looked. I thought (the injury) scared him, and that probably scared us."" WARRIORS WHIPLASH The Hornets went against the Clippers coming off their best performance of the season, a surprise 111-100 road victory two nights earlier over the Golden State Warriors, only their third road victory of the season. ""We talked about the fact it was Golden State. They're the best team, and it's easy to get up for them,"" Silas said. ""But we have to be in that mindset every game, especially in the position we're in. Not just having a Golden State attitude, we're looking to have an attitude about the way we play on the road.""

Their offensive highlight came with 6:40 left in the third quarter when Blake Griffin broke free for a driving, right-handed dunk that brought the crowd to its feet.","400975288"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Tyreke Evans' decision to gamble and sign a one-year deal with Memphis this past offseason is looking increasingly more like a safe bet for the veteran guard. His troublesome right knee is no longer bothering him as much, either. Evans had 26 points, seven rebounds and five assists against his former team and the Grizzlies beat the Sacramento Kings 114-96 on Sunday. ""I love playing against the team that drafted me,"" Evans said. ""Most of the time when I (come) back I've played well. It just gets me going."" Evans shot 10 of 16 and had five 3-pointers. He spent two stints with Sacramento and was most recently with the team in 2016. The 2010 rookie of the year saw his stock drop after multiple knee surgeries that cost him 99 games over the past two seasons before he signed with Memphis. Healthy this season, Evans is looking more like his former self. Evans has scored 20 or more in 19 games this season and is shooting a career-high 42.6 percent on 3-pointers. ""He's had that edge all year,"" Memphis center Marc Gasol said. ""He's had that same mentality so don't take it like he came in here and did something he hasn't done every game. He's come with that aggressiveness."" Jarell Martin added 11 points and three others had 10 points apiece on a day all 13 players scored for the Grizzlies. One day after setting a season high for scoring in a 141-128 loss to the Golden State Warriors, Memphis had another big offensive game in a blowout of stumbling Sacramento. The Grizzlies scored 35 points in the first quarter and led by 14 or more at the end of every quarter. Wayne Selden punctuated the win with a dunk that put Memphis up 104-71 with 7:25 remaining. ""That's the growth we've been looking for in our offense,"" Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""For our guys not to hang their head and continue to believe in what we're doing, it shows the steps that we're taking."" The Kings trailed by as many as 33 and missed 11 of 24 free throws and trailed for the final 43 minutes. It's the second consecutive year that the two teams played on New Year's Eve. The Grizzlies won both. Willie Cauley-Stein had 21 points and eight rebounds for the Kings. Buddy Hield added 15 points, and Garrett Temple had 13. Mario Chalmers made a pair of 3-pointers and had eight points in five minutes during Memphis' 36-point first quarter and was involved in a strange sequence of events at the end of the period. Frank Mason attempted a halfcourt shot at the buzzer and missed while being defended by Chalmers. After officials reviewed the play Mason, who was upset over not the call from the refs, was charged with a technical and Chalmers was called for a foul. The Grizzlies led by 24 before a late Sacramento surge cut the gap to 64-46 at halftime. ""Lack of focus and lack of force,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""They looked at us and shot over us, and then looked us and drove around us. Each guy has to own their own stuff."" OLD FRIENDS Evans wasn't the only player facing his former team. Zach Randolph, a two-time All-Star over eight seasons who helped Memphis reach the 2013 Western Conference finals before signing with Sacramento in the offseason, had four points and six rebounds. Randolph spent most of the game going against Gasol, his longtime teammate. ""So many thing go through your head, so many emotions,"" Gasol said. ""Truly a brother. We made each other better when we were playing together, we made each other better in practice when we battled each other. I miss him every day."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Gasol was called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter after arguing with an official. ... Memphis shot 60 percent (12 of 20) in the first quarter. Kings: Mason limped off the court with a bruised left heel after making two of three free throws on the foul by Chalmers.

"PHOENIX --  The Philadelphia 76ers might now be learning how to win after blowing a big lead, having done it in back-to-back games. Dario Saric tied a season high with 27 points and the Sixers beat the Phoenix Suns 123-110 on Sunday night after blowing an 18-point lead in one quarter. ""It's on our back all of the time that we can't win at the end of a game,"" Saric said. ""The last two games we showed up in the fourth quarter how we need to play. How we are tough at the end of the game."" Joel Embiid added 22 points and nine rebounds, and Ben Simmons had 11 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter to help Philadelphia win for third time in four games. Embiid returned after he sat out Saturday's game at Denver to rest his back. He hurt his right hand going for an inbounds pass late in the game, but stayed in until 41 seconds remained. He had X-rays after the game and was told he might have a sprain. Devin Booker scored 28 of his 32 points in the second half for the Suns, and T.J. Warren had 28. ""If you weren't coaching against him he's somebody you would pay to go see,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said of Booker. The Sixers came close to dropping their seventh game this season in which they have led by 11 points or more. But J.J. Redick made a 3-pointer with 1:31 to play for an insurmountable 119-108 lead. Redick had 22 points. Philadelphia led by 11 at Denver in the fourth quarter on Saturday and had to hang on for a five-point win. ""We're getting better at closing out games and knowing what we need to do,"" Simmons said. ""I just know he (Brown) needs me to be more aggressive so I just try to take it in my own hands."" Phoenix trailed 73-55 with 9:20 left in the third quarter and went on a 32-11 run to take the lead before the quarter ended. Booker scored 16 of his points in the third as the Suns fought back with energy on both ends. Philadelphia took a 92-89 lead into the fourth quarter after Phoenix took a three-point lead, its largest of the game. The Suns couldn't retake the lead throughout the entire fourth quarter, however, as the Sixers pulled away. ""We are in a lot more games than we used to be and we are winning some games,"" Booker said. ""We are moving in the right direction for sure."" Warren made all four of his shots and scored 11 points in the first quarter. The Suns trailed by as many as 12 in the first 12 minutes, and 38-32 when it ended thanks to a 29-foot bank shot by Redick with a second to go. Redick scored 10 of his points in the first quarter. Simmons added nine rebounds and six assists for the 76ers. The Sixers hit their first four shots of the second quarter and took a 51-35 lead on a basket and free throw by Embiid with 8:14 to play. The Suns went three minutes of the quarter without a point and Philadelphia took a 63-49 lead into halftime after going up by 18. Phoenix made only 6 of 21 second-quarter shots. ""I credit our guys for getting back in it, but sometimes you use up all that energy,"" Suns coach Jay Triano said. RAISING THE ROOF The Suns brought back a celebratory gesture from recent years when Marquese Chriss followed Booker's miss with a two-handed dunk with 4:39 left in the third. Players on the bench pumped both arms in the air, the jam cutting the Sixers' lead to two at 82-80.

"NEW YORK --  The Brooklyn Nets had heard enough about not being able to win on the second night of back-to-back games. Allen Crabbe was tired of hearing his defensive approach questioned. With the game on the line late in the fourth quarter on Monday night, they collectively answered. Rookie Jarrett Allen had a career-high 16 points, Crabbe added 15 points and blocked a potential tying shot, and the Nets edged the Orlando Magic 98-95. ""I wish that reporter was here that kept telling us that we were not good on back-to-backs,"" coach Kenny Atkinson said jokingly. ""I wanted to thank him for motivating us."" Caris LeVert also had 15 points, while DeMarre Carroll chipped in 14 points, 10 rebounds and the tiebreaking free throw with 34.5 seconds remaining. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 13 for the Nets, who opened up the new year with a win after closing out 2017 with a 1-4 road trip. The Nets are 3-5 in the back end of a back-to-back. Aaron Gordon had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and Elfrid Payton added 17 points for an Orlando team that has lost its last seven games on the road. Bismack Biyombo posted his own double-double with 13 points and a season-high 17 boards for the Magic, who have now lost 11 of their last 12 overall. Crabbe made two free throws to give the Nets their three-point lead with 18 seconds left. He then followed it by blocking Evan Fournier's 3-point attempt with seven seconds left, and DJ Augustin missed Orlando's final chance to tie. ""I'm just trying to take more pride in it. I'm low key tired of hearing people trying to question my defense,"" Crabbe said. ""Coming over here in this new role there are a lot of expectations now, so I don't want to be the liability, especially in film the next day."" The Magic led by as many as eight points in the first half, but couldn't gain control of the game in a fourth quarter that featured 13 ties and 11 lead changes. Said Fournier of his failed shot: ""I felt (bad) all night long. Could never find my rhythm. So yeah, it wasn't good enough for sure."" Orlando squandered a 93-90 lead with 1:51 to go in the fourth after Gordon made a pair of free throws. Hollis-Jefferson then made two free throws to close the lead to 93-92 with 1:31 remaining and LeVert converted on a three-point play to put the Nets up 95-93. Orlando's Wes Iwundu then answered with a basket to even it again at 95-all. Carroll was then fouled under the basket and put the Nets ahead for good. TIP-INS Magic: Orlando's last road win took place Dec. 3 across town from Brooklyn at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks. Nets: Brooklyn, second in the league with 34.3 3-pointers per game this season, attempted only nine 3s in the first half, making three. They hit 6 of 15 in the second half . Nets lead the lead season series 2-1. IT GETS TOUGHER The Magic welcome two of the NBA's best teams this week at home. First up is a date on Wednesday night with the Houston Rockets, who own the second-best record in the Western Conference. Saturday night it's a matchup against LeBron James and Cleveland, the defending Eastern Conference champs, who this week get point guard Isaiah Thomas back. Biyombo, who is averaging 9.5 points, 13 rebounds and 3.3 blocks since stepping into the starting lineup in place of injured center Nikola Vucevic, believes they can still snap out of this slump. ""We need to keep improving. We need to keep playing and we have to remain patient because there's still a lot left in the season"", he said. PERFECT WAY TO START THE NEW YEAR The Nets improved to 9-0 this season when holding their opponent under 100 points. They're also 7-0 when limiting the opposition's shooting under 40 percent.

"TORONTO --  DeMar DeRozan spent his New Year's Day watching basketball history and making some, too. DeRozan scored a franchise-record 52 points, and the Toronto Raptors beat the Milwaukee Bucks 131-127 in overtime on Monday night, matching the team record with their 12th consecutive home victory. DeRozan said he spent some time earlier in the day watching the final few minutes of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals, in which Hall of Famer Michael Jordan beat the Utah Jazz with a late jump shot, giving the Chicago Bulls their sixth title in eight seasons. ""I remember being a kid and wishing to be in moments like that,"" DeRozan said. ""When you come out here and you're in those moments, you've got to make the best out of them."" DeRozan sure did, becoming the third player in Raptors history to score 50 or more in a single game. The others are Vince Carter and Terrence Ross, who each had 51. ""I for sure wanted to beat T-Ross,"" DeRozan joked about eclipsing his former teammate. DeRozan scored the first nine points of the game and had 21 in the first, the most by a Raptors player in a single quarter this season. ""He was playing with a lot of juice,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""You could see the bounce in his step. Tonight, DeMar DeRozan played like a superstar."" DeRozan made 17 of 29 field-goal attempts and went 13 for 13 at the free-throw line. His five 3-pointers were one shy of his career high. ""He's dangerous any time he puts on a uniform,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""Now to be able to expand his range out to the 3-point line just makes the game easier for him."" Kyle Lowry had 26 points and Serge Ibaka added 11 for the Raptors, who also won 12 straight at Air Canada Centre between Jan. 18 and March 6, 2016. Toronto is an NBA-best 14-1 at home. Eric Bledsoe scored 29 points, including 11 in overtime, and Giannis Antetokounmpo had 26 for the Bucks, who had won their previous two.

DeRozan made a pair of free throws to tie it at 114 with 37 seconds left in regulation, and Toronto got the ball back when Lowry stripped Matthew Dellavedova. Lowry's 3-point attempt with the shot clock winding down missed the rim, giving the Bucks 3.2 seconds to try to win it. With DeRozan defending him, Malcolm Brogdon couldn't get a shot off before the buzzer sounded, sending it to overtime. ""We were looking at Khris and Giannis,"" Kidd said. ""We had two options and Malcolm was the safety. We knew they were going to switch, we just didn't make the right read.""

McCollum proved it Monday night when he scored 25 of his 32 points after halftime, including the tiebreaking basket with 56.5 seconds remaining in overtime, and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Chicago Bulls 124-120. ""I just tried to make plays,"" McCollum said. ""If I can get a good shot, take it. If not, make the right play. I think guys did a great job of making the game easier for me. If I can get 30 good shots, I'll take 30 more. If I can get 40 good shots ... I'll take 40."" Al-Farouq Aminu added a season-high 24 points and Evan Turner also had his season best with 22 for Portland, which was without leading scorer Damian Lilliard for a fifth straight game. Kris Dunn scored 22 points and Nikola Mirotic had 18 points off the bench for Chicago, which blew a late lead for a second straight game. The Bulls lost for only the fourth time in 14 games since Mirotic returned to the lineup. Though he missed his first seven shots, McCollum was pivotal as Portland rallied from a six-point deficit in the final 2 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter. McCollum scored the final four points in regulation to tie the score at 112 and answered after Lauri Markannen, who finished with 19 points, made a jumper from the corner that tied it at 120 with 1:14 left in overtime. McCollum then made his short floater and added a pair of late free throws. ""(McCollum) is a shooter, he's a scorer and you've got to have that mentality,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""What I was pleased most about with C.J. was his assists. ""In the fourth quarter and overtime he made good decisions."" Led by Mirotic and Bobby Portis, the Bulls' bench helped them overcome a sluggish start. Each had nine points in a second quarter in which Chicago's reserves outscored Portland's 18-7. But both were on the bench for the final 7 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter and all of overtime. Portis finished with 14 points, seven rebounds and four assists. ""I just thought with (Jusuf) Nurkic out there we had to find a way to keep him off the glass,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""He's too big and strong out there. I felt like we needed Robin (Lopez), who also was playing well."" ""The last two nights we haven't gotten the job done. It hurts, it stings, especially after having the seven in a row where we did close out a lot of those close games."" TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard missed his fifth straight game with a right hamstring strain. Expected to be a game-time decision, Lillard, who hasn't played since Dec. 20, was ruled out early. Stotts isn't sure if Lillard would play on Tuesday at Cleveland. ""When he's ready, he'll be ready, but it's hard to say,"" Stotts said. Bulls: Zach LaVine's ""training camp"" has gone well so far, according to Hoiberg. Coming off February surgery to repair a torn ACL in his left knee, LaVine is halfway through a stretch of six consecutive days of full-contact practices. ""He's sore, as expected,"" Hoiberg said. ""He's in training camp mode right now, but he's handling the workload well and that's the important thing."" HOT SHOOTING With Lillard's 25-point average out of the lineup, Aminu's offensive output was critical. He made 5-of-6 3-pointers and scored 17 points after halftime. The Blazers' 14 3-pointers were tied for the team's second-most made this season. They made 18 in a Dec. 9 loss at Houston. ""It was good for us to have an offensive night,"" Stotts said. ""We needed every one of (Aminu's) 3s."" HOMECOMING Turner, who grew up in nearby Oak Park, Illinois, made the most of his one trip to Chicago this season. He scored 14 first-half points and also hit a 3-pointer to open the scoring in overtime. ""Ever since he had his first buck, I was saying, `E.T.'s home. He's at the crib,"" the Blazers' Pat Connaughton said. ""He kept it going.""","400975293"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  A mix of younger players and veterans is working quite nicely for the streaking Minnesota Timberwolves. Jimmy Butler scored 28 points and Minnesota started fast and held off the struggling Los Angeles Lakers 114-96 on Monday night. Karl-Anthony Towns recorded his 30th double-double of the season with 16 points and 13 rebounds to help Minnesota win for the seventh time in eight games and 10th in 13. ""We're striving to be good, we just got to continue to keep growing, continue to be great and don't get bored with the process,"" Towns said. ""We're finding some success right now. Don't get too comfortable with it."" Butler and Taj Gibson were brought to Minnesota in large part to help players like Towns and Andrew Wiggins continue to develop. ""There's a lot of players that end up with stats in this league and they don't win. So maybe you sacrifice some of the individual stuff, but you're impacting winning in a far greater way,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""Guys are cutting a lot better now. They know if they're open Jimmy will find them. I think KAT is starting to see things. He's making a lot of great plays. Wigs is starting to see things and that's great for our team."" Wiggins scored 21 points and grabbed a season-high nine rebounds. ""Doing whatever I can to help the team,"" he said. Jordan Clarkson scored 20 points off the bench for the Lakers, who've lost seven in a row and 10 of 11. Los Angeles was again missing three starters: center Brook Lopez (ankle), and guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (legal) and Lonzo Ball (shoulder). Julius Randle had 15 points and 12 rebounds, and Brandon Ingram had 14 points for Los Angeles. Kyle Kuzma, the team's leading scorer at 17.9 points per game, played just 18 minutes and scored all of his six points in the third quarter. ""I've been banged up the past four games. It's a reoccurrence,"" he said. ""It's my thigh . been getting hit same part every game."" With its early commanding lead whittled to as little as five points early in the third quarter, the Timberwolves went on a 13-0 run late in the quarter to rebuild a big lead. After scoring the first 17 points in Sunday's win in Indiana, a franchise best, Minnesota nearly broke the record. Wiggins scored nine points as the Timberwolves jumped to a 16-0 lead. He also added an alley-oop feed for a dunk by Butler and grabbed a couple rebounds. ""I think a lot of times early, we were winning, but we were just winning on talent. I think these last two games we've done a great job winning with execution,"" Towns said. Los Angeles, which had eight of its 24 turnovers in the opening 12 minutes, got within 30-18 by quarter's end. All the Lakers' points came from the bench after the starters were pulled 3:36 into the game. ""The turnovers are the most frustrating part,"" said coach Luke Walton. ""I can't blame just turnovers on them going up 16-0 and us not playing with energy, and us not putting pressure on the defense even though that was the whole message going into the game."" TIP-INS Lakers: Los Angeles wore its light blue throwback uniforms with MPLS on front. ... Ball (left shoulder sprain) missed his fifth straight game. ... Caldwell-Pope likely missed his last road game due to a legal travel restriction stemming from a March 2017 incident. The Lakers are not away from Staples Center until Jan. 13. Timberwolves: Butler has at least 20 points in eight straight games. . C Gorgui Dieng had 17 points off the bench. . Towns had four fouls -- three offensive. ... Minnesota is 11-1 at Target Center against Western Conference foes; 2-5 vs. Eastern Conference teams. FILLING THE ARENA The announced crowd was 18,978, Minnesota's second straight sellout and just the fifth this season. Entering the night, Minnesota averaged 15,864 fans, fourth-worst in the NBA. The last time Minnesota had consecutive full houses was when Kevin Garnett returned to the team Feb. 25-28, 2015.","400975294"
"CLEVELAND --  Isaiah Thomas had one last wait. Sitting on the scorer's table, Thomas could see the end of his seventh-month odyssey in front of him. And when the buzzer finally sounded and the Cleveland crowd erupted for a player it barely knows, Thomas took the last few steps onto the court and completed a trip he hopes to never take again. He was all the way back. Thomas showed flashes of what made him an All-Star in his long-awaited debut for the Cavaliers, who snapped a three-game losing streak by beating the Portland Trail Blazers 127-110 on Tuesday night. ""It's been a long journey for me,"" Thomas said. ""I couldn't really see the light at the end of the tunnel. For that day to come the first couple days of 2018, it's going to be a special year."" It was a special night for Thomas, who scored 17 points and played 19 minutes in his first game in seven months, an impressive return to action for the dynamic point guard traded to Cleveland last summer. He added three 3-pointers and three assists before leaving with 8:10 remaining and the Cavs up by 12. Before leaving the floor, Thomas got a hug from LeBron James and one from Cavs coach Tyronn Lue, who pulled him close and offered two perfect words. ""Welcome back,"" Lue said. James scored 24 points, Kevin Love had 19 and Jae Crowder added 15 for the Cavs, who were coming off losses at Golden State, Sacramento and Utah. Damian Lillard scored 25 for the Blazers after missing five games with a hamstring injury. Jusuf Nurkic added 23 and CJ McCollum had 19 for Portland. Thomas hadn't played since May 19 because of a torn labrum in his hip that ended his 2017 postseason with Boston and threatened to derail his career. But the 5-foot-9 playmaker, who inspired the Celtics and an entire city last year by playing in the immediate aftermath of his sister's death, patiently stuck with his rehab. And with 4:33 left in the first quarter, Thomas checked in to a loud ovation as fans cheered for a player they believe can help the Cavs win another title. ""It was a special moment,"" he said. ""I haven't played in a game and you would think I was here for a few years and playing and battling in the Finals with this team. But it was special for my family to be here, my wife and kids to see that, that's genuine love right there."" This was the first chance for James and the rest of the Cavs to play with Thomas, who will sit out Wednesday's homecoming in Boston. He's not an enemy, but family. ""What I like most about him is he has a chip on his shoulder for life,"" James said. ""That's just who he is. When a guy's got a chip on his shoulder for life, he's never going to not work hard. Not going to never give it his all. Not going to never disappoint you."" The Cavs were unable to separate from the Blazers until Thomas and Dwyane Wade teamed up in the fourth. Thomas knocked down a jumper and then fired a pass toward the baseline to a cutting Wade, who made a reverse layup. On Cleveland's next possession, Thomas spotted up in the corner and buried a 3-pointer to give the Cavs a 100-91 lead. ""This is obviously our first time playing together, but you can see moments where he added a dynamic that we need, especially if we want to get to where we want to be,"" Wade said. ""Happy that he's back on the court and glad he's on our side."" MINUTE BY MINUTE Lue will keep close tabs on Thomas' minutes over the next few weeks while he builds up stamina and confidence. Initially, Thomas won't play in any back-to-back games. BOSTON BOUND Wednesday's game will be the second matchup between the Celtics and Cavs, who have developed a rivalry in recent years. ""It's not one of 82 because they're the No. 1 seed and we have some history with them obviously,"" James said. ""But it's not more than that. We want to go in there and play well."" HARD CONTACT Thomas took a couple hard falls, good tests for his hip. Driving the lane past Shabazz Napier, Thomas dropped in a left-handed scoop shot while being fouled and crashed to the floor. He got up and shook off the contact, clearing another important hurdle in his comeback. BACK ON THE COURT Lillard played 33 minutes in his first game since Dec. 20. He made six 3-pointers and had six assists, but was unhappy with seven turnovers. ""My conditioning was pretty good,"" he said. ""My timing was a little bit off with some of my passes but everything else, I felt pretty good."" TIP-INS Blazers: Were outscored 36-23 in the fourth. ... Portland went 3-2 without Lillard. ... Nurkic, a 7-footer, went down hard when he appeared to be hit by James on a drive in the second quarter. However, replays showed that James barely grazed the big man. Cavaliers: Won their 13th straight at home. ... Have made at least 10 3s in franchise record 26 straight games. ... Thomas expects a warm welcome from Boston fans. ""I know it will be all love,"" he said. ""I gave that city everything I had and they showed me genuine love back and I think that love is going to last forever. So, there are no hard feelings. This ain't no revenge game.""","400975295"
"NEW YORK -- He's now the fifth-winningest coach in NBA history, though there are some things Gregg Popovich still doesn't know. Like what everybody was yelling about after Manu Ginobili's overthrown pass, for example. He was just as fooled initially as the referees, not realizing the ball had gone in the basket. It was the most bizarre bucket of San Antonio's 100-91 victory over the New York Knicks on Tuesday night. ""I did not, in all honestly. I did not,"" Popovich said. ""Then everybody started grabbing me and saying the ball went in. I said, 'Yeah, the ball went in!' I acted like I knew what was going on."" He almost always does. Popovich earned his 1,176th victory, all with the Spurs. The five-time champion broke a tie with his friend George Karl. Popovich has a .694 winning percentage, tops among all coaches in the top five of the all-time coaching wins list, which is topped by Don Nelson (1,335). Just ahead of Popovich on the list at No. 4: Pat Riley, with 1,210 wins. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 29 points and Kawhi Leonard had a season-high 25 for the Spurs. Ginobili finished with 12 points -- three of them coming on what appeared to be a pass that went into the basket without everyone noticing. The Spurs beat the Knicks for the second time in six days and won for the fourth time in five games. They beat New York 119-107 on Dec. 28. Michael Beasley had 18 points for the Knicks, who were playing one of just four home games this month. They play 12 times on the road. Kristaps Porzingis shot just 5 for 19 and was one of three Knicks to finish with 13 points. ""They just for 48 minutes played consistently,"" Porzingis said. ""They talk on defense. And they also know when they need to push the pace and when they need to slow it down."" Leonard played 30 minutes for the first time this season. It was just his seventh game after his return from a quadriceps injury. He shot 8 for 20 and grabbed eight rebounds. ""I felt good,"" he said. ""Still got a little bit of ways to go as far as my conditioning, legs, just the whole rhythm of the game, figuring out things."" TIP-INS Spurs: Leonard missed his first five 3-point attempts, and then made his final three. ... Danny Green, who has battled a left groin injury, didn't play in the second half and Popovich indicated he may be shut down to rest. Knicks: G Ron Baker missed the game because of a broken left orbital bone sustained when he was hit in the face trying to stop Anthony Davis' drive to the basket in New York's victory at New Orleans on Saturday. Coach Jeff Hornacek said Baker took part in the non-contact portion of practice Monday but the mask he was fitted for to wear in games wasn't available yet. NEW YEAR, SAME OL' SPURS The calendar has changed but the Spurs rarely do. Tim Duncan is gone, but Ginobili (40) and Tony Parker (35) are still around in 2018. ""I still miss Timmy, and Manu will go at some point, maybe in the next five, six years,"" Popovich joked. ""Tony, he thinks he's going to play for 10 more. Those contracts are pretty good."" BAD FIRST IMPRESSION Popovich didn't want Parker after the Frenchman's first workout as a teenager. ""I thought he was soft, I thought he didn't care, I thought he thought he was too cool for school and I said no and we sent him out of town,"" Popovich said. He agreed to give Parker another workout and came away impressed by his toughness. ""If you have time to go through all that, I guess you learn a little bit and it might help you take a chance on someone,"" Popovich said.","400975296"
"PHOENIX --  The Phoenix Suns appeared headed for an ugly home loss to the Atlanta Hawks until the frantic final minutes. That's when Devin Booker and Marquese Chriss came through. Booker sank three free throws to put Phoenix ahead with 12.3 seconds to play, Chriss soared to block Taurean Prince's shot at the rim with 7 seconds to go and the Suns rallied to hand the Hawks another road loss, 104-103 on Tuesday night. ""We played bad today, but that says a lot about a young team,"" Booker said. ""To be able to play bad like that, come back and get a win down late, that's big."" Booker scored eight of his 34 points in the final 37 seconds, starting with a 3-pointer that made it 101-99, as the Suns finished with a 15-4 run. T.J. Warren scored 31 and Chriss had 17 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks for Phoenix. Booker, in his 13th 30-point game of the season, was 14 of 15 at the foul line, 11-for-11 in the second half. Ersan Ilyasova scored 21 points for Atlanta. Kent Bazemore and Dennis Schroder added 20 apiece. Bazemore made 7 of 8 shots, including 4 of 5 3-pointers, but he fouled Booker on a 3-point attempt with the Hawks clinging to a two-point lead. Booker made all three to put the Suns on top 102-101. Prince took a lob from Schroder and was free for what looked to be an open layup, but Chriss came from the other side of the court to soar and block the shot. ""I just had to run and try to catch up and he lofted the ball a little too much and I was able to get back,"" Chriss said. ""I think I have a chance for pretty much every block I go for."" Booker called it ""an x-factor play that only Marquese can make."" Booker made two more at the line with 6.5 seconds remaining to make it 104-101. With the Hawks needing a 3-pointer to tie it, Schroder instead drove for the layup to cut it to one, but by then there was just a half-second to play and the Suns handed Atlanta its seventh straight road loss. ""It's tough, man,"" Bazemore said, ""any time you fight so hard and put yourself in a situation to win a game, and I question myself down the stretch."" Bazemore called Booker ""a great player and he was there when his team needed him."" As for that foul on the three-pointer, Bazemore said, ""I thought I made some really good plays down the stretch defensively and didn't get the benefit of the doubt. You control what you control."" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano was not pleased with what he saw much of the night. ""I thought we stayed in it and we gave ourselves a chance at the end, but throughout the game I did not like our energy level,"" he said. ""We were slow to the ball. ... The lineup at the end, they got into it, and we were a little bit better defensively, and as a result we gave ourselves into it."" Atlanta led by as many as 14 in the first half and was up 99-89 after Prince's inside basket with 2:53 to play. ""That's a tough loss,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""To have a lead and not make enough plays on both ends of the court, I think we'll learn from it. ... There are lots of mental mistakes from all of us. We all can get better."" TIP-INS Hawks: The Hawks haven't won in Phoenix since March of 2015. ... Atlanta is 3-16 on the road. ... The Hawks had won three of four. ... Prince has made a 3-pointer in 19 consecutive games. ... The Hawks have won two in a row only once this season. Suns: First-round draft pick Josh Jackson did not play, the first time that's happened this season. ... The Suns have won four of six and six of nine. ... Booker scored 17 of Phoenix's first 30 points but didn't take a shot in a scoreless third quarter. ...

"The Hornets shoot a season-high 57% from the field Tuesday night to beat the Kings 131-111 in Sacramento. (0:54) SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Dwight Howard lost control of the ball on his way in for an apparent dunk when he was fouled from behind by Zach Randolph. As Howard tried to regain his footing, the ball floated about 3 feet above the rim and then fell straight back down and through. ""I don't know how it went in,"" Howard said with a grin. On a night when Charlotte set season highs in several offensive categories, Howard's play was symptomatic of just how good things were going for the struggling Hornets. Howard had 20 points and eight rebounds, Kemba Walker added 12 points and 10 assists, and Charlotte built a big early lead in beating the Sacramento Kings 131-111 on Tuesday. Nicolas Batum scored 21 points, Jeremy Lamb added 16, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marvin Williams had 10 points apiece to help the Hornets to their third consecutive victory in Sacramento. ""To score the way we did, really just did a lot of good things offensively,"" Hornets interim coach Stephen Silas said. ""We need to carry that over because our offense has not been very good up until this point, up until this trip. But things are starting to click a little bit and it's good."" Charlotte came in as one of the NBA's worst 3-point shooting teams but repeatedly got open looks from beyond the arc, especially in the first half when the Hornets made 10 of their season high-tying 15 3s. Lamb and Batum hit three apiece to pace the outside shooting. Four days after stunning Golden State to begin their four-game trip, the Hornets set season highs in scoring and for points scored in the first half (72). Charlotte's previous high was 129 points in an overtime win over Washington on Nov. 22. ""It was pretty good,"" Howard said. ""I still think our defense could have been a lot better. We gave up too many points in the paint. One-on-one defense, especially for the bigs, could have been a lot better. We're going to take the positives but there are some things we still have to improve on."" Zach Randolph had 24 points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento. Skal Labissiere added 17 points and a career-best 15 rebounds for the Kings, who have lost five of six. ""Teams are definitely confident that they can come here and shoot well,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""It's just what it is until it's not."" Charlotte led 32-25 but didn't pull away until an 18-4 run midway through the second. Four different Hornets made 3-pointers, and Howard had a dunk and short hook on consecutive possessions. Walker added a three-point play and Williams had a 3-pointer as part of another run for Charlotte, and Batum's short jumper put the Hornets up 72-52. Sacramento made a brief surge in the third to pull to 76-65, but Kidd-Gilchrist scored eight points over the next 2 1/2 minutes to extend Charlotte's lead to 88-71. PICK-AND-ROLL PERFECTION Most of Charlotte's open 3-pointers came as a result of the Hornets' pick-and-roll offense that was basically unstoppable. ""It was more of our ball movement,"" Silas said. ""We stayed in the pick-and-roll basically the whole game, as much as we could. And we were making the extra pass and getting those open 3s."" TIP-INS Hornets: Charlotte was 26th in 3-point shooting going into the game but went 15 of 32 from beyond the arc. The 10 3s in the first half were one more than the Hornets were averaging over a full game. Kings: Sacramento trailed at the break despite shooting above 60 percent for most of the first half. ... De'Aaron Fox scored 17 points in his return after missing eight games with a right quadriceps tear sustained against Minnesota on Dec. 14. The fifth overall pick in the draft, Fox shot 5 of 12 and had four assists. ... Frank Mason bruised his left heel Sunday against Memphis and will be re-evaluated in a week.","400975298"
"LOS ANGELES --  It's happening with such regularity now, people are just expecting Lou Williams to come off the bench and put up 20-plus points while leading the Los Angeles Clippers to a victory. Williams did it again Tuesday night, scoring 33 to send the Clippers to their fourth consecutive win, 113-105 over the Memphis Grizzlies. The standout reserve shot 8 of 15 from the field. Continually driving to the basket, he hit all 15 of his free throws. ""He's obviously a great scorer, but when you draw that many fouls and get to the free throw line that many times, you're almost impossible to guard,"" Memphis interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. Williams leads NBA reserves in scoring at 21.6 points per game. He scored 40 off the bench in his last game against Charlotte. He has scored at least 30 off the bench eight times this season, tied for the second-most in NBA history. Ricky Pierce (1989-90) holds the record with 17. Williams got scoring help Tuesday from Blake Griffin, who had 21 points -- including five down the stretch after the Grizzlies had erased most of an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to close to 103-101. Tyreke Evans led Memphis with 18 points, six assists and five rebounds. Mario Chalmers had 15 points off the bench. Williams and Griffin, however, proved too much for the Grizzlies in the final moments. Rookie guard C.J. Williams, starting for an injured Austin Rivers, added a career-high 18 points for the Clippers in his 10th career start. ""When I think about it, it's just basketball,"" C.J. Williams said. ""There are so many other things that can engulf your mind outside of basketball. But I'm playing the sport I've played for 20 years now. I just enjoy every moment of it."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: G Wayne Selden Jr. returned Sunday after missing 33 games with a right quadriceps injury. He played 18 minutes against Sacramento, scoring 10 points. Bickerstaff said Selden's minutes would continue to be watched closely until his conditioning improves. ""He's a versatile player. He can be really good defensively. He's athletic, he's strong. And then offensively he has a knack to make plays. From that wing position, he gives us an added dimension to be able to play some pick-and-roll and attack and share with his teammates,"" Bickerstaff said. Selden scored 13 points in 14 minutes Tuesday. Clippers: Los Angeles had expected Rivers to return from his sore Achilles tendon against Memphis, but coach Doc Rivers said his son had not improved enough to play and it was uncertain how close he was. ""I don't know. We thought he was, but the fact that he's not playing says probably not,"" Doc Rivers said. ""He had some discomfort, so they're going to re-evaluate his foot again and send him to another doctor."" PLAYOFF HOPES Despite playing without two starters (Patrick Beverley, Danilo Gallinari) and missing Griffin for 14 games due to a knee injury, the Clippers are 17-19 and one game back of eighth place in the Western Conference for the final playoff spot. ""We always expected ourselves to be in the mix,"" Lou Williams said. ""Obviously, the makeup of this team has changed over the course of these past couple of months with injuries. We all felt we were a talented team, a playoff team, and so far we've kind of put ourselves back in that position."" HANDS OFF What makes Lou Williams so difficult to defend? ""He just knows how to create fouls,"" Chalmers said. ""We have to figure out how to guard him when we can't touch him.""","400975299"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  James Harden's strained left hamstring figures to be a problem for the Houston Rockets. It wasn't a big deal Wednesday night against the Orlando Magic. Gerald Green scored a season-high 27 points, Clint Capela had 21 points and eight rebounds and the Rockets (27-9) got by without the NBA scoring leader in routing the Magic 116-98. ""This was a good day. We've got Golden State (Thursday) so ask me tomorrow,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We'll try to hold the fort down until we get James back."" Green made his first five 3-point shots and finished 7 for 10 from behind the arc for the Rockets, who were never behind and led by as many as 28 late in the third quarter. Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson, with 17 points each, were among six Rockets in double figures and that did not include Chris Paul, who had eight points, 13 assists and seven rebounds. ""We'e still trying to get healthy,"" Paul said. ""We're still waiting for Luc (Mbah a Moute) to get back and obviously James is out for a while, but it's by committee right now for us."" Aaron Gordon led the Magic with 16 points after missing his first eight shots. Elfrid Payton and Mario Hezonja added 14 each in Orlando's 12th loss in 13 games. The Magic missed 16 of their first 18 shots and fell behind by 15 points before the end of the first quarter. A scoring burst by Hezonja kept them in the game in the second quarter but they could get no closer than nine. Capela scored on a layup, a dunk and two free throws during the Rockets' 15-5 spurt at the outset of the second half, turning the game into a rout at 70-46. In his first start and only his fourth game with the Rockets, Green produced his 27 points on only 15 shots. ""Chris (Paul) did a great job of getting me going early,"" Green said. ""My rhythm felt really good and I was able to knock down shots. ""Everybody knows we can score, but people underestimate that when we do lock down, we lock down. Today made that point. We held them to 12 points in the first quarter."" Houston shot 44 percent (15 for 34) from 3-point range while Orlando shot 19 percent (6 for 31). ""When you're not making shots, everything in the game gets harder,"" noted Magic coach Frank Vogel. ""You press a little bit more, your focus on the defensive end slips a little more and we've got to overcome that."" RECORD-BREAKING PACE The Rockets are well on their way to breaking their own records, set last season, for 3-point attempts (40.3 per game) and 3-pointers made (14.4 per game). ""I don't go out and tell a guy we've got to get 45 threes up,"" D'Antoni said. ""I don't care. It could be 20. Depends on how the other team plays you. But we will not run a play that is set up to get a 15-foot shot."" TIP-INS Rockets: The game was only the third missed by Harden in the last four seasons. ... After getting 10 points and five rebounds, Nene left the game with a bruised right knee. Magic: F Jonathon Simmons left the game in the second quarter with back spasms and did not return.","400975300"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid went from doubtful to dominant, using a sprained right hand that nearly sidelined him to instead rock the rim, swat shots and stop the Spurs. ""I want to be out there with them. I don't want to quit on them,"" Embiid said. Ruled out by the 76ers before tipoff, Embiid made the call to push through and play, and then dealt San Antonio a rare bad hand in Philadelphia. Embiid had 21 points and 11 rebounds to lead the 76ers to a 112-106 win over the Spurs on Wednesday night. The Sixers needed all 35 minutes from Embiid to knock off short-handed San Antonio and snap a 12-game losing streak to the Spurs. It was the same old Embiid during the 76ers' fast start. He grabbed a rebound and had a putback for the first score of the game and had six points and six rebounds in the first quarter. He slammed home an alley-oop in the third and never even looked at his hand as he sank a free throw to finish the play. ""I was fine. Nothing to worry about,"" Embiid said. Embiid, who blocked four shots, sat by his locker and had several minutes of treatment to try to prevent further swelling. He had an anti-inflammatory gel gently massaged into the palm of his massive hand. Embiid flexed his fingers before his bruised hand was wrapped in ice. ""That's a gutsy effort,"" coach Brett Brown said. Brown fleeced his good friend and former boss, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, on the condition of his cornerstone center during their pregame chat. Popovich learned only minutes before tipoff that Embiid -- and not listed center Amir Johnson -- was in the lineup. ""I'm glad he played,"" Popovich said. ""I want to see him play. He's great."" Embiid suffered the injury in a hard fall Saturday against the Suns and had said before the game his hand was swollen and he couldn't shoot. But he used a soft touch to sink a couple of jumpers during pregame drills, and that was enough to convince the Sixers he could play. The Sixers blew a 16-point lead and might have been thumped from the outset had the Spurs not sat five players. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich benched Manu Ginobili, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker and Rudy Gay with his team playing the second of back-to-back games. Ben Simmons put the Sixers ahead 106-103 on a goaltended basket and free throw. JJ Redick buried a long jumper -- with an assist from Embiid -- and Simmons shook the rim with a dunk that brought the fans to their feet and sealed the win. ""It's a team that didn't have a full-strength roster,"" Brown said, ""but in my eyes, it's still the San Antonio Spurs."" TIP-INS Spurs: Patty Mills led the Spurs with 26 points and LaMarcus Aldridge had 24 points and 14 rebounds. 76ers: Soccer star Carli Lloyd rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell to start the game. ... Simmons had 26 points and Redick scored 20. FULTZ UPDATE Markelle Fultz, the No. 1 pick of the 2017 draft, appears close to playing again after missing two months with right shoulder soreness. Fultz has played in only four games this season, all as a reserve. He participated in both 4-on-4 half-court drills and light one-on-one work this week at practice. Fultz struggled with his mechanics when he did play, and his shooting form was widely mocked around the NBA. Brown said he had not determined how Fultz would be worked into the rotation when he did return. ""I'm excited because he completely connects the dots to what we don't have,"" Brown said. ""Anybody that can create their own shot, anybody that can create something for somebody else is of extreme value to the collection of what we do. That is his skill set."" GOOD FRIENDS Brown was all smiles when he caught up with Popovich. Brown joined the Spurs as a member of their basketball operations department in 1998-99 and was a member of the Spurs organization for the first four of their championship seasons (1999, 2003, 2005 and 2007). Brown had been 0-8 vs. Popovich. Popovich said Brown was the right coach for the job and to handle the painful, ongoing rebuild in Philadelphia ""It's the fortitude, the patience that he's exhibited in such a consistent manner in tough circumstances for several years,"" Popovich said. ""I don't know of a coach that I've ever run into that could handle that adversity and stay so positive and continue to teach."" Brown has a 93-272 career record in four-plus seasons with the Sixers.","400975301"
"WASHINGTON --  For weeks, the Washington Wizards have been hearing about their struggles against teams with losing records. Now that they've won two straight and elevated their record to 11-10 against sub-.500 teams, perhaps they've taken a step toward ending that discussion. ""We'll find out in the next 10, 20 games,"" Washington center Marcin Gortat said. Gortat had a season-high 21 points, making 9 of 10 from the field, Bradley Beal scored 27 and John Wall had 25 points and nine assists in the Wizards' 121-103 win over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. Playing for the first time since he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week, Beal followed his 39-point outburst on Sunday against Chicago by hitting 11 of his 14 field goal attempts for Washington, which has won five of six. Beal has answered plenty of questions about the Wizards' lapses against the NBA's bottom-feeders. ""Nobody criticizes themselves more than us."" Beal said. ""We're aware of it. We know that our job is to finish. We have more to prove."" Michael Beasley had 20 points, including 16 in the second half, to lead the Knicks, who have lost six of seven. Kristaps Porzingis scored 16 points. New York has lost 14 of its last 15 to Washington. In an energetic first half that ended with both teams shooting 58.1 percent, Wall's jumper at the horn gave the Wizards a 64-63 halftime lead. The first seven Washington baskets in the third quarter were from inside, and the resulting 15-3 run gave the Wizards a 79-66 lead with 7:47 to play in the quarter. The Knicks lost at home against San Antonio on Tuesday, and they had little energy after halftime. ""Not to make any excuses, but it's always tougher to play the back-to-backs and I think it got to us,"" Porzingis said. ""Our energy just wasn't there. They had three days of rest and came out fresh and we just didn't have it for the second half."" TIP-INS Knicks: G Ron Baker returned to the lineup after missing a game with a left orbital fracture. Baker donned a protective mask, and he expects to wear it for at least four weeks. Wizards: F Chris McCullough was assigned to the Wisconsin Herd of the G League. McCullough is averaging 3.0 points and 1.7 rebounds in 12 games. ... F Mike Young, who was signed to a two-way contract last spring but never played for Washington, was waived. ... The Wizards (22-16) are a season-high six games over .500. . F Markieff Morris tied a season high with 11 rebounds. PLAYER OF THE WEEK Beal knows Washington's 3-1 week helped win him his first Player of the Week award. ""If we didn't win games, I wouldn't have been considered for it,"" Beal said. ""Hopefully, many more to come, but that's never my focus."" GORTAT ON OFFENSE Gortat entered the game averaging 8.6 points per game, and hasn't been as much of an offensive force for the Wizards as he's been in the past. ""It's just one game in the season where I'm going to score like that,"" Gortat said. KNICKS SLOW Porzingis, who entered averaging 24.1 points per game, had a rough second half. He had just two points in 17 minutes, missing five of six shots. ""He's got to use his athletic ability running down the court, and we got a little slow there for a while,"" New York coach Jeff Hornacek said.","400975302"
"NEW YORK --  The Brooklyn Nets were well aware that Minnesota had been blowing teams off the starting line. The Nets not only hung in at the beginning, they made the big plays at the end. Spencer Dinwiddie made the go-ahead jumper with 10.1 seconds left and tied his career high with 26 points, leading Brooklyn to a 98-97 victory over the Timberwolves on Wednesday night. The Wolves raced to a 17-0 lead against Indiana on Sunday and then 16-0 against the Lakers the next night, but the Nets never let them find an early flow. ""When you spot a team that many points, it's always hard to come back and that's something we really didn't want to happen,"" Dinwiddie said, ""and obviously we didn't."" Jimmy Butler missed at the buzzer as the Timberwolves lost for just the second time in nine games. ""I just think as a whole we didn't play that much good basketball and we get put in that situation which from the jump could have went either way,"" Butler said. ""At least we fought and got back in the game, but I didn't make a shot."" Dinwiddie added nine assists as the Nets improved to 2-0 in the new year -- more wins than they had all last January, when they were 1-15. Joe Harris came off the bench to score 17 points. ""Really proud of how the team's progressing and just showing a resiliency that I felt that we didn't have last year,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""We felt last year we kind of crumbled in a situation like that where they made a run. We stayed together and really showed a lot of physical and mental toughness."" Butler finished with 30 points, mostly on the strength of 16-of-18 shooting at the foul line. Andrew Wiggins added 17 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 16 points and 10 rebounds. Dinwiddie had given the Nets a 96-94 lead on a jumper with 1:11 to play before three straight free throws from Butler put Minnesota back on top. The next Nets possession didn't seem to be going anywhere as the clock ran down, but Dinwiddie dribbled left away from Taj Gibson and lofted a floater that went in. Butler then dribbled right while defended by DeMarre Carroll and got off a good look that missed. The Nets led 24-22 after one quarter and held Minnesota to 39.5 percent shooting in the first half, taking a 48-43 lead on Dinwiddie's 3-pointer at the buzzer. Brooklyn scored the first seven points of the third quarter to open a 55-43 lead before Minnesota finally got going, using a 23-7 run to build a 66-62 advantage. The Wolves were ahead 73-71 after three thanks to Wiggins' jumper at the buzzer. ""The thing is, I told them this: `It may not be going our way early but then we've got to make it go our way,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I thought we showed some resiliency in the second half but we talked about how important it is to play for 48 minutes and sometimes you miss some shots."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota fell to 4-9 against Eastern Conference teams. ... The Wolves had won 11 of the last 16 meetings. Nets: Brooklyn played without Caris LeVert, who had been the only Nets player to appear in all 37 games, because of a left groin strain. Atkinson said the injury wasn't serious and hoped LeVert could play Saturday against Boston. ... Atkinson said the Nets couldn't call up Isaiah Whitehead from their G League affiliate to be the backup point guard in LeVert's absence because he was dealing with a knee injury. BETTER BASKETBALL The game matched two of the most improved teams in the NBA through the same number of games as last season. The Wolves came in 24-14, a league-best 12-game improvement over their 12-26 mark. Miami was improved by nine wins, while the Nets were tied for third with Philadelphia after improving by nine wins. The Nets entered 14-23 -- they were 8-29 after 37 games in 2016-17. OKAFOR OK Jahlil Okafor had two points in 11 minutes, his second appearance for the Nets since they acquired him from Philadelphia last month. After the first stint, the team decided to get him back into playing shape before putting him in games again. Okafor had sat out almost all season after falling out of the Sixers' rotation.","400975303"
"MIAMI --  Kelly Olynyk had game-highs in points and rebounds, which was easy to see in the box score. The play of the night wasn't so obvious. Olynyk scored 25 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, Goran Dragic added 24 points and 13 assists and the Miami Heat held off the Detroit Pistons 111-104 on Wednesday -- moving three games over .500 for the first time since April 2016. ""One, that's sobering,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""But it shows you that we're grinding."" That grind was evident in the final minute. Dragic missed a shot with the Heat up three, and Olynyk knew he couldn't grab the rebound. So he tapped it to Josh Richardson to extend the possession, and Dragic wound up setting Olynyk up for a layup 14 seconds later to give Miami a five-point lead and put the game away. ""Kelly's a smart player,"" Dragic said. Richardson scored 22 for Miami, which shot 51 percent and outscored the Pistons 51-27 from 3-point range. James Johnson scored 16, Wayne Ellington had 12 and Hassan Whiteside added 10 for the Heat. ""They were in the paint all night,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""That's what we talked about before the game. So the ball was coming inside out of the paint. They just broke us down on the dribble on pick-and-rolls and on drives."" Tobias Harris led Detroit with 19 points. Reggie Bullock scored 17, Avery Bradley and Boban Marjanovic had 15 apiece, Dwight Buycks scored 14 and Luke Kennard added 13 for the Pistons. The Pistons were without center Andre Drummond, sidelined by bruised ribs. That meant Marjanovic made his first start since the end of the 2015-16 season, when he was with San Antonio. Olynyk and Whiteside are both 7-footers. Marjanovic is listed at 7-foot-3, and he seemed to tower even over the tallest Miami defenders. ""That's one big human being,"" Olynyk said. ""But he's skilled, too."" Marjanovic was 5 for 8 from the field, 5 for 5 from the line, and led Detroit with nine rebounds. It's unclear when Drummond will be back, though soon seems likely. ""It's just a pain tolerance thing,"" Van Gundy said. ""There's no doctor telling him he has to sit out or anything. It's whatever he can tolerate. There's no way to know that."" TIP-INS Pistons: Detroit is 20-16, after being 16-20 at this point a year ago. ... Bullock was 4 for 4 in the third quarter, all from 3-point range. ... This game started a stretch where Detroit plays six of eight on the road. After that, they've got 14 out of 18 at home. Heat: Miami was 17 for 34 from 3-point range. Olynyk and Richardson, Miami's starting forwards, opened a combined 6 of 6 from beyond the arc. ... Miami has now played on 11 Wednesdays (in 12 weeks) this season, but no Thursdays. ... Ellington's 3-pointer with 6:39 left put Miami up for good in a game that had 14 lead changes and 11 ties. INJURY WATCH Bradley returned for Detroit after missing seven games with a hip-groin injury. The Heat got James Johnson back after he sat six of Miami's last seven with bursitis in his right ankle. Miami is still without Justise Winslow (knee) and Dion Waiters (ankle). Detroit will be without Reggie Jackson (ankle) until at least the All-Star break. HIGH TECH Spoelstra was hit with his sixth technical this season, and he cringed when told no coach has more. Van Gundy got one for arguing, insisting he only said ""come on"" to referee James Williams. Van Gundy thinks it was his first technical not accompanied by profanity. ""Definitely the first time I've gotten one for saying `come on,"" he said.","400975304"
"BOSTON --  One by one, the Boston Celtics lined up to embrace Isaiah Thomas. The next time they see their former teammate, he probably won't be in a hoodie after watching the game from the bench. And it won't be so easy. Terry Rozier scored 20 points in 20 minutes, stealing the spotlight from Thomas, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving in a rematch of the Eastern Conference finals and leading the Celtics to a 102-88 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night. Thomas received a standing ovation from the Boston fans but did not play one night after making his season debut in a return from a hip injury. Rozier made sure to pay his respects, and Thomas told the third-year Celtics guard he was proud of him. ""When I first came in the league, that's a guy that I watched a lot. The little things he did on and off the court. Like a big brother to me,"" Rozier said. ""Just to hear those words from him, I'm happy that he's on his way back -- so I can guard him in February."" Rozier scored the last eight Boston points of the first quarter to give the Celtics an 11-point lead, and had another eight in a row midway through the fourth when they expanded the lead to 21. Marcus Smart and Jayson Tatum had 15 points apiece, and Irving and Al Horford each had 11 points and nine rebounds to help Boston to its fourth straight win. James had 19 points, seven rebounds and six assists on 8-for-15 shooting -- the only starter to make more than half of his shots on a team that scored a season-low 88 points. ""Against LeBron, there's nobody that can guard him the whole game. So you have to throw as many bodies at him as you can,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""And then pray."" Tristan Thompson had 10 points and 10 rebounds for Cleveland, which lost for the fourth time in five games. Playing on back-to-back nights -- the Celtics had been preparing for them since New Year's Eve -- Cleveland shot 34.8 percent. It was the first time the teams had played since the season opener, when top Boston free-agent Gordon Hayward broke his leg in a gruesome injury that reshuffled the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Celtics finished with the top seed last year, but lost in the conference finals to Cleveland. And so much has happened since then. Thomas was traded for Irving, then missed the first 36 games of the season with a hip injury before making his season debut on Tuesday night. In that time, he stewed over his departure from Boston, where he developed into an All-Star and fan favorite. ""I don't know who we are or who we can be until we get I.T. back consistently,"" James said. ""Until we get a full dosage of I.T. ... we're trying to figure things out. But we'll be fine."" The Celtics scored seven straight points midway through the first quarter to turn a one-point deficit into a 15-9 lead. They ran off the last five points of the quarter -- all by Rozier -- on a tip-in and a 27-foot 3-pointer just before the buzzer that made it 32-21. DOUBLE TEAMS With the Cavaliers double-teaming their longtime point guard for much of the game, Irving was held under 20 points for the first time since Dec. 10, a span of 11 games. ""Every time he gets doubled, I'm thinking of ways I can help him out, scoring,"" Rozier said. ""He opened up the game for a lot of us."" WELCOME HOME Thomas made his first appearance at the new Boston Garden since the trade, but he did not play. Although he had expressed shock at the trade and held a grudge toward Danny Ainge, who orchestrated it, the relationship between him and the Boston fans remains unblemished. (Thomas also said on Wednesday that he had mended fences with Ainge .) Thomas, who asked the Celtics not to play a video tribute, saying he would prefer to be honored when he was actually playing, got a cheer from the crowd when he joined his teammates on the bench late in the first quarter and made a brief appearance on the video board. At the break, cameras again showed Thomas. And this time, the crowd rose to its feet for a standing ovation. The Cavs guard pounded his heart three times, smiled and gave a little wave before returning to his seat for the start of the second quarter. HAPPY TO BE BACK Thomas said he has a long way to go before he feels like himself on the court. But after his seven-month absence, he said playing Tuesday night against Portland was one of the most special moments of his career. ""There's still movements that I'm scared to do. But it's just because I've been out for so long,"" he said. ""For the most part when you get hurt the mental part is the toughest part. My wind isn't there. I'm not in that good of a shape. Obviously my game isn't where I want it to be, but it showed a positive step in the right direction that I'm not far where I want to be."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Kevin Love left the game early in the fourth quarter with a right ankle sprain. He finished with two points and five rebounds in 21, going 1-for-11 from the floor and missing all four 3-point attempts.. ... Jae Crowder also made his first trip to Boston as a visiting player. He finished with six points and nine rebound son 2-for-12 shooting. ... The Cavaliers are 14-4 over the last 18 matchups against Boston, including two playoff series. Celtics: Seen in the crowd: Gymnast Aly Raisman, Red Sox manager Alex Cora, Red Sox outfielder Mookie Betts, Patriots Dion Lewis and James White and former Patriot Troy Brown. ... Aron Baynes limped to the locker room in the second quarter but returned. He finished with six points.","400975305"
"CHICAGO --  All that DeMar DeRozan wanted to talk about was the lift Toronto's bench provided. As for his recent scoring tear? ""I don't think nothing of it,"" he said. DeRozan had 35 points, Delon Wright set career highs with 25 points and 13 rebounds, and the Raptors beat the Chicago Bulls 124-115 on Wednesday night. DeRozan came up big again after scoring a franchise-record 52 points in a win over Milwaukee on New Year's Day. He was particularly good in the third quarter this time, scoring 18 points after being held to nine in the first half. DeRozan also shot 5 of 8 on 3-pointers and converted all 10 free throws. Wright had his first career double-double and hit four 3s to lead a big effort by the bench. He scored 12 in the second quarter and eight more points in the fourth to help Toronto pull away for its ninth win in 11 games. Serge Ibaka and Kyle Lowry scored 16 apiece for Toronto. Fred VanVleet, from nearby Rockford, added 13 points, and the Raptors' reserves outscored Chicago's 54-39. ""They've been great for us all year,"" DeRozan said. ""We come out slacking. The bench always picks us up, and vice versa. Tonight, the bench did what they've been doing all year, got the energy going. We fed off that, and got back in the game."" He'll get no argument from coach Dwane Casey. ""The bench really saved us tonight,"" he said. ""They gave us energy. We just couldn't get our mojo going with the first unit, but Delon came in and had a career high. I really liked the way he was going after rebounds. His overall game sustained us."" Justin Holiday led Chicago with 26 points, and Lauri Markkanen added 22 points and 12 rebounds. Nikola Mirotic scored 20, but the Bulls dropped their third straight. The Bulls looked sharp early on, with a 10-point lead after the first quarter. But they couldn't sustain their edge on defense and were impatient on offense -- particularly the second unit. ""We were coming out and jacking up contested shots with zero or one pass,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""And you can't have that. So again, that second unit's been pretty darn good for us. Tonight, we struggled with it."" PULLING AWAY Chicago was leading 92-90 early in the fourth when Toronto went on a 16-2 run. Lowry hit a 3 to make it 106-94 with 6:39 remaining, and the Raptors remained in control the rest of the way. LAVINE UPDATE The Bulls hope to decide on a return date for G Zach LaVine early next week. LaVine will travel with the team to games at Dallas and Indiana on Friday and Saturday. Hoiberg said the two-time slam dunk champion will meet with doctors, trainers, management and coaches after the Bulls return home. LaVine averaged 18.9 points in 47 games for Minnesota last season before tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. The Bulls acquired him along with Kris Dunn and Markkanen in the trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Timberwolves. TIP-INS Raptors: Toronto had dropped six straight at Chicago. ... The Raptors were 19 of 19 at the foul line. ... Wright hit 10 of 15 shots. Bulls: Markkanen has led the Bulls in rebounding 13 times and has eight double-doubles. He is averaging 21 points over his last four games. ... C Robin Lopez had 12 points and a career-high six assists. ... Mirotic has scored 20 or more in eight of his 15 games.","400975306"
"MILWAUKEE --  A teammate asked Giannis Antetokounmpo how he felt after a game in which the Milwaukee Bucks star secured his 18th double-double of the season. ""Good rest,"" said Antetokounmpo, shrugging his shoulders as he reached his locker. Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 10 rebounds before getting a well-earned break in the fourth quarter, and the Bucks pulled away for a 122-101 win over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night. Antetokounmpo had his way around the rim with his usual array of dunks and layups, shooting 12 of 18. He clinched his double-double with 1:01 left in the third quarter, passing an offensive rebound to Thon Maker in the corner. Maker hit an open 3-pointer to extend what had been a 10-point halftime lead to a 93-74 edge. It was one of the Bucks' five 3s in the third to put the game out of reach. ""We are still giving up big quarters, to start the first, to start the third,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""Defensively we are in a hole, and offensively we are turning the ball over."" This was just the kind of breather the Bucks needed after losing in overtime at Toronto on New Year's Day, with the dangerous Raptors visiting Milwaukee on Friday. Coach Jason Kidd liked the ball movement after his team had 33 assists, especially in the third quarter. Khris Middleton added 27 points, while Malcolm Brogdon added 17 off the bench for the Bucks. ""We put a huge emphasis on coming out in the third quarter ... and really trying to close it out early,"" Brogdon said. The lead was so safe that Kidd rested Antetokounmpo for the entire fourth quarter. The 6-foot-11 star played just 29 minutes, nine fewer than his season average. Middleton, who averages 37 minutes a night, was also limited to 29 on Wednesday. ""We'd all like to have a game like this when you can keep them under 30 minutes,"" Kidd said. Minus leading scorer Victor Oladipo (24.9 points per game) for a fourth straight game because of a knee injury, the Pacers couldn't keep up with Antetokounmpo's athleticism on both ends of the floor . Domantas Sabonis had a career-high 24 points on 10-of-13 shooting for Indiana, which lost its season-high fifth straight. Darren Collison added 17 points. The Pacers shot just 20 percent (3 of 15) from 3-point range. ""We are in a tough stretch now. We just got to figure it out together as a team somehow, continue to get better,"" Sabonis said. Antetokounmpo had 21 points on 8-of-11 shooting in the first half to help the Bucks build a 62-52 halftime lead. TIP-INS Pacers: The Bucks shot 58 percent overall, the fourth time in five games that Indiana allowed an opponent to make at least half its shots. ... Officials whistled coach Nate McMillan for a technical with 4:57 left in the third quarter following a contested dunk by Antetokounmpo. ... Sabonis led the team in the first half with 14 points after hitting 6 of 8 shots. Bucks: Alley-oop buckets were a staple of the offense early with Antetokounmpo and Bledsoe each connecting on crowd-pleasing dunks in a first quarter that ended with Milwaukee leading 34-26. The Bucks held a 16-10 edge on points in the paint after the first, before the Pacers tried to get more protective around the rim. Antetokounmpo still held a high-flying advantage because of his quickness and length. QUOTABLE ""We can't worry about that. Injuries are a part of it. We definitely miss players when they are out, but we are without Vic and we have to get it done."" -- McMillan on the adjustment to playing without Oladipo. DELLY DISHES Bucks guard Matthew Dellavedova had eight points and nine assists in just 17 minutes. He had his third straight game with at least nine assists, all coming off the bench. ""When he's on the floor, I think all four guys believe they have a chance to score, and that helps,"" Kidd said.","400975307"
"DALLAS --  The Dallas Mavericks were left shaking their heads at Stephen Curry's shot-making ability -- and how they let him get one last great look at the basket. Curry's long 3-pointer with three seconds to play allowed the Golden State Warriors to escape with a 125-122 win over the Mavericks on Wednesday night after blowing a double-digit lead in the final four minutes. On their final possession, the Warriors gave Curry the inbounds pass. A crossover dribble and a screen from Draymond Green were all he needed to get a clean look from 28 feet, which hit nothing but net. Dallas, with a foul to give, didn't take it. ""Too open of a look for a game-winner for the greatest shooter in the game,"" longtime Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki said. Curry finished with 32 points and has 70 in two games since returning from an ankle injury. Golden State's ""Big Four"" combined for 100 points, and the Warriors needed every one of them against a Mavericks team that had won four straight. ""Draymond set a great screen,"" Curry said. ""I caught Yogi (Ferrell) by surprise and was able to get to my spot and knock it down. I have confidence to take the shot and make it and finish the game."" Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson had 25 points each, and Green added 18 to go with 10 rebounds. Wesley Matthews led the Mavericks with 22 points, including seven 3-pointers, and Dwight Powell tied his career high with 21. Dallas, playing from behind most of the game, wouldn't go away despite trailing 114-102 with 4:32 left. Three turnovers by the Warriors and some cold shooting, combined with a sudden hot streak by the Mavs, enabled Dallas to tie the score at 120 on Harrison Barnes' jumper with 39.9 seconds to play. ""I was smiling at the idea that we could be completely brain dead out there,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""All I could do was laugh. It was like grade-school stuff the last few minutes."" Thompson and Barnes traded inside baskets before Curry's big shot in the final seconds. A long heave by Dennis Smith Jr. at the buzzer was way off. Golden State extended its road winning streak to eight games. The Warriors haven't lost away from Oracle Arena since before Thanksgiving. FOUR FOR THE MONEY Not only did the Golden State quartet produce 100 points, but one of the four was always there to step up. Curry scored 20 and Durant 16 in the first half, Green had 15 in the second half, and Thompson had 14 in the fourth quarter. FINALLY A CLOSE ONE Despite their 13-26 record, Dallas has won or played close against most of the NBA's best teams. The one exception had been Golden State, which has won nine in a row and 16 of 17 against the Mavs and had dominated the two previous meetings this season by a combined 45 points. This time, Dallas fought back from deficits of 12 in the first half and nine in the third quarter, taking a lead at 84-83 on Devin Harris' 3-pointer with 3:40 to play in the period. ""This is who we were supposed to be all along,"" Matthews said. ""We don't have a moral victory that we took the champs to a one-possession game. We really felt in our hearts we were supposed to win that one."" TIP-INS Warriors: Played without Andre Iguodala (back and hip strain) and Omri Casspi (back strain). Casspi's injury occurred during the morning shootaround. Kerr said Iguodala would likely play Thursday at Houston. ... Thompson's second-quarter 3 marked the 92nd straight game in which he's made at least one, the third-longest streak in NBA history. Mavericks: Reserve center Nerlens Noel had his cast removed Tuesday following left thumb surgery on Dec. 8. Noel hasn't played since Nov. 22 and has scored just 72 points in 18 games for the team.","400975308"
"DENVER --  The Phoenix Suns didn't get to Denver until around 2 p.m. Wednesday because of plane trouble. They can thank Gary Harris for making their trip even more unbearable. Harris scored 28 of his 36 points in the first half and the Nuggets used a big third quarter to beat Phoenix 134-111 on Wednesday night. Harris tied his career high for points, finishing 14 of 17 from the field. Nikola Jokic added 14 points, nine rebounds and eight assists to help the Nuggets stop a two-game slide and improve to 13-4 at home this season. ""You see how he's aggressive?"" Jokic said of Harris. ""That's how he's supposed to be. That's how he's supposed to play."" Wilson Chandler added 17 points, Trey Lyles had 16 and Jamal Murray 13. Denver used a 37-18 third quarter to take control. Devin Booker led Phoenix with 17 points. Greg Monroe filled in for starting center Tyson Chandler and had 16 points and 10 rebounds. Marquese Chriss added 16 points, Josh Jackson scored 14 and TJ Warren had 13. The Suns had some issues getting to Denver after their 104-103 comeback victory over the Atlanta Hawks in Phoenix on Tuesday night. Waiting at Sky Harbor International Airport until 2 a.m., the Suns were finally sent home as mechanical problems delayed their flight until noon. ""We try not to make no excuses,"" said Phoenix guard Isaiah Canaan, who had 11 points off the bench. ""Obviously, it was a tough travel day. It's part of the game and it's our job. We've got to come out and play no matter what the circumstance is."" Harris hit his first eight shots and finished the opening quarter 9 of 10 from the field. He had 20 points in the first 10:34, including a nifty reverse layup that fooled two defenders. His driving layup late in the quarter put the Nuggets up 34-22. The Suns responded, though, outscoring Denver 45-27 in the final 13:09 of the half. They shot 16 of 21 from the field in the second and led 67-61 at the break. ""They scored so easy,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""I told our guys at halftime, 76 percent, 41 points, a team that had just played three games in four nights -- that is embarrassing. We should all be embarrassed by that. Now let's go do something about it."" Denver took over after that, as the Suns hit only five of their first 28 shots in the third. TIP-INS Suns: Chandler (rest) sat out, while Monroe got the start for his first game action since Dec. 21. ... Jackson, the Suns' first-round draft pick, logged 24 minutes after not playing for the first time this season Tuesday. Nuggets: Monroe blocked Warren at the basket in the final seconds of the first half and Jokic picked it up and heaved a full-court pass to Harris, who tapped in a layup at the buzzer. Harris finished the half 12 of 13 from the field. ... SG Will Barton played despite illness and had 12 points. ... PF Juancho Hernangomez (coach's decision) missed his fourth straight game. The 22-year-old Spaniard has logged only 3 minutes of playing time in the team's last nine games. ... Broncos general manager John Elway sat courtside. ... PF Kenneth Faried had four points and two rebounds in his first action since Dec. 15. EASY CONNECTION With Elway in the house, Jokic showed off an electric passing game of his own. Off a Phoenix turnover late in the third, Jokic flipped a behind-the-back pass down the court to Malik Beasley, who finished it with a wide-open slam. The two also connected on a few other highlight-reel breaks in the half. ""He said to me, `I'm going to run so just find me,"" Jokic said. ""You could see he was running fast."" JET LAG After a 41-point second quarter, the Suns scored only 44 the rest of the way. ""We didn't execute as well,"" Chriss said. ""Lacking energy and being at this altitude you need to lock in a little bit more and we didn't play the way we wanted to play.""","400975309"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The New Orleans Pelicans are ahead of the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference standings but haven't had recent success head-to-head. That changed with a complete performance on Wednesday night. Anthony Davis had 29 points and 15 rebounds, and the Pelicans snapped a five-game losing streak against the Jazz with a 108-98 victory. ""Once we share the basketball and just play for each other on both ends of the floor, then we're a tough team to beat,"" Davis said. ""Sometimes, we play on one end of the floor and not the other. When we play for a full 48 minutes on both ends, then we give ourselves a chance to win every game. ""We owe these guys from last time. ... We've got teams gaining on us for the eight spot, so we've got to create a lead for ourselves, create some separation."" Jrue Holiday carried the offense early with 18 first-half points and finished with 24 for the Pelicans. DeMarcus Cousins added 19 points and 11 rebounds. Donovan Mitchell led the Jazz with 24 points, and Joe Johnson scored 20 off the bench. ""We did a good job of moving the basketball and then I thought we were really good defensively, especially taking away Mitchell after what he did to us the last game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""AD did a great job of trying to take advantage of situations that we had and then our guards did a great job. We just did a really good job of moving the basketball and moving ourselves and not getting spiked, especially down the stretch."" The Pelicans came in ranked 6th in the league in 3-point shooting, and they went 14-for-30 (46.7 percent) from beyond the arc. The Jazz made just 7 of 32 (21.9 percent) from 3-point range. ""When you see teams shoot 50 percent from the 3-point line, roughly, you've got to do a better job of it,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We had some other situations where we just didn't close out just as aggressively enough. ""We weren't aggressive enough defending their handoffs. We weren't aggressive enough on the ball in pick-and-roll. ... There's got to be a sustained effort on those things. It's got to be habitual."" The game went back and forth before the Pelicans closed the third quarter on a 12-1 run, including seven points from Davis. Dante Cunningham's three-point play to start the fourth put New Orleans up by 12, its biggest lead. Utah responded with a 9-0 run, but Davis slammed the door with 10 fourth-quarter points. ""We've got to play with extra energy and play with an assertiveness, and I don't think we did too much tonight,"" Mitchell said. TIP-INS Pelicans: Cousins left with 8 minutes left in the first quarter after an awkward landing. He went to the locker room before returning about three minutes later. Jazz: Jonas Jerebko started at power forward after playing just four minutes in Utah's last game and not at all in the one before that. Snyder has rotated minutes at that spot between Jerebko, Thabo Sefolosha and Ekpe Udoh. PLAYOFF IMPLICATIONS The Jazz and Pelicans face off two more times this season. Utah won the first meeting in December. Snyder said head-to-head matchups with teams competing for similar playoff position carry a little more weight. ""They matter. They matter more when you look back on them,"" Snyder said. ""We play these guys more, too. There's always more of those, so to speak, until you get late in the year. The players are aware. They know the standings and they know where teams are. I do too. ""But for us, I think it would be a mistake to play a game just for that reason. Our challenge is to be true to who we are and our habits and trying to get better. And hopefully the next time you play them, you're better and better and better. And maybe you're in a position where those games actually matter.""","400975310"
"LOS ANGELES --  Russell Westbrook, doing his MVP thing back home. Paul George and Carmelo Anthony lighting it up. All expected. But where did Terrance Ferguson come from? Oklahoma City might have found another potential star Wednesday night in Ferguson, a rookie who scored all 24 of his points in the second half to help the Thunder to a 133-96 victory over the skidding Los Angeles Lakers. Ferguson shot 6 of 9 on 3-pointers and threw down several spectacular dunks as Oklahoma City handed the Lakers their eighth consecutive defeat. He finished 9 of 12 from the field overall. ""Like throwing a pebble in the ocean,"" Ferguson said. ""Pretty good night."" It was the first NBA start for Ferguson, whose previous career high was seven points. ""What you guys saw out there tonight, that's him,"" Anthony said. ""He's hardworking -- day in, day out. Listens, takes advice. Whatever the coach asks him, he gets it done. What you saw wasn't a coincidence."" George, thought to be interested in playing for his hometown Lakers at some point, matched Ferguson with 24 points. Anthony added 21 and Westbrook had 20 points, 12 assists and six rebounds in a successful homecoming. The reigning league MVP was born in Long Beach and went to college at UCLA. There was little of note for the Lakers to point to. After opening the game with a 10-0 run, they were thoroughly outplayed the rest of the night. The Thunder took control in the second quarter, outscoring Los Angeles 37-18. ""I felt like we came out the way we have been playing all year, which is competitive, in the fight and taking it to them,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""Then it felt like we gave in."" The Lakers were led by rookie Kyle Kuzma's 18 points. They shot 41.3 percent from the field, while the Thunder shot 60.2 percent. Oklahoma City led by as many as 39 in the second half as Ferguson began to put on his show. ""We really gave up,"" Kuzma said. ""They took a little lead and we just went to being selfish on the floor. We didn't compete on defense and they killed us."" Oklahoma City finished with 36 assists. TIP-INS Thunder: Despite the additions of George and Anthony this season, Westbrook leads the team in points, rebounds and assists. Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said Westbrook is no longer the young player who came up with Kevin Durant trying to establish himself. ""He is always trying to do what's best for the team. He didn't shoot the ball particularly well early (this season),"" Donovan said. ""He puts a tremendous about of responsibility and ownership on himself as a point guard -- that it's his job to get those guys involved. He was trying to get those guys involved."" Lakers: Julius Randle, thought to be somewhat undersized as a 6-foot-9 power forward, started his fourth consecutive game at center despite the return of Brook Lopez (ankle). Randle had been getting irregular playing time but in his first three starts averaged 20.7 points and 11.3 rebounds while shooting 60 percent from the field. ""Julius has been great all year. He probably deserves more playing time,"" Walton said. ""He's obviously been frustrated with me at times but he's done a really nice job of when he gets called on, does a great job. He produces when he's out there."" ... Rookie point guard Lonzo Ball (shoulder) missed his sixth consecutive game. He is expected to return to practice Thursday. MORE TO COME George insisted Ferguson's big game was no fluke. ""As soon as I got here, I noticed he was a huge talent,"" George said. ""He was very impressive. His work ethic with his natural talent -- the kid is really good. He reminds me of myself a lot early on in the league. Just a sponge trying to take everything in. He's special."" Ferguson was just trying to soak in his breakout night. ""To have a game like that was pretty amazing,"" he said. Ferguson, who opted to play in Australia for one year instead of going to college, said he hadn't had a game like that in a while. ""It felt like I was back in high school,"" he said.","400975311"
"HOUSTON --  Stephen Curry is well aware that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has crafted his team specifically to try and beat the Golden State Warriors. ""As much as he talks about it, yeah it's hard not to,"" Curry said. ""It's pretty ... clear."" But on Thursday night with the Rockets missing the most important piece on their team in James Harden, Chris Paul and his supporting cast were not enough to overcome the defending champions. Curry scored 29 points, Klay Thompson had 28 and the Warriors pulled away late in the fourth quarter for a 124-114 victory. Draymond Green added a triple-double with 17 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists to become the franchise career leader in triple-doubles with 21. It was his second this season to move him past Tom Gola. The Warriors extended their road winning streak to nine games and have won an NBA-best 16 road games this season. The teams stayed close through most of the game, but the Warriors had a seven-point lead with about 3 1/2 minutes left. They scored the next five points, highlighted by a 3 from Curry, to make it 120-109 and send many of the home fans streaming for the exits. The Rockets got 30 points from Eric Gordon, and Gerald Green came off the bench to score 29 and tie a career high with eight 3-pointers as they played their second game without Harden, who is out for at least two weeks with a hamstring strain. ""We've got to get better as a team,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We're just not quite there defensively, communication, all the stuff we can control we're not doing."" The Warriors were short-handed, too, playing without Kevin Durant, who missed the game with strained right calf. But Andre Iguodala returned after sitting out Wednesday night with back and hip strains and had 10 points and eight assists. ""Obviously they were missing their best player without James so we felt like there was an opportunity for us,"" Thompson said. Curry added nine rebounds and five assists and a steal in his third game back after missing 11 with a sprained right ankle. Golden State led by 10 after a dunk by David West with about 7 1/2 minutes remaining. The Rockets scored the next five points, with a 3-pointer from Gerald Green, to get to 108-103, but the Warriors scored the next five points to go up by 10 again. The Warriors were up by 3 after three and opened the fourth quarter with an 8-1 run to make it 101-91 with about 10 minutes left. Chris Paul re-entered the game after that and he helped get things going when he found Gordon for a 3-pointer which started a 7-2 run that cut the lead to 103-98. Paul finished with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. Gerald Green's second 3-pointer in less than a minute put Houston up by two midway through the third quarter. The Warriors scored the next seven points, with a 3-pointer from Thompson, to take a 79-74 lead about a minute later. They didn't stay on top for long though as the Rockets scored the next 11 points to go up 85-79. Gerald Green delighted the crowd when he knocked down a 3 from the corner before being fouled Iguodala and crashing to the ground. He also made the free throw. The Warriors ended a 2 1/2 minute scoring drought on a dunk by Kevon Looney before Curry added a layup. But Gerald Green pushed the lead to 88-83 when he banked in another 3-pointer. The Warriors closed out the quarter with a 10-2 spurt, capped by 3s from Nick Young and Curry, to take a 93-90 lead into the fourth quarter. The Rockets led 63-62 at halftime. TIP-INS Warriors: Omri Casspi missed his second straight game with a strained back. ... Curry played in his 600th career game with the Warriors, making him the 10th player in franchise history to reach that mark. Rockets: Nene normally doesn't play the second game of back-to-back games but was also dealing with a bruised right knee that coach Mike D'Antoni could cause him to miss more time. ... Paul received a technical foul in the fourth quarter. NICE CATCH R&amp;B singer Usher watched the game from a courtside seat next to Golden State's bench and got involved in the action when he caught Trevor Ariza and Curry as they sailed out of bounds and into his seat chasing a loose ball in the third quarter. Usher put his hands up to protect himself as they barreled his way and laughed as he collected himself after the two players got up. ""I think he made it out of that collision all right,"" Curry said. ""I just wanted to make sure his voice was fine. I didn't want to mess with that, that's his moneymaker."" GREEN'S SHOT Gerald Green became the first player in franchise history to make seven or more 3-pointers in consecutive games after he made seven on Wednesday night against Orlando. Golden State coach Steve Kerr raved about the work of Green, who was signed on Dec. 28. ""Gerald Green just kept them in the game almost singlehandedly,"" Kerr said. ""He's one of those guys it seems like you should just leave him open because it's all of the challenged ones that he makes. He makes all these crazy, difficult shots when you're flying at him and then there's some that are open that he misses.""","400975312"
"LOS ANGELES --  This was the plan from the beginning. It just took a little longer to come together than Oklahoma City had hoped. The Thunder added All-Stars Paul George and Carmelo Anthony to MVP Russell Westbrook and waited for the wins to roll up. And then they started 8-12. They've hit their stride now, though, as evidenced by a 127-117 victory Thursday night that ended the Los Angeles Clippers' four-game winning streak. Oklahoma City's ""Big Three"" was on full display: Westbrook had his 13th triple-double of the season with 29 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in his latest homecoming. George scored 31 points and Anthony added 22. They almost dared the Clippers to outscore them. ""Absolutely, when we're on, all three of us hot like that, it's going to result in a lot of wins,"" George said. The Thunder have won eight of their last 10 games. ""We found our rhythm,"" Anthony said. ""We still have some ways to go as a team, but we've figured out how we want to play and who we are."" Despite a rash of injuries, the Clippers had also been playing well. They led by three going into the fourth quarter but then were immediately outscored 12-0, mostly by the Oklahoma City bench. DeAndre Jordan led the Clippers with a season-high 26 points and 17 rebounds. Lou Williams had 26 points and Blake Griffin scored 24, but it wasn't enough to keep up with the Thunder. ""You can't take all three of those guys away,"" Jordan said. ""We just tried to do the best we could making it tough for those guys to score."" TIP-INS Thunder: After scoring 24 points in his first career start Wednesday, rookie G Terrance Ferguson was back in the lineup. Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said he had little concern Ferguson would suddenly grow cocky. ""It's not really who he is,"" Donovan said. ""But I think this is a great opportunity from the standpoint of being able to put behind you (Wednesday) and focus on what's in front of you today."" Ferguson had 11 points against the Clippers. ... G Alex Abrines missed his second consecutive game with a sore groin. Said Donovan: ""We don't feel like it's anything too severe."" Clippers: G Austin Rivers, originally diagnosed with a strained Achilles and expected back quickly, got a second opinion and now has been diagnosed with a bruised heel. The team called it posterior right ankle impingement. ""It's not the best news, obviously,"" said coach Doc Rivers, Austin's father. ""He'll be evaluated in two weeks, which doesn't sound great right now. I think we'll find out a lot more in a couple weeks."" Austin Rivers had started every game he played since the third game of the season. GEORGE AT HOME The star forward has not been shy about his desire to play in his hometown of Los Angeles, particularly for the Lakers. He can become a free agent at the end of the season. ""I can have love for somewhere,"" George said. ""I'm from here. That's a no-brainer. I'm going to be honest. It has nothing with me wanting to be in Oklahoma or not be in Oklahoma. I'm from here and love being here."" ANOTHER INJURY The Clippers were already playing without guards Patrick Beverley (knee surgery) and Austin Rivers (bruised heel), along with injured forward Danilo Gallinari. Now, for the second time this season, Los Angeles has lost starting point guard Milos Teodosic. Teodosic did not return for the second half after aggravating his plantar fasciitis, which previously caused him to miss 22 consecutive games. ""He's day to day,"" Doc Rivers said. ""They will evaluate him tomorrow and we'll see, but it doesn't look great, to be honest.""","400975313"
"MIAMI --  Wayne Ellington attempted 16 3-pointers to set a Miami Heat franchise record, and yes, that was an important element in what happened on Friday night against the New York Knicks. It's not why the Heat won, however. The little plays -- Ellington throwing his body onto the floor to corral a loose ball late in regulation, James Johnson shaking off the sting of an 0-for-7 night to create the turnover that put Miami up for good -- were what mattered most, at least from the Heat perspective. They moved a season-high four games over .500 by holding off the Knicks 107-103 in overtime on Friday night, with Ellington's 24 points leading the way. ""That's the type of team we are,"" Ellington said. ""In order for us to be successful, that's the type of plays we have to make so we're getting down and getting dirty. That's what it's about."" Goran Dragic added 19 for Miami, which set a team record by attempting 42 3-pointers -- as well as a team record by missing 30 of them. Josh Richardson scored 18 and Tyler Johnson added 16 for Miami, which went 19 for 20 from the foul line, 10 for 10 in the fourth quarter and overtime. ""We needed to grind this game,"" Dragic said. ""It was a tough game, but we're happy with the result."" Doug McDermott's 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left in regulation sent the game to overtime, and the Knicks led twice in the extra session. Miami finished the game on a 7-2 spurt, started by a 3 from Ellington with 2:22 remaining. Courtney Lee scored 24 for New York, which got 20 from Michael Beasley -- who missed most of overtime after turning his ankle -- and 15 from Kristaps Porzingis. The Knicks lost despite shooting 49 percent and holding the Heat to 40 percent. ""It's just how it goes sometimes,"" Porzingis said. ""On to the next one."" The game was tied for the 15th and final time with a half-minute left, when James Johnson managed to break up Jarrett Jack's pass from near the top of the key for a turnover. That led to Richardson making two free throws a few seconds later, the Knicks missed two shots in the last 13 seconds and Miami survived. ""For competitors only,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""They live for those moments."" The Knicks were down 10 early in the third, but went on runs of 7-0 and 9-0 on the way to taking an 86-80 lead midway through the fourth. Miami scored the next six, getting back-to-back 2-pointers from Ellington -- a rarity for him, but they were needed. That set up a back-and-forth in the final minutes of regulation, where the Knicks took the lead three times, Miami kept answering and McDermott sent it to overtime -- where, after four more lead changes and two more ties, the Heat finished it off. ""These games, right here, show character,"" Ellington said. TIP-INS Knicks: Tim Hardaway Jr., still out with a leg injury, warmly greeted several Heat broadcasters pregame. Tim Hardaway Sr. is one of three Heat players to have his Miami jersey retired, and his son is well-regarded by the franchise. ... The Knicks didn't make a 3-pointer until Porzingis connected about 3 minutes into the third quarter. They were 5 for 13 from deep. Heat: Miami has won its last 10 January games. ... The three-game winning streak matches a season-best for Miami. ... Derrick Jones Jr. became the 239th player to get time in a Heat uniform, and the 238th to score. WAITERS WATCH Heat guard Dion Waiters has sought a second opinion on his sprained left ankle -- which could be an indicator that he may not wait until the offseason for surgery. Officially, his status hasn't changed. ""He's still doing his rehab, he's doing his treatment,"" Spoelstra said. Friday was the fifth game Waiters missed since aggravating the sprain, which has bothered him since March. BEASLEY COMMENTS Beasley was drafted No. 2 overall by the Heat in 2008, and had three stints in Miami. He raised some eyebrows this week when telling the New York Post he thought Spoelstra could have believed in him more. Said Spoelstra, who remains fond of Beasley: ""Jeez, Beas, you threw me under the bus, man."" Beasley tried to defuse it pregame as well, saying, ""I love Spo.""","400975314"
"PHILADELPHIA -- Joel Embiid palmed a basketball he had just autographed high over his head and feigned like he would drop it to one of the kids that had circled the 7-footer on the court. With a victory celebration waiting in the locker room, Embiid, a noted soccer nut, took one step and punted the ball into the stands. He did far worse harm kicking the basketball life out of the Pistons. Embiid and Ben Simmons almost outproduced Detroit in the first half and sparked the 76ers to a mammoth lead even they couldn't blow in a 114-78 romp on Friday night. Embiid had 23 points and nine rebounds. Simmons had 19 points and nine assists to lead the Sixers to their fourth straight win, which moved them back to .500. With 2 minutes left in the first half, Embiid and Simmons had combined for 26 points on 12-of-19 shooting. The Pistons had 26 points on 11-of-38 shooting. The 76ers have a nasty habit of blowing double-digit leads that crushed their push toward a more respectable spot in the standings. They wasted an 18-point lead in a loss to Portland. The Sixers turned a 22-point edge into a loss against Toronto. And they led by 16 points before Sacramento beat them. ""I truly believe that we're headed in the right direction, and I felt that even when we were losing,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""It doesn't get much attention when you lose."" The Sixers opened the game on a 15-2 run and, unlike their December collapses, they never let this one get close. They led 97-61 through three. Embiid waved his arms toward fans as they chanted ""Trust the Process!"" a motto that surely had to grate at Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy. Gundy was one of the more vocal critics of Philadelphia's maligned rebuild and said in 2014 the strategy was ""embarrassing."" ""If you're putting that roster on the floor, you're doing everything you can possibly do to try to lose,"" Van Gundy said. True. And that was the point of the method to tank seasons. While the Sixers have mostly collected duds in the first round of the draft (Jahlil Okafor, Michael Carter-Williams, Nerlens Noel) under their plan, Embiid and Simmons are the Powerball payoff for the franchise. Simmons, the No. 1 pick of the 2016 draft, did not attempt a 3-pointer and shot only one free throw. He didn't need to do much more as he dominated in the paint. ""He was on a mission,"" Brown said. ""He physically was as impressive as I've seen him."" The 76ers sell ""Ben &amp; Jo"" shirts as part of the promotional push to earn them each their first All-Star berths. ""I like my chances,"" Embiid said. ""If I make the All-Star Game, good. But I want to win. I want to be in the playoffs."" Simmons -- who has no jump shot -- backed defenders in the paint and spun around them for easy buckets. Embiid plowed his way to the rim and even buried a 3 in the second half. The move of the night? Hard to pick one when each play was more GIF-worthy than the last in the first half. Embiid made Dwight Buycks look like a JV player when he handled the ball at the top of the arc and used his left shoulder to knock back the guard two times before he tossed up a prayer and made the bucket. Simmons hustled toward a loose ball in the second quarter, ran a tightrope down the sideline as he tried to regain his footing and curved toward the baseline to throw down a two-handed dunk that sent the crowd into a frenzy. Simmons even flexed for the crowd, one more performance worthy of the Big Ben moniker that will surely be crowned on him next week when the Sixers play in London. ""I want to go out there and put on a show,"" Embiid said. TIP-INS Pistons: At least no one was injured. 76ers: This game had the feel of a pep rally. Julius Erving rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell. Even with temps in the low teens, Sixers fans went nuts when they all won a free fast-food frozen dessert in the fourth. And ""E-A-G-L-E-S"" chants rang out throughout the fourth quarter. ROUGH NIGHT Tobias Harris led the Pistons with 14 points. Langston Galloway, who starred at nearby Saint Joseph's, scored 11 points. ""We never had even a good 2-minute stretch in the game,"" Van Gundy said.","400975315"
"BOSTON --  Defense dominated as Boston went back-and-forth with Minnesota for three quarters. The fourth belonged to the Celtics, who pulled away early in the final period and held off the Timberwolves 91-84 on Friday night. ""We just stuck with it and the defense came and gave us a victory,"" said Marcus Smart, who led Boston with 18 points. ""Tonight was one of those games where every last one of us from the starters to the guys coming in off the bench were ready."" Smart scored 16 in the second half and fellow reserve Terry Rozier finished with 14 points for the Celtics, whose bench outscored Minnesota's 42-20. ""We played pretty good defense tonight. That's what pushed us over at the end,"" said Rozier, who added nine rebounds. ""Once we locked in on the defensive end, we were fine. Create our offense by creating defense."" Kyrie Irving had 16 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, Aron Baynes had 11 points and 10 rebounds and Jaylen Brown also scored 11 for Boston, which has won five straight and six of seven. Karl-Anthony Towns led the Timberwolves with 25 points and a career-high 23 rebounds. Jimmy Butler scored 14, Jamal Crawford had 13 points and Andrew Wiggins scored 10 for Minnesota, which lost back-to-back games for the first time since November. ""I think we did a pretty good job defensively making it hard on them. We just didn't make the shots we needed to make,"" Towns said. ""We fought very hard offensively. It just was a funky night for us."" Boston had a rough night shooting, going 38 for 94 (40.4 percent) and making just 6 of 36 3-pointers. Minnesota also struggled, shooting 36.8 percent from the field. ""They are a good team,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You've got to play 48 minutes against them to win. We didn't do that. We had a little lull at the start of the fourth."" The Timberwolves, coming off a 98-97 loss at Brooklyn on Wednesday, faded early in the fourth after leading by as many as seven in what had been a tight game. The lead changed 14 times before Boston went up for good in the final period. Irving drove for a layup with one second left in the third, starting a 10-2 run that allowed the Celtics to start pulling away. Baynes scored Boston's first four points of the final period, and Rozier banked in a shot and then added a 3-pointer with 8:02 left that gave the Celtics a 77-68 lead. Boston continued its run, getting a dunk by Baynes followed by a steal by Smart that started a fast break and sent Smart to the line for two free throws that pushed the lead to 85-73 with 6:05 remaining. PLAYING SMART Boston coach Brad Stevens said Smart is a luxury to have coming off the bench for the Celtics. He scored 16 on Wednesday night as Boston beat Cleveland 102-88 in a rematch of the 2017 Eastern Conference finals, and then led Boston in scoring Friday when the Celtics needed a late push to pull away from Minnesota. ""Sometimes when we're struggling, I think the ball is going to find energy. And Marcus Smart has energy,"" Stevens said. ""He's playing at a good level. We need him to continue to do so. Obviously, he's a really important part of our team."" REBOUNDING WOES Towns pulled down more than half of the Timberwolves' 43 rebounds, and no other Minnesota player had more than four as Boston dominated the glass 56-43. ""We've just got to make a conscious effort to go get them. We can't just rely on Kat (Towns) to get every single rebound,"" Butler said. ""He did a great job of it, but we've got to help him. He can't be everywhere on the floor."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Hadn't lost back-to-back games since Nov. 19 against Detroit and the following night at Charlotte. ... Lost their 11th straight at Boston. ... Towns had a double-double by halftime with 14 points and 13 rebounds in the first two quarters. His previous career high was 22 rebounds against Houston last Feb. 25, and the most he pulled down this season was 19 against Oklahoma City on Oct. 27. Celtics: Aren't home again until Jan. 16, a stretch that includes a game in London against Philadelphia on Jan. 11. ... Boston swept the two games against Minnesota last season. ... The Celtics shot 20 percent (3 for 15) from 3-point range in the first half.","400975316"
"MILWAUKEE --  Banished to the bench with two fouls less than 90 seconds into the game, Jonas Valanciunas provided little help in the first half for the Toronto Raptors. He sure made up for it in the third quarter. Valanciunas scored all of his 20 points in the decisive third quarter and Toronto beat the Milwaukee Bucks for the second time this week, 129-110 on Friday night. ""He was a beast down there, man,"" Milwaukee center John Henson said. Toronto outscored Milwaukee 43-19 in the third quarter to win its fourth consecutive game, including a 131-127 overtime victory over the Bucks on Monday. The Raptors have won 10 of 12. ""He didn't get off to a good start, but starting the second half he was masterful how he was getting position, using his size and strength in the paint and just doing a good job of rebounding the ball,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey said of his 7-foot center. Valanciunas picked up two fouls in the first 86 seconds of the game and was held scoreless without taking a shot in just five minutes during the first half. He played the entire third quarter, going 8 of 9 and grabbing nine of his 13 rebounds, as the Raptors extended a two-point halftime lead to 104-78. ""It happens, you know, a quick two fouls,"" he said. ""I don't look for special motivation, I'm always motivated to play hard. That's what I did in the third quarter."" Despite sitting most of the first half, he had little trouble finding his rhythm to open the third quarter. ""You've got to stay ready for 48 minutes,"" he said. ""When you're a pro, you can't relax and you can't look at what had happened. You have to look at where you can get an advantage and where you can do some damage. That's what I was thinking about."" Toronto made 17 of 25 shots in the quarter and outrebounded the Bucks, 18-2. The Raptors outscored Milwaukee 27-9 in the final six minutes of the quarter. ""It just seemed like we took a step back when they turned it up,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""We kind of like gave in."" Serge Ibaka scored 17 of his team-high 21 points in the first half, and DeMar DeRozan, who scored 52 points in the Raptors' win over Milwaukee on Monday, had 14 of his 20 in the third. Valanciunas and DeRozan combined to make 14 of 16 shots and score 34 points in the third. DeRozan, Valanciunas and Kyle Lowry, who had 16 points, all rested in the fourth quarter. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 24 points for the Bucks. Malcolm Brogdon had 19 and Eric Bledsoe added 17. Lowry hit a 27-footer to give Toronto the lead for good at 58-57 with 1:37 left in the second quarter. The Raptors led 61-59 at halftime. FOCUS ON DEROZAN The Bucks often double-teamed DeRozan to open the game after he scored a career high against them on Monday night. ""It was expected by me, by us as a team,"" DeRozan said. ""We made little adjustments once we felt it in the first quarter."" VOTE ""WELL-DESERVED"" Kidd said Antetokounmpo leading the NBA in All-Star Game fan voting was ""well deserved. It shows all his hard work. He is a guy that everyone wants to see play, no matter whether you're in Milwaukee or on the road."" Antetokounmpo had 836,416 votes in the first round of voting, just ahead of LeBron James, who had 856,080. TIP-INS Raptors: It was Toronto's final trip to the BMO Harris Bradley Center. The team finished 17-25 in regular-season games. A new Bucks arena is set to open next season. ... Toronto had 18 second-chance points to Milwaukee's five. Bucks: Toronto's 43 points in the third quarter were the most allowed by Milwaukee in a quarter this season.","400975317"
"DALLAS --  Kris Dunn, Justin Holiday and the Chicago Bulls kept making free throws in the final minute. Somehow, the Dallas Mavericks kept getting closer. Only after Yogi Ferrell's desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer fell short could the Bulls finally celebrate a 47-point fourth quarter Friday night and a frantic 127-124 victory over the Mavericks after leading by 10 with 68 seconds to go. Dunn scored a career-high 32 points and Holiday added 23 for the Bulls, who made all 13 free throws in the final 1:08 but still gave Dallas a chance because the Mavericks had three-point possessions four times while pressing full court and fouling after every bucket. A turnover helped also as the teams combined for 35 points in that final sequence. The Mavericks allowed a franchise record in points for any quarter. ""When you have a 10-point lead with about a minute to go, you've got to find a way to get a couple of stops,"" said Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg, whose team started the fourth with a 10-0 run. ""But it's a really good win coming down here against a team that's been really hot, rolling."" Nobody figured to be saying that about either team a month into the season. But it was a fittingly close game for teams having remarkably similar seasons -- almost the same record after miserable starts followed by respectable recoveries that pulled each out of last in its conference. The Bulls (14-25) were 3-20 before a seven-game winning streak that sparked an 11-5 record since the woeful start. The Mavericks (13-27), who started 2-14, just had their best winning streak of the season stopped at four by Stephen Curry's 3-pointer in the final seconds of Golden State's 125-122 victory in Dallas. Oh, and the Mavericks were down 12 with 4 1/2 minutes left in that loss. ""We are falling into some bad habits playing these windshield-wiper games,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We just need to take a hard look at it."" Wesley Matthews scored 24 points and Harrison Barnes had 23 for the Mavericks, who were outscored 47-36 in the fourth. Rookie Lauri Markkanen had 16 with an emphatic follow-up dunk during a 16-4 surge that put the Bulls up 114-104 with 1:08 to play. Dunn started that run with a jumper and finished it with his ninth assist for Nikola Mirotic's layup. The Mavericks fouled the Bulls eight times in the final minute-plus, hoping the Bulls would miss but they never did. Still, Dallas chipped away. Matthews hit all three free throws after a foul from behind the arc. Dwight Powell had a three-point play. Dennis Smith Jr. had a steal and dunk along with a pair of 3s, the latter after he missed from long range but hit an even longer shot after an offensive rebound by Barnes to get within 125-124. After a Chicago timeout, Dallas quickly fouled Holiday, who made both free throws with 2.6 seconds left before Ferrell's miss from the left wing after a long inbound pass was relayed to him. Holiday had eight of the late free throws, and Dunn three. Smith scored 10 of his 15 points in the final 44 seconds. Dirk Nowitzki scored 19 points and was 3 of 3 from long range, including one to give the Mavericks their final lead at 100-98. TIP-INS Bulls: Hoiberg said G Zach LaVine (left knee) was still on schedule for his possible season debut in about a week. LaVine had a light day of shooting and will get another full workout Saturday. ... Dunn, in his second season, topped his previous best of 24 on Nov. 28 against Phoenix. He had a game-high four steals. ... Mirotic had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Mavericks: Matthews had his second straight 20-point game, matching his previous total for the season. ... J.J. Barea had 11 points and nine assists. ... The previous franchise record for points in a quarter was 46, both times in the fourth. The most recent was Jan. 19, 1996, a 129-124 win at home against Boston. ON TARGET Holiday (5 of 6) and Dunn (4 of 5) combined to go 9 of 11 from 3-point range as the Bulls shot 50 percent (14 of 28) from beyond the arc. Chicago shot 68 percent in the first quarter and 56 percent for the game. The Mavericks shot 53 percent, the sixth time in eight games they've shot at least 50 percent after doing so just twice before that. WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN Early in the frantic final minute, Powell was called for his sixth foul after he won a battle for a loose ball against Denzel Valentine. Powell finished the play with a dunk, and the Mavericks weren't happy with the call. Dallas was down 116-110 at that point. Powell finished with 13 points after matching his career high with 21 against the Warriors.","400975318"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Looking for some extra offense with two of their top scorers out, the Spurs turned to their defense. Kawhi Leonard and Manu Ginobili each scored 21 points and San Antonio set a season high in steals in beating the Phoenix Suns 103-89 on Friday night. Playing without starters LaMarcus Aldridge, who sat out for rest, and an injured Danny Green, the Spurs responded by scoring 29 points off 23 turnovers. San Antonio had 15 steals and six blocks, fueling a 31-13 advantage in fast-break points. ""It's their active hands,"" Phoenix coach Jay Triano said. ""They trace the ball, they chart deflections. Their hands are always in the pot. They don't let you make a pass on time and on target and they take a lot of pride in that."" Leonard was at the forefront of the defensive effort. The two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year set a season high with three blocks and tied his season best with four steals. Leonard ran down Devin Booker from behind to block a layup early in the first quarter and minutes later stepped in front of Tyson Chandler for a steal that led to a breakaway dunk. ""Kawhi is getting to look more and more like himself every game,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. It was Leonard's eighth appearance after missing the season's first 27 games with right quadriceps tendinopathy. Leonard had eight points during a 26-3 run after San Antonio fell behind by eight points two minutes into the second quarter. ""He's just starting to get into his groove offensively,"" Triano said. ""He's got the midrange, he can shoot the 3. He's strong, so if you've got a lighter defender, he can go past them. He's got to be the focus of your defense and then that opens him making plays for others and them being able to shoot the ball."" Ginobili also drew the Suns' attention, scoring 15 points in a decisive third quarter. ""I totally respect what he's doing out there,"" Chandler said. ""It seems like whenever we got close he hit every big shot. He's been doing that consistently for the last 19 years."" Ginobili joined Vince Carter as the only 40-year-old players to score 20 points off the bench. He shot 7 for 10 from the field in setting a season high for points. ""He's something else,"" Popovich said. ""Whatever he's drinking, I want some of it. I'm serious. There's got to be a fountain of youth someplace."" Booker had 21 points and Marquese Chriss added 12 for Phoenix, which lost its ninth straight in San Antonio. Booker finished 8 for 17 from the field after shooting 5 for 7 in the opening quarter. ""They put a bunch of different bodies on me,"" Booker said. ""I had (Bryn) Forbes on me at one point. Kawhi was guarding me a little bit. Throwing different looks. First half, I got open a few times. Second half, it was all double teams."" TIP-INS Suns: F T.J. Warren did not play after being listed as questionable due to an illness. Phoenix was also without F Jared Dudley (illness). ... The Suns have made a 3-pointer in 1,099 consecutive games since March 29, 2004. It's the second-longest streak in NBA history to Dallas' 1,108 straight from Feb. 27, 1999, to Dec. 12, 2012. ... The Spurs have won 12 of the last 13 in the series. Phoenix's last win in San Antonio was Feb. 27, 2013. Jermaine O'Neal had 22 points in the 105-101 victory. Spurs: Aldridge has missed only two games this season, both for rest. ... Green missed his second straight game and seventh overall with tightness in his left groin. ... Joffrey Lauvergne exited with 2:56 left in the first half after colliding nose to forehead with Chriss, but returned to the Spurs bench midway through the third quarter. He played seven minutes in the fourth, finishing with three points and six rebounds in 15 minutes. OFFSEASON NON-WORKOUTS Ginobili was asked if he prepared for the season any differently considering he has had such a dynamic start to his 16th season. ""Very different this year,"" Ginobili said. ""I didn't do anything. I thought I was going to retire and I took a two-month vacation. So, if you want to look that I worked out? No. I just went to Spain for 47 days thinking I wasn't going to come back, but then mid-August and September and October, I tried to work hard because I knew it was going to be hard."" Ginobili is averaging 8.5 points, but has been active on both ends and has been dunking like he did in his first years in the league. BOOKER FAN Popovich praised Booker before and after the game, calling the 21-year-old a great player. ""I thought we did a pretty good on him,"" Popovich said. ""Lost him here and there, but he's a special kid.""","400975319"
"DENVER --  Trey Lyles was considered expendable by Utah on draft night in June. He did his best to show the Jazz it was a mistake to let him go. Lyles scored a career-high 26 points, Jamal Murray also had 26 points and the Denver Nuggets beat Utah 99-91 on Friday night. Lyles also grabbed seven rebounds. He averaged 21 points and 7.5 rebounds in the two home games against his former team to help the Nuggets split the season series with the Jazz. ""Trey, he's got an opportunity to play right now and he's taking advantage of it,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""We felt he's a really good player. There's part of you, I'm happy to see him playing well. I wish we would have done better against him tonight. But he worked hard for us and I think we put a lot of time in trying to help him get better."" Lyles didn't play in seven of the first 10 games of the season but has become a key reserve after Paul Millsap went down with a left wrist injury in November. He has scored in double figures in 12 of the last 13 games, but saved his best performance for his former team. ""I went out there with the mindset to just play the game,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter who it's going against; luckily it was against them. Another game in the books for me."" Lyles and Murray, both members of the Canadian national team, each scored seven points in the third when Denver outscored the Jazz 38-16 after trailing by three at halftime. ""We were taking the ball out of the net the whole time when a team scores 38 points on you,"" Snyder said. Donovan Mitchell had 15 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, Ricky Rubio also scored 15 points and Derrick Favors had 14 points and 10 rebounds for Utah. The Jazz have lost 12 of 15 since starting the season 13-11. The game was tied at 56 when Murray hit a 3-pointer, was fouled and made the free throw to start a 20-5 Denver run. Nikola Jokic, who missed his first four shots of the third quarter, capped the run with his first 3-pointer to give the Nuggets a 76-61 lead with 3:37 left in the third. ""We just started locking down defensively,"" Lyles said. ""We made it hard for them to score and get what they wanted. When we play defense like that we can score with the best of them."" Lyles converted a three-point play to extend the lead to 17, and Will Barton's 3-pointer in the final minute of the period gave Denver an 84-65 lead heading into the fourth. The lead was 21 early in the fourth before Utah made a run to close within eight in the final minute. TIP-INS Jazz: Nuggets president Josh Kroenke played for Snyder at Missouri from 1999-2004. ""Josh was my first recruit,"" Snyder said. ""You could count on Josh to do what he could do to help you win a game. That's probably the best compliment you can give a player, and that's how he's running his team."" ... C Rudy Gobert will have his injured left knee reevaluated next week. He has been out since Dec. 15. ... Utah lost for the third time when holding an opponent to fewer than 100 points. Nuggets: Barton was feeling better after battling flu-like symptoms the past couple of days. He finished with 12 points and eight assists. ... G Gary Harris had 13 points two days after matching his career high of 36. HEALTH PLAN Barton's illness hasn't spread to the rest of the team but Nuggets coach Michael Malone isn't taking any chances. ""Everybody's got hand sanitizer, there's emergency packets for everybody to use,"" Malone said. ""I'm not shaking anybody's hand; stay away from me. It is that time of year. Guys are getting sick and if you can do anything to kind of control it and not let it spread throughout the locker room is really important, because it can wipe a team out pretty quickly.""","400975320"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Washington Wizards' 15-point lead in the fourth quarter was enough to claim their fourth straight victory. Barely enough. The Wizards weathered a late rally by Memphis to escape with a 102-100 win on Friday night. Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 34 points, while fellow guard John Wall added 25 points and nine assists. ""We stopped being aggressive, and I think we kind of slowed the pace down instead of pushing it,"" Beal said of allowing Memphis to get back into the game, adding: ""We settled for some tough shots, a lot of contested ones down the stretch versus getting out in transition and continuing to play the same way we had played the whole game."" That change of pace for Washington came following an advantage that reached 17 in the third quarter and was still sitting at 15 with just under 9 minutes left. But Memphis used eight straight points to cut the deficit to seven points, then later crafted a 10-1 rally to pull within 98-97 on Tyreke Evans' 3-pointer with 18 seconds left. Meanwhile, the Wizards made only 2 of 16 shots in the fourth. But Memphis couldn't overtake the Wizards the rest of the way, and a pair of free throws by Markieff Morris with 3 seconds remaining provided enough cushion for Washington to escape. Morris finished with 12 points and matched his career high with 17 rebounds. ""We've got to stop digging holes,"" Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""You've got to give the guys a ton of credit for continuing to fight and continuing to battle back. . But we have to correct the errors that put us in those holes. We shouldn't be down 15 at any point."" Evans led Memphis with 26 points, while Marc Gasol finished with 17 points and 11 rebounds. Mario Chalmers had 13 points. Despite Wall and Beal combining to connect on 17 of 34 shots, Washingston still shot 39 percent for the game. ""To win on the road shooting 39 percent means we played the defense it takes to win,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. TIP-INS Wizards: F Mike Scott, who was shooting 66 percent (76 of 115) over the previous 14 games, made his first three shots and finished the night 4 of 6. ... Morris recorded his second double-double of the season. The first came in the Wizards' previous game Wednesday against the Knicks. ... Morris had 17 rebounds against Dallas on Dec. 6, 2012, when he was a member of the Phoenix Suns. ... Beal has recorded at least 30 points in seven games this season. Grizzlies: Memphis finished a 10-game stretch in which it didn't play consecutive games in the same city. Seven of those were on the road. . Memphis is 1-12 against the Eastern Conference, with the only win coming Dec. 15 over Atlanta. ... G Andrew Harrison sat out with a left shoulder injury. ... Evans has 12 games scoring at least 25 points. ... Memphis had 21 fast-break points, the seventh game this season in which it recorded at least 20. The Grizzlies had only seven games of at least 20 in all of the 2016-17 season. CONLEY STATUS Memphis guard Mike Conley, who hasn't played since Nov. 13, said before the game there is no timetable for his return from a left Achilles tendon injury. He continues to work on non-contact drills ""to try and see how much the Achilles can take."" Asked about whether he will return this season, he replied, ""I can't see how I wouldn't. I'm very confident I'll be suiting up at some point."" JUMPIN' JOHN WALL Chasing a loose ball near the end of the first half, Wall ended up having to leap seated photographers on the baseline and two rows of fans -- a move that caused some to catch their breath since Wall has missed 10 games this year with a sore left knee. ""It wasn't a good sight for me to watch,"" Brooks said, adding: ""I am glad he popped up."" As for Wall, he took the hurdling in stride. ""That's a little bit of my track in me,"" the guard said. ""(Brooks) was scared. I did long jump, so I think I'm all right.""","400975321"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard believes Portland's offense is finally finding a flow after an early season focus on defense. ""It takes time,"" he said. ""Typically we were a really good offensive team, and we were not a great defensive team. This year we came in and we've been really good on defense. I think our offense has been set back, I guess, and it's taken a little bit longer to find that rhythm and for guys to understand what plays need to be made, when to make the extra pass, who to make that extra pass to. But we're figuring it out."" CJ McCollum led Portland with 20 points and Lillard added 14 in a 110-89 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night. Al-Farouq Aminu also had 14 and the Blazers snapped a three-game losing streak to the Hawks at the Moda Center. Seven of Portland's players were in double figures and the team had a season-high 30 assists. Dennis Schroder had 14 points for the Hawks, who trailed by as many as 25 points in fourth quarter. Atlanta has lost three of its last four games. It was not known whether Lillard would play against the Hawks because of a calf injury, but he started. He had missed four games with a sore right hamstring before playing 33 minutes and scoring 25 points in a 127-110 loss at Cleveland on Tuesday. ""He gave them a spark at certain times,"" Atlanta's Taurean Prince said. ""He didn't score 30 or anything but the things that he did helped his teammates. He's a good player so we expected him to make a difference."" Lillard, who sat the fourth quarter, finished with six assists, as did McCollum. Coach Terry Stotts said ball movement has been key. ""It's three games in a row where our passing has been improved and we've just got to continue that. Our passing has been below average for most of the season, so it's encouraging between Chicago and Cleveland and tonight, that we're making some passes,"" Stotts said. The Blazers went on a 12-2 run to take an early 20-12 lead. Portland led by as many as 12 points in the opening half, but Atlanta got back within 45-43 on Schroder's layup. After a brief dustup where words were exchanged between Prince and Jusuf Nurkic, the Blazers went on to a 52-46 lead at halftime. McCollum led all scorers with 16 points. Prince had a 3-pointer in the first half to extend his streak to 20 straight games with a 3. Aminu's driving layup gave the Blazers an 80-63 lead late in the third quarter. ""They played well but I think we've got to do more to make it hard on them, we've got to do more to make them uncomfortable,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I don't know what they shot in the third quarter, what they scored, but I just felt like we just didn't get any stops."" McCollum's 3-pointer and Pat Connaughton's layup pushed Portland's lead to 91-68 early in the fourth. Stotts sent his all of his starters to the bench at the start of the fourth quarter except for McCollum, who played for just over five minutes before he took a seat as well.

"LOS ANGELES --  With three wins in four stops on a leisurely paced road trip, the Charlotte Hornets unexpectedly hit their stride in California. The Los Angeles Lakers are still stumbling around. Kemba Walker had 19 points and seven assists, and the Hornets wrapped up a solid trip with their first back-to-back victories since Thanksgiving, beating the spiraling Lakers 108-94 on Friday night. Jeremy Lamb scored 17 points and Marvin Williams added 16 for the Hornets, who won three of four in the Golden State, including a shocking win over the Warriors to kick off the trip. The Hornets wrapped up the road swing by emphatically avenging their home loss to the Lakers last month. ""We'll take it all day long,"" associate head coach Stephen Silas said. ""It was a great trip."" Six players scored in double figures for Charlotte, which has won four of six overall. Dwight Howard had 15 points and 10 rebounds while the Hornets had little trouble staying ahead of the Lakers after the opening minutes. Charlotte took a 16-point lead in the first half and stretched it to 21 in the third quarter. ""It means a lot, because we've really been struggling on the road before this trip,"" said Silas, whose team lost 12 of its first 16 road games this season. ""To come on the road and get three wins, especially in the West, it's really big for us. Hopefully we can carry home the momentum from this trip."" Lonzo Ball had 11 points and five assists in his first game since Dec. 23 for the Lakers, who have lost nine straight since Dec. 20. The rookie point guard missed six games with a sprained left shoulder, and he returned in limited minutes while rebuilding his strength. The Lakers' faithful fans are even growing frustrated in what looks like a fifth consecutive losing season. They booed the Lakers after Lamb's uncontested alley-oop dunk on a fast break put the Hornets up by 25 early in the fourth quarter. ""They got hot and really never stopped making shots,"" Brandon Ingram said. ""Eventually you get tired of losing. I think a lot of guys on this team are used to winning."" Ingram had 22 points and a career-high 14 rebounds, but Los Angeles dropped to 1-12 since winning at Charlotte on Dec. 9. The Lakers (11-27) are in last place in the Western Conference. ""Early in the year, if we had off shooting nights like we've had a lot of, we were still right in ballgames because we were defending our tails off,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""The biggest thing we need to get back to is playing defense like that. We're going to get back to being a good defensive team, no matter what it takes."" TIP-INS Hornets: Frank Kaminsky scored 12 points. He also got a technical foul in the fourth quarter for arguing a call. ... Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added 13 points and eight rebounds. Lakers: Brook Lopez scored 11 points in his second game back from an eight-game absence with a sprained ankle. ... Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez watched the game at courtside, as did comedian John Mulaney. GETTING SHOTS The Lakers are the NBA's worst 3-point shooting team, and they went 9 for 36 against the Hornets. At least they improved the NBA's worst free-throw shooting percentage by going 9 for 12. HI DWIGHT Howard received the thunderous boos that have greeted him at Staples Center ever since he completed his single season with the Lakers in 2013 by spurning them to sign a free-agent deal with the Rockets. The Lakers haven't made the playoffs since he left, enduring the worst half-decade in franchise history. ""I don't think about it,"" Howard said. ""At some point, they get over it. ... I had a good time. I thought I played very well, despite just coming off of back surgery and also tearing a labrum, which I guess means nothing to people. Other than that, it's always fun to come here and play in LA.""","400975323"
"LOS ANGELES --  Points came easily for Steph Curry on Saturday. Eleven in his first five minutes, 17 before the game was 8 1/2 minutes old. ""I just wanted to start off the game right,"" Curry said. ""It's obviously weird starting a game at 12:30 (p.m.). You've got to find that energy and something to build momentum, especially early."" He finished with a season-high 45 points without playing the fourth quarter and the Golden State Warriors ran away from the Los Angeles Clippers 121-105 for their fourth straight victory. ""I knew right away, when I got free for a couple of threes in the first quarter and they went down, I got in a rhythm,"" Curry said. ""Beyond that, you just keep your head down and keep shooting and stay aggressive."" Curry took advantage of the guard-depleted Clippers, making 11 of 21 shots, including 8 of 16 3-pointers, going against rookie Juwan Evans and G-League call-up Tyrone Wallace. In the four games since missing 11 with an ankle injury, Curry has averaged 36 points on 58 percent shooting, 54 percent beyond the arc. ""He's been on fire. Maybe the break was good for him,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""He's been amazing."" Said Curry: ""Coming off the injury, obviously I've got fresh legs, a nice rhythm. I was able to put some good work in the week and a half before I got back on the floor."" The Clippers' Blake Griffin suffered a concussion late in the first quarter when he stumbled driving into the lane from the right wing and hit his head on JaVale McGee's right elbow. Griffin fell to the floor immediately, and remained down for several minutes as team physicians tended to him. He walked off under his own power and went to the locker room. ""Blake's a pretty tough guy, he should be OK,"" teammate DeAndre Jordan said. ""But we definitely want him to be cautious and do whatever he needs to do to be OK."" Nick Young and JaVale McGee each scored 11 points, and Klay Thompson and David West added 10 apiece for Golden State, playing with Kevin Durant sidelined by a right calf strain. The Warriors improved to 17-2 since Nov. 27. Lou Williams scored 23 points, and Jordan added 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers. They lost their 12th straight to the Warriors, dating to Dec. 25, 2014. Tyrone Wallace, signed Friday, added 13 points in his first game for Los Angeles.

Golden State went up 103-73 on McGee's dunk with 55 seconds in a quarter that would see the Warriors outscore on the Clippers 39-22 for a 103-76 lead with 12 minutes to play. ""We had a big third quarter, which is what we wanted,"" Kerr said. ""At halftime we talked about it. Let's break free and make sure everybody gets out there and plays. That third quarter was important for us, but this was mainly about Steph tonight."" TIP-INS: Warriors: The Warriors won their 10th straight road game, improving their road record to 17-3. Thompson hit a 3-pointer with 1:06 left in the second quarter, extending his streak of games with a made 3-pointer to 94, the longest active run. F Andre Iguodala started for the third time this season. Clippers: F Sam Dekker made his first start of the season. In the first two starts, rookie Juwan Evans has drawn the assignment of guarding Russell Westbrook two nights ago and Steff Curry this afternoon. CHANGING OF THE GUARDS With guards Austin Rivers (right ankle) and MilosTeodosic (sore plantar fasciitis) out with injuries, the Clippers were forced to waive F Jamil Wilson, who had started 10 games and averaged 7.0 points on 46 percent shooting, on Friday. In Wilson's place, G Tyrone Wallace was singed a two-way contract. ""We don't have enough guards,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""When Milos went out the other night, we didn't have enough players to playa the game. I don't know if I've ever had to cut a guy because we don't have enough guys at a position. That's what we had to do. It's a tough one."" AFTERNOON APPREHENSION After dramatic victories in back-to-back games over Dallas and Houston, Warriors coach Steve Kerr worried about how the Warriors would react to the game's 12:30 p.m. starting time. ""It's a genuine concern,"" Kerr said. ""Particularly because it was a unique back-to-back in Dallas, with travel back from Houston. We had a lot of flying, a couple of late nights in a row, and then an early start. This has a very different feel for a game.""","400975324"
"NEW YORK --  With a couple big wins behind them and a long plane ride ahead, the Boston Celtics knew they were in for a rough game. ""I think everybody had to push through,"" rookie Jayson Tatum said. Tatum did most of the pushing at the end. He had a driving dunk and a 3-pointer on consecutive possessions, pulling the Celtics out of a late hole and leading them to an 87-85 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night. Playing without Al Horford because of a sore left knee, Boston won its sixth straight heading into its trip to London to face Philadelphia on Thursday. The Celtics were trailing by one when Tatum got the ball and drove for a powerful slam that gave them an 84-83 lead. Kyrie Irving missed on Boston's next possession but wrestled the ball away from DeMarre Carroll and got it to Tatum in the corner near the Boston bench, and his 3 made it 87-83 with 45 seconds to play. ""He is not scared of the moment,"" coach Brad Stevens said about the No. 3 pick. ""Never has been."" The Nets cut it two on Joe Harris' tip and had a bunch of chances to tie in the final seconds, but missed a series of shots near the basket, with DeMarre Carroll appearing to be injured during the sequence. Irving finished with 21 points, and Tatum added 14. Both teams shot under 40 percent, with the Celtics perhaps worn out after a draining week in which they beat Cleveland on Wednesday and Minnesota on Friday in nationally televised games at home. But they played their usual rock-solid defense, limiting the Nets to 33 percent shooting from the field and 19 percent from 3-point range. ""For us as a young, developing group to really will ourselves to that win, of course there are some games where we're not necessarily going to score over 90 points,"" Irving said. ""But on the flip side, we can hold teams to under 90 points so we'll always give ourselves a great chance to win if we're playing at a high level on the defensive end."" Spencer Dinwiddie had 20 points for the Nets, who were bidding for their first three-game winning streak of the season. They're also trying to earn respect, and Dinwiddie feels they aren't getting it yet from referees. ""When you approach somebody and they shush you or they wave you off like you're not a man, you know what I'm saying, or something of that nature,"" Dinwiddie said, ""that's also frustrating to already be in a position of feeling like you're not getting the same respect."" Harris had 10 points and 12 rebounds in his first career double-double. TIP-INS Celtics: The Celtics missed their first five free throws before Irving made the second of his two attempts in the second quarter. Jaylen Brown was 0 for 4 in the first half. Boston finished 8 for 15. ... The Celtics have won the last eight meetings, including three close games this season. Nets: Jahlil Okafor had 12 points in 13 minutes, going 5 for 12 from the field in his second straight appearance. ... With backup guard Caris LeVert out for a second straight game with a left groin strain and Isaiah Whitehead unavailable, Milton Doyle made his third appearance of the season and second at home. The rookie guard is on a two-way contract and has spent much of his time with the Nets' G League affiliate. HORFORD HURTING Horford said his knee began hurting in the second quarter of the Celtics' victory over Minnesota on Friday night, though he didn't recall any specific moment. He said the knee felt better after treatment overnight and Saturday and was optimistic he could play, but said the knee just didn't feel right after his pregame workout on the court. He said he hoped to play Thursday. CARROLL CONCERN Carroll shot 3 for 12 and scored 10 points and had to be helped from the floor by teammates after the final flurry near the basket. He came into the game batting rib soreness. Coach Kenny Atkinson said Carroll wanted to keep playing, but he's going to be hurting while he does. ""I think it's very painful,"" Atkinson said. ""I think if you've ever had a rib, I think those are painful but I do think it's something that can't get worse, so it's what pain level can you tolerate.""","400975325"
"DETROIT --  The Detroit Pistons have beaten several of the NBA's top teams this season. Without James Harden, Houston might not qualify for that distinction -- but it was still a nice victory for the Pistons after an awful loss the night before. Tobias Harris scored 27 points, and the Pistons held on for a 108-101 win over the Rockets on Saturday night. Detroit lost 114-78 at Philadelphia the previous evening, but the Pistons used a strong third quarter to outlast Houston. Detroit is only four games over .500, but the Pistons have beaten Golden State, Boston, San Antonio, Minnesota and now Houston. The Rockets are without Harden, but the Pistons were missing their own standout, with Andre Drummond sidelined because of a right rib contusion. ""We've sort of been up and down,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""It's a good thing on a night like tonight. It's a bad thing on a night like last night. It's just a little too up and down. We need to be more consistent in what we do."" As usual, Houston relied heavily on 3-point shooting. The Rockets went 7 for 13 from beyond the arc in the first quarter, but were only 8 for 34 after that. ""I don't know if that was the performance of a tired team or what happened there,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We're short-handed right now, and it seems like we are always playing our third game in four nights. We just never really had any intensity on defense, even when our offense was flowing."" Detroit was the more efficient team from 3-point range, going 12 of 25. Chris Paul had 16 points and 13 assists for Houston. Ish Smith scored 17 points for Detroit, and Dwight Buycks added a career-high 16. There were eight lead changes and six ties in the first half, and Houston led 58-57 after two quarters. Detroit then outscored the Rockets 31-19 in the third. A dunk by Harris put the Pistons up 72-65, and Reggie Bullock's 3 near the end of the period made it 86-72. Houston rallied late and cut the deficit to four with 15.5 seconds left, but Smith made two free throws for Detroit at the other end. TIP-INS Rockets: Harden is out with a hamstring strain. Houston was also without C Nene, who has a bruised right knee. Pistons: In addition to Drummond, Detroit was without G Reggie Jackson (sprained right ankle) and F Stanley Johnson (strained right hip flexor). ... Eric Moreland replaced Drummond at center for the first start of his career and set career highs with eight points, four assists and 36 minutes. TURNAROUND Detroit is 5-2 in the second game of back-to-backs after going 3-14 last season. The Pistons had reason to be ready Saturday. ""It was tough in Philly last night,"" Bullock said. ""It was a lot of shots going in and out. Obviously, we missed a lot of defensive assignments, but tonight, we came back hungry."" TOUGH STRETCH The Rockets went 4 for 21 from long distance in the second and third quarters. ""Once we hit a lull in the second half, we were never able to regain our offensive flow,"" said guard Eric Gordon, who scored 15 points. ""That's a solid team, even with the guys they are missing, and they didn't let up on us once we stopped making shots."" QUOTABLE Van Gundy isn't thrilled with how backup center Boban Marjanovic is being officiated. At 7-foot-3, Marjanovic can be tough to defend, and he had 10 points on 4-of-8 shooting. ""His size, they just officiate the game differently. They do,"" Van Gundy said. ""If he pushed and shoved guys and held guys the way they're able to do to him, it would be a foul every time.""","400975326"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo gave the Pacers they needed to end a five-game losing streak. Oladipo had 23 points and nine assists in three quarters in his return from a right knee injury to help the Pacers beat the Chicago Bulls 125-86 on Saturday night. Oladipo also had six rebounds and five steals after missing the previous four games. Domantas Sabonis added 22 points, and TJ Leaf had 15. But it was Oladipo who stole the show and led a surge to put the game away by halftime. ""That's an All-Star guy. Any time he's in the lineup it's going to make things a little bit easier,"" Leaf said. ""It's certainly nice to have a guy like that back."" Four of Oladipo's steals came on consecutive possession during a 16-2 run in the first quarter. He broke away after his fourth steal and made a two-handed dunk to make it 24:17 with 4:51 left in period and then looked into the stands with both arms up to signify he was back after a stretch the seemed longer than four games. ""I was just out there playing,"" Oladipo said. ""I just kind of get lost in the game and do whatever I can to help my teammates. I just try to set the tone on both ends."" The big run in the opening quarter ended with a technical free throw by Darren Collison and a basket by Sabonis to take a 31-19 lead with 2:43 remaining in the first period. They went on a 14-0 run in the second quarter to go ahead 48-28. Thaddeus Young scored on a turnaround hook shot to give the Pacers a 64-37 halftime lead. Bobby Portis had 15 points, and Denzel Valentine and Lauri Markkanen each had 13 points and five rebounds for the Bulls. They've lost four of their last five games and their defensive woes haven't gotten much better. Opponents have shot 49.3 percent against Chicago over the last five games. The Pacers finished 55.8 percent from the field. ""The bottom line is (Indiana) looked comfortable all night,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""They brought the fight to us tonight. They got into us right away. We didn't handle it well."" Indiana led by as much as 41 points when Leaf dunked to make it 116-75 with 5:30 left to play. TIP-INS: Bulls: Shot just 37.5 percent from the field. ... Kris Dunn had eight points and eight assists. . Markkanen has scored in double figures in all four matchups with Indiana this season. Pacers: Forward Bojan Bogdanovic was out with a sprained left ankle. ... Indiana won three games in a season against Chicago for the first time since 2012-13. ... Leaf had a career-high six rebounds. STRAINING STRETCH Hoiberg said the Bulls plan on taking the day off Sunday and they could use the rest. The ream arrived in Indianapolis at 3 a.m. Saturday after beating Dallas 127-124 on Friday, and completed a stretch of seven games in 11 days. Chicago is 2-7 in games when playing the day before. A DAY OF BASKETBALL The Pacers-Bulls matchup capped off Basketball Day in the Hoosier state, where the sport is so popular. It was nearly 13 hours of nonstop basketball, which featured the top high school teams in the state and college games including Purdue, Indiana, Butler and Valparaiso before the Pacers and Bulls tipped off.","400975327"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  LeBron James did a little bit of everything in Cleveland's victory over Orlando James had 33 points, 10 rebounds, nine assists and six steals, but it was his steady presence on the floor in the final six minutes that made the difference in Cleveland's 131-127 victory Saturday night. Cleveland let a 20-point fourth-quarter advantage dwindle down to three before and the Magic's shooting touch ran out, much of it because James helped the Cavs make enough plays to secure the win. ""I play both sides of the floor,"" James said. ""I don't just score or rebound or pass the ball. Anytime you get a steal it allows us to get the ball in the open court and not play against a set defense."" Kevin Love hit six 3-pointers and finished with 27 points for the Cavaliers, and Isaiah Thomas had 19 points and four assists in his second appearance and first start of the season following a hip injury. Dwayne Wade added 16 points and nine rebounds, including retrieving a Thomas' airball and laying it in to give the Cavs a five-point cushion with 17.8 seconds left. Cleveland seized control in the third period, hitting seven of 11 3-pointers in the period and outscoring Orlando 40-23. ""We played the right way that quarter,"" Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Defensively, we got stops and offensively we shared the ball, played with pace and guys got open looks. Then in the fourth quarter, we got bogged down."" Aaron Gordon led the Magic's fourth-quarter rally, scoring 11 of his 30 points when the Magic turned a blowout into a tight finish. Elfrid Payton had 20 points and five assists, and Evan Fournier contributed 18 points for the Magic, who lost their fourth straight. Mario Hezonja added 16 points and 10 rebounds in his seventh starting appearance this season. But Gordon couldn't match James in any category but scoring and the Magic forward's teammates didn't pick up the slack, especially on the boards. Orlando gave up 13 second-chance points while getting outscored 40-23 in the third period, allowing Cleveland to take a 20-point lead in the final period. ""That's part of what has to change for us to become a winning team,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""We've got to box out on every shot. We talk about it every day on a ridiculous level. It's an elementary school fundamental that we continue to break down on and it hurts us."" TIP INS Cavaliers: Kyle Korver tied Paul Pierce for fourth-place on the career 3-pointers list with 2,143.  Cleveland has won nine straight times in Orlando. ... James played in his 1,100 game in his 15-year career. ... Cleveland is 22-0 when tied or leading starting the fourth quarter. Magic: Jonathon Simmons back injury forced the Magic to change their starting lineup for the 16th time this season. ... Magic rookie Wes Iwandu had a career-high 12 points. ... Payton got into a shouting match with Thomas in the first half and both players were given a technical. SG Evan Fournier had his string of consecutive free throws end at 21 since returning from an ankle injury six games ago. HE'S BACK Thomas made his first start this season for the Cavaliers, after recover from a hip injury and scored 19 points on seven of 13 shooting. Thomas had 17 points in 19 minutes off the bench in his debut Tuesday night against Portland. ""My body felt a lot better,"" Thomas said. ""I had more of a rhythm early, but that rust was still there. I was missing layups and free throws and things like that. After we got going and my body got caught up, I felt better."" Thomas took a nasty spill on a drive to the basket, but bounced right up and showed no ill effects. ""I don't like seeing him hit the floor, but obviously seeing him get up and taking that type of physicality is very key for his progression,"" James said.","400975328"
"WASHINGTON --  Giannis Antetokounmpo and Eric Bledsoe led the Milwaukee Bucks to victory. Matthew Dellavedova was the one who really got the Washington Wizards' attention. Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 12 rebounds, and Bledsoe scored 15 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter of Milwaukee's 110-103 victory Saturday night. But it was Dellavedova who left Washington steaming after a fourth-quarter flagrant 2 foul on Bradley Beal that resembled a football tackle and threatened to spark a brawl. ""There's a difference between making a play on the ball and wrapping your arms around somebody's neck,"" Beal said. ""I mean, it is what it is."" As Beal drove the lane in transition, Dellavedova reached out his arms. The right one caught Beal around the neck and brought him to the ground. ""I was just trying to hold him to prevent him from, you know, getting the and-one, and then he just went to the ground,"" said Dellavedova, who received his first career ejection. Beal finished with 20 points, and John Wall added 16 points and 16 rebounds for Washington. But the pair shot just 1 for 9 in the final 7:24 after Dellavedova's dismissal. ""We had opportunities to win the game,"" Wall said. ""The reason why we lost is they made bigger shots."" Khris Middleton had 20 points, and John Henson added 11 points and 11 rebounds for the Bucks, who secured a fourth win in six games and snapped Washington's four-game win streak. Milwaukee closed the game on a 12-4 run to help erase some of the sting of a blowout loss to Toronto a night earlier. ""I think we did a good job just coming out tonight and just playing harder as a team,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We definitely wanted this win."" Antetokounmpo hit a running layup to put Milwaukee up for good, 100-99, then followed with a baseline jumper to stretch the lead to three with 1:44 left. Bledsoe's step-back 3-pointer made it 105-101 with 1:17 to play before Antetokounmpo's last jumper stretched the 108-103 with 36.2 remaining. GIANNIS, MEET SHAQ Antetokounmpo has at least 20 points and five rebounds in 27 consecutive games. That's the longest such NBA streak since Shaquille O'Neal matched it during the 2000-01 season. BUCKS BEAR DOWN While Antetokounmpo and Bledsoe spurred the offense late, Milwaukee's defense  held Washington to 5 of 19 shooting. ""You understand that Wall and Beal are going to be the focal point,"" said Bucks coach Jason Kidd. ""It wasn't just one-on-one but it was team defense, everybody helped each other and tried to make it as tough as possible."" OFFICIALLY IN TROUBLE? Beal could also face some discipline from the NBA for his actions in the brief scrum that followed Dellavedova's foul. Replays showed Beal's hand had made contact with referee Kevin Scott's shoulder and neck area as he stepped at Dellavedova. ""The one thing I didn't like is the ref going after me versus trying to control him,"" Beal said. ""I have a right to react the way I did."" A ""DIRTY PLAYER"" Wall said his own impressions of Dellavedova don't quite match the record of four flagrant fouls in five NBA seasons. ""Whatever their team can say and other people can vouch for him, to me, I always thought he was a dirty player,"" Wall said. TIP INS Bucks: Kidd elected to give G Malcolm Brogdon his 11th start of the season Saturday and bring G Tony Snell off the bench. .

"MINNEAPOLIS --  Even though the Timberwolves were the ones playing the second half of a back-to-back, the Pelicans were the flatter team. Karl-Anthony Towns is making a lot of teams look that way right now. Towns and Jimmy Butler each scored 21 points, Andrew Wiggins added 20 and Minnesota cruised past New Orleans 116-98 on Saturday night. It took three tries, but Towns finally was able to spend more time on the floor than the bench against the Pelicans. In the teams' first two games against each other, Minnesota's young and emotional big man got into foul trouble against New Orleans' physical frontcourt. Not this time. ""It was good to be out there and try to help my teammates win instead of the last two times being on the bench,"" he said. Towns went 7 for 11 and grabbed 16 rebounds for another strong effort after Friday's 25-point, 23-rebound show in Boston. ""It was nice to see him play a game against New Orleans,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau deadpanned, noting that Towns kept his head despite some elbows and shoves from the likes of DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis in the lane. ""He showed a lot of maturity and growth in terms of not reacting to calls and non-calls and just playing,"" Thibodeau said. ""He's playing a really strong all-around game right now."" And unlike Friday night against the Celtics, the rest of the Timberwolves also shot well. Taj Gibson had 15 points and Gorgui Dieng added 14 off the bench as the Timberwolves shot 48.9 percent from the floor and led by as many as 34. The win snapped Minnesota's two-game losing streak ahead of a tough matchup next week against Cleveland. ""We understand we needed to get this one tonight,"" Gibson said. Cousins led the Pelicans with 23 points and Davis added 16. But the Timberwolves held Jrue Holiday, who averaged 21 points per game in December, to single digits for most of the game. Holiday finished with 13 points on 6-for-13 shooting before fouling out with 3:45 to play. New Orleans turned the ball over 16 times -- leading to 17 Timberwolves points -- and was outrebounded 47-38. ""They beat us in all phases of the game,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. ""They were quicker. They were better defensively. They ran to the ball. They got the 50-50 balls."" TIP-INS: Pelicans: New Orleans shot 36.4 percent (8 for 22) in the third quarter and was 6 for 29 from 3-point range for the game. It was the first time the Pelicans failed to score 100 points since Nov. 25 against Golden State (17 games). ... Cousins recorded his 29th double-double of the season. ... The Pelicans fell to 2-13 when being outrebounded this season. Timberwolves: It was Minnesota's third straight sellout. The Timberwolves hadn't sold out three consecutive games since 2012. ... Teague is doing ""more and more"" in his recovery from a sprained left MCL. Teague missed his sixth game since hurting his knee Dec. 27 against Denver and is sidelined indefinitely. ""He's fitted with a brace, so he's getting used to that,"" Thibodeau said. ""So we just take it day by day. When he's ready to go, he goes."" DIENG GOOD Dieng had another strong performance against New Orleans after scoring 12 and 19 points in the previous two games. He shot 6 for 9, including 2 for 2 from 3-point range. BELOW THE CENTURY MARK The Timberwolves have held their last five opponents to fewer than 100 points. The last time that happened was a six-game streak from Nov. 5-12, 2012.","400975330"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  After preaching patience most of the season, Vince Carter is seeing signs of growth from his young Sacramento teammates. It certainly helps when the 40-year-old eight-time All-Star can be a part of things, too. Carter scored 10 of his 12 points in the fourth quarter and the Kings held off the Denver Nuggets 106-98 on Saturday night. De'Aaron Fox had 18 points and seven assists, Willie Cauley-Stein added 17 points and Buddy Hield had 14. ""We have a lot of talent around here, it's just patience,"" Carter said. ""They have to learn how to play this game and have to go through all the different scenarios that you could possibly face in an NBA game, and you won't see that until the second part of the season. ""Everybody wants to see that growth, they want to see it now, and it doesn't happen that way."" Sacramento was up 13 early in the fourth, but Denver rallied and Trey Lyles' layup pulled the Nuggets to 92-89 with 5:22 remaining. Cauley-Stein made back-to-back layups for the Kings and, after Will Barton made a 3-pointer for the Nuggets, Hield made a short jumper and Coleman hit a 3-pointer to help Sacramento pull away. The Kings had dropped four straight, including both matchups this season. ""We're not a finished product but it's a step in the right direction,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. Lyles led Denver with 19 points, Jamal Murray added 18, and Will Barton and Gary Harris had 17 apiece. The loss capped a frustrating night for Denver, which was playing the second half of a back-to-back. The Nuggets committed a season-high 26 turnovers, missed four consecutive free throws down the stretch and coach Mike Malone -- who previously coached in Sacramento -- was hit with a technical foul. Sacramento capitalized on almost every mistake Denver made and scored 40 points off turnovers. That wasn't the type of performance Malone was looking for two days before playing the Golden State Warriors. ""Bottom line is you gave a team that had three days off life by giving them 40 points off of your mistakes,"" Malone said. ""If you do that in a couple nights in Oakland, you'll get beat by 50."" The Nuggets erased most of an early 12-point deficit but fell apart after going scoreless for 5 1/2 minutes while missing their first nine shots in the second. Denver's frustrations boiled over when Malone, who spent one-plus seasons coaching in Sacramento, picked up a technical foul. Things didn't get much better in the third. The Nuggets, who had 15 turnovers in the first half, made another to open the second half when Cauley-Stein intercepted the inbounds pass at midcourt and drove in for a dunk. KINGS FIRE SCOUTING DIRECTOR The Kings fired scouting director and former assistant general manager Mike Bratz, who was previously an assistant coach in Sacramento under Rick Adelman and Eddie Jordan. ""We agreed to part ways and appreciate all of his contributions to the Kings,"" the team said in a statement. ""We wish him nothing but the best."" STEALING THE SPOTLIGHT Cauley-Stein led the Kings' defensive charge with a career-best seven steals that also matches the most in the NBA this season. Overall Sacramento had 16 steals. ""Just being ready and active, being in the right spots on defense,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""That'll happen. It's big. It feels good."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver shot 46.1 percent, slightly better than Sacramento, but never led. Barton didn't score until 1:28 remained in the third. . Kenneth Faried sat out his fourth consecutive game because of coach's decision. Kings: Carter had a season-high eight rebounds. . It's the first time this season Sacramento has led the entire game. .

"MIAMI --  The last Miami play was designed by Heat coach Erik Spoelstra to put the ball in Josh Richardson's hands, and with it came the right to decide who would take his team's biggest shot of the game. He chose himself. It was the right call. Richardson's layup with 5.1 seconds left capped a Miami rally from eight points down in the fourth, Donovan Mitchell missed a jumper for Utah at the buzzer and the Heat simply stole one in the final moments to beat the Utah Jazz 103-102 on Sunday. ""He drew it up for me and I was kind of surprised,"" Richardson said. So surprised, in fact, that Richardson emerged from that huddle telling Wayne Ellington and Tyler Johnson to get ready for his pass. But a lane opened to the rim, Richardson laid the ball home and the Heat won their fourth straight -- all by single digits, Miami's longest stretch of such wins since November 2012. ""Utah played a very good basketball game,"" Spoelstra said. ""In many ways, they deserved to win this one. But we've got to make up some ground. We've given up some games that we wish we could have had back, so quite frankly we need to steal some."" Tyler Johnson and Goran Dragic each scored 16 points for Miami. Richardson and Hassan Whiteside each had 14, James Johnson 13 and Kelly Olynyk had 12. Mitchell scored 19 of his 27 points in the second half, but couldn't save Utah from dropping its seventh straight on the road. He went into the backcourt to take the final inbounds pass and wound up taking a jumper from the right side that missed as time expired. Mitchell kicked himself afterward, realizing too late Rodney Hood might have been open. ""I should have made the right read instead of shooting it,"" Mitchell said. Hood scored 17 points, Thabo Sefolosha added 13 and Derrick Favors 11 for the Jazz, who fell to 3-17 on the road. ""We obviously did a few things right,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""It doesn't feel like it right now."" Miami improved to 2-14 when trailing after three quarters. The Heat led for 20 of the 24 first-half minutes, but their lead was only 49-47 at the break. Mitchell was 3 for 12 in the opening half, after going 5 for 14 against the Heat when the teams met in November. It was like he was due to break out -- and did just that, needing only 3 minutes to score Utah's first 11 points of the second half. He made his first five shots of the third, ended up 6-for-8 for 13 points in the quarter and Utah took a 75-74 lead into the fourth. Mitchell put the Jazz up 93-85 with 6:28 left, but Miami finished on a 18-9 spurt. ""Find a way at the end,"" Spoelstra said. TIP-INS Jazz: The 3:30 p.m. EST tip is the earliest for Utah this season. ... The Jazz scored 74 points in the teams' first meeting this season; Joe Johnson's jumper with 1:09 left in the third gave Utah 75 on Sunday. ... Utah is off until Wednesday, which means the Jazz -- who had time for exactly one non-gameday practice in December -- will get one during this trip. Heat: Miami plays seven of its next eight, and 11 of its next 14, on the road. ... There's been no change yet in the status of Dion Waiters, who sought a second opinion on his sprained left ankle last week. Waiters missed his sixth consecutive game. ... The Heat sent Derrick Walton Jr. to Sioux Falls of the G League over the weekend, after he appeared in 12 games with Miami. SILVER WATCHES NBA Commissioner Adam Silver watched the game from the stands. He's in Miami for league marketing meetings scheduled for this week. BOTH SIDES Whiteside had tip-ins on consecutive possessions in the first quarter, 22 seconds apart, which sounds great -- until realizing it happened on both ends of the floor. Favors was credited with the basket when Whiteside accidentally deflected the ball in for two Utah points, and on the ensuing Miami possession the Heat center tipped in a miss by Dragic.","400975332"
"DALLAS --  On the day the New York Knicks guaranteed his contract for the rest of the season, Jarrett Jack hit the big shot to deliver them a victory. Jack's floater in the lane with 31.2 seconds to play snapped a tie and the Knicks beat the Dallas Mavericks 100-96 on Sunday night. Kristaps Porzingis scored 29 points for New York, which ended a three-game losing streak and sent the Mavericks to their third straight loss -- all at home. Dallas never led in the game, but for the third game in a row, the Mavericks made a late rally from a double-digit deficit -- and fell short just as they had against Golden State and Chicago. ""It's really the same old story,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""It's an early hole, it's a late rally, and then come up short. Bottom line is we've got to be better early in games."" Harrison Barnes scored 25 points and Devin Harris had nine of his 11 in the fourth quarter for Dallas on the night the team honored long-time point guard Derek Harper by retiring his jersey. The Mavericks trailed 90-77 with 4:48 left, but went on a 15-2 run over the next 2:20 to tie the score at 92. Harris started and ended the run with 3-pointers. ""We did what we were supposed to do all game, turned up the pressure and intensity,"" Mavericks guard Wesley Matthews said. ""It was just a little too late."" After Porzingis made two free throws and Barnes hit a short jumper, Jack used Porzingis' screen to penetrate into the lane and drop in a floater. ""I was just trying to be aggressive,"" Jack said. ""They had done a good job of mucking the game up, denying a lot of our actions, not allowing us to get the ball in the place that we were trying to get it to. (Porzingis) set a good screen. I saw I had an opening and I just tried to knock the shot down."" J.J. Barea missed a long 3 that would have given Dallas the lead, and Courtney Lee hit four free throws in the final 16.6 seconds to seal it. Up 56-52 at halftime, New York built its lead to 73-63 midway through the third quarter before the Mavericks closed the quarter on an 8-2 run. But after Harris' three-point play cut the lead to 77-74 with 11:27 to play, Dallas did not score again for five minutes as the Knicks built the lead back to 13. TIP-INS Knicks: Lee has made 43 free throws in a row, the second-longest streak in Knicks history. Chris Duhon made 44 in a row in 2008-09. Mavericks: Matthews had 14 points and four Mavericks scored 11. HARPER HONORED The Mavericks retired Harper's No. 12, the third Dallas player to be so honored. Harper's jersey joins those of his former teammates Brad Davis (No. 15) and Rolando Blackman (No. 22) in the rafters. Harper played 12 seasons in a 16-year career with the Mavericks, ranking fourth in the team's history in points and first in assists and steals. Harper also made the NBA Finals with the Knicks in 1994 and is now the analyst on Mavericks' TV broadcasts. ""I kept looking up at Brad and Ro's numbers during the first half of the game and just thinking that I was going to be up there joining those guys. "" Harper said after the game. ""When reality sets in, this is a big deal because not a lot of people get to have their jersey retired. It's an incredible honor."" BATTLE OF THE ROOKIES Harper wore No. 11 with the Knicks, and that jersey is now worn by rookie point guard Frank Ntilikina, the eighth pick in the 2017 draft. The Mavericks took Dennis Smith, Jr. with the next pick. Smith won the scoring battle on Sunday, 11 points to seven, and both players had five assists. Ntilikina added seven rebounds and was on the floor for most of the fourth quarter as the Knicks built their double-digit lead. DOUBLE-DOUBLES Kyle O'Quinn had 15 points and 11 rebounds, and Enes Kanter added 13 points and 18 boards for the Knicks. Porzingis fell just two rebounds short of a double-double of his own.","400975333"
"PHOENIX --  Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson were fourth overall picks in the draft: Bender in 2016, Jackson in 2017. Both are just 20 years old, and the jury is out on whether they deserved to go that high. They sure looked good Sunday night, though. Bender scored 17 of his career-high 20 points in the second half, Jackson had 17 points and 10 rebounds in the first double-double of his rookie season, and the Phoenix reserves played a big role in the Suns' 114-100 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. ""We're trying to develop young players here and they both stepped up big-time today,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said. ""I thought they played really well together. Josh would drive and kick and find Dragan on the perimeter and I think there's a comfort level really developing with those two."" Bender made a career-best six 3-pointers, going 5 of 6 in the second half. The Suns beat the Thunder for the third straight time dating to last season, with all three wins coming in Phoenix. Russell Westbrook had his 14th triple-double of the season and second in a row with 26 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, but Oklahoma City never led after the first quarter. Paul George added 19 points and Steven Adams 18 for the Thunder. Devin Booker scored 26 and T.J. Warren 23 for Phoenix. The Suns made a season-high 17 3s in 39 attempts while Oklahoma City was 8 of 27. ""We like the way we played,"" Triano said. ""We shot a lot of 3s, which is what we want to do. We got into our drive-and-kick game. I thought we were solid defensively. I think they missed a bunch of shots as well. This is a game that we feel really good about and it's a step for us. It's a step for us for sure."" Booker's 3-pointer gave Phoenix a 74-60 lead with 7:56 left in the third, but the Thunder responded with a 15-2 run. Westbrook made one of two free throws to cap the outburst and cut the lead to 76-75 with 5:03 left in the period. Bender's 3 ignited a 14-4 Suns surge, Jackson's 3-pointer boosting the lead to 90-79 with 32 seconds left in the quarter. Carmelo Anthony's three-point play cut the lead to 90-82 entering the fourth. Bender sank two more 3s to start a 14-2 outburst that put Phoenix up 107-89 after Tyler Ulis' 3-pointer with 6:42 remaining. ""All my 3s in the second half were wide-open 3s,"" Bender said. ""We moved the ball really well. They gave us some open shots."" Bender also had six rebounds, four assists and three blocked shots. The Thunder had beaten the Lakers and Clippers on the three-game road trip before losing Sunday. ""In the first half we did not play like we had played the last couple of games,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. ""Then we tried to get back to that level. We got back to it for a little bit but we couldn't get all the way there."" TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook moved past Larry Bird into 40th on the NBA career assist list. ... Westbrook missed four of seven free throws. The Thunder were 12 of 21 at the line. ... Terrance Ferguson fouled out with 7:42 to play. ... George and Westbrook are 1-2 in the NBA in steals. George had one, Westbrook two in the game. ... Westbrook has 93 career triple-doubles. Suns: The 14-point winning margin matched Phoenix's biggest of season. ...

BENCH BLOWOUT The Suns reserves outscored their Oklahoma City counterparts 48-21, 28-11 in the second half. Jackson made a career-high three 3s in six tries. Bender was 6 for 9. Jackson became the first Suns rookie to have at least 10 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a game since Joe Johnson on Feb. 22, 2002.","400975334"
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- CJ McCollum's floater bounced several times around the rim, and the crowd seemed to hold a collective breath. It finally fell in with 5.9 seconds left, giving the Portland Trail Blazers a 111-110 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday night with both teams short-handed. ""It didn't want to go in. I think that's karma for all the in-and-outs I've missed all year. So I was due for one,'' McCollum said. ""I got a good look, so I can live with that even if it rolls out. That's the shot I practice over and over again."" McCollum finished with 25 points, and Maurice Harkless added 19 off the bench for the Blazers, who were without starter Damian Lillard. It was Portland's fifth win in seven games and third straight victory at home. Former Blazer LaMarcus Aldridge had 30 points and 14 rebounds, while Manu Ginobili added 26 points, including six 3-pointers, for the Spurs. Trailing by as many as 12 points in the third quarter, Portland rallied to lead 101-94 on Harkless' 3-pointer with 5:37 left. But Ginobili's 3 gave the Spurs a 105-103 lead with 2:48 left. He added another to extend the lead to 108-105. According to Elias Sports Bureau research, Ginobili is the only player in NBA history to have multiple 20-point games off the bench at age 40 or older. He finished with 21 points on Friday in a victory over the Suns. McCollum's layup with 1:11 to go gave the Blazers a one-point edge, but he missed an off-balance jumper that would have given Portland some cushion. After Kyle Anderson's free throws put San Antonio in front, McCollum came through with his floater that gave Portland the winning margin. Aldridge missed a jumper from out front as time ran out. Afterward, Aldridge took responsibility. ""I definitely have to be better. I think this one is on me,"" he said. ""I missed two free throws, and then I rushed the last shot. The team did a really good job of putting us in that position, working hard. I think this one is definitely on me tonight."" Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard sat out because of a partial tear in his left shoulder, coach Gregg Popovich revealed before the game. Leonard sustained the injury during the Spurs' 103-89 win Friday over the Phoenix Suns. ""It's too bad because he was starting to get back into form a little bit after playing a couple of games,"" Popovich told reporters. The coach said the Spurs would monitor the injury over the coming days, and there was no official word on how serious it was. The game against the Suns was Leonard's eighth appearance of the season after he missed the first 27 games with right quadriceps tendinopathy. ""It's disappointing. We need him,'' Ginobili said. ""He started to feel better, to feel good, and then we lose him for a few games and we don't know how many.'' The Spurs also didn't have Rudy Gay (right heel) and Danny Green (groin tightness). Tony Parker also did not play. San Antonio plays again Monday against the Sacramento Kings. The Blazers were without Lillard because of a right calf strain. Lillard missed four games because of a strained right hamstring but played in the last two, despite being bothered by his calf. Lillard leads the Blazers with 24.9 points and 6.3 assists per game. Shabazz Napier started in his place. Napier helped spark Portland at the start, and the game was tied at 27 to start the second quarter. The Spurs led 53-48 at the half, led by Aldridge with 15 points. Jusuf Nurkic had 11 for Portland. San Antonio extended the lead to 69-57 after Aldridge's layup. The Blazers rallied and took an 80-77 lead on Napier's basket near the end of the third quarter, but Davis Bertans hit a 3 to pull San Antonio back into a tie to open the fourth. Napier, who continues to impress with his passing, finished with 15 points for his 10th straight game in double figures. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio won the opening game of this season's series with the Blazers 93-91 in Portland on Dec. 20. The third of the three meetings will be in San Antonio on April 7. ... Aldridge played his first nine NBA seasons with the Blazers. Trail Blazers: Nurkic had his ninth double-double of the season. He finished with 17 points and 13 rebounds. AGE IS JUST A NUMBER Ginobili became the first player in his 40s to score 15-plus points in back-to-back games since Michael Jordan in 2002-03, according to the Spurs. QUOTABLE ""It's been a tough season. We're still hanging out, hanging in, hanging on. We're doing OK, I guess. That's why losses like this hurt more. It was such a great effort, and it just slipped away,"" Ginobili said.","400975335"
"Lakers coach Luke Walton says in a postgame news conference that the reason he pulled Lonzo Ball was because his dad, LaVar, was talking trash. Walton quickly adds ""I'm just kidding"" and explains Lonzo's fatigue. (1:22) LOS ANGELES --  For nine games, the Los Angeles Lakers couldn't figure out how to get their defense back on track. That changed against the Atlanta Hawks. The Lakers mae 13 steals and scored 26 points off turnovers Sunday night en route to a 132-113 victory to end a nine-game losing streak. ""It was good to kind of see the guys get back to that mode where defense anchors what we do offensively instead of the other way around,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. Brandon Ingram had 20 points and seven assists while Lonzo Ball finished with 13 points, 10 assists and six rebounds. Julius Randle had 15 points and nine rebounds in his sixth straight start. Nine Lakers made at least one steal. Brook Lopez had four on his own. ""Everybody was on a string together,"" Ingram said. ""We trusted each other, whether it was individual defense, whether it was help-side defense, transition defense. I think we all trusted each other."" Dennis Schroder led the Hawks with 27 points on 10-of-23 shooting. Kent Bazemore and John Collins added 15 points apiece. Los Angeles led by as many as 26 points -- its biggest margin this season -- and enjoyed a strong shooting night. The Lakers made 55.8 percent of their field goals, and shot 44 percent from 3-point range. Even free throws went in for the Lakers, who came into Sunday as the worst team in the league in that category. Los Angeles made 20 of 25. The Hawks, on the other hand, shot 44 percent from the field. Los Angeles went on a 16-3 run in the opening minutes of the second quarter that culminated in a transition 3-pointer by Ball and a basket by Larry Nance Jr. off a pass from Josh Hart. The lead quickly ballooned to 20 after another 3 by Ball and a layup by Kyle Kuzma. In all, the Lakers outscored the Hawks 37-21 in the second period. ""They were out and running on the fast break, making 3s, making layups,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think it started with good defense on their part. We weren't executing offensively."" The Hawks closed within 13 with 10:09 remaining in the fourth quarter, but a long pass from Kuzma led to a one-handed dunk by Ball, giving the Lakers a 17-point lead. Hart's 3-pointer with 5:33 left in the game gave Los Angeles its biggest lead. The Hawks started the game on a 10-2 run, but the Lakers recovered. Kuzma's basket on a strong drive gave Los Angeles a 29-27 lead just before the first-quarter buzzer. TIP-INS Lakers: Won for the first time at home since Nov. 21 against the Chicago Bulls. ... Beat the Hawks 46 years earlier to the day for an NBA-record 33rd straight win. ... Eight Lakers scored in double figures. Hawks: Budenholzer picked up a technical foul in the first quarter. ... Taurean Prince dislocated his right ring finger in the first quarter but returned to the game. LAVAR AND LUKE Walton said earlier Sunday he wasn't bothered by LaVar Ball's comment to ESPN that he had lost control of the team. The coach added that his only concern is his relationship with Lonzo Ball. Walton said he'd received messages of support from coaches who advised him to ""not be concerned with parents and what other people outside the organization think."" FAST PACE The Lakers scored 42 fast-break points, tying a franchise record. It was their largest such total since 2001. Los Angeles outscored Atlanta in transition 28-0 in the first half alone. ""That's what we're great at,"" Larry Nance Jr. said. ""When we have Zo, we're a beast when it comes to running. He's so good at finding it, pushing it and hitting open guys that it's contagious and then everybody gets involved.""","400975336"
"INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan challenged his team to play more aggressive defense. On Monday night, the Pacers showed just how good they could be. Indiana seized control early by forcing 13 turnovers in the first 17 minutes, built a 29-point lead and never allowed the Milwaukee Bucks to make a serious run over the final 42 minutes of a 109-96 victory. ""I thought we came out defensively and challenged every catch,"" McMillan said. ""We had better pressure defensively."" Last week, the Pacers couldn't do much right in a 21-point loss at Milwaukee. This time, they played with passion and intensity and it changed everything. Indiana dominated most of the game, forcing continual miscues and bad shots while the offense took advantage by making 18 of its first 25 attempts. Milwaukee never recovered from the early flurry. Domantas Sabonis finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Pacers. Victor Oladipo, Myles Turner and Thaddeus Young each had 15 points on a night when seven Pacers players scored at least 10. Indiana has won two straight since a five-game losing streak. Khris Middleton led Milwaukee with 19 points and Giannis Antetokounmpo had 17 -- not nearly enough against an intense defense on a mission. ""Indiana is a team that pressures and tries to make us uncomfortable, force us into bad decisions and they did,"" Malcolm Brogdon said after scoring 12 points for the Bucks. ""We let it affect us with turnovers."" Indiana broke it open by scoring 20 straight points in the first quarter to turn a 15-14 game into a blowout. The Pacers finished the period on a 22-2 spurt to make it 37-16. The Pacers extended the lead to 48-21 midway through the second quarter before the Bucks finally fought back with a 9-1 run to cut the deficit to 19. Indiana immediately answered with seven straight points and led 64-38 at halftime. Milwaukee couldn't get any closer than 16 until the final two minutes. ""We just turned it up, helping the helper, going out there and have each other's back,"" Oladipo said. ""We definitely looked united and that was huge for us."" TIP-INS Bucks: Tied their season low for first-quarter points and started 7 of 25 from the field. ... Antetokounmpo also had seven rebounds and three assists. ... John Henson scored 12 points and grabbed six rebounds. ... Milwaukee cut the deficit to nine with 59.2 seconds left and finished the game shooting 46.6 percent. The Bucks have made at least 45 percent of their shots in 17 straight games, the longest streak in the NBA this season. Pacers: Had 30 assists on 44 baskets. ... Indiana matched its season high for first-quarter points. ... Oladipo had five rebounds and three steals. ... Turner had six rebounds and four blocks, his 15th game this season with three or more blocks. ... Sabonis' career-best streak of two straight 20-point games ended. ... Young had eight rebounds. REMEMBERING WOODEN As part of their Hickory Night celebration, the Pacers honored one of the greatest basketball stars in the state's illustrious history -- the late John Wooden. He was a three-time all-state player at Martinsville High School, a three-time All-American at Purdue and was the head coach at Indiana State before taking the UCLA job. It was there, in Los Angeles, where he earned the nickname the ""Wizard of Westwood"" and won a record 10 national championships. Wooden died in 2010 at age 99. But his great granddaughter, Cori Andersen, spoke to the crowd, and former player Marques Johnson, now one of the Bucks' announcers, was also in attendance. Johnson played on Wooden's last championship team before playing for the Bucks. ""I'm definitely a California girl but he was Hoosier all the way,"" Andersen said. DOUBLE SCARE The two players acquired in the Paul George trade with Oklahoma City both gave the Pacers a little scare in the second half. Oladipo stayed on the ground briefly with 7:02 left in the third quarter after drawing a foul and appearing to land awkwardly and hard on the floor. But after a timeout he made two free throws and continued to play. ""I'm good. I'm feathery,"" Oladipo said. Sabonis left with 2:51 to go, clutching his left wrist after a collision on a charge. He did not return. Sabonis said he thought he'd be OK.","400975337"
"NEW YORK --  Toronto's big lead was lost, and its point guard was being carried off the court after a painful fall. DeMar DeRozan made sure at least the game was won. DeRozan scored 35 points, including a go-ahead three-point play with 26.1 seconds left in overtime, and the Raptors shook off a late injury to Kyle Lowry to beat the Brooklyn Nets 114-113 on Monday night. The Raptors blew a 10-point lead in the final 4 1/2 minutes of regulation but recovered to beat Brooklyn for the 10th straight time and win its fifth in a row overall. ""We rely on Kyle for everything he does for us, to be the general out there on the court,"" DeRozan said. ""And it's tough when he's not out there but we got to figure it out."" Lowry got hurt when he flipped backward over the Nets' Quincy Acy while going for an offensive rebound in OT. He got up and went back down with what appeared to be pain in both his back and legs, so much so that teammates trying to carry him off the court had to stop because it appeared Lowry was hurting too much. Lowry, who crashed hard into a cameraman behind the baseline earlier in the game, had X-rays and the Raptors said he had an acute back spasm and would be re-evaluated Tuesday. ""He reminds me a lot of Gary Payton, who threw his body around and he has to play that way to be effective,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""And we love it when he does because he was in there, getting rebounds over their guards and he got clipped on that one and hopefully he's OK."" Lowry had 18 points and 11 assists for Toronto, and Jonas Valanciunas finished with 21 points and 13 rebounds. Spencer Dinwiddie scored a career-high 31 points for the Nets, but his wild shot on a last drive went over the backboard. They have played a franchise-record five straight games decided by three or fewer points, the first NBA team to do that since San Antonio late in the 2012-13 season. ""If these close losses turn into wins, we're close to .500 ball,"" Dinwiddie said. ""We're looking at the playoffs. There's a different morale, different vibe, instead of always coming in here feeling a certain way about whatever happened on the court."" Lowry had a run of seven straight Toronto points to keep a comfortable lead for the Raptors most of the fourth quarter. But suddenly the Nets got hot from 3-point range, and eventually tied it at 107 on Allen Crabbe's drive to the basket with 9.7 seconds remaining. Crabbe was hurt on the play and had to be helped off. Brooklyn then got the first four points of OT and appeared in good shape when Lowry left, but couldn't hold off DeRozan. ""We're going to study it and figure out, `Hey, how can we close these games out,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It's the hardest thing to do in professional sports, is close out a game."" TIP-INS Raptors: Serge Ibaka finished with 11 points and 12 rebounds. ... The Raptors play Cleveland and Golden State in a three-night span later this week. Nets: DeMarre Carroll was held out after injuring his right knee on the final possession of Brooklyn's loss to Boston on Saturday, but Atkinson said the Nets were fortunate the injury wasn't worse. The starting forward is day to day. DEMAR-VELOUS DeRozan won Eastern Conference player of the week honors for the third time this season after averaging an NBA-high 35.7 points in three games last week, highlighted by a franchise-record 52 points in a victory over Milwaukee on Jan. 1. DeRozan also won the award for the weeks of Nov. 13-18 and Dec. 18-24. RUSSELL'S RECOVERY D'Angelo Russell, who had left knee surgery and has been out nearly two months, practiced with the Nets' G League affiliate Monday. Neither Russell nor Atkinson knew when the starting guard would be ready to play for the Nets, but Russell was just glad to take part in what he said was a tough first practice after missing the last 26 games. ""Like I said, just getting that sweat again is what I've been looking for,"" Russell said.","400975338"
"CHICAGO -- The Houston Rockets nailed plenty of 3-pointers early and late, and the lull in between couldn't prevent them from picking up a win they certainly needed. Eric Gordon and Chris Paul each had 24 points and nine assists, Gerald Green scored 22 and the Rockets beat the Chicago Bulls 116-107 on Monday night despite blowing a 21-point lead. Trevor Ariza added 18 points and nine rebounds for the Rockets, who had lost seven of nine. The fact that they've been without NBA scoring leader James Harden lately hasn't made things easier. He missed his fourth straight game because of a strained hamstring. ""We've just got to have everybody play well and play hard because we have a small margin for error,"" Gordon said. ""We've just got to continue to play consistently, play well throughout the game."" It helps when the freewheeling Rockets are connecting from long range. They made 20 of 54 3-pointers despite a big lull in the middle quarters, with Ariza draining six in the game and Green and Gordon each hitting four. The Rockets went 8 of 13 in the first quarter and 7 of 16 in the fourth. In between, they were 5 of 25. ""It means we take a lot of 3s, I do know that,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We are trying to take the right shot and the right play. We will go on a fast break and jack up the 3. ... We will do that. If guys feel comfortable and confident, why not? I kind of like us doing that."" Clint Capela added 15 points and 16 rebounds, and Houston won for the second time in four games without Harden. Bobby Portis led the Bulls with 22 points. Denzel Valentine and Kris Dunn each scored 19, but Chicago lost for the fifth time in six games. ""I think we're definitely improving,"" Dunn said. ""The chemistry is there."" Houston nearly put this one away early, going up by 21 late in the first quarter after Paul's four-point play. But the Bulls got more physical and went ahead in the third. The Rockets regrouped, scoring eight straight to stretch a two-point lead to 10 late in the quarter. Back-to-back 3s by Green and Paul made it 87-76 going into the fourth. LAVINE MEETING The Bulls had no update after forward Zach LaVine and his representatives met Monday with management, coaches and medical staff to set a date for his Chicago debut. Vice president of basketball operations John Paxson figures to give one when he meets with the media on Tuesday. Acquired along with Dunn and Lauri Markkanen in the draft-night trade that sent Jimmy Butler to Minnesota, LaVine appears ready to play for the first time since he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee last February. The two-time slam dunk champion averaged 18.9 points in 47 games for the Timberwolves last season. TIP-INS Rockets: Houston had dropped four of five road games. ... Capela has 20 double-doubles. ... Paul has five straight games with at least nine assists. He also grabbed eight rebounds. Bulls: F Nikola Mirotic missed the game because of a stomach virus that's been bothering him the past few days.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Timberwolves, like so many lesser opponents over the years, have been largely unsuccessful in trying to best LeBron James. This time, they built a lead on Cleveland as big as 41 points before the end of the third quarter. It was just another example of the difference Jimmy Butler has made on this promising team. Andrew Wiggins had 25 points in three quarters, Butler pitched in 21 points and tight defense on James, and the Timberwolves cruised to a 127-99 victory over the Cavaliers on Monday night. ""We did what we're supposed to do at home,"" Butler said. ""We're a really good team. They're a really good team. They missed a lot of shots that they normally make. We all know that. We'll see them again down the road, and hopefully we play the same exact way."" Karl-Anthony Towns (19 points, 12 rebounds) and Taj Gibson (16 points, 13 rebounds) were tenacious around the basket for the Timberwolves, who outrebounded the Cavs 56-37, their largest advantage of the season. The Wolves had a 60-42 edge in points in the paint, and every starter but Towns took the whole fourth quarter off. With their 116-98 win over New Orleans on Saturday, the Wolves have enjoyed a ferocious start to this five-game homestand. ""We just came out the last two games with a certain mentality, a certain focus,"" Towns said. James had just 10 points on 4-for-8 shooting, taking his first loss at Minnesota in 13 games since Feb. 17, 2005. He posted a career-worst minus-39 rating. ""I've won a game and had a bad plus-minus before, so what does that matter?"" James said. ""I don't give a damn about no damn plus/minus."" The deficit for the Cavs reached 41 points after a dunk by Wiggins set up by a driving pass by Tyus Jones, who had grabbed his own miss from 3-point range. Butler had plenty to do with that, contributing nine assists and eight rebounds before resting during the fourth quarter. The Wolves led 69-42 at halftime, matching their largest first-half score from just two nights ago, after a rainbow 3-pointer from the top of the key by Butler brought the fans to their feet. That also tied the most points allowed by the Cavs in any half this season. ""What he's doing every night, it's amazing, but it's also bringing the best out of everyone on the team, and to me that's the true mark of greatness,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said of his hand-picked leader and star who arrived last summer in a trade with Chicago. Butler has experienced seven straight wins over James and the Cavs. He made sure the Wolves didn't slip after the break, knocking down a mid-range fadeaway, stealing the ball back and then swishing a pull-up 3-pointer on the other end to push the lead to 31 points early in the third quarter. Jeff Green scored 22 points off the bench to lead the Cavs, who've lost six of their last nine. Kevin Love, J.R. Smith and Isaiah Thomas, three-fifths of the starting lineup, were a combined 0 for 18 from the field in the first half. Love finished with three points and two rebounds in 21 minutes. But that was hardly the problem. ""We've got to be better defensively,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Kyle Korver, who had 19 points off the bench, connected four times from beyond the arc and passed Paul Pierce for fourth place on the NBA's all-time list in 3-pointers made with 2,147. Ray Allen (2,973), Reggie Miller (2,560) and Jason Terry (2,244) are ahead of him. Timberwolves: After shooting 52 percent from the field, the Wolves improved to 12-2 when making at least half of their shots. HEAVE-HO Thomas was ejected in the third quarter for a flagrant-two foul on Wiggins, for clotheslining him in the jaw as he drove to the basket. ""I didn't mean to do that,"" Thomas said. ""I'm just glad he's all right."" Thomas, still on a playing-time restriction coming off a hip injury, had nine points in 19 minutes. ""I've got to figure out a better way to start the game off,"" he said. TAKE THAT James chased down Jones to swat his fast-break layup attempt into the seats in the second quarter, following with a stare-down and some barbs traded with Aaron Brooks on the Wolves bench. Jones got his revenge a little later in the same period on a similar play, throwing down a dunk just in time before James arrived to try for another block. That was just the second career dunk for Jones, whose first NBA slam was last week. CROWD PLEASER The game marked the fourth consecutive sellout of Target Center for the Timberwolves, their longest streak in nearly five years. Love, who was traded to the Cavs for Wiggins, was the recipient of several rounds of boos in the first quarter. ""We're playing good basketball. Everyone's playing together. We're giving the fans what they want to see,"" said Wiggins, who beat the Cavs, the team that drafted him first overall in 2014 and dealt him before he ever played for them, for the first time.","400975340"
"NEW ORLEANS --  DeMarcus Cousins slammed a water bottle on the floor, angry about the way he was playing and the two early fouls that led coach Alvin Gentry to sit his star center earlier than planned. Water spilled onto the court, causing a delay as Pelicans staffers scrambled to sop it up with towels. By the end of the game, the Pelicans' mercurial big man had redeemed himself with a late-game flourish that helped New Orleans hold on for victory after Anthony Davis was forced from the game with a sprained right ankle. Cousins scored 16 of his 20 points after Davis hobbled to the locker room in the third quarter, lifting New Orleans to a 112-109 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night. ""It's like common sense, I believe. Somebody had to pick up the slack and I was playing (poorly) in the first half,"" Cousins said. ""I let some bad calls get to me early. I was just kind of out of rhythm."" Rajon Rondo capped a 12-point, 15-assist performance with two transition layups in the last 1:21 to help secure a victory the Pelicans needed to restore morale after a listless blowout loss in Minnesota over the weekend. Davis dominated before he left with 4:41 remaining in the third, scoring 30 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in 27 minutes. Cousins, who also had 10 rebounds, elevated his game with aggressive drives and added a timely 3-pointer. ""You've got the two best bigs in the league, man. How they coincide and coexist is great to be able to do that and feed off each other,"" said Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday, who scored 14 points. ""DeMarcus, he's always been just that competitor. When it's his time to take over, he does that and he does it big."" E'Twaun Moore contributed 23 points, moving well without the ball to get open for high percentage layups and floaters. Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy was exasperated by his team's inability to get stops. ""We've lost five straight on the road and all of them have been horrendous defensive efforts,"" Van Gundy said. ""Every one of them. Dallas, Orlando, Miami, Philly, and tonight. Pathetic defensive efforts."" Scoring was not as difficult for Detroit until the final 12 seconds, when Avery Bradley missed two jumpers that could have tied the game. Tobias Harris scored 25 points and Bradley had 24 for the Pistons, who've lost three of four. Andre Drummond, who missed two of Detroit's previous three games, had 16 points and 14 rebounds. Drummond converted alley-oop and driving dunks in the last 1:04, pulling the Pistons within 111-109 with 39 seconds left. But Bradley missed a 21-footer with 11 seconds remaining and was off the mark with a 3 that could have tied it after Holiday missed one of two free throws with 5 seconds left. ""The starters need to start the defensive mentality and make it become contagious,"" Bradley said. ""I take blame for it. ... I need to come out and focus on that and let my teammates feed off my energy."" TIP-INS Pistons: Fell to 8-13 on the road. ... Former Pelicans guard Ish Smith had 16 points. Reggie Bullock and Dwight Buycks each scored 10 points. ... The Pistons were 8 of 27 from 3-point range. ... Forward Stanley Johnson missed his fifth straight game with an injured right hip flexor, but Van Gundy said he should return to action soon. Pelicans: Rondo had nine of his assists in the first quarter, tying a franchise record. ... Pelicans reserves scored only 13 points. ... New Orleans made 6 of 22 3-point attempts, but shot 56.1 percent (46 of 82) overall. MOMENTUM SHIFTS New Orleans led by 14 halfway through the third quarter, when Cousins found Davis for a fast-break dunk. But Davis hurt his ankle less than two minutes later, and the Pistons capitalized with a 9-0 run highlighted by Bradley's 3-pointer and driving layup. New Orleans also was in control early and led by as many as 11 points in the first quarter when Moore hit a layup and an 18-foot pull-up on consecutive possessions. But the Pelicans' rhythm seemed disrupted after Cousins was called for a couple quick fouls. Early in the second quarter, Detroit tied the game on Buycks' driving finger roll, and the Pistons led by six on Bradley's layup minutes later. Davis helped New Orleans regain momentum and take a 59-56 lead into halftime.","400975341"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Out of sync for most of the first three quarters, the San Antonio Spurs got a big lift from LaMarcus Aldridge down the stretch and an even bigger boost off the bench from Davis Bertans. With star forward Kawhi Leonard sidelined indefinitely by a left shoulder tear, it was the perfect combination to keep San Antonio's three-year winning streak against Sacramento going. Aldridge had 31 points and 12 rebounds, Bertans scored a career-high 28 and the Spurs came back from 13 down in the second half to beat the Kings 107-100 on Monday night. ""Guys (were) just being more active,"" Aldridge said. ""In the first half we made a bunch of mistakes and in the second half we cleaned it up. Guys competed, played smarter and we ended up getting a win."" Aldridge provided his normal spark while dominating down low. He scored 21 points in the second half, including six over the final two minutes. Bertans was just as crisp. The 25-year-old Latvian shot 11 of 15 and made a career-high six 3-pointers while teaming with Aldridge to lead the comeback. ""He's a wonderful shooter but he also understands how to play,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He really spreads the court for us. He was a big factor tonight."" Patty Mills added 14 points and five assists, and Bryn Forbes scored 12 to help the Spurs to their 12th consecutive win over the Kings. But it wasn't easy. One night after losing to Portland 111-110, San Antonio was outplayed and outhustled in the first half and was still down 95-90 with four minutes remaining. Kyle Anderson made one of two free throws and Bertans hit back-to-back 3s to put the Spurs up 97-95. After Willie Cauley-Stein's free throw, Aldridge tipped in Mills' miss and then converted a three-point play as San Antonio closed on a 10-3 run. Mills punctuated the win with a steal at midcourt that led to an uncontested layup. That left the Sacramento crowd stunned and silent after the Kings had led by as many as 14. ""Once you get out there you forget about tired legs,"" Bertans said. ""Coming off that loss in Portland it was very important to just keep pounding the rock until the end."" Cauley-Stein had 22 points and nine rebounds for the Kings. De'Aaron Fox added 11 points and 10 assists, and Bogdan Bogdanovic and Garrett Temple scored 16 apiece. The Spurs have not lost to the Kings since Nov. 15, 2014, and have won seven straight in Sacramento. The Kings have dropped six of eight overall. ""It's a tough one to swallow,"" Fox said. ""It was just a few turnovers and then defensively we couldn't get a stop (late)."" Both teams traded buckets early before Sacramento built a double-digit lead before halftime. Zach Randolph, who sat out Sunday's win over Denver because of oral surgery, made a 3-pointer to start an 11-2 run. Fox made a layup and Buddy Hield followed with a 3 after Aldridge turned the ball over in the backcourt. Bogdanovich hit his second 3 of the second quarter to put the Kings up by 14 before the Spurs closed to 56-46 at halftime. ""Guys were playing hard but we were making fatigue mistakes, throwing the ball out of bounds, throwing it to the other team,"" Aldridge said. Aldridge scored 11 of San Antonio's first 13 points in the third quarter, but it was Bertans who kept the Spurs close with his career night. He had two 3s in the third and two in the fourth to fuel the comeback. ""That's what we need from him,"" Aldridge said. ""When he shoots with confidence and he plays with a determination, he's a big-time player. When he's indecisive and he's trying to overthink it, that's when he's not as good as he can be. Today he played with confidence and took the shots that he had."" TIP-INS Spurs: Manu Ginobili was given the night off after scoring a season-high 26 points in the loss to Portland on Sunday. ... Danny Green (groin tightness) missed his fourth consecutive game. Kings: Cauley-Stein had 10 points and five rebounds in the first quarter. ... George Hill missed his second straight game for personal reasons.","400975342"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Even when Stephen Curry isn't at his best he can still be downright brilliant. Curry scored 32 points and dished out nine assists in another superb performance during his sensational recent stretch, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Nuggets 124-114 on Monday night to avenge an ugly home loss to Denver in late December. ""When you've got a guy as talented as Steph, he is who he is,"" teammate David West said. ""The rest of us sort of understand and expect him to do what he's going to do."" Klay Thompson scored 19 on his bobbblehead night while Draymond Green added a season-high 23 points and 10 assists in the defending NBA champions' fifth straight victory on a night when Kevin Durant sat out his third consecutive game with a strained right calf. Nikola Jokic had his first triple-double of the season with 22 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists as four players scored 20 points or more for the Nuggets, who were coming off a 106-98 loss at Sacramento on Saturday. In his 12th 30-point game of the season, Curry hit a long 3-pointer with 56.1 seconds left in the third and the Warriors led 93-81 going into the final quarter after the Nuggets had fought back to tie it midway through the period. ""I didn't think he played that well, but this is Steph Curry. On a night when he's not maybe at his best, he's still dominating the game in parts,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""He hit the big shots during that stretch."" Curry shot 9 for 17 overall, including 5 of 10 from 3-point territory. The two-time MVP has scored 29 or more points in seven straight games. In four games before Monday, he was averaging 36 points, six rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.3 steals in 31.8 minutes since returning from an 11-game absence due to a sprained right ankle. The Western Conference player of the week for last week, Curry strained his left knee in the first half, headed to the locker room to have it taped and then returned. West contributed 10 points, scoring in double figures for a third straight game to go with six rebounds and four assists while becoming the 127th player in NBA history to play in 1,000 regular-season games. ""It looks like his 100th game, the way he's moving out there,"" Thompson said. Said Kerr: ""David West is playing like he's 25 years old."" Thompson made his initial four shots and Green scored eight quick points, connecting on his first three field goal attempts. He handed out five assists as Golden State raced ahead 27-20 -- a far cry from the Warriors' previous performance in a 96-81 loss to Denver at Oracle Arena on Dec. 23. The Warriors shot 3 for 27 in that game from 3-point range but topped that with four 3s in the first quarter Monday and finished 13 for 30 from deep. Thompson's 3-pointer with 4:10 left in the third made it 78-71 after Denver had tied the game 89-all at the 6:57 mark of the period. The Nuggets held the Warriors to a season-low scoring performance here last time that snapped their 11-game winning streak. Golden State has won seven of eight since. Denver got 22 points from Gary Harris, and 21 apiece from Jamal Murray and Trey Lyles. ""Even when there were times where it looked like the game was getting out of hand, our guys never let go of the rope,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""We never quit working. We forced them to bring their starters back in. We forced them to finish that game out."" DURANT UPDATE Kerr said Durant ""didn't feel quite right"" after going through shootaround earlier in the day. ""We're all on the same page that until he feels right, he's not going to play,"" Kerr said. ""Hopefully the next couple of days he'll clear that hurdle and be ready to go."" GREEN FINED Green was fined $25,000 by the NBA for publicly criticizing the league's officiating in comments after Golden State's 121-105 win against the Clippers on Saturday. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver limited its turnovers to 11 after committing a season-high 26 at Sacramento two days earlier that led to 40 Kings points. ... Denver is 3-11 on the road vs. Western Conference teams. Warriors: Andre Iguodala hit his first 3-pointer in nine games he's played since Dec. 18, snapping an 0-for-12 funk from deep when he made one in the first. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  C.J. Williams took a shot coach Doc Rivers didn't want him to take, and Rivers could only laugh. Just as he's prone to do with these Clippers. Williams hit a 3-pointer from the left wing with nine seconds left to lift Los Angeles over the Atlanta Hawks 108-107 on Monday night. ""I've made that shot before. It was just a rhythm dribble to my left,"" Williams said. ""Once we got the offensive rebound, I felt the momentum and I felt the excitement of the moment, so I wanted to take the 3. I took that dribble and I shot it with confidence. As soon as I let it go I knew it was in."" Lou Williams led Los Angeles with 34 points but missed a late 3 that resulted in a long rebound by Wesley Johnson. He passed the ball out to C.J. Williams for a shot that snapped the Clippers' two-game skid. ""The thing about Doc is he didn't necessarily want the 3, but he lets you play,"" C.J. Williams said. ""I was in rhythm. As soon as I took the dribble it felt good. I didn't want to take it all the way to the basket and take a chance of getting my shot blocked."" With his team down 107-105, Rivers wanted the Clippers to go for a two-point basket to tie it, only to be overruled by his rookie in the final seconds. ""I was actually yelling, `We don't need a 3,"" Rivers said. ""But you could see he was comfortable and he wanted it. ""I've said I love coaching this team,"" he added. ""They play hard. We laugh a lot. We have to with some of the things we do out there on the floor. We make some crazy mistakes at times. But with this group you've just got to laugh it off and move on to the next play."" Atlanta set up its defense to keep Lou Williams from taking the Clippers' last shot. ""We didn't want him to make the last shot, but he was able to get one off,"" coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""Long rebound and Wesley Johnson comes up with it and kicks it to C.J. Williams, who makes a tough 3. That's just a bad break for us."" On the final possession, Atlanta got the ball to Kent Bazemore, who was guarded by Johnson. He forced Bazemore to pass across to Taurean Prince, who missed a 15-foot jumper with three seconds remaining. ""Wes saved us with the switch,"" Rivers said. ""When Prince got the ball, he was shooting over Lou and I was dying over there."" DeAndre Jordan added 25 points and 18 rebounds as Los Angeles won despite blowing a 13-point lead in the third quarter. The Clippers played without leading scorer Blake Griffin, who suffered a concussion Saturday against Golden State. Prince scored 20 points, Dennis Schroder added 18 and Kent Bazemore and Ersan Ilyasova had 13 apiece for Atlanta, which lost its fourth straight. With the score tied at 105, Lou Williams missed a short shot and Bazemore made two free throws after being fouled in the lane with 23 seconds to play, putting Atlanta up 107-105. After C.J. Williams hit a floater from the left baseline with 3:35 left, tying the score at 99, Bazemore followed up a layup with a 3-pointer to give Atlanta a 104-100 lead with 2:11 to play. After Lou Williams committed a turnover, Bazemore was fouled by Jordan and hit one of two free throws for a 105-99 advantage. The Hawks then decided to foul Jordan on three consecutive possessions. He made five of six free throws to pull Los Angeles to 105-104 with 1:08 left. The Clippers forced an Atlanta turnover on the ensuing inbounds play, and Juwan Evans made the first of two free throws. Johnson was called for basket interference as the second shot hung on the rim, giving Atlanta the ball with the score tied at 105. ""They were just flying up and down the court, scoring in transition in the first half,"" Budenholzer said. ""Then we got our transition defense in a better place in the second half, and make them play in the half court. If you do that you at least give yourself a chance."" GRIFFIN UPDATE Griffin was inactive against the Hawks, but did ride an exercise bike during the Clippers' workout earlier in the day and continues to progress toward a return that Rivers expects to be at least three or four days away. ""He's passed a couple of tests already,"" the coach said. ""The whole (concussion) protocol thing now, you have to go through the entire protocol. I think he has another couple of tests to pass, and we'll just have to wait."" TIP-INS Hawks: Prince was a game-time decision, as the Hawks wanted to see how he felt about his dislocated right ring finger after pregame warmups. Prince was injured in the first quarter against the Lakers the night before. ... Fifth-year center Duane Dedmon was on a minutes restriction in his first game after missing 19 with a left tibia stress reaction, Budenholzer said. Clippers: Los Angeles played without four of its five opening-night starters (Griffin, Patrick Beverley, Danilo Gallinari and Milos Teodosic), and the first man off the bench in that game, Austin Rivers. Jordan was the only opening-night starter to play against the Hawks. ... Jordan, a career 43 percent free throw shooter, made 21 of his 25 free throws over the previous four games.","400975344"
"TORONTO --  Wayne Ellington leads Miami in 3-pointers, which made Tuesday's game-winning basket a bit of a surprise. Ellington converted a go-ahead driving layup with less than a second remaining, and the Heat stopped Toronto's 12-game home winning streak with a 90-89 victory over the Raptors. ""That's probably the last thing anybody would think that he would do is put the ball on the floor,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""I think it caught everybody by surprise, including me."" It was the only basket of the second half for Ellington, who finished with 15 points. Ellington said he considered shooting after catching the inbounds pass from Goran Dragic, but decided to drive along the baseline past Toronto's Pascal Siakam before laying the ball in off the glass. ""I looked at the rim and I saw him just charging hard,"" Ellington said. ""Obviously, that's what they wanted to take away from me, was that 3-ball in the corner. I was able to get loose, man, and get around him."" Like his coach, Dragic also was surprised when Ellington didn't launch a 3. ""I thought he was going to shoot it but he made a great read,"" Dragic said. Dragic had 24 points and matched his career high with 12 rebounds as Miami extended its season-best winning streak to five. Bam Adebayo had 16 points and a career-high 15 rebounds and Hassan Whiteside collected 13 points and 15 boards for the Heat, who had dropped their previous five visits to Toronto. The Raptors were without point guard Kyle Lowry after the three-time All-Star bruised his tailbone during Monday's overtime win at Brooklyn. DeMar DeRozan scored 25 points as the Raptors lost for the first time in six games and failed to break the franchise record for consecutive home victories. Serge Ibaka finished with 11 after he was ejected in the second half. ""We let them get easy points,"" DeRozan said. It was Toronto's first home loss since Nov. 5 against Washington, a game in which Lowry was ejected early in the second quarter. The Raptors are 14-2 at home. Ibaka and Miami's James Johnson were ejected after trading punches at 7:50 of the third quarter. The skirmish began when the two started shoving one another while waiting for the ball to be inbounded under the Miami basket. Officials reviewed the incident before giving both players technical fouls and ejections. ""It certainly felt like there was something at stake from the very tip, and that's the way it should be in this league,"" Spoelstra said. ""There was a physicality, an edge to the game."" Tempers flared again after the final whistle, with DeRozan appearing to yell at Dragic as the teams left the court. ""Nothing special,"" Dragic said. ""Just exchanged some words. No big deal."" Miami guard Tyler Johnson, who had started the previous 10 games, was unavailable after he strained his left shoulder at shootaround. His status for Wednesday's game at Indiana was not known. TIP-INS Heat: Miami outrebounded Toronto 64-37. ... Improved to 14-3 when holding opponents below 100 points. ... Ellington had three of Miami's four 3-pointers.

"OKLAHOMA CITY -- While Damian Lillard tries to get past a lingering injury, the Portland Trail Blazers are relying on each other to fashion a nice run of positive results. CJ McCollum had 27 points and seven assists, and the Trail Blazers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 117-106 on Tuesday night in the opener of a four-game trip. Shabazz Napier added 21 points and Jusuf Nurkic had 20 points and eight rebounds for Portland, which moved past Oklahoma City into second in the Northwest Division standings with its seventh win in its last nine games against the Thunder. Portland has won four of five overall despite playing most of that stretch without Lillard, who sat out for the seventh time in the last nine games with a left calf strain. ""There's not as much pressure,"" McCollum said. ""Obviously, you're down a guy like Damien, who's able to do everything . and can take over a quarter and bail us out at times. When we come on a road trip like this, the guys are like, `Oh, Damien's hurt. We're not supposed to win.' I think everybody plays a little bit looser, understanding that we're playing against upper-tier Western Conference competition. ""Executing and playing the right way has been big for us and being comfortable with making aggressive mistakes, then moving on."" Russell Westbrook had 22 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds for Oklahoma City, which is slumping a bit after playing well for most of December. The Thunder have dropped four of six, with three of those losses coming at home and another at Phoenix on Sunday. Oklahoma City shot 44 percent from the field while Portland made 53.1 percent of its shots. Paul George scored 22 points for the Thunder, and Carmelo Anthony had 19. ""I think it's a lack of energy,"" Anthony said. ""We played in spurts tonight. I think the last two games the energy has just been down. With that, we were one step behind on a lot of plays. We didn't put a full game together these past two games. As a result, we lost these two. ... It happens.""

"DALLAS -- Dennis Smith Jr. and Yogi Ferrell helped set the pace for the Dallas Mavericks in their 114-99 win over the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night. It started with rebounding. The 6-foot Ferrell led the team with eight boards, the 6-3 Smith had seven and the Mavericks used that spark to get offense going the other way. ""Me and Yogi run (after rebounding),"" Smith said. ""We find each other on the break pretty well, and when we can get into the paint it opens up the floor for everybody."" Ferrell said it was a result of the rest of the team boxing out, and he just benefited by grabbing the ball. ""Those guys do the hard part. We do the easy part and get boards,"" Ferrell said. ""When we do that it gets our break started a lot quicker."" It also led to a balanced scoring output for Dallas. Dirk Nowitzki and Smith each scored 20 points as the Mavericks stopped a three-game slide. Wesley Matthews had 16 points for Dallas, which got its first win since Dec. 31 against Oklahoma City. Harrison Barnes and Ferrell scored 15 apiece, while J.J. Barea had 12 assists and eight points. ""Yogi came in and really changed the game,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""His impact on the offensive and defensive ends -- his energy was great. In the first half, he was the one guy who was really battling on the boards for us, the shortest guy out there."" Carlisle earned his 708th career win, moving past John MacLeod for 17th in NBA history. Next up is Gene Shue with 784. Aaron Gordon scored 19 points for Orlando, which has lost five in a row. D.J. Augustin had 18 points, and Marreese Speights finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds. The Magic have allowed at least 100 points in four of their last five games and have lost 14 of 15. ""They've just got to do better,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""We've got to figure that out."" The Magic led 48-43 at halftime, but Nowitzki and Smith helped the Mavericks rally with 15 points apiece in the second half. With his team leading 66-64 and 4:04 remaining in the third quarter, Ferrell made a pull-up jumper and Barnes followed with another jump shot. The Mavs carried an 82-75 lead into the fourth. ""We didn't stick with the same energy that we had in the first half,"" Augustin said. ""We didn't come out and execute like we were supposed to, like we did in the first half, and it kind of fell apart at the end."" The Magic pulled within four in the final period before the Mavericks closed the game with a 14-3 run over the final four minutes. Dallas shot 51.8 percent from the floor. Orlando shot 45.6 percent and had 13 turnovers in a sloppy offensive performance. OFF THE BENCH Gordon didn't start after he violated team rules. Vogel didn't elaborate on what rule, but Gordon indicated it had to do with being late to a team function. ""Obviously, it hurts. I want to be on the floor as much as I can and starting,"" Gordon said. ""I understand that time management is crucial. Being punctual is part of character. Having a high character leads into winning. It's the little things that matter, so I understand why they did it.""

With Ball leading the charge, the Lakers were at their most effective when pushing the ball up the court, and they picked up where they left off after tying a franchise record with 42 fast-break points against Atlanta on Sunday. They had a 35-8 edge on the break this time, and Ball's 11 assists were his most since the rookie sustained a shoulder injury that sidelined him for six games. He finished with five points. ""He creates our pace for us,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""He makes winning plays for us. He gets other people easy shots, so he impacted the game on both ends of the floor and was a big part of why we won tonight."" Walton was not sated by the win, however. He was unhappy with the Lakers' 26 turnovers and a lackadaisical attitude after going on a 19-0 run in the first quarter. Fueled by eight points from Ingram and seven from Randle, who had 13 points and five rebounds in the first half, Los Angeles took an 18-point lead, its largest of the night. But the second unit let Sacramento right back into the game, and the Lakers were only up 31-27 at the end of the quarter. ""We're trying to play a certain way and have a certain standard,"" Walton said. ""We've been struggling. We will take a win when we can get it, but it just doesn't feel the same way as when you play the game the right way throughout."" Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 19 points off the bench for the Kings, who have lost five of six. De'Aaron Fox had 15 points and Buddy Hield scored 13. Kings coach Dave Joerger thought fatigue did his team in following a 107-100 loss to San Antonio on Monday. Sacramento shot a season-worst 34.5 percent from the field (30 of 87). ""It's just that time of year where you have to keep grinding away,"" Joerger said. ""We made too many mental mistakes, made some really bad turnovers that are just head-scratchers. The guys are getting better, and we'll just keep plugging away."" LONG-RANGE LOPEZ Los Angeles opened an 84-74 lead going into the fourth quarter, closing the third on a 22-10 run. Sacramento started the second half with a 14-3 surge to take an eight-point lead before Lopez hit three 3-pointers. Lopez then missed from long range on what he admitted was a heat-check shot, but Ball was under the basket for a putback. Lopez finished 5 of 8 from 3-point range. ""They made the last run and just kind of sustained it,"" Fox said. REARRANGING FOR RANDLE Randle spent most of the season using his superior athleticism to get the better of backup centers and power forwards as a scorer. Walton wants him to be just as willing to pass when driving down the lane now that Randle is becoming a more regular presence in the starting lineup. The growing pains were evident, with six assists and six turnovers against the length of Zach Randolph and Willie Cauley-Stein. ""Tonight he had moments where he was great at it and there were moments where he over-penetrated and we got in trouble,"" Walton said. TIP-INS Kings: G George Hill missed his third straight game to be with his wife, who is pregnant. Lakers: Ball had his ninth career double-double. ... Randle had his eighth double-double of the season.","400975348"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Mavericks point guard Dennis Smith Jr. had a simple strategy in the fourth quarter when it came to Harrison Barnes. ""Give him the ball and get out of the way,"" Smith said. Barnes had 13 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, Yogi Ferrell made seven 3-pointers and scored 22 points and the Mavericks fended off fatigue to beat a fresh Charlotte Hornets team 115-111 on Wednesday night. Barnes made all five of his shots in the fourth quarter and added 11 rebounds for the Mavericks, who won on back-to-back nights. Barnes said he liked his matchup against Frank Kaminsky in the fourth quarter. ""I just tried to be aggressive and attack the rim,"" Barnes said. ""I saw a few shots drop and I was kind of in a rhythm after that. Coach kept going to me and just kept on converting."" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle called Barnes' game ""absolutely brilliant."" ""He hit on a variety of shots -- 2s, 3s, drives,"" Carlisle said. ""Look that's what great players do. Really proud of him. He had a pretty good rhythm going all night. We just needed to get the ball in his hands."" Dirk Nowitzki added 19 points -- one shy of his season high -- and Smith had 15 points and six assists. It was a crushing loss for the Hornets, who were coming off a 3-1 West Coast road trip that included a win over the Golden State Warriors. Kemba Walker had 41 points on 16-of-28 shooting for the Hornets. Dwight Howard had 15 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte, but was an anemic 5 of 18 from the foul line, which proved costly in a close game. The Mavericks were playing their third game in four days, while the Hornets were coming off a four-day layoff. But Dallas showed no signs of wearing down in the fourth quarter, repeatedly thwarting Charlotte's attempts to take the lead. Charlotte trailed by six entering the fourth quarter, but Jeremy Lamb buried a 3-pointer from the right wing to pull the Hornets even with 9 minutes left. But the Hornets could never grab the lead. The big play came with 2 minutes remaining when Salah Mejri ripped an offensive rebound away from Howard and kicked the ball out to Ferrell, who buried a 3-pointer from the top of the key to give the Mavericks a 5-point lead. Barnes followed with a long 3 on the next possession. ""I told him, if you aren't getting the ball enough, let me know,"" Smith said. ""I will do whatever it takes to get it to you, especially if you are in a groove like that. That's what he does, he closes."" TIP INS: Mavericks: The team was awarded two-way forward Jalen Jones on a waiver claim. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. In a related move, the Mavericks also requested waivers on two-way guard Kyle Collinsworth. Hornets: Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas said backup center Cody Zeller is ""not very close"" to returning to action following his left knee injury. ""He just started doing some spot shooting, but he's not very close,"" Silas said. DIRK DOES IT AGAIN: Yes, it's painful to watch him run up and down the court, but Nowitzki still finds a way to be productive in his 20th season. He repeatedly hit big shots -- both 3s and fadeaways -- at clutch times. ""Dirk's really one of the most amazing athletes I've ever seen or been around,"" Carlisle said. ""To perform like this at the advanced age of 39 in the NBA is just unbelievable."" HORNETS `DIRE' WITHOUT WALKER: The Hornets (15-24) are struggling, but Silas said things would be ""pretty dire"" to imagine the team without Walker, who is second in scoring among point guards in the Eastern Conference. ""He does everything,"" Silas said. ""He comes up with big steals. He goes for charges. He makes every big pick and roll play, every shot, every play for everybody else.""","400975349"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Miami found out an eight-man rotation might be just as effective as a full bench. Sometimes, it can even be better. Goran Dragic scored 20 points and backup Wayne Ellington made the decisive 3-pointer with 25.5 seconds left Wednesday night to help the Heat fend off a late charge to hold on for a rare 114-106 victory at Indiana. ""None of these wins are going to come easy, but I think it just says a lot about how tough we are,"" Josh Richardson said after scoring 14 points and shooting 3 of 4 from 3-point range. ""Every night, we have to scratch and claw for everything and it's paying off."" This game might have been their most impressive yet. With four players sitting out because of injuries, Tyler Johnson not expected to dress and James Johnson suspended by the league for throwing punches in a victory over Toronto, the Heat showed up at Bankers Life Fieldhouse expecting only seven players to be available for their second road game in two nights. Tyler Johnson, it turns out, managed to play through a sprained left shoulder giving coach Erik Spoelstra one more body to divvy up the minutes. And he needed every one. Ellington, Johnson and Bam Adebayo all played more than 30 minutes, all scored 15 points off the bench and all made key plays throughout the game as Miami won its sixth in a row and snapped a 10-game road losing streak against the Pacers. Hassan Whiteside added 16 points and 15 rebounds. ""We knew it was going to be tough here. (Indiana) plays extremely well at home,"" Spoelstra said. ""They're athletic. They have great team speed. It wasn't a perfect game by any means, but it was probably a little bit more to our pace and our liking."" It was good enough to fend off the hard-charging Pacers, who had won their previous two games. Victor Oladipo had 26 points, seven rebounds and four assists and Lance Stephenson gave Indiana a late boost of energy that nearly led Indiana back from a 10-point deficit in the final 9:57. Stephenson wound up with 15 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Miami showed no sign of fatigue early, shooting better than 60 percent for most of the first two quarters and took a 58-47 lead at halftime. And when Indiana used a 14-2 run to get within 65-63, the Heat fought through the weariness again. Indiana blew its first chance to tie the score, or take the lead, when Al Jefferson drew an offensive foul late in the third. The Heat then retook an 84-78 lead after three and extended the margin to 90-80 early in the fourth on a basket by Adebayo. That's when the Pacers turned it on. They scored six straight to make it 92-89 and used another 6-0 spurt to finally tie it at 97 on Stephenson's 18-footer with 5:09 left. But Miami broke the tie on Johnson's 3 and put it away when Ellington's shot dropped in for to make it 109-103. ""They hit some tough shots,"" Oladipo said. ""They've been hitting tough shots every win, the last three or four wins, down to wire and they executed again. Credit them, they did a great job."" TIP-INS Heat: Dragic also finished with nine assists. ... Miami has won 13 consecutive games in January including last season, the longest active streak in the league. ... The home team had won 18 of the previous 20 regular-season games in this series. Pacers: Missed their first 10 3s and wound up 1 of 18 from beyond the arc. Indiana also went 19 of 29 from the free-throw line. ... Thaddeus Young had 12 points and nine rebounds. ... Domantas Sabonis had 18 points and seven rebounds after replacing Myles Turner in the starting lineup. TURNER OUT Turner injured his right elbow Monday night after making a dunk in the victory over Milwaukee. The team announced he wouldn't play Wednesday morning and said he would miss at least one more game as he continues to be evaluated. He showed up in street clothes and wore a protective brace over his sport coat on the bench. Turner was averaging 2.24 blocks per game, second in the league. ""We'll get more information after Friday's game,"" coach Nate McMillan said.","400975350"
"Rodney Hood gets tossed after his second technical foul and then knocks a phone out of a fan's hand as he walks off. (0:37) WASHINGTON --  The Washington Wizards had every reason to take the Jazz seriously after they were routed by 47 points in Utah last month. Nonetheless, their uneven play against inferior opponents continued. Ricky Rubio scored 21 points, Donovan Mitchell had 16 and the short-handed Jazz completed a season sweep of the Wizards with a 107-104 win on Wednesday night. Ekpe Udoh scored 16 points and Joe Johnson had 16 off the bench for the Jazz, who had lost 13 of 16 in between meetings with Washington. The Wizards (23-18), who were embarrassed 116-69 in Utah on Dec. 4, fell to 11-10 against teams with losing records. ""That is something you never stop thinking about as a competitor,"" Washington forward Kelly Oubre Jr. said of the previous drubbing, ""and that's why it hurts even more to lose this one."" Utah played without two starters, and second-leading scorer Rodney Hood was ejected in the second half. ""We had a great effort from a lot of guys and I think at the end there's just a determination,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder. ""We were fortunate that a few shots missed and we made a couple big ones when we needed to. I thought we made some of our own luck tonight."" Washington did not have John Wall in the first meeting with Utah. The four-time All-Star had 35 points and 11 assists but committed eight of the Wizards' season-high-matching 23 turnovers. Bradley Beal had 23 points, but lost the ball with 2.9 seconds remaining while attempting a game-tying 3-pointer. ""You're not going to win a game if you turn it over that many times,"" Beal said. Washington shot 8-for-22 in the fourth quarter. ""We know on offense you can make or miss shots but on defense you've got to make stops at the end,"" Rubio said, ""and I think we did it tonight and that's why we got the win."" The Wizards shot 52.6 percent from the field but lost their second straight after winning their previous four. Utah (17-24) got just its fourth road win of the season. Washington trailed by 10 early in the fourth quarter before Wall hit a pair of 3-pointers during an 11-3 surge that gave the Wizards a one-point lead. Joe Ingles responded with a 3-pointer that put Utah ahead 104-102 with 1:09 remaining. Washington's defense erred with an ill-advised double-team on Mitchell's penetration. ""It was good in the first half, (but) in that third quarter, and then the last two minutes we made so many mistakes. ... It cannot happen,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. Washington led most of the first half and 50-46 at halftime, but Utah seized momentum with a 16-3 run in the third quarter, during which Hood received his second technical foul. Rubio's jumper after one of the Wizards' nine turnovers in the quarter put the Jazz up 83-75. TIP-INS Jazz: Utah outscored Washington 37-27 in the third, and Udoh scored 10 points in the period. . Ingles had 10 points. ... Already without C Rudy Gobert, Utah played without F/C Derrick Favors (right ankle sprain).

""I'm not a real creative offensive guy, as you guys all know,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy joked after the game. ""If we find something that's working, I tend to just keep going to it. Tobias got off to a great start. I thought Andre Drummond was outstanding all night."" Dwight Buycks added 17 points for the Pistons. ""I thought from the jump we got good defensive stops,"" Harris said. ""We were able to get out in transition. Andre was a big focus, especially for them, so we were able to get some open looks and just capitalize off that."" Allen Crabbe scored 20 points and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 15 points for the Nets, who have lost three in a row. ""They were just the aggressor, more physical,"" Crabbe said. ""They made us turn the ball over. They basically had control of the game for the majority of the game. Trying to play catch up in this league is not easy.

"NEW YORK --  Lauri Markkanen had knocked down eight 3-pointers and almost knocked out his coach with a soaring slam, but Kris Dunn couldn't get anything to fall. He kept shooting, and eventually hit the shot that put the Bulls on top for good. Markkanen scored a season-high 33 points, Dunn shook off a nightmarish shooting night to make the tiebreaking basket in the second overtime, and Chicago beat the New York Knicks 122-119 on Wednesday night. ""It was a hard-fought win,"" Markkanen said. ""We could have ended it a little bit earlier, but (that's) just how we won."" Dunn had missed 14 of his first 17 shots before banking in a runner with just under a minute left in the second extra period and Markkanen finished it off by making two free throws with 6.8 seconds remaining. The rookie added 10 rebounds. ""For Lauri to come in on the big stage, the World's Most Famous Arena, and hit eight 3s and play against arguably the best power forward in the league in Porzingis, play 46 minutes and hit those big free throws late, just tells you everything you need to know,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. Robin Lopez and Denzel Valentine each scored 20 points for the Bulls in their third narrow victory over the Knicks this season. Markkanen was 8 of 15 behind the arc though his highlight play was at the rim, when he threw down a dunk over Knicks center Enes Kanter . ""I damn near passed out when he dunked that one,"" Hoiberg said. ""When he took that full court and just cocked it back, I was speechless. I got chills. It was crazy.""

Kristaps Porzingis finished with 24 points, including a dunk at the buzzer to force the second OT. `We had opportunities. We didn't get stops at crucial times,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. Lopez then had the first two baskets of the second OT, and after the Knicks got the next two, Dunn made his shot to make it 118-116. He'd had plenty of easier looks that didn't fall, but his teammates and coaches told him to keep shooting. ""The mid-range, that's my shot, and I kept getting to my spots,"" Dunn said. ""I liked the shot and it wasn't falling, and the fact that the sky floater goes in is just like, all right, if that's going to go in, then we're going to have to accept it.""

LaVine, acquired in the trade for Jimmy Butler, hoped to play in this game, but neither the Bulls nor their G League affiliate had enough practice days between games to get him ready enough.

"HOUSTON --  With James Harden injured, the Houston Rockets are figuring out different ways to make up for the offense the league's leading scorer normally provides. On Wednesday night, that meant Chris Paul took 29 shots and finished with a season-high 37 points to help the Rockets to a 121-112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. Paul tied his career high for field-goal attempts in a regulation game. He took 33 shots and scored 42 points in a double-overtime game with New Orleans in 2008. His 37 points were the most by a Rocket besides Harden since Jeremy Lin had 38 against San Antonio on Dec. 10, 2012. Paul, who made 13 field goals, was asked if he realized he'd come close to taking the most shots in his career. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""It kind of felt like it. Like goodness. I missed a lot, too. That's what I'm mad about."" Portland coach Terry Stotts said Paul was tough to stop. ""He was exceptional,"" Stotts said. ""He really controlled the game, like he can do. His shot-making was as good as I've seen."" Eric Gordon added 30 points as the Rockets withstood a late run to win their second straight. The Blazers used a big run to cut a 14-point deficit to three with about three minutes left. Houston responded with a 6-2 run, capped by a 3-pointer from Paul, to make it 111-104 about a minute later. Damian Lillard made a layup on the other end, but Paul cut through three defenders to make an off-balance layup to push the lead to 113-106. The Blazers couldn't get the ball in after a timeout, Houston got the ball back and Clint Capela added two free throws to secure the victory. The Rockets won their second straight and improved to 3-2 in five games without Harden, who is out for at least two weeks with a hamstring injury. Lillard scored 29 after missing the last two games with a strained right calf, and C.J. McCollum added 24 points as the Blazers saw a three-game winning streak snapped. Paul had 11 assists, seven rebounds and three steals, and Capela added 13 points with eight rebounds. Gerald Green scored all of Houston's points in a 5-2 run that extended the lead to 103-89 midway through the fourth period. He finished with 12 points and has scored in double digits in seven straight games for the first time since 2015. ""We're having to manufacture points in different ways,"" Paul said. ""Gerald continues to be great and be aggressive. ... James averages 30 and we're just doing it by committee."" Lillard scored the first seven points of an 11-0 spurt that got the Trail Blazers within 103-100 with about 3 1/2 minutes left. Paul received a technical in that span for arguing about a foul called on P.J. Tucker. The Rockets led by nine entering the fourth quarter and were up by 11 with about 7 1/2 minutes remaining after Gordon scored four points. He made a layup before missing a shot on the next possession, only to grab it with one hand and finish with a dunk that made it 98-87. Portland's Ed Davis was called for a flagrant foul late in the third when he hit Tarik Black in the right eye as Black dunked. Black remained on the court for a couple of minutes before being helped to his feet and escorted to the locker room, holding a towel over his right eye. The team said he had an abrasion to his right eye and he'll miss Friday's game. Paul made the free throw on that play, and Tucker added a layup after that to extend the lead to 84-74.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  After a poor defensive performance in the first quarter, the Memphis Grizzlies turned up the pressure all the way until the last minute. The Grizzlies held New Orleans to a mere nine points in the third period and then forced a key turnover by DeMarcus Cousins in the final seven seconds to help them defeat the Pelicans 105-102 on Wednesday night. With New Orleans trailing 103-102, Cousins headed to the middle of the lane, but had the ball knocked away by Marc Gasol. Tyreke Evans, who was fouled immediately after the turnover -- the Pelicans' 12th of the game -- converted a pair of free throws with 5.9 seconds left. ""It was a risky play,"" Gasol said of helping defensively on Cousins. ""Once I saw him put the head down and not really seeing it, I saw a chance and took a gamble and it paid off."" After Evans' foul shots, the Pelicans had a chance for a tie, but E'Twaun Moore's 3-point attempt from the left wing bounced off the front of the rim. ""You've got to live with it,"" said Moore. ""That didn't go in. You've got to go to the next time. That's all."" Evans scored 28 points, while Gasol finished with 21 points and 10 rebounds for Memphis.

Cousins was 2 of 10 from the field entering the fourth, but scored 14 points in the final quarter. He had four 3-pointers in the fourth, including a trio of 3s as the Pelicans overcame an 11-point deficit. ""Basically, had some open shots,"" Cousins said. ""Found shots in the flow of the game."" After leading 61-60 at halftime, the Pelicans ran into offensive problems in the third quarter when they scored nine points -- a season low for any quarter. They made only four of their 17 shots and missed all four free throw attempts. ""Bad quarter. Terrible quarter,"" Cousins said. That allowed Memphis, which scored just 17 points in the period, to take a 77-70 lead heading to the fourth. ""Obviously, we struggled in the third quarter,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We struggled to make a shot. I thought our defense was great in the third quarter. But when you give up 17 points and score nine, that was a major problem in the second half.""

""It was a great shot,"" Gentry said. ""We're not going to get a better shot than that."" NO FOUL The last New Orleans possession began with 5.9 seconds left, and interim Memphis coach J.B.

"MILWAUKEE --  With a lineup full of long, athletic players, the Milwaukee Bucks can make up for poor nights from the 3-point line by wearing down opponents in transition. They ran away from Orlando on Wednesday night once they figured out how to slow down the lowly Magic. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 26 points, Khris Middleton added 22 and the Bucks turned up their defensive intensity after a porous first quarter for a 110-103 win on Wednesday night. John Henson picked up his fifth double-double of the year with 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Bucks, who handed the Magic their sixth straight loss and 15th in their last 16. ""Our defense is our biggest thing right now so we can get out on transition,"" guard Eric Bledsoe said. ""I thought we got a lot of easy buckets in transition -- that's our game.""

The 6-foot-11 forward backed down Aaron Gordon in the post, then used a spin move to drive for a layup on a three-point play for a 66-57 lead with 7:55 left in the third. After an empty Orlando possession, Antetokounmpo took a feed along the baseline from Bledsoe for an uncontested dunk. The Magic called timeout but it did not help. ""In the third quarter, the starting group did a really good job of taking control of the game,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. Leading by 20 to start the fourth quarter, Kidd was able to get some rest for Antetokounmpo and Bledsoe (15 points) with the Golden State Warriors visiting Milwaukee on Friday night. Evan Fournier had 21 points to lead Orlando, which cut the deficit to single digits during the closing minutes with reserves on the floor. Gordon had 11 points but was just 4 of 18 from the field in 30 minutes, including a stretch of 12 straight missed shots in the second and third quarters. He was averaging 24.8 points over his previous five games. After shooting 50 percent in the first quarter, Orlando tailed off to 32 percent (15 of 46) in the second and third quarters combined. ""I think we're fighting. I think we're playing hard,"" coach Frank Vogel said. ""We're just not a very good basketball team right now. We got to fight and execute."" TIP-INS Magic: A stretch of losing has led to questions from some fans about whether Orlando should be tanking for a high draft pick. Vogel wants no part of that discussion. ""That's not a word I digest. I'm trying to build a winning culture, winning habits. And that's my only focus,"" Vogel said before the game. Bucks: F Jabari Parker is on target to return from a left knee injury the week before the All-Star break. Kidd said Parker was doing great and is about a month away from playing. ... Henson had an active night , including eight points and eight rebounds to help the Bucks take a seven-point halftime lead. OUT OF THE PAINT Middleton said the Bucks made a concerted effort to keep the Magic out of the lane after the first quarter, forcing them to take contested jumpers. Gordon didn't have his outside shot to make up for his lack of production inside. ""I mean, they've got a long defense,"" Gordon said. ""They don't make it easy for you to score at the rim. My outside shot definitely was not falling tonight."" NO SHOT The Magic also had a tough night from 3-point range, shooting 2 of 13 (15 percent) in the first half. They finished 8 of 29 (27 percent), including 4 of 8 by Marreese Speights (14 points). QUOTABLE ""Energy-wise, it was a 10. Sharing the ball, getting stops ... I thought they did a great job."" -- Kidd.","400975356"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Taj Gibson and his teammates knew the Minnesota Timberwolves' four-game homestand was going to be tough. After all, New Orleans, Cleveland, Oklahoma City and New York were coming to town. Well, three games in, Minnesota has answered the challenge and demonstrated how much it has grown this season. Jimmy Butler scored 26 points, grabbed seven rebounds and had eight assists for the Timberwolves in a 104-88 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday night. ""We were shaking our heads and just hoping that we can do well,"" Gibson said. ""But the way we've been playing, we have a lot of confidence."" Andrew Wiggins added 19 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns had 18 points and 12 rebounds as Minnesota pulled away in the second half to win its third game in a row and 10th in its last 13 overall. Taking the season series 3-1 from division foe Oklahoma City capped a stretch in which the Timberwolves beat New Orleans by 18 points and Cleveland by 28. Minnesota led by at least 34 in each of those games. Wednesday proved to be a bit tougher against the physical Thunder, but the Wolves outscored Oklahoma City 29-19 in the third and led by as many as 16 in the fourth. ""Guess we're, I don't know, growing a little bit,"" Butler said. ""For us to go out there and guard the way we did, do what we talked about in shootaround and the day before in practice, it's huge for us. We're growing as a unit."" Russell Westbrook had 38 points and 10 rebounds, but the rest of the Thunder had a tough time shooting. Westbrook was 15 of 23 from the field, while his teammates were 17 of 56 (30.3 percent).

""We've got to lock in and get a win,"" Westbrook said. ""That's all I can say."" George scored just two points in the first half. ""We were getting good looks,"" George said. ""I thought we got shots that we'd been shooting all season. A lot of catch-and-shoot opportunities. It's like that. I think personally, I should've tried to play around the basket a little more, just to get something early, see the ball go down and work my way up."" The Thunder shot 28.6 percent in the third quarter (6 of 21). Meanwhile, the Wolves hit 62.5 percent (10 of 16) to take control. NOT CLOSE THIS TIME The first three games between the teams were decided by a combined nine-point margin. Minnesota won the first two games by a total of five points. Oklahoma City came back with a four-point win at home on Dec. 1 as George scored 36 points. ""I think both teams are probably a lot different today than when we faced all the way back in the beginning of December,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I think maybe early in the year, they were maybe not as great defensively and now they're getting better. I thought tonight they played well."" TIP-INS Thunder: G Andre Roberson missed his sixth straight game with left patellar tendinitis and coach Billy Donovan said he would also miss Saturday's game. ... Oklahoma City tied a season high with 20 turnovers. ... In the first three meetings, Thunder C Steven Adams was 27 of 33 from the field for a combined 64 points.

"DENVER --  The Atlanta Hawks were savoring a rare win during a tough season. The Denver Nuggets were lamenting a missed opportunity to improve their postseason hopes. Dennis Schroder had 19 points and 10 assists, Taurean Prince scored 16 and the Hawks beat Denver 110-97 on Wednesday night, ending a 10-game road losing streak. Atlanta wrapped up a five-game trip with its first road win since Dec. 2 at Brooklyn. ""It feels good to win a game -- period,"" guard Malcolm Delaney said. ""We've been battling. It's been tough for us, losing a lot of close games. Just to pull one out and finish how we did feels pretty good."" Kent Bazemore scored 14 points and Ersan Ilyasova had 10 points and nine rebounds for the Hawks, who never trailed after the first quarter. Atlanta (11-30) has the worst record in the NBA and entered the night tied for the fewest road wins. The Hawks posted their fourth road victory this season. Denver had won 11 of 13 home games since early November and now has its first three-game losing streak of the season. ""I'm not going to use the word embarrassing because that would be disrespectful to Atlanta. You've got to give them credit,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""They came in here and beat us. But for us to come out with the lack of energy, lack of a sense of urgency, was really disappointing. At the end of the day I put this loss on me."" The Hawks had twice lost by one point during their Western Conference swing. They closed out this win by outscoring Denver 28-19 in the fourth quarter, forcing five turnovers in the period. Gary Harris had 25 points but was the only Denver player to shoot well from the field. Nikola Jokic had nine points, 12 rebounds and seven assists but was 4-of-21 shooting and missed all eight of his 3-pointers. ""It was probably just a little bit of one of those nights for him,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""He's normally going to make a few more of those shots, so he had a little bit of an off night."" Denver trailed by 10 in the third and got within two late in the period but missed its first six shots of the fourth. The Hawks extended the lead to 93-81 on a layup and jumper by Delaney. He also assisted on Ilyasova's 3-ponter that sparked an 11-3 run to start the fourth. The Nuggets made a small run to get within eight but Atlanta responded with a 9-2 surge to lead 102-87 with 3:29 left. Denver never got closer than nine the rest of the way. The loss dropped the Nuggets to 21-20. ""It's not about them, it's about us,"" Harris said. ""We know what we've got to do. If we come out there and play hard, that doesn't happen."" Denver shot just 6 of 24 on 3-pointers in the first half and 37.3 percent from the field overall. Atlanta took advantage and led by as many as 10 and 54-46 at halftime.

"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Lou Williams sent the same roaring, adoring crowd that cheered Kevin Durant's milestone to the exits several minutes before the final buzzer. Durant was brilliant, and Williams even better. Williams scored 27 of his career-high 50 points in the third quarter and the undermanned Los Angeles Clippers beat the Golden State Warriors for the first time in more than three years with a 125-106 win Wednesday that spoiled a milestone night for Durant. Williams shot 16 for 27 with a career-best eight 3-pointers and made all 10 of his free throws. ""He ordered 50-piece nuggets on us tonight,"" Durant quipped. ""Lou got it going."" Durant became the 44th player in NBA history to score 20,000 career points, finishing with 40 as the Warriors had their five-game winning streak snapped along with a 12-game unbeaten stretch in the Clippers rivalry. Durant reached the milestone on a pull-up jumper from the left wing at the 1:41 mark of the second quarter. The Warriors announced his accomplishment on the main scoreboard and Durant received a standing ovation, shaking his head in acknowledgment while still very much in game mode. By late in the fourth quarter, that crowd was making its way for the exits with the game out of reach. The NBA Finals MVP returned from a three-game absence due to a strained right calf and scored 25 points in the first half against the Clippers -- KD's biggest half of the season and the exact number he needed for 20,000. Durant, who had a four-point play during the second quarter on the way to 14 points in the period, is at 29 the second-youngest player behind LeBron James and first to reach the 20,000 mark as a member of the Warriors. He shot 14 for 18, including 6 of 7 from deep, and Zaza Pachulia added 12 points on a night when the Warriors were without their starting backcourt. Stephen Curry re-sprained his right ankle during the morning shootaround, and Klay Thompson also was out for rest that had been previously scheduled. ""Our spirit wasn't right, our energy wasn't right. We weren't connected and they were,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. ""The Clippers came in here probably insulted we were resting Klay, and obviously Steph goes down and so the game changes."" Williams also dished out seven assists and rookie Tyrone Wallace added a season-best 22 points off the bench for the Clippers while returning to the Bay Area, where he starred in college at California. ""Obviously 50 is a huge number. It's a great accomplishment,"" Williams said. ""For me, it was more important to get a win, try to close that gap to get back to .500, especially with the injuries, with guys in and out of the lineup, for us to still have that opportunity, to be in the playoff fold. So, I've been playing with confidence for the past month or so now."" Nick Young started in place of Thompson and had seven points but shot 3 for 11 and missed six of his seven 3-point tries. It was Young's first start with the Warriors. Shaun Livingston played in place of Curry and contributed eight points and four assists. Draymond Green missed his first five shots before connecting late in the third. ""We still have two All-Stars. It's an embarrassment of riches,"" Kerr said of Durant and Green. ""I'm not going to shy away from that."" There were 13 lead changes in the first quarter alone. Golden State went on a 10-0 run midway through the second during which Durant scored eight points. CURRY'S ANKLE Curry has the same injury that recently sidelined him for 11 games, though Kerr said: ""I don't think it's serious. ... He tweaked it."" No MRI or X-rays were scheduled for now, though Curry was sore and the Warriors won't take any chances. ""I didn't see anything,"" Kerr said before the game. ""We just had a normal shootaround and he was in his usual game-day routine with Q (Bruce Fraser) and he just rolled his ankle somehow. Just kind of a fluke thing, kind of caught us off guard, but obviously he won't play. ... It's unfortunate. Hopefully it'll clear up in the next couple days."" The Warriors are 10-2 without Curry. TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles hadn't beaten the Warriors since Christmas Day 2014. The Clippers also had lost 11 straight on Golden State's home floor since a 105-86 win on Dec. 25, 2011. Warriors: Durant had his seventh 30-point game this season. ... Thompson had played in all 41 games this season. ... C JaVale McGee played for only the second time in five games as Kerr struggles to use all his players in a deep, talented rotation. ... Young earned his 194th career start as Golden State used a 14th different starting lineup this season -- matching the team's total from last season.","400975359"
"LONDON --  Ten seasons ago, the Boston Celtics came to London and won. They went on to win the NBA title. As they repeated the first half of that feat with a comeback victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night, the Eastern Conference-leading Celtics provided more evidence that they can emulate that 2007-08 squad. Kyrie Irving had 20 points, seven assists and six rebounds and Boston overcame a 22-point deficit to beat the 76ers 114-103 in the eighth regular season NBA game played in England. ""It's always great to believe in fate,"" Irving said. ""But for us we have to be dogged in every moment we're afforded. It's great for that to happen for that past team but it's the past. We have to be very present. Winning an NBA championship is one of the hardest things you can do in life."" Jaylen Brown added 21 points, and Marcus Morris had 19 points and eight rebounds to help the Celtics extend their winning streak to seven games. JJ Redick had 22 points and hit five 3-pointers for Philadelphia, but the 76ers were unable to take advantage of their fast start as the Celtics' NBA-best defense tightened at O2 Arena. Joel Embiid had 16 points, and fellow All-Star hopeful Ben Simmons added 15 for the 76ers. ""This team that we just played today is the best defensive team in the NBA and we felt all of that,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""When you look at their individual defensive players to a man, they're as strong positionally as any team in the NBA."" Irving and Embiid struggled early, going a combined 1 for 10 from the field in the first quarter. Despite ending the quarter pointless, Embiid was able to make an impact on defense, notably swatting away Irving's attempted layup. Embiid and Simmons helped out Redick at the start of the second and the 76ers made their first nine shots of the quarter to open the 22-point lead with 6:56 remaining in the quarter. However, Irving finally made a 3, sparking a strong Celtics finish to the half as they closed to 57-48. Having been outshone by fellow Rookie Of The Year contender Simmons in the first half, Jayson Tatum began the second half hot, making his first five shots to bring the Celtics within a point. The Celtics took their first lead midway through the third quarter, and soon took control as Morris and fellow reserve Marcus Smart stretched the lead. Irving returned early in the fourth and was fouled making a trademark driving layup and made the free throw to give the Celtics a 105-88 advantage midway through the quarter, all but ending the contest. PLAYOFF PREVIEW? With the Celtics top of the Eastern Conference with a 34-10 record and the 76ers (19-20) ninth and fighting to make the post-season a first round playoff meeting between the two is a possibility. Despite having lost all three games to the Celtics this season, Embiid is confident the 76ers could compete in a seven-game series. ""If we end up meeting in the playoffs, I feel like we got a pretty good chance,"" Embiid said. ""We just need to correct whatever has been careless the whole season and that's turnovers and fouling a lot."" TIP-INS Celtics: The Celtics held Philadelphia without a field goal for the final 4:37 of the second quarter to trim the halftime deficit to nine points 76ers: Embiid was the only player on either team to finish with a double-double, adding 10 rebounds to his 15 points.","400975360"
"TORONTO --  LeBron James isn't enjoying the view lately, watching the end of blowout losses from the Cleveland Cavaliers' bench. James and his struggling Cavaliers absorbed their most-lopsided rout of the season, overwhelmed by the Toronto Raptors 133-99 on Thursday night. The Cavaliers have dropped six of eight dating to a Christmas Day defeat at defending champion Golden State. James scored 26 points in this loss while Isaiah Thomas missed his first 11 shots. ""I don't know where it kind of went wrong or what happened,"" James said. ""We've got to try to pick it back up and find it."" After losing to Minnesota 127-99 on Monday, the Cavaliers fell by an even bigger margin. Toronto's 133 points were the most by any Cavaliers opponent this season, and marked the third straight game that Cleveland has allowed at least 127. So, what has been James' biggest beef with Cleveland's last two losses? ""That I haven't played in the fourth quarter,"" he said, adding his team is getting ""tore up."" Kevin Love, who scored 10 points, said he's confident the Cavs can turn it around in time to reach the finals for a fourth straight season. ""We have enough talent here to get over that hump and make a lot of good things happen,"" Love said. ""Right now it's just tough to see the light at the end of the tunnel but it is there. We will get out of it and we will get better."" Fred VanVleet scored a career-high 22 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 15 points and a season-high 18 rebounds and the Raptors overcame the absences of two starters. C.J.Miles scored 16 points, Pascal Siakam and Norm Powell each had 14 and DeMar DeRozan 13 for the Raptors, who were without point guard Kyle Lowry (bruised tailbone) and forward Serge Ibaka (suspension). Jakob Poeltl had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the Raptors. VanVleet made six of eight 3-point attempts as the Raptors connected on a season-high 18 shots from beyond the arc. ""I was really proud of the way he came to play,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. Toronto's 12-game home winning streak was snapped in Tuesday's loss to Miami, but the Raptors bounced back in their first meeting with Cleveland since the Cavaliers swept the Raptors out of the second round of the playoffs last May. Thomas connecting on a short jumper at 7:22 of the third quarter for his first basket. He finished 2 for 15 and went 0 for 6 from 3-point range. Playing for the fourth time this season as he returns from a right hip injury, Thomas scored four points in 24 minutes. ""He'll be fine,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. ""He's going to have to work out some kinks, but he'll be fine."" Lowry missed his second straight game after he was injured in a heavy fall in overtime of Monday's win at Brooklyn. Lowry participated in shootaround Thursday morning but is still too sore to play. Ibaka served a one-game suspension for throwing a punch at Miami's James Johnson in Tuesday's home loss to the Heat. Leading 30-24 after one quarter, the Raptors extended their lead in the second thanks to their bench. Siakam scored 10 points and VanVleet had eight as Toronto led 65-40 at halftime.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Blake Griffin says he's fully recovered from the concussion he suffered last weekend and marveled at how his Los Angeles Clippers have maneuvered their way around a series of injuries to key players this season. Griffin is just as impressed with how much the club has gotten from unheralded teammates like Tyrone Wallace, who spent most of the season in the G League before joining the Clippers for his NBA debut this month. Wallace intercepted a pass at midcourt and drove in for a dunk with 10.9 seconds left, moments after what appeared to be a costly turnover by Lou Williams, and the Clippers held off the Sacramento Kings 121-115 on Thursday night after blowing a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter. ""Guys made big plays when we needed them,"" Griffin said. ""Guys that weren't even on an NBA roster at the beginning of the season are coming up and making big plays like they've been in the league for years. That's awesome to see."" The Clippers, who lost DeAndre Jordan to a sprained left ankle in the second quarter, won their third straight over the Kings this season and their 11th in a row at Sacramento. ""It's tough. You just keep dropping guys every game,"" Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. ""Every game someone is stepping in for us, too, and that's the blessing."" Williams finished with 30 points and six assists, one night after scoring a career-high 50 against defending champion Golden State. Griffin had 18 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in his return to the lineup, and Montrezl Harrell scored a season-best 25 -- including 16 in the second quarter when Los Angeles put up 43 points. The Clippers led 106-92 early in the fourth before the Kings rallied to go ahead 113-112 on Bogdan Bogdanovich's layup with 2:10 remaining. Griffin followed with a 3-pointer and Williams later scored on a short jumper, but the Kings pulled to 117-115 on George Hill's free throw with 24.9 seconds left. Williams then committed a turnover at midcourt when he threw a pass to Sacramento's Kosta Koufos, but Wallace saved his teammate when he stole the ball back and drove in for a dunk. Wesley Johnson added two free throws to seal the win. ""Normally bigs don't want to push the ball up so I kind of just sat there and waited a little behind the guard,"" Wallace said. ""I figured (Koufos) was going to look to pass it. He just turned and threw the ball without looking, so I knew I had an opportunity to get the steal. I had the whole court in front of me."" Bogdanovich scored 22 points, and Koufos had 14 points and 14 rebounds. Hill added 21 points but missed two free throws in the final 70 seconds. ""We've got to start games and play with a lot more effort, a lot more aggressiveness, a lot more motor,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Williams had 21 points in the first half, including nine in the final 1:33 of the second quarter after the Kings had trimmed a 14-point deficit to 60-58. The Clippers also got a lift from Harrell, who made all seven of his shots in the period. That was important after Jordan limped off the court with an ankle injury after scoring on a dunk with 5:15 left in the first half. ""That's par for the course for our team this year,"" Griffin said. ""One guy comes back, one guy has to go out."" GRIFFIN'S HEALTH Griffin shot 5 of 14 and was 2 for 7 from beyond the arc in his return from a concussion he suffered last Saturday. ""Fine head-wise and all that,"" he said. ""I just felt like I was a little off rhythm-wise.""

"LOS ANGELES --  Halfway through another mostly miserable season, the young Los Angeles Lakers have put together their longest winning streak of the year. Coach Luke Walton is eager to see whether they can maintain the momentum that's making their future look slightly less bleak. Brandon Ingram scored 26 points, Lonzo Ball added 18 and the Lakers held off the short-handed San Antonio Spurs 93-81 on Thursday night for their third straight victory. Larry Nance Jr. had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Lakers (14-27), who blew an early 19-point lead before running away in the fourth quarter with a poise they've shown only fleetingly this season. Los Angeles had lost nine straight before its current surge. ""We responded like a team that's failed a lot, and kind of got sick of it,"" Walton said. ""We're seen that point many times this year where we're playing well, we have a lead, the other team goes on a run and then we stall out in the second half. I thought our players did a great job of coming together."" Ingram had an aggressive offensive game, and Ball contributed 10 rebounds, six assists and four 3-pointers as Los Angeles also snapped a seven-game losing streak to the Spurs at Staples Center since April 2013. The Lakers (14-27) appear to be midway through their fifth consecutive non-playoff season, but their entertaining style occasionally produces great moments, such as the dunk thrown down by Nance on a less-than-ideal pass from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. ""We're focused on defense, effort and energy, really,"" Nance said of the winning streak. ""I don't know what it was, but it was about time we got out of that rut."" LaMarcus Aldridge scored 15 of his 20 points in the first half for the Spurs, who committed 21 turnovers while playing without injured starters Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker and Danny Green. Bryn Forbes scored 18 points and Dejounte Murray added 14 points and 11 rebounds. ""That was a pathetic performance by our team, and a lot of the reason for it was the way the Lakers played,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""They were very physical, much more physical than we were. Their desire was at a totally different level than ours was. ... Just effort and will. I thought in that sense, we were pathetic."" TIP-INS Spurs: Pau Gasol had nine points and 12 rebounds in the 37-year-old Spaniard's latest return to the city where he won two championships alongside Kobe Bryant, whose two retired jersey numbers now hang in the Staples Center rafters. Lakers: They made an early 25-3 run on the way to a 37-18 lead. Ball hit three 3-pointers and didn't miss a shot in the first half. ... Kentavious Caldwell-Pope played a solid defensive game and contributed down the stretch with 10 points and four rebounds. AILING SPURS Leonard missed his third straight game with a left shoulder strain, and Parker sat after spraining his right ankle in Sacramento on Monday. Green missed his fifth consecutive game with a groin strain. Veteran Rudy Gay also sat out his seventh straight game with right heel bursitis, leaving the Spurs short-handed in the last stop on a three-game trip down the West Coast. PEANUT GALLERY Before the game, Popovich didn't mince words when asked about the recent criticism of Walton from Lithuanian basketball power broker LaVar Ball: ""I think the first thing to look at is the substance and gravitas of the source that speaks, and just stopping at that point would tell you that you don't need to listen or go any further. It's just another fan in the peanut gallery with an opinion, which is meaningless."" TRADE ME NOT Popovich also revealed that Aldridge requested a trade last summer after a rough season. The coach talked the star big man out of his feelings after a few dinners and meetings. ""I was very candid with him,"" Popovich said. ""I told him, `I'd be happy to trade you. You get me a talent like Kevin Durant, and I'll drive you to the airport. I'll pack your bags. And I will drive you there, get you on the plane and get you seated.' He laughed, (and) I said, `But short of that, I'm your best buddy, because you're here for another year, and you ain't going nowhere.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  With Dwight Howard struggling with his shot and a tough back-to-back looming, the Charlotte Hornets needed a bit of variety on offense against the Utah Jazz. Kemba Walker scored 22 points and Frank Kaminsky added 16 to lead the Hornets to their fourth victory in six games, 99-88 on Friday night. Six players scored in double figures. ""We had a post-up game, we had a pick-and-roll game, we had a catch-and-shoot game,"" said Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas. ""Nic (Batum) got going early, and we've been talking a lot."" Marvin Williams scored 15 and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist 12 for Charlotte, which won despite an off night for Howard, who scored just two first-half points. Howard finished with eight points on 2-of-9 shooting. He also went 4 for 10 from the foul line and led the team with 13 rebounds. Charlotte will go for a season sweep of the Thunder at home on Saturday. The Hornets won at Oklahoma City 116-103 on Dec. 11. Jeremy Lamb's basket with 5:20 left gave Charlotte an 87-85 lead, part of a 14-3 run to end the game. ""I think our defense was really good in the fourth quarter,"" said Howard, who last was held in single digits Dec. 31 (four points at Los Angeles Clippers). ""Marvin hit some big 3s, got a big cut to the basket and we got a good win. We needed it, especially after last game."" Batum and Jeremy Lamb added 11 points apiece for Charlotte, which lost to Dallas 115-111 on Wednesday to start a three-game homestand. Donovan Mitchell scored 35 points for Utah, which has lost 14 of 19. Rodney Hood added 15 and fellow reserve Royce O'Neale 11 for the Jazz, who had been 10-3 when holding opponents to 100 points or fewer. Mitchell, a rookie who scored a career-best 41 in a win last Friday against New Orleans, had 22 points at halftime on 7-of-12 shooting. Charlotte limited him to 3-of-8 shooting the rest of the way. ""We've tried to not put a ceiling on him one way or the other,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said of Mitchell. ""Just focus on day-to-day what he's doing. From that standpoint, he continues to get better. He struggled late in a playmaking position, so he's figuring things out."" TIP-INS Jazz: Forward Thabo Sefolosha left the game with a knee injury in the second period. ... Rudy Gobert missed his 13th consecutive game (knee). . Utah had won seven of the past 10 matchups with Charlotte. Hornets: Charlotte has had five different leading scorers in its past 11 games. ... Walker opened 4 for 4 on 3-pointers before missing his last two. CLIFFORD RETURNS Hornets coach Steve Clifford will rejoin the team for practice on Tuesday. Clifford, who left the team Dec. 6 because of health reasons, will coach the Hornets Wednesday against Washington. He spoke with his team on Friday. ""It's great news,"" Batum said. ""I called him right away and talked to him. It's good to know he's coming back, and it's good to know he's getting better. He's been out a few weeks, and it could be scary (to be sick), but the most important thing right now is his health."" ROAD WOES CONTINUE Utah finished an Eastern road swing 1-4, and the loss to Charlotte Friday was the only one by double digits. ""That's always there,"" Snyder said of his team's energy level late. ""You have to figure it out. I thought we fought through it. Defensively we didn't have a ton of life, but I thought our bench gave us a big lift when (Hood and O'Neale) came in.""","400975364"
"INDIANAPOLIS -- When Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan went small Friday night, Lance Stephenson came up big. He baited LeBron James into a late technical foul. He made play after play down the stretch, and when the game was over, the Pacers' showman was celebrating. Stephenson had 16 points and 11 rebounds to help Indiana erase a 22-point, first-half deficit and beat Cleveland 97-95. It's the Pacers' third win this season over the three-time defending Eastern Conference champs. ""It feels good, but it's a long season,"" a more subdued Stephenson said in the locker room. ""They're a tough team, but we came out and played smart defense and made the right plays."" It was a stunning twist, coming almost exactly nine months after the Cavs rallied from a 26-point deficit on the same court to beat Indiana in the playoffs. This time, the Pacers handed Cleveland a third straight confounding loss. The first two came by a combined 62 points, and on Friday, the Cavs were outscored 84-61 over the final three quarters on the second night of back-to-back road games. Stephenson had plenty of help. Darren Collison scored 22 points and Victor Oladipo had 19. But the guy with a knack for getting inside opponents' heads with unthinkable stunts, like blowing in James' ear or giving him a thumb in the side -- as television replays showed during the game -- played the instigator perfectly. James had 27 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds and was called for a technical foul after reacting to Stephenson's jab by shoving him in the chest. Oladipo made the free throw to give Indiana an 84-82 lead with 7:53 to go, a costly point. The four-time MVP wasn't amused. ""Lance is just a little dirty, that's all. He's a little dirty,"" James said. ""I should have known. I've known since school, it's not the guy who tells the joke that gets caught, it's the guy who laughs. They caught me on the retaliation. He played well, though."" Stephenson entered the game with 5:52 left in the third quarter when 6-foot-11 center Domantas Sabonis picked up his fourth foul. McMillan let him play the rest of the way. The result: Indiana, which trailed 26-6 about eight minutes into the game and still trailed 72-60 with 5:23 left in the third, rallied. Indiana shut out the Cavs over the final 3:57 and twice stopped James when he could have given the Cavs the lead. Oladipo's 3 with 2:10 left gave Indiana the lead for good. James then had two chances to give Cleveland the lead in the final two seconds. First, a switch by Collison forced James out of bounds on a baseline drive 1.7 seconds to go. Then, James' desperation 3 bounced high off the rim. ""It's hard to get into his head, but tonight was [different],"" Stephenson said. ""Just playing against the best player in the league, trying to win against them. There are a lot of fans coming out to support him, so I just try to get his fans mad, too."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: Kevin Love had 21 points and 10 assists and Jeff Green added 13 points, all in the first half. ... The Cavs were 7-of-34 from 3-point range and wound up shooting 43 percent overall after shooting 59.1 percent in the first quarter. ... Love went over the 7,000-rebound mark during the game and now has 7,007. ... It's the first time in 10 Central Division games Cleveland failed to score at least 100. The Cavs are 0-3 against Indiana and 6-1 against everyone else in the division. ... Cleveland had a 39-18 scoring advantage on fast-break points. Pacers: Sabonis had 12 points and 15 rebounds. ... Indiana has won three of its last four and has beaten Cleveland three times in one season for the first time since 2013-14. ... The Pacers were 10-of-21 on 3s just two days after going a season-worst 1-of-18 from beyond the arc. ... Indiana is 17-5 when making 10 or more 3s in a game. SHORT BENCHES The Cavs played without four guards: Isaiah Thomas, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose and Iman Shumpert. While Rose and Shumpert continue recovering from injuries, Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue decided to give Thomas and Wade extra rest because of the back-to-backs. Indiana played without starting center Myles Turner for the second straight game. Turner has been out with an injured right elbow. THEY SAID IT Cavaliers: ""We come out with low energy in the fourth quarter,"" James said. ""We had a lot of energy in the first half. In the third quarter, we didn't exert as much as we did in the first half, and we let them get back into the game."" Pacers: ""You can't play regular defense on him,"" Stephenson said, referring to James. ""You've got to get on him and try to get into him.""","400975365"
"WASHINGTON --  Just as the Washington Wizards fixed some recent scoring issues, their defense faltered. At least they avoided losing to another sub-.500 team thanks to their All-Star caliber backcourt. Bradley Beal and John Wall each scored 30 points and the Wizards snapped a two-game losing streak with a 125-119 victory over the Orlando Magic on Friday night. Ian Mahinmi finished with a season-high 17 points in the defense-optional game. Washington shot 56.8 percent from the field and scored a season-high 74 points in the paint. Tied at 98 after three quarters with Orlando hitting better than 60 percent of its field goal attempts entering the final period, Washington finished off the Magic with solid work on both ends of the court. ""I looked at the score. I said we really have (98) each after the third quarter,"" Beal said. ""I said whoever plays defense first is going to win. That was a no-brainer."" The Wizards struggled offensively in recent fourth quarters but made 11-of-20 attempts against Orlando. Wall hit three jump shots during an 11-2 run that gave Washington a 121-113 lead with 3:15 remaining. The Magic shot 6 for 22 in the fourth quarter, finishing at 51 percent from the floor overall. Orlando has lost seven in a row, 16 of 17 and 27 of its last 31. That stretch included a 130-103 rout by Washington on Dec. 23. ""I think our guys competed, very much so on the defensive end, and the results just weren't there,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""Credit to them, they've got two All-Star guards, their bigs are good finishers. They've got a lot of firepower."" Elfrid Payton scored 27 points and Jonathon Simmons had 23 as all five Orlando starters reached double figures. Bismack Biyombo finished 8 of 9 from the field for a career-high 21 points. Including Wednesday's 107-104 loss to the undermanned Utah Jazz on Wednesday, Washington entered Friday with an underwhelming 11-10 record against teams with losing records. TIP-INS Magic: Aaron Gordon had 14 points and Evan Fournier scored 10. ... Orlando shot 70.6 percent from the field in the first quarter. ... With Orlando in the nation's capital ahead of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Vogel took the team to the slain civil rights leader's memorial. ""It's good for our guys to keep a big picture and continue to be enlightened about the world. Obviously, sadly there is far too much racial injustice in our country."" Wizards: Wall became the youngest player (27 years, 128 days) in franchise to reach 10,000 points for his career. . Beal made nine of his first 10 shot attempts and finished the first half 10 of 13 for 23 points as the Wizards entered halftime leading 65-63. . C Marcin Gortat had 12 points and 11 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season. KEEP ROLLING Wall rolled his ankle on the final play of the first half after landing on Gortat's foot while attempting to rebound. He left the court with a slight limp, but opened the second half and scored 10 points in the third quarter, including an emphatic driving dunk. ""That guy just tapes it up, goes out there and competes,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""It's what makes him a special player. . He's a competitor, and we needed every bit of his effort and energy, defensive toughness and offense and shot-making ability tonight."" BASEMENT ADJACENT With the Atlanta Hawks losing at Brooklyn on Friday, Orlando avoided owning the NBA's worst record. ""We're 29th in the league,"" Simmons said. ""That's where we are. We need to do better.""","400975366"
"ATLANTA --  Spencer Dinwiddie did everything he could to keep the Brooklyn Nets composed in the closing seconds. ""We've had a little bit of a losing streak and we had some heartbreaking losses followed up obviously by the very poor showing against Detroit,"" he said. ""To come out here and take Atlanta's best shot and still come away with the victory is big-time."" Dinwiddie had 20 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds, Jahlil Okafor added 17 points in a reserve role and the Nets beat the Hawks 110-105 on Friday night. Dinwiddie made the go-ahead basket with 11 seconds left as the Nets snapped a three-game losing streak to move past an embarrassing 34-point home loss to Detroit two nights earlier. Atlanta guard Dennis Schroder finished with a career-high 34 points, but after causing matchup problems all night with his ball-handling, he missed his last two layup attempts and committed a game-ending turnover with 5 seconds remaining. Dinwiddie, who had just two points against the Pistons, was Brooklyn's spark, recovering from a rough stretch late in the fourth when he let Schroder glide past him for an acrobatic layup and then lost the ball out of bounds on the ensuing possession. After Dewayne Dedmon's 3-pointer gave the Hawks their biggest lead at five, Dinwiddie immediately answered with a 3 with 2:20 left and then took charge at the end. He grabbed a defensive rebound and drew a foul on a fast-break layup with 11 seconds remaining. Dinwiddie missed the free throw but battled for the rebound and got fouled again. This time he hit both free throws to make it 108-105. ""Like I said, if I don't turn it over as much and miss free throws and the easy end of layups, we ain't even in that position,"" Dinwiddie said. ""So it's really a credit to the team for picking me up."" Schroder missed a layup and then was called for traveling on the same possession with 5.1 seconds remaining. Okafor, in his fifth straight game and sixth overall for Brooklyn, went 6 for 8 from the field in 12 minutes. The Nets acquired Okafor, the No. 3 overall draft pick for Philadelphia in 2015, in a trade early last month. ""I had a lot of easy buckets because of my teammates just dropping the ball off to me and I was wide open,"" Okafor said. The Hawks trailed by nine in the first and the second, but forced a tie both times. Brooklyn took its first double-digit lead in the third on Tyler Zeller's layup, but Atlanta went on an 11-0 run to take its first lead of the game, 67-66 on Tyler Dorsey's 3. Brooklyn's DeMarre Carroll started and played 28 minutes after missing the last two games with a right knee sprain. He finished with 13 points. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 14 points and has scored in double figures in 12 of his last 13 games. Kent Bazemore had 16 points for the NBA-worst Hawks, who have lost five of six. ""As a competitor, you go out there and give it your all for 48 minutes and come up short,"" Bazemore said. ""This is reminiscent of the Clippers game (Sunday)."" There were eight lead changes and six ties in the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Nets: Tied a season high with 29 assists. Caris LeVert had seven. Carroll and Hollis-Jefferson each had three. Hawks: F Marco Belinelli, the team's fourth-leading scorer, has a sprained left ankle and missed his first game. CLOSE TO KIN Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, who spent four seasons on Atlanta's bench before getting hired in April 2016, knows everything about Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer's San Antonio system and vice versa. ""We're doing more Hawks stuff than the Hawks,"" Atkinson deadpanned before the game","400975367"
"Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokoumpo both said they were more focused on the game than playing against each other. (0:49) MILWAUKEE --  The Golden State Warriors turned up the heat late on the Milwaukee Bucks before finishing them off from the perimeter. Even the absence of sharpshooting star Stephen Curry and a low-key night for fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson couldn't slow down the best team in the West at the end. Kevin Durant scored 26 points, Draymond Green added 21 and Golden State used a 13-4 run in the fourth quarter to pull away for a 108-94 win Friday night. With Curry still sidelined by a right ankle injury, the Warriors clamped down on defense and did most of their damage on the other end in the lane. Durant's mid-range jumper gave Golden State a 96-90 lead before the All-Star forward hit an open 3 with 2:15 left to cap the run with a three-possession lead. The Warriors were just 3 of 13 from 3-point range until Durant and Green hit back-to-back 3s in the final 3 minutes to seal their 11th straight road win. ""We were just getting lazy,"" coach Steve Kerr about his team's defense in the third quarter. ""It caught us off-guard a little bit but we were able to get back to our defensive mentality of being the aggressor in the fourth quarter."" Giannis Antetokounmpo had 23 points, while Eric Bledsoe added 21 to lead the Bucks. They were outscored 28-12 in the fourth after hitting just 5 of 20 from the field. ""We've got to keep moving the ball, we've got to stay consistent moving the ball well and get defensive stops,"" said guard Tony Snell (11 points). Milwaukee played some of its best ball with Antetokounmpo off the court. He didn't play the final 4:41 of the third quarter after picking up his fourth foul. Trailing by 14 at halftime, the Bucks turned to the Golden State way to get back in the game -- hitting clutch shots from 3-point range . Malcolm Brogdon (17 points) and Snell hit two 3s apiece in the 15-7 run with Antetokounmpo on the bench to give Milwaukee an 82-80 lead after three quarters. The defending NBA champions asserted dominance over the aspiring contender in the East in the fourth. Durant had 17 first-half points to help Golden State build its 63-49 halftime lead. With Curry out, the Warriors instead focused on driving to the hoop and gave the Bucks fits at time with cutters. Durant might be one of the few scorers in the league who can still teach Antetokounmpo a few moves, like the fake Durant used to blow past the Bucks' star for an easy dunk. ""Having a player like that who elevates your level of play definitely makes you better as a basketball player so I appreciate times like this,"" Durant said. TIP-INS: Warriors: Curry re-sprained the troublesome ankle before the loss Wednesday night to the Los Angeles Clippers. Kerr said Curry lobbied to return Friday and felt good at shootaround, but that the ankle still wasn't well enough for him to play. Kerr said Curry will also be listed as questionable for the game Saturday night in Toronto. Bucks: Three-point shooting defense has improved of late after holding four of the previous five opponents to 31 percent or less from beyond the arc. They're allowing foes to shoot 38 percent from 3-point range on the year. ""We are making a conscious effort. We are trying to get better at guarding the 3,"" coach Jason Kidd said. The Warriors finished 5 of 15 (33 percent) from 3-point territory. ... F Khris Middleton was just 2 of 12 from the field for eight points. KLAY'S DAY Thompson had a relatively quiet day with just 12 points in 35 minutes, shooting 4 of 11 overall and missing both of his 3-point attempts. He returned from a one-game break for rest. Brogdon drew the assignment of guarding Thompson for much of the evening. ""I thought Malcolm was great, being able to guard Thompson and also being able to run the offense and take advantage of the ball movement,"" Kidd said. COMING HOME Warriors F Kevon Looney had nine points and eight rebounds in 23 minutes playing in his hometown. He grew up about 10 minutes from the Bradley Center. ""I dreamed about this as a kid so it was pretty sweet,"" he said.","400975368"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Karl-Anthony Towns found teammate Nemanja Bjelica cutting for a layup on one trip down the floor in the fourth quarter, and later hit an open Bjelica for a 3-pointer and a double-digit lead. Towns on the floor with four reserves to start the fourth was the right mix against the New York Knicks on Friday night, and Minnesota continued its impressive homestand. Towns fell one assist shy of his second career triple-double, scoring 23 points and grabbing 15 rebounds in the Timberwolves' 118-108 victory. ""I think we just have a good chemistry right now,"" Towns said. ""We know where people are going to be. We're doing a great job of putting ourselves in spots that we know the person dribbling or facilitating the ball is comfortable getting into them."" Taj Gibson added 17 points and Andrew Wiggins had 16 for Minnesota. The Timberwolves shot 56.7 percent (38 of 67) over the final three quarters to come from behind and win their fourth game in a row and 11th of 14 overall. Minnesota had eight players score in double figures to win its fourth straight game by at least 10 points, the second-longest streak in team history behind a six-game stretch in 2001. ""I thought the bench at the end of the third, start of the fourth gave us a big lift,"" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We started the game with not much energy, but we found a way to win in the end. I like this offensively a lot. I thought we made a lot of good plays, unselfish plays. But defensively, we didn't get going until the fourth quarter."" Kristaps Porzingis scored 17 points for New York. Porzingis was 3 of 5 from 3-point territory but 3 of 14 from inside the arc. Enes Kanter had his 18th double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds, but the Knicks lost for the ninth time in 11 games. ""We got to be better in these bad moments like we had in today's game,"" Porzingis said. ""We got to fix those. ... We're not too far off. We're in a bad moment right now, but we're going to get ourselves out of it."" TIP-INS Knicks: New York is 4-15 on the road this season. ... Former Wolves forward Michael Beasley scored 13 points in 16 minutes off the bench. Beasley had 10 points on 5-of-10 shooting in just six minutes in the second quarter. ... The Knicks entered the night with the league's fewest 3-point attempts, but went 12 of 24. Timberwolves: Minnesota had its sixth straight sellout, the longest streak for the franchise since it sold out 48 straight games from 1990-92. The Timberwolves sold out every game of the 1990-91 season and had seven in a row to start the 1991-92 season. Minnesota has nine sellouts this season. ... Towns' nine assists were a season high. ... Minnesota allowed more than 100 points for the first time in eight games. HARDAWAY RETURNS Tim Hardaway Jr. returned for the Knicks after missing 20 games with a stress injury in his lower left leg. He scored 16 points in 25 minutes off the bench. Coach Jeff Hornacek said Hardaway would play limited minutes in a reserve role as he tries to build up stamina. ""He looked out of sync,"" Hornacek said. ""You could tell he doesn't have the speed that he had earlier on. That's going to take a little while. ... His speed will pick up."" In his first year back with the Knicks after a signing a four-year, $71 million contract in the offseason, Hardaway entered the night averaging 17.8 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists in 21 games. BUOYED BY THE BENCH The Wolves have been led by the starting five all season, but the bench provided a big spark on Friday. Jamal Crawford hit three of his first five shots to spark the offense in the first half. New York had control much of the game before Minnesota's run with the reserves complementing Towns. Bjelica scored eight points during a 17-3 run over the end of the third and start of the fourth quarters, capped by Bjelica's 3. Gorgui Dieng added six points during the stretch and the bench finished with 37 points. ""You can tell that the urgency to win in this locker room is real important,"" Gibson said. ""From pretty much in the early months, it's a different attitude. Guys understanding that we really have a chance to do something special. So, guys just want to win. Whoever's out there, we're going to do it.""","400975369"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Anthony Davis crossed up his defender with a behind-the-back dribble, exploded toward the hoop and scored despite being fouled. Clearly, Davis' recently sprained right ankle was holding up well. Davis scored 36 points, grabbed five of his nine rebounds on the offensive end and blocked two shots, and the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Portland Trail Blazers 119-113 on Friday night. ""His presence tonight, it was felt tonight throughout the entire game,"" said Pelicans center DeMarcus Cousins, whose 24-point, 19-rebound performance also included an alley-oop lob to Davis for a two-handed jam. ""Throw him the ball and get out the way. That's our finisher. That's our scorer, so it kind of takes a load off of everybody on the floor. Easy target."" Jrue Holiday scored 25 points for New Orleans, which hit the halfway point of the regular season one game above .500 and in the Western Conference playoff picture. ""This was one we needed to have,"" said Davis, who sat out a narrow loss in Memphis on Wednesday night. Still, the Pelicans have yet to prove they can become more consistent and less sloppy. While the Pelicans shot 54.9 percent (45 of 82), they nearly threw the game away with 18 turnovers, which Portland converted into 28 points. ""We made a lot of mistakes,"" said Cousins, who had five turnovers. ""We managed a win and it's tough to win in this league. But with that being said, I think there's still a lot of things we've got to improve on."" Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum each scored 23 points for Portland. Al-Farouq Aminu had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Jusuf Nurkic added 19 points. Portland attempted 42 3-pointers and missed 30, but coach Terry Stotts wasn't complaining about shot selection. ""Most of them were decent looks,"" Stotts said. ""When you score 113 points, you can't really look at the offense. But it was an offensive game, and we came up a little short."" Holiday, however, said New Orleans' defensive approach affected Portland's perimeter shooting. ""That was part of the game plan to not let them have 3s,"" Holiday said. ""We think their offense is based around a lot of 3-point shots."" Shabazz Napier scored 17 points in his seventh start of the season. His 3-pointer gave the Blazers their biggest lead at 75-67 in the third quarter. Soon after, however, Rajon Rondo's 3 ignited an 11-2 New Orleans run that also included Cousins' cutting dunk as he was fouled. The Pelicans preserved a single-digit lead the rest of the way. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Wing player Evan Turner was scratched because of an illness. Napier started in his spot. .... Portland has scored 110 or more in each of its last seven games. ... Lillard moved into seventh in franchise history in scoring with 9,753 points since entering the NBA in 2012. He passed Geoff Petrie, who scored 9,732 from 1970-76. ... McCollum has scored at least 20 in five straight and 26 times this season. ... Portland's reserves combined for only 12 points. Pelicans: Darius Miller scored 16 in a reserve role. ... The Pelicans improved to 2-1 against the Trail Blazers this season, winning the first meeting in New Orleans. The teams will meet once more this season. TESTINESS Cousins and Nurkic barked at one another periodically. Cousins ""never started an All-Star Game or playoff game and (is) talking trash for no reason,"" Nurkic said. Cousins played coy when asked if his aggressiveness against Portland was personal. ""Why would anything be personal?"" Cousins said. When asked specifically about what Nurkic said on the court, Cousins responded, ""I don't hear anything he's saying."" TRADING RUNS New Orleans led by 16 points in the second quarter when Cousins' 3 capped a 16-4 run. But Lillard, who had just four points midway through the second quarter, added nine quick points during a 13-4 run, hitting two 3s and a driving layup as he was fouled. McCollum and Aminu added 3s, and Lillard's steal of Holiday's pass for a breakaway dunk tied it at 61 heading into halftime.","400975370"
"DENVER --  Missing their top scorer, the Denver Nuggets leaned on their defense to end a three-game losing streak. Will Barton scored 17 points, Trey Lyles had 16 and the Nuggets overcame a slow start to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 87-78 on Friday night. Denver took control of the game by holding Memphis to 13 points in the third quarter, and the Grizzlies finished with a season low in scoring by a Nuggets opponent. ""Our defense stayed the course,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Tonight, a lot of guys struggled to make shots but they never deterred from the defensive end of the floor. This was a game we had to have and I am proud of our guys for going out there and getting the job done."" Nikola Jokic added 14 points and nine rebounds for Denver, which played without star guard Gary Harris, who was excused for personal reasons. It was the first game that Harris, who averages 16.9 points, has missed this season. Barton started in his place. ""It's always tough, not having Gary Harris, who does everything,"" Barton said. ""He's one of our top defenders, one of our top scorers. But our mentality is always next man up and everyone stepped up and played well and we got the win."" Barton said the Nuggets' defense was a constant. ""We were making those guys work and getting after them and trying to make them uncomfortable,"" he said. Marc Gasol had 22 points and 11 rebounds for Memphis, his 18th double-double this season. Tyreke Evans and James Ennis III added 12 points each. ""Defensively, they were able to run a lot more and they got to the free throw line more often,"" Gasol said. ""And they controlled the pace in the second half."" Trailing 54-50 midway through the third quarter, the Nuggets went on an 8-0 run, taking their first lead since the game's opening minutes on a driving layup by Jokic. Denver had a 67-60 advantage -- its biggest lead to that point -- heading into the fourth quarter. Memphis pulled within three, but the Nuggets scored 10 of the next 12 points, taking a 77-66 lead on Mason Plumlee's dunk off Malik Beasley's alley-oop pass with 6:15 remaining. Memphis could not make significant inroads on Denver's lead the rest of the way. Denver pulled within 47-43 at halftime after a lackluster first quarter in which Memphis went on a 15-0 run for a 23-8 lead before settling for a 10-point advantage at the close of the period. TIP-INS Grizzlies: G Mike Conley (left heel) and F Chandler Parsons (sore right knee) were not with the team but continue to make progress in their rehabilitation. Conley has been playing some 3-on-3 games and Parsons has participated in shooting drills. ""We will be cautious with those guys because they are important to us,"" Grizzlies interim coach J.B.

Retired Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning watched the game from a courtside seat. PERIMETER DEFENSE The Grizzlies were held to 39 percent shooting (30 for 77). The Nuggets have won 18 of their last 19 when holding the opposition at or below 39 percent from the field. The only loss in that span was to Memphis two years ago.","400975371"
"Ryan Anderson drives to the basket and finishes with a uncontested one-handed flush. (0:19) PHOENIX --  Houston didn't need James Harden to roll past the Phoenix Suns. There were plenty of contributions from just about everyone else to make it a 112-95 Rocket romp on Friday night. Chris Paul scored 25 points to lead six Houston players in double figures and the Rockets improved to 4-2 since losing Harden with a hamstring injury. ""We are just holding it down, holding it down until we get the whole crew back,"" Paul said. ""Ain't nobody going to feel sorry for ourselves and we ain't going to feel sorry for ourselves. We are just going to go out there and keep competing."" Houston led by 18 in the second quarter, 22 at the end of the third and 27 in the fourth in its sixth consecutive victory over Phoenix. Clint Capela scored 17 points and grabbed 16 rebounds for the Rockets, who dominated the boards 53-38. Ryan Anderson and Trevor Ariza added 18 points apiece and Eric Gordon 14. Devin Booker scored 27 and T.J. Warren 21 for the Suns, who were coming off a home win over Oklahoma City four days earlier. Booker, playing more these days at point guard, had nine assists but nine of his team's 19 turnovers. Houston had a 14-4 advantage on the offensive boards. ""I think we're number one in the league in getting an offensive rebound and kicking it out for a 3, so that's great,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""And obviously Chris had some mismatches and he started doing some short 15-foot game. He's awesome. Everybody contributed here and there."" Phoenix got off to a fast start, scoring 10 straight points, capped by Dragan Bender's 3-pointer, to lead 21-10. Then things turned sour for the home team. The Rockets outscored the Suns 37-8 over the final 5:05 of the first quarter and first 6:47 of the second, when Anderson's two free throws put Houston on top 47-29 with 5:13 left in the first half. The Rockets led 57-44 at the break, despite Booker's 18 points. Houston scored the first four points of the second half and Phoenix never got closer than 15 after that. The Rockets went with a small lineup and spaced the floor, leading to open shots. ""Well, they space everybody out,"" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. ""They're going to shoot a lot and that makes it tough when you're out there on the 3-point line and you try to challenge shots and turning around to go chase rebounds. That can be difficult. I thought they were probably a little quicker to the ball."" TIP-INS Rockets: At 30-11, the Rockets have their fourth-best record at a season's midpoint in franchise history. ... The Rockets have won in Phoenix nine straight times and have beaten the Suns 13 of last 15 overall. ... Capela's career high in rebounds is 20. ... Houston won its 15th road game, third-most in NBA behind Boston (16) and Golden State (18). Suns: Forwards Marquese Chriss and Josh Jackson missed the game, both with hip injuries. Isaiah Canaan was out with a left abductor strain. ... Chriss ended a streak of 124 consecutive games to begin his career. It was longest streak by a Sun since Kyle Macy played in the first 329 games of his pro career from 1980-84. ... Tyson Chandler grabbed 11 rebounds and needs 11 more to be the 40th player in NBA history with 10,000. MEMORIES The Suns, who haven't made the playoffs in six seasons, commemorated the 25th anniversary of their 1992-93 Western Conference champion team at halftime. Charles Barkley, Tom Chambers, Dan Majerle, Kevin Johnson, coach Paul Westphal, and then-CEO and general manager Jerry Colangelo were among the participants. That team lost to the Bulls and Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals. Barkley, of course, got the biggest cheers.","400975372"
"DALLAS --  With a matinee game in the middle of a road trip, Dallas native Julius Randle had a rare opportunity to enjoy a night off in his hometown. He already had a good afternoon. Randle had 23 points and 15 rebounds, including a follow shot late in overtime that helped the Los Angeles Lakers seal a 107-101 victory over the Mavericks on Saturday. ""Yeah, I'm going to enjoy it for sure,"" Randle said. ""I've got my little man here, got my wife here, my family. I'm going to enjoy this night."" With his team leading 104-101, Randle grabbed a rebound on Lonzo Ball's missed jump shot and scored on the rebound with 18 seconds remaining, giving the Lakers a five-point lead they preserved to extend their winning streak to a season-best four games. ""That's a tough place to win, so it's a good job getting this win on the road,"" Randle said. The Lakers (15-27) trailed by double digits in the fourth quarter, but battled back for their first win against the Mavericks in 15 tries and their first victory in Dallas since Feb. 24, 2013. ""We just didn't want to lose,"" guard Jordan Clarkson said. Clarkson added 19 points, Kyle Kuzma had 18, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 17. Rookie Dennis Smith Jr. had 23 points, 17 in the first half, as the Mavericks (15-29) had a two-game win streak snapped. Harrison Barnes and Wesley Matthews each had 17 points for Dallas. Randle scored six points in overtime, including a fadeaway shot with 2:35 remaining that gave the Lakers a 102-99 lead. ""He was just being a beast tonight,"" Smith said. ""Using his power all game, he was relentless. So it worked out pretty well for them."" Each team had a chance to win the game in final seconds of regulation. Barnes made a pull-up jumper in the paint to tie the game at 95 with 5.9 seconds remaining. The Lakers called a timeout but couldn't get off a clean shot before the buzzer. ""I told them going into overtime, `All right, it's time to regroup now,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""They made some tough shots (at the end of regulation), and now it's time to refocus. We've been in overtime games before, and let's take it possession by possession."" There were six ties and 12 lead changes in the game, and the Lakers turned it into a close game when they orchestrated a 15-3 run in the fourth quarter, erasing the 80-70 lead that Dallas had taken early in the fourth quarter on a 3-pointer by Dirk Nowitzki. ""We gave up the 10-point lead in the fourth, we obviously lost some defensive edge there,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We just weren't able to stop them. That was really it."" Los Angeles played most of the game without Brandon Ingram, who had four points in the first half before a sprained left ankle pulled him from the game. ""It's a mild ankle sprain, day-to-day. I think they took him back to get some X-rays. I don't know that part of it, but he's day-to-day right now,"" Walton said. ""We're obviously hopeful that he'll be able to get back with us because we need what he does out there on the court."" TIP-INS Lakers: The Lakers' four-game win streak comes after a season-worst, nine-game skid. Mavericks: G Kyle Collingsworth was signed to a 10-day contract on Saturday. Collingsworth was originally signed to a two-way contract by Dallas on Dec. 19 but had been waived on Jan. 10 after playing in four games. DOUBLE-DOUBLE Kuzma had his 10th double-double of the season with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Kuzma also had three assists and a steal in 36 minutes off the bench. MOVING UP Nowitzki passed former Laker Jerry West with his 7,161st career free throw made in the second quarter, taking sole possession of sixth in NBA history. Nowitzki finished 3 for 4 from the line and now has 7,163 makes in his career. Michael Jordan ranks fifth all-time with 7,327 made free throws.","400975373"
"LOS ANGELES --  Being .500 is hardly a team's goal, although with the kind of injury-wracked season the Clippers are having, it's somewhat of an accomplishment. Lou Williams scored 26 points in the Clippers' 126-105 win over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday, giving Los Angeles a 21-21 mark at the season's midpoint. ""With all the guys that are out, we're just trying to hold the fort,"" coach Doc Rivers said. Willie Reed added 14 points and 13 rebounds making his first start of the season in place of DeAndre Jordan, who has a sprained left ankle. Blake Griffin had 11 points and nine assists as one of eight Clippers in double figures. ""Everyone can step up, it doesn't matter who it is,"" Reed said. ""I just try to be ready when the opportunity presents itself."" Their second game in three days against the last-place Kings was just what the doctor ordered for the Clippers. Besides Jordan, they were without Austin Rivers and Danilo Gallinari. Patrick Beverley had season-ending knee surgery while C.J. Wilson is out indefinitely. After the Kings scored the game's first four points, it was all Clippers. They shot 55 percent in building a 21-point lead in the first half, and were up 64-45 at the break. Willie Cauley-Stein had 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Kings in their fourth straight loss. De'Aaron Fox added 17 points and 10 assists. ""Sometimes when a team comes out and shoots the ball like the way they were doing, it's kind of difficult to bring that energy,"" Fox said, ""especially when we think we're playing good defense and then Lou hits the off-balance shot, but that's what he does."" The Kings picked up their scoring in the third, losing the quarter 28-23, but they still trailed 91-68 going into the fourth. Reed and Griffin rested in the fourth, when the Clippers were outscored 37-35. Los Angeles shot 56 percent from the floor for the game and outscored the Kings 60-50 in the paint. TIP-INS Kings: They've lost five in a row to the Clippers and eight of the last nine. ... The Kings lost 121-115 when the teams played Thursday. Clippers: Doc Rivers said he didn't think Jordan will be out long, but added, ""I can't guarantee it."" ... Williams has scored 20 or more points off the bench in nine straight games, moving ahead of New Orleans' Jrue Holiday for the longest such streak among active players. ... Jordan's next game will tie him with Randy Smith for most played in franchise history at 715. ... Jordan is already the first player in franchise history to be with the team for 10 seasons. SCUFFLING KINGS The Kings fell to 13-29 and 6-16 on the road, and lost all four of their games against the Clippers this season. ""Like, enough is enough,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""Coach (Dave Joerger) is at that point where he's not going to play you if you're not doing the right thing, and that's how it should be. Kind of like a college team. If you're not doing the job right, next man up and you'll get your turn when it comes back around."" RARE MISS Jordan sat out because of injury for the first time in his 10-year career. It was his first missed game of the season and just his second over the last two years.","400975374"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Russell Westbrook didn't think the Oklahoma City Thunder were aggressive enough in the last meeting with the Charlotte Hornets. The NBA's reigning MVP made sure that didn't happen again Saturday. ""We hit first,"" Westbrook said. Westbrook had 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, and the Thunder beat the Hornets 101-91 to snap a three-game losing streak. Paul George added 17 points, Steven Adams had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and the Thunder avenged a 116-103 loss to the Hornets earlier this season in Oklahoma City. The Thunder trailed by three entering the fourth quarter, but their bench helped open a double-digit lead as Charlotte shot 5 of 21 from the field over the final 12 minutes. The Thunder attempted 97 shots as they dominated the offensive glass with 20 second-chance points. Oklahoma City's length on defense bothered the Hornets all night, particularly late in the game. Charlotte scored just 32 points in the second half. ""We used our size and athleticism, to put pressure on them,"" Westbrook said. Hornets All-Star point guard Kemba Walker had several shots blocked on drives to the basket and finished 5 of 17 from the field. He still led the Hornets with 19 points, while Dwight Howard added 11 points and 17 rebounds. Charlotte hoped to gain some momentum and get back in the fight in the Eastern Conference after having won three of its previous four games, but couldn't overcome its poor fourth quarter. The Hornets were outscored 28-15. It was a needed win for the Thunder in their fifth game on the road in the last six. Oklahoma City will play four of its next five at home. Westbrook finished just 10 of 27 from the field but controlled the tempo of the game late and didn't allow the Hornets to get back into it once they fell behind by double digits. Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas said he felt that his team ran out of gas in the fourth quarter after playing a late game Friday night and then two hours earlier than normal on Saturday. ""We started the quarter pretty good but after the second group went in they seemed tired,"" Silas said. ""Our first group seemed tired, too. A back-to-back with a quick turnaround was a tough one."" TIP-INS Thunder: Jerami Grant finished with nine points on 3-of-3 shooting from the field. ... Carmelo Anthony struggled from the field, shooting 3 of 14 and finishing with seven points and 10 rebounds. ... Bench outscored Charlotte 35-27.

Were outscored 44-34 in the paint. FELTON'S CONTRIBUTION The Thunder got a big lift from backup point guard Raymond Felton in the fourth quarter. He used the pick-and-roll effectively to get to the basket and create shots for others. ""He knows how to play pick-and-rolls, so he was able to go deep into the paint,"" said Hornets forward Marvin Williams. ""He was able to kick it out and make big shots for them. It took us a little while to kind of figure out what to do with him and once we did they kind of went away from it."" Felton, who played at North Carolina, was thrilled to get a win. ""We were tired of dropping these L's and wanted to get a win tonight,"" Felton said. ""I especially wanted to get one here, back home. It was one of those things where we were just being aggressive, playing together. We got aggressive on defense, so it worked out for us."" PLAYING BETTER Despite the loss, Hornets guard Nic Batum feels the team is starting to play better, particularly on defense. ""If we stick together as a team, like I have been preaching the last couple of weeks, we can be a good team,"" Batum said. But the Hornets are 16-25 and might be starting to run out of time to make a playoff run.","400975375"
"WASHINGTON --  After leading the Washington Wizards to their first overtime win of the season, John Wall remained frustrated that the late drama had been self-imposed. Wall scored 17 of his 23 points in the second half and overtime, and tied a season high with 16 assists in the Wizards' 119-113 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night. Yet the perennial All-Star couldn't shake thoughts of his own performance, which also included eight turnovers, or that of a team that gave back a 23-point lead. ""The whole second half was just nasty for us, period,"" Wall said. ""We have to do better. We have to do a lot better."" Washington has repeatedly struggled to close games at home this season. On Nov. 1, the Wizards lost 112-116 to Phoenix after holding a 22-point lead in the first half. On Nov. 25, they led by 17 in the fourth quarter before losing 108-105 to Portland. They pulled this one out in overtime, when Wall hit two jumpers and contributed three assists while the Nets shot 1 for 8 from the floor. ""We've got an All-Star point guard. That helps, right?"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""He made big plays, big shots down the stretch."" Bradley Beal scored 24 points and Kelly Oubre added 17 off the bench on 5-of-6 shooting. Marcin Gortat had 16 points and 13 rebounds as the Wizards pulled to 2-2 on their five-game homestand and avoided being swept by the Nets in the season series. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 22 points for Brooklyn, which never led. Jarrett Allen added 16 points and DeMarre Carroll had 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, who are winless in three overtime games ""You know, it's tough, all the close games,"" Allen said. ""But I feel like every one of them has been a learning experience. There's little things we pick up from games that we've lost like this, and we just try to improve on them."" Beal gave Washington the lead for good on a jumper and followed with a 3-pointer, both off feeds by Wall, to make it 114-109. Then Wall hit a pair of contested jumpers to keep Washington's lead at five, the latter making it 118-113 with 17 seconds left in the extra period. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn fell to 2-7 in the second game of back-to-back sets. ... Brooklyn's starting five scored only 19 first-half points ... C Tyler Zeller (left hip) sat out for the first time since Nov. 14. Wizards: Washington swept both ends of a back-to-back set for the first time this season. ... Wall received his fourth technical foul of the season during the third quarter. ... G Jodie Meeks returned to action after he was left out of Washington's rotation for the first time this season on Friday night. THE BEAL DEAL Beal has now scored 20 or more points in 10 consecutive games, his longest such stretch this season. ""Without my teammates, I wouldn't be able to have this streak,"" Beal said. ""But I do take pride in being aggressive and being a scorer, and doing the best that I can."" ALMOST AMAZING Brooklyn trailed 59-39 at halftime before closing within three in the third and tying it on a 16-5 run to end the fourth. During that last stretch, Allen Crabbe hit two 3-pointers and fed Caris LeVert for a dunk that closed it to 105-104 with 1:45 remaining. The Nets missed their next three shots and turned it over twice, yet still tied it at 107-all on Quincy Acy's 3-pointer from the top of the arc with 9.1 seconds left.","400975376"
"TORONTO --  After a huge first half, Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors had to hold on late to wrap up their eighth straight win over Toronto. Curry returned from a two-game absence to score 24 points, Klay Thompson had 26 and the Warriors blew nearly all of a 27-point lead before beating the Raptors 127-125 on Saturday night. DeMar DeRozan scored 42 points for the Raptors, who made it a tight game after the Warriors rang up 81 points on 71.1 percent shooting in the first half. ""We expected that and we took that punch,"" Kevin Durant said of Toronto's comeback. ""I'm glad we got the `W,' especially on the second night of a back-to-back."" The Warriors won at Milwaukee on Friday. Durant scored 25 points and Draymond Green had 14 for the Warriors, who have won 12 straight on the road. Golden State's 19 road wins are the most in the NBA. OG Anunoby had 17 points and Serge Ibaka 14 for the Raptors, who rallied from a 19-point deficit through three quarters to make it a one-point game in the fourth. Fred VanVleet scored 13 points and Jonas Valanciunas had 12 as Toronto lost for the third time in 18 home games. ""We're not really into moral victories around here so you've got to look and see what you could have done better,"" VanVleet said. Curry sat out Wednesday's home loss to the Clippers and Friday's win at Milwaukee because of a sore right ankle, the same injury that kept him out of 11 games in December. ""It's sore but it felt good enough to play,"" Curry said. ""It's probably exactly where I was the last time I came back. I don't feel limited out there but you just feel it."" Curry finished with a team-high nine assists. His six rebounds tied Durant for the team lead. Raptors guard Kyle Lowry missed his third straight game because of a bruised tailbone. VanVleet's 3-pointer with 3:52 left cut it to 116-115, but Curry answered with a 3 for the Warriors. DeRozan's basket with just over a minute to go made it a one-point game again, and Curry missed a pair of free throws with 45 seconds remaining. ""It happens to everybody,"" coach Steve Kerr said of the rare misses. ""It's his first game back."" After a missed shot by DeRozan, Durant's jumper with 21 seconds left gave Golden State a 125-122 lead. A missed 3 by CJ Miles led to a jump ball, then a scramble for a loose ball that went out of bounds next to the Warriors bench. After a video review, Golden State was awarded possession with three seconds left. Curry was fouled and sealed it with a pair of free throws before VanVleet hit a buzzer-beating 3. The out of bounds call was one of several decisions that had DeRozan fuming about the officiating. ""It's frustrating being out there feeling like you're playing 5-on-8,"" DeRozan said. ""Some of those calls were terrible, period."" Green and Thompson each scored 10 points in the first and Golden State led 43-35 after one, its highest-scoring opening quarter of the season. Golden State seized control with a 16-2 run to begin the second quarter and led 81-54 at halftime. It was the Warriors' biggest half of the season and their first 80-point half away from home since Nov. 2, 1990, at Denver (87 points). ""You knew we weren't going to do that the whole game,"" Kerr said. TIP-INS Warriors: Golden State made eight of its first nine shots. ... The Warriors had one turnover in the first half. They finished with a season-low seven. ... F Andre Igoudala played eight minutes in the first half but did not return in the second after a recurrence of the hip injury he suffered in Friday's win at Milwaukee. ...

"CHICAGO --  The Chicago Bulls got their first taste of life with Zach LaVine and liked what they saw. LaVine scored 14 points in his first game in 11 months, rookie Lauri Marrkanen added 19 points and the Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 107-105 on Saturday night. Chicago made 17 3-pointers and held off several late charges by the Pistons to win for the 13th time in its last 20 games. LaVine was making his Bulls debut after being acquired from Minnesota in the Jimmy Butler trade. LaVine, who last season averaged 18.9 points in 47 contests, hadn't played since he suffered a torn ACL against Detroit on Feb. 3. ""It actually felt really good,"" LaVine said. ""It wasn't that fast paced. I was tired, but it wasn't that fast. I was relaxed."" Avery Bradley scored 26 points and Andre Drummond had 21 and 15 rebounds for Detroit, which lost its sixth road game in seven tries. Coming off a career-high, 33-point effort on Wednesday, Markkanen hit a 17-foot shot with 1:08 to go to give the Bulls a 106-105 lead. The game featured 23 lead changes and seven ties. Chicago then survived four late shot attempts by Detroit, including a missed layup by Drummond with 38 seconds left. ""We just didn't close,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""In the first half, we just didn't close. Our guys are not closing out. Period."" It was the second straight close victory for the Bulls after an overtime win at New York on Wednesday. ""It means a lot and it's especially nice to have Zach back,"" Markkanen said. ""Just to see how he moves and how quick he is, how well he can shoot the ball. All around he's a great player and he's going to bring a lot to the team."" With LaVine on the court, the Bulls reached 100 points for the 17th time in 20 games after reaching the mark only eight times in their first 23 contests. LaVine made his first shot, a 27-footer from the right of the key, before he assisted Robin Lopez's basket inside. The fourth-year guard followed with an easy 15-footer at the 8:12 mark in the first quarter to give Chicago an early 12-11 lead. LaVine made 5 of 9 shots and finished with two assists. ""(LaVine is) a very smooth player and has a lot of confidence to rise up on his first shot and knock down a 3,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""(That) shows you that he's just been itching for this moment to get out there and back on the floor with his teammates."" Kris Dunn had 18 points, eight assists and eight rebounds for Chicago. Dunn also was credited with a blocked shot on Reggie Bullock's attempted layup at the buzzer. Nikola Mirotic had 16 points and six rebounds off the bench and Bobby Portis scored 15 in the win. Eight of Drummond's 15 rebounds were on the offensive end, which helped Detroit to a 30-6 advantage in second-chance points. TIP-INS Pistons: Forward Stanley Johnson sat out with a sore right hip flexor after missing practice on Friday. ""They're not really seeing any structural things, he's just really tight,"" Van Gundy said. ""Problem's moving in one direction. I don't know if it's necessarily a pain thing. It's his ability, in his mind, at least, to move."" Bulls: Connected on 17 3-point tries to match the franchise record with a seventh consecutive game with at least 10 3-pointers made. Chicago made its first six tries from beyond the arc, including all three by Markkanen, to equal the previous stretch from March 21-April 2, 2017. BIG SHOT Upset he missed a wide-open, 3-pointer to give the Bulls the lead, Hoiberg said Markkanen apologized to his teammates in the huddle. Hoiberg drew up the next play for Markkanen, who hit the go-ahead shot. ""Robin (Lopez) set a great screen to get him open,"" Hoiberg said. ""(Markkanen) had no hesitation, he rose up and knocked it down. To be that calm as a 20-year-old rookie is a great sign for him."" QUOTABLE LaVine on his return: ""Not really butterflies, just anxious. It's just what I love to do. It's one of the best feelings to go out there, play in front of 20,000-plus people, your teammates supporting you, coaches that support you, medical staff, your family, a lot of people having your back.""","400975378"
"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs have not had many opportunities to play with a full and healthy roster this season, so they took advantage of the luxury Saturday night. Kawhi Leonard scored 19 points in his return from a three-game absence, Davis Bertans had 18 and San Antonio never trailed in a 112-80 victory over the Denver Nuggets. San Antonio won its 14th straight at the AT&amp;T Center, improving the league's best home record to 19-2. ""We haven't had many games with everyone healthy,"" said forward LaMarcus Aldridge, who added 15 points. ""So, it definitely felt good tonight."" The Spurs' projected starting lineup of Leonard, Aldridge, Pau Gasol, Tony Parker and Danny Green played together for only the sixth game this season and just the second time at home. Reserve Rudy Gay missed his eighth straight game with bursitis in his right heel, but the Spurs were just happy to have more players on the bench than in the locker room. ""It was good to have everybody,"" Green said. ""I think the win helped guys' confidence, getting some open looks."" Green had 11 points in his return from a 10-game absence due to tightness in his left groin. Leonard played 28 minutes in his return, shooting 5 for 8 from the field while collecting eight rebounds, four assists and four steals. After missing the season's first 27 games with right quadriceps tendinopathy, Leonard strained his left shoulder against Phoenix on Jan. 5. ""He looks confident,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He looks confident in his body and he wasn't really winded tonight either, which surprised me. He's coming along well."" The Spurs raced to a 23-12 lead in the first quarter despite getting just one point from Leonard. San Antonio opened the game by shooting 6 for 7 on 3-pointers, including three consecutive 3s by Bertans to close that opening run. ""He's a rhythm shooter and he was feeling it,"" Spurs guard Manu Ginobili said. ""When you see that he gets in that type of rhythm, I think it's a good idea to just look for him."" Bertans, a second-year player included by Indiana in a trade that brought Leonard to San Antonio for George Hill, had a career-high six 3-pointers. He finished 6 for 7 on 3s. San Antonio shot 14 for 27 on 3-pointers and 53 percent overall while running Denver's defense ragged. ""They're not stopping, they're just moving and moving,"" Nuggets center Nikola Jokic said. ""Every cut is a live cut, every pass is a live pass, every shot .. They're doing the small things so good that you believe they are really going to do it."" Jokic had 23 points and nine rebounds for Denver, which has lost 10 straight in San Antonio. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver was held to 11 points in the fourth quarter, a season low in the final period for a San Antonio opponent. .

""It makes you wonder what he would say if he was here,"" Popovich said. ""I think if he was here, he'd have probably figured out a way to gather some people together and make a stand, so it didn't keep happening. But at this point, it's all about leadership and trying to bring people together and we just don't have a lot of that right now. Nobody was better at that than he was. He knew how to protest peacefully, but he also knew how to bring people together and get things done. We don't seem to have that right now. So, we just got to keep dealing."" RETURN TO THE COURT Gary Harris, Denver's leading scorer, returned after missing the previous game due to what the team said were ""private family matters."" ""It's been a long day for me,"" said Harris, who flew to San Antonio on his own. Harris had 18 points in 30 minutes.","400975379"
"MIAMI --  Goran Dragic and Erik Spoelstra were asked separately Sunday what a seven-game winning streak means to them, and both immediately provided the same answer. ""Nothing,"" Dragic said. ""Nothing,"" Spoelstra said. Even in their best stretch of the season, the Miami Heat are still sounding far from content. Dragic scored 11 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, and the Heat held Milwaukee to its worst shooting game in nearly five years on the way to topping the Bucks 97-79. ""We've still got 40 games left. We cannot be satisfied with that,"" Dragic said. ""We still need to improve. If you start thinking like that, if you're satisfied with that, then it's not going to be pretty for us."" Josh Richardson scored 16 and Hassan Whiteside finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds for Miami. Milwaukee shot 32 percent, 6 percent worse than any game this season and the lowest percentage by a Bucks team in a regular-season game since March 22, 2013. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Malcolm Brogdon combined to shoot 13 for 24 for the Bucks. Their teammates shot a combined 12 for 55, including a 4-for-16 day from Eric Bledsoe and a 3-for-16 from Khris Middleton. ""We played bad basketball,"" Antetokounmpo said. The Heat trailed 43-41 at the half, then took control by outscoring the Bucks 41-21 in the first 16 minutes of the second half. ""Our guys really stepped it up,"" said Spoelstra, who now has 12 winning streaks of at least seven games in his tenure as Heat coach. Antetokounmpo scored 22 for Milwaukee, which started 1 for 14 from the floor in the second half. Middleton added 16, Brogdon had 15 and Bledsoe scored 10 for Milwaukee. ""We were playing from behind,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""We've got some guys who can't make shots right now. We've just got to keep grinding, keep getting those guys a look, and believe that they're going to make the next shot."" It was a rare easy win for Miami. The first six Heat wins in this streak were all by single digits. The Bucks were making a run in the fourth when Dragic took over. His 3-pointer with the shot clock expiring with 5:19 left put the Heat up by 14, part of a run in which he scored 11 consecutive Miami points. ""Dragon hit those 3s,"" said Bledsoe, Dragic's former teammate in Phoenix. ""Those are the shots we wanted him to take. Unfortunately, he made them."" TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee forced Miami into 15 turnovers, but converted them into only two points. ... The 1 p.m. start time won't be Milwaukee's earliest wake-up call of the season. The Bucks play in Brooklyn at noon on Feb. 4 -- Super Bowl Sunday. ... Olympic sprinting great Usain Bolt of Jamaica sat courtside, across from the Milwaukee bench. Heat: Miami plays nine of its next 11 games on the road. But after that stretch, 18 of the final 29 regular-season contests are at home with no remaining road trip longer than three games. ... The Heat have now had 300 consecutive home regular-season sellouts. SCHEDULE RARITY Sunday was the start of a rare back-to-back of day games for the Bucks, Heat and Knicks. All play Monday afternoon, part of the NBA's lineup on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Bucks and Knicks had similar schedules on this weekend last year, but the Heat haven't had early starts on consecutive days since March 2009. Milwaukee flies to Washington, Miami flies to Chicago and New York heads to Brooklyn. The Wizards, Bulls and Nets all had Sunday off. ROTHSTEIN HONORED Former Heat coach Ron Rothstein was honored at halftime for winning the Tex Winter Assistant Coach Lifetime Impact Award. Rothstein was joined by the entire current Heat coaching staff, along with former Heat assistant Tony Fiorentino -- now a team broadcaster -- and David Fizdale, the former Miami assistant who was coach in Memphis until being let go earlier this season. WINSLOW RETURNS Justise Winslow returned for Miami after missing 14 games with a knee strain, finishing with three points, four rebounds and four assists in 13 minutes. Sunday's appearance was his 37th in Miami's last 115 games.","400975380"
"NEW YORK --  Anthony Davis' fullcourt heave after the third quarter was too late to give him points, though it gave him that unstoppable feeling great players get. ""I kind of saw it, but I mean you never really make those,"" Davis said of the shot he launched from just inside the opposite baseline . ""So when it in I just kind of felt like tonight was definitely my night."" And thanks to his monster effort, it became the Pelicans', too. Davis scored a season-high 48 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, leading New Orleans back from 19 points down late in the third quarter to a 123-118 overtime victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday. Jrue Holiday added 31 points, and DeMarcus Cousins had 15 points, 16 rebounds, seven steals and five assists and for the Pelicans. They were down 16 after one, even further back late in the third and still down nine with 4 1/2 minutes left in regulation. But they kept coming and Holiday had three baskets and a couple free throws in OT to help them finish it off. ""I thought we did a great job in the overtime,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""AD was just huge for us, and when you get into those zones like that he's really good."" Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. each scored 25 points for the Knicks, who lost their third straight and 10th in their last 12 games. Jarrett Jack had a season-high 22 points, and Enes Kanter finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Five days after a double-overtime loss to Chicago in a game they led by 11, the Knicks coughed up another big lead in a miserable way to finish a rare January home game before they begin a seven-game, coast-to-coast trip Monday in Brooklyn that has them away for two weeks. ""I think we've just got to do a better job of when we're up 12, 15 points, we've got to take it to another level, another notch,"" Hardaway said. ""We haven't been doing that these last couple of games."" The Knicks seemed in control late in a high-scoring third quarter, when they outscored the Pelicans 39-34. Hardaway's jumper gave New York a 96-77 lead with 1:22 remaining in the period, but New Orleans then went on a 17-4 run to cut it 100-94 midway through the fourth. The Pelicans then finished regulation with a 13-4 charge, tying the game on Davis' basket with 3.5 seconds remaining. New Orleans then nearly won it, as E'Twaun Moore stole an inbounds pass and launched a 3-pointer that rimmed out at the buzzer. Holiday put New Orleans ahead for good with 1:52 to play in OT and Davis had the next basket, making it 120-117. The Knicks, playing the first of back-to-back afternoon starts, jumped to a 29-13 lead after one quarter. TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis has scored at least 35 points in each of his last three games at Madison Square Garden. ... PG Jameer Nelson missed the game for personal reasons. ... The Pelicans signed guard Mike James, who played for Phoenix earlier this season, to a two-way contract. He didn't play. Knicks: The Knicks signed former lottery pick Trey Burke, who had been playing for their G League affiliate and was second in the league with 26.6 points per game. The No. 9 selection in the 2013 draft has averaged 10.6 points and 3.6 assists in 267 career games with Utah and Washington. BURKE'S BACK Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said during the summer Burke told the Knicks he was interested in playing for their G League team and learning their system, rather than signing a deal with another NBA team. Hornacek speculated that may have been because the Knicks' point guard situation was unsettled at the time and maybe Burke saw an opportunity, but Burke explained otherwise. ""I think I wanted to just start from scratch, kind of recreate my brand, recreate and show what I can do on a night in and night out basis with consistent minutes,"" Burke said. ""I think going down there, a lot of people look at it as a knock, but for me, I went down there, it was more so like a growing period for me. I kind of wanted to start over."" BIG MEN ON CAMPUS The game featured three straight winners of the AP college basketball Player of the Year award. Davis won in 2012 for NCAA champion Kentucky, Burke won the next year when Michigan was the runner-up, and the Knicks' Doug McDermott won in 2014 at Creighton.","400975381"
"PHOENIX --  There are some NBA games that are over shortly after they began. The Indiana Pacers' 120-97 rout of the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night was one of them. Darren Collison had 19 points to lead seven players in double figures and the Pacers jumped on the Suns early and never let up. Victor Oladipo scored 13 of his 17 points in the first half for the Pacers, who were coming off a home victory over Cleveland and have won four of five after a five-game losing streak. Cory Joseph added 16 points, and Bojan Bogdanovic had 14 for Indiana. ""I thought it was really good. We wanted to start this road trip off right,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""I thought defensively we were focused, making them earn everything they got. Offensively, we had good ball movement. We were pretty consistent with that for 48 minutes."" Rookie Josh Jackson scored a career-best 21 points for Phoenix, which has lost four of five. Devin Booker added 15, but on 5-of-16 shooting, 1 of 6 from 3-point range. ""I thought we did a good job on some of their best players,"" Collison said. ""Booker is a talented player and we knew if he got it going we were in for a long night. I think we did a good job containing him the best that we can and we just played great team defense. When we play great team defense, we can do what we want at the offensive end."" In an otherwise bad night for Phoenix, 17-year NBA veteran Tyson Chandler grabbed 14 rebounds to become the 40th player in league history to top 10,000 for his career (10,003). ""It means a lot,"" he said, ""because when you come into this league as a young player you're just trying to survive. Now at the latter part of my career, to start to get some of these milestones, it just reminds you of all the hard work, the sacrifices, the journey you've got to make."" Interim coach Jay Triano called the Chandler milestone ""`unbelievable."" ""Anytime you do something that only 40 people have done in the history of the game,"" Triano said, ""I think that's an incredible honor."" The Suns, playing without second-leading scorer T.J. Warren, led only briefly early. Indiana went on a 15-4 run to go up 23-11 and led 30-16 after one quarter. Phoenix never got it to single digits again, trailing by as many as 25 in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the lead reached 92-59 (33 points) on T.J. Leaf's 3-pointer. Indiana opened the second half with a 16-8 run to lead 46-24 on Al Jefferson's layup with 7:09 left in the half.  Indiana led 64-44 at the break. ""I just thought tonight we lacked juice, I don't know why, at both ends,"" Triano said. ""Our cuts weren't' precise offensively and defensively we were a half-step behind them every time they made a move."" TIP INS Pacers: Indiana committed a season-low six turnovers. ... Opened a five-game trip through the West. ... Indiana shot 54.5 percent to the Suns' 41.2 percent. .... Indiana still is just 8-16 against Suns since 2005-06.

"Jamal Crawford feeds the ball to Jimmy Butler and he sinks the 3-point jumper to extend the Wolves' lead. (0:19) MINNEAPOLIS --  As Jamal Crawford talked about how the Minnesota Timberwolves must continue improving, next-locker neighbor Jimmy Butler couldn't help himself. ""Blah, blah, blah,"" Butler playfully jabbed while Crawford spoke with reporters after the Timberwolves' 120-103 victory over Portland on Sunday night. The Wolves know they need to keep their second 5-0 homestand in franchise history in perspective. Butler scored 24 points, Jeff Teague added 22 and Karl-Anthony Towns had 20 points and 11 rebounds for his NBA-leading 37th double-double of the season. The Wolves had their first 5-0 homestand since 2001, winning each game by double figures against the likes of New Orleans, Cleveland, Oklahoma City and New York. But coach Tom Thibodeau cautioned against reading too much into the wins, which haven't come easy or often in Minnesota for the last 14 seasons. ""It's important to win everywhere, and `are we building the right habits?"" Thibodeau said. ""You want to make sure that you're thinking about that improvement each and every day so that you can be playing your best at the end."" Crawford echoed those thoughts. ""We know we've come a long ways, but we have some more levels we can go to,"" he said. ""It's good to keep building good habits."" They led by as many as 26 against Portland to send the Trail Blazers to their third loss in a row. Damian Lillard scored 21 points, and C.J. McCollum and Pat Connaughton each had 18 for Portland. The Blazers had scored 110 points or more in seven straight game. That streak was in jeopardy early thanks to the Blazers' paltry 10-point second quarter and 18 total turnovers. ""Our offense really hit the skids,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""We didn't shoot it well, we didn't pass it well, we turned the ball over. Minnesota took advantage of it, so it was a big hole."" Portland led by five early and ended the first quarter up 33-31. But the Blazers went cold in the second, shooting only 2 for 15 and scoring more points off six free throws in the quarter. The Wolves, meanwhile, put together a 14-0 run and steadily pulled away. ""We've got to put our hats on defense,"" Crawford said. ""Offense will come and go, but defense is what can takes us there."" HOME COOKIN' Four of Minnesota's wins during the homestand came against teams currently in position to make the playoffs: New Orleans, Cleveland, Oklahoma City, and Portland. The win also extended the Wolves' home winning streak to eight games, which is the team's longest single-season home winning streak since winning 14 in a row from Dec. 16, 2003, to Feb. 6, 2004. LILLARD LOSES THE HANDLE Lillard may have led Portland's scoring, but he also had a team-high six turnovers. ""Against a team that good, you can't take away possessions from your team. You need every opportunity,"" he said. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Portland's 10 points in the second quarter wasn't the Blazers' lowest output of the season -- they scored only six against Toronto on Oct. 30. It was, however, the fewest points allows by Minnesota in any quarter at Target Center since Philadelphia scored nine in the second on Dec. 3, 2014. ... The Blazers reserves outscored Minnesota's 42-25. ... Lillard has his fourth 20-plus point performance of his last six. He also contributed eight assists and six rebounds. Timberwolves: It's the third time in franchise history the Wolves have won five games on a homestand. ... Crawford had 10 points off the bench. ... There were plenty of purple Vikings jerseys in the crowd, which broke out into its loudest cheers of the first half when the final score of Minnesota's last-second playoff victory was flashed on the scoreboard. The crowd also broke out into a few impromptu ""Skol!"" chants. QUOTE OF THE NIGHT ""Probably a late arriving crowd, but for a good reason,"" Thibodeau said with the laugh, referring to the Vikings fans who were still filing into Target Center as the game started.","400975383"
"DETROIT --  Stephen Silas wrapped up his stint as Charlotte's acting head coach with a win. Kemba Walker scored 17 of his 20 points in the second half, and the Hornets pulled away in the fourth quarter of a 118-107 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday. Silas, Charlotte's associate head coach, has been filling in for Steve Clifford, who has been out for more than a month for health reasons. Clifford will take over again Wednesday against Washington, and Silas was grateful to his players for their effort while he was in charge. ""I just told them how much I appreciated them and how they made it easy for me to coach them,"" Silas said. ""They had a decision to make. They could have either treated me as a substitute coach or treated me as someone who could really help them, and they did the latter."" Dwight Howard had 21 points and 17 rebounds for the Hornets, who trailed 56-50 at halftime before dominating the final two quarters. A 10-0 run in the fourth put Charlotte ahead 106-88, and although Detroit answered with nine quick points in 43 seconds, the Hornets were never in much danger of losing down the stretch. ""If we aren't going to guard, we aren't going to win,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""That's the whole story."" Andre Drummond of the Pistons had only three points and 10 rebounds, and his day was summed up late in the fourth when he went up for a powerful, one-handed dunk -- only to have Howard easily swat the ball away . ""It was huge matchup -- literally. Two of the biggest dudes in the league,"" Charlotte's Marvin Williams said. ""Drummond can be a load down there, but Dwight was definitely ready for the challenge."" Tobias Harris scored 20 points for Detroit despite foul trouble. The Pistons shot 15 of 29 from 3-point range. Williams had 21 points for Charlotte and shot 7 of 8 from the field. Detroit's Reggie Bullock had 20 points. MILESTONE Walker needed 14 points to reach 9,000 for his career. He easily surpassed that mark and also had nine assists with only one turnover. AT THE LINE The Hornets came in with a plus-324 margin in free-throw attempts on the season, the top mark in the NBA. They added to that Monday, going 22 of 33 while Detroit was only 8 of 11. POOR DEFENSE Charlotte scored only 32 points in the second half of a loss to Oklahoma City on Saturday. The Hornets had 68 in the last two quarters Monday. ""We got crushed in the paint and we got crushed on the boards,"" Van Gundy said. ""We were up six at the half, and I thought the first three defensive possessions of the second half said everything. We didn't defend, and they got rolling."" Detroit was outscored 60-44 in the paint, 40-16 in the second half. ""It's all about focus,"" Harris said. ""We have to work on stopping what other teams do well. For Charlotte, it is the pick and roll, and we let them do what they wanted all game."" TIP-INS Hornets: F/C Frank Kaminsky limped off in the fourth quarter after a collision with Harris when the Detroit player drove to the basket. Pistons: Detroit is still without starting PG Reggie Jackson, who is out with a right ankle sprain. F Stanley Johnson (strained right hip flexor) did not play either. ... The Pistons have signed G Kay Felder and G Reggie Hearn to two-way contracts and requested waivers on G Luis Montero. ... Harris played only 25:10.","400975384"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Just as the Philadelphia 76ers were letting yet another big lead slip away, a leak in their locker room sent water spilling into the hallway. Sixers employees stopped the stream before it reached the court, and the players prevented a fourth-quarter gusher from washing away another sure win. Joel Embiid had 34 points and 11 rebounds and Philadelphia held off the cold-shooting Toronto Raptors 117-111 on Monday. ""Look at some of the things we ended up doing at the end of the game. All we really had to do was dribble it out and instead we're playing volleyball,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said before lamenting his team's seven fourth-quarter turnovers. ""That's the stuff that keeps me up really, really late at night."" T.J. McConnell added a career-high 18 points and eight assists and JJ Redick scored 15 before leaving with a left leg injury for the Sixers, who never trailed and shook off Ben Simmons' foul trouble to win for the fifth time in six games. The Sixers blew a 22-point lead in a loss to Boston in London in their last game and coughed up a 22-point lead in a loss in Toronto's previous visit last month. ""We've been in this type of position a lot this year,"" Embiid said. Embiid and his teammates were forced to take a different tunnel to the dressing room after the game, and the room was off-limits to reporters. But the Sixers did just enough to make the players less grumpy about the hassle. They saw a 21-point lead cut to 102-101 on DeMar DeRozan's 3-pointer with 3:01 left. Simmons responded with a driving layup and Dario Saric hit a 3 on the next possession to get the lead back to six. Embiid hit four free throws in the final 25.3 seconds to put it away as he motioned for the crowd to get to its feet. ""The big fella was great,"" McConnell said. DeRozan scored 24 points and Kyle Lowry struggled in his return from a three-game absence because of a bruised tailbone. The Raptors lost backup guard Fred VanVleet to a right knee injury early in the fourth quarter in their second straight loss. ""A tough game,"" said Lowry, who had 13 points on 3-of-16 shooting. The Raptors missed their first 10 3-point attempts, and shot 40 percent from the field, two days after a narrow loss to Golden State followed a blowout win over Cleveland. ""We have to get our motors going no matter who we play. It can't just be Cleveland or Golden State,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. Lowry and Simmons, who had 12 points and six turnovers, were ejected with 6.5 seconds left after a dustup near midcourt. No punches were thrown in the game that included six technical fouls. ""I don't play around,"" Simmons said. ""I'm not going to take (crap) from anybody."" The Sixers led 59-43 before the Raptors closed a dismal first half on a 6-0 run. Unable to stop Embiid (18 points) and unable to shoot from the outside (0 of 7 from 3-point range), the Raptors couldn't take advantage of Simmons missing the final seven minutes with three fouls. Simmons picked up his fourth foul 24 seconds into the third quarter but stayed in, and the Sixers built a 21-point lead with the help of technical fouls against VanVleet and Casey. ""Consistency in our league unbelievable,"" Casey said of the officiating. ""We've got to get that under control because one night it's one thing and another night it's another thing."" VanVleet crashed to the floor under the basket early in the fourth quarter and didn't return. TIP-INS Raptors: Lowry told the team he was ready to play after pregame warmups. ... DeRozan and McConnell each received technical fouls in the second quarter. McConnell jumped up after DeRozan's hard foul and the two had to be separated. 76ers: Embiid had seven of the Sixers' 21 turnovers. It was his seventh 30-point game of the season. ... There was no update on Redick, who came up lame after he caught a pass and limped to the locker room. ... Reserve C Richaun Holmes (illness) didn't dress. ... The Sixers after the game signed G Demetrius Jackson to a two-way contract and waived F James Michael McAdoo. DR.

"WASHINGTON --  Now that he has this basketball thing figured out, Giannis Antetokounmpo showed he wouldn't make a bad long snapper in football, either. Antetokounmpo hiked the ball through his legs to teammate Khris Middleton for a fast-break dunk and the highlight of his all-around dominant performance as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Washington Wizards 104-95 on Monday. Antetokounmpo scored 27 points and grabbed a career-high 20 rebounds in the Bucks' second road victory against the Wizards in 10 days. ""It's not important,"" Antetokounmpo said of his 20 rebounds. ""I was just in the right spot, and the ball just came into my hands."" The Wizards got 27 points and nine assists from John Wall and 19 points off the bench from Kelly Oubre. But just like on Jan. 6 when these teams last met, Antetokounmpo was the difference in Milwaukee pulling away in a tight game late. He and guard Eric Bledsoe, who had 23 points, led the Bucks on an 11-0 fourth-quarter run, and Antetokounmpo was able to dribble out the clock to ""M-V-P!"" chants from some fans in attendance. ""He was all over the floor tonight,"" Bledsoe said. ""That's the things we need from him night in and night out."" What the Bucks didn't expect was Antetokounmpo being able to snap the ball through his legs to Middleton with 6:50 left. ""That was a heck of a play by one of the best players in the world,"" coach Jason Kidd said. ""To be able to do that, to understand where his teammates are on the floor and the response that fast of hiking the ball to Khris just shows how good he really is."" Unfamiliar with football, Antetokounmpo asked if that's what a pitcher does. Told that was the job of a long snapper, the Bucks' leader smiled. ""Yeah, I could be a football player,"" he said. THREE-BALL The Bucks, who came in ranked 28th in the NBA in 3-point shooting at 34.6 percent, made half of their attempts against the league leaders in 3-point defense. Milwaukee attempted 16 3-point shots, which is what Kidd wants to see. ""You've got to keep shooting,"" said Kidd, whose 1,988 3-point field goals rank ninth in NBA/ABA history. ""The shooters have to keep shooting. Got to believe that the next one's going in."" TURNOVER TIME Washington's 24 turnovers were a season high and six short of the franchise record. The Wizards kept it close despite giving the ball away much more than usual. ""That really hurt us,"" coach Scott Brooks said. ""It has been the last few games, no question. We have to stop it from happening. It's costing us a great opportunity. Basically 24 turnovers is basically one entire quarter of not playing offense. It's hard to win that way."" FIGHTING BROOKS In the fourth quarter when these teams last met, Milwaukee's Matthew Dellavedova tackled Washington's Bradley Beal around the neck and brought him to the ground, leading to a flagrant-two foul. Though the Wizards steamed over the incident, Brooks is glad there's competitiveness but fewer fights in the NBA than when he played. ""The league has done a remarkable job of controlling the flare-ups,"" Brooks said. ""You fine and you suspend, that's the way to get it. You can't just fine guys. You've got to suspend guys, and that controls that."" Brooks recalled the only $2,000 fighting fine of his playing career when he got into a tussle during a 1993 playoff game with now-Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan. ""He's a lot bigger than I was,"" Brooks said. ""Not a good decision on my part. But I made a lot of those."" TIP-INS Bucks: Khris Middleton scored 19 points and Malcolm Brodgon 16. ... Were one of three teams to play back-to-back afternoon games Sunday and Monday, along with the Miami Heat and New York Knicks. Wizards: Beal continued his fourth-quarter struggles, going 0 of 4. He was 3 of 23 in his previous six fourth quarters. Beal finished with 19 points ... Foul trouble limited F Markieff Morris to six points in 24 minutes. ... G Jodie Meeks was out of the rotation for the second time in three games.","400975386"
"ATLANTA --  Dennis Schroder loves taking charge with the outcome uncertain in the closing seconds. It means even more when he can push the Atlanta Hawks to a rare victory over the San Antonio Spurs. ""I'm glad we got the win, first off,"" Schroder said. ""I hit my shots in crunch time. Dewayne Dedmon set great screens and got me open. I just shot with confidence, so it feels great."" Schroder scored 26 points, Ersan Ilyasova added 20 and the Hawks held off the Spurs in the closing seconds to win 102-99 on Monday. LaMarcus Aldridge had 25 points and 11 rebounds for San Antonio, which lost guard Manu Ginobli to a right thigh contusion in the first quarter and played without Kawhi Leonard as the star forward comes back slowly from injuries. The Hawks (11-31), who came in with the NBA's worst record and had lost five of six, never trailed after John Collins' tip-in made it 78-76 with 9:23 remaining. Danny Green's 3-pointer with 31 seconds left cut the lead to one, but Schroder answered by dribbling down the shot clock and hitting a layup to put Atlanta up by three with 10 seconds left. Schroder hit two of the Hawks' four free throws and the Spurs hit two before Green's 3-point attempt bounced off the back of the rim with 2 seconds left. ""Dennis made some big plays,"" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""The pull-up at the free-throw line, the left-handed finish -- it was a lot."" Kyle Anderson and Patty Mills each finished with 13 points for the Spurs. Collins and Dedmon each had 12 points for Atlanta. San Antonio jumped out to a 14-point lead midway through the first quarter, but Atlanta went on a big run to go up 33-32 midway through the second on Schroder's 18-footer. The Spurs are third in the Western Conference despite a 10-14 road record. ""I thought we came back and played in the second half,"" Aldridge said, ""but we've just got to take care of the ball better, we've got to guard the ball and we've got to rebound."" TIP-INS Spurs: Ginobli was injured while running into a screen from Dedmon. ""He got a good lick,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""I think he's going to be pretty tight for a while."" ... The team listed ""injury management"" as the reason that Leonard didn't play. Leonard had 19 points and eight rebounds in 28 minutes when he returned Friday against Denver from a three-game absence with a left shoulder injury. Hawks: Outscored San Antonio 16-4 in fast-break points. ... Out-rebounded the Spurs 50-37. When the Hawks lost at San Antonio in November, they were minus-14 on the boards. ... Swingman Marco Belinelli scored 10 points in 21 minutes after missing his first game of the season, Thursday's home loss to Brooklyn, with a sprained left ankle. ... F Andrew White, a rookie formerly of Syracuse, Nebraska and Kansas, was signed to a two-way contract and will report to Erie of the G-League. TWO STRAIGHT AT HOME Budenholzer lost his first six games against Popovich, his longtime mentor, but he's 2-2 since. Budenholzer, in his fifth season with the Hawks, spent 19 years on San Antonio's staff, including 17 as Popovich's assistant. SERIES TRENDS The Hawks have lost 20 straight in San Antonio, but they're 26-19 at home against the Spurs and earned their first consecutive home wins in the series since 2002-04. CALLING OUT TRUMP Popovich, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, said before the Martin Luther King Jr. Day game that the slain civil rights leader ""was truly a person who was interested in making America great. For everyone."" Popovich, meeting with reporters in King's hometown, weighed in again about Trump, whom Popovich said has consistently inflamed racial tensions for political purposes. Popovich has been outspoken about Trump since the former real estate developer and reality TV star began his rise through politics. He was asked Monday about King's legacy and referenced Trump's reported use of a vulgarity to refer to African countries. ""No matter what it is, he is willing to use it as a weapon and for a certain number of people who will vote for him for his own selfish reasons, and it shows what he cares about is himself,"" Popovich said. ""It's got nothing to do with America or anybody else. It's about puffing himself up and making sure in his disingenuous, cynical way that he satisfies a group. That's what I find really dangerous and really disgusting -- the way he uses his comments and then will tell you that he's not a racist.""","400975387"
"NEW YORK --  Though it hardly appeared like it with thousands of blue-and-orange-dressed fans standing and screaming for them, this was a road game for the New York Knicks. ""It feels like we're playing at home, so it was a good atmosphere for us,"" Kristaps Porzingis said. It gets harder from here. Porzingis had 26 points and nine rebounds, Michael Beasley added 23 points and 10 boards, and the Knicks opened their longest road trip in nearly 30 years by beating the Brooklyn Nets 119-104 on Monday. A day after blowing a 19-point lead in the third quarter of a loss to New Orleans, the Knicks lost most of a 14-point advantage heading to the fourth. But they opened the period with 11 straight points and went on to beat the Nets comfortably for the third time this season. Though the game was only a few miles from their home arena, the Knicks will do plenty of traveling the rest of the trip. They play seven straight on the road for the first time since 1988-89, with the remainder coming against the Western Conference. ""I think it's the beginning of an opportunity and they came out and responded after yesterday's loss,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. Rookie Frank Ntilikina finished with 10 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds as the Knicks snapped a three-game losing streak and won for the third time in 13 games. They played without Tim Hardaway Jr., who was rested after playing 33 minutes Sunday in his second game back from a stress injury to his lower left leg. DeMarre Carroll scored 22 points for the Nets, who shot 37 percent and lost for the fifth time in six games. ""To a certain extent, it's a make-or-miss league. As a unit, we shot in the 30s. That's not very good,"" said point guard Spencer Dinwiddie, who went 2 for 14. The Nets were 14 for 44 in the first half and fell behind by 14 early in the third. They got back into the game mostly on the strength of their free-throw shooting during a foul-filled 12 minutes in which the teams combined to shoot 36 free throws. Brooklyn went 17 of 20 and trailed only 83-81 after Carroll's jumper at the buzzer. But Ron Baker and Ntilikina made 3-pointers, Beasley had a three-point play in the opening run that made it 94-81 and Brooklyn never challenged again. ""They took us out the beginning of that fourth quarter and then dominated us the rest of the quarter,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. TIP-INS Knicks: Trey Burke made his Knicks debut after being signed Sunday from their G League team. Burke made a jumper on his first shot and had five points. ... Hornacek said Hardaway hadn't had any setbacks or recurrence of injury, but that he needed rest after playing more minutes than they'd planned on Sunday. Nets: The Nets fell to 0-8 against the Atlantic Division. ... D'Angelo Russell practiced with the Long Island Nets of the G League on Monday as he continues his recovery from left knee surgery. He was recalled after practice and sat on the Nets' bench, where he was called for a technical foul in the third quarter. Atkinson said the point guard is close to returning from the injury that's sidelined him for two months. ... C Tyler Zeller was back in the starting lineup after missing a game with a sore left hip. LONG ROAD AHEAD The Knicks move on to Memphis on Wednesday before the rest of the trip takes them to the western half of the country. They will be gone nearly two weeks before returning home to host the Nets on Jan. 30. LEE FROM THE LINE Courtney Lee made his 44th straight free throw on a third-quarter technical, tying the Knicks' record set by Chris Duhon in 2008-09. Lee came into the game leading the league at 96.1 percent after hitting 73 of 76. MLK-NYK The Knicks improved to 21-11 on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. They had lost five of their last seven, including losses to Brooklyn in 2013 and '14.","400975388"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The third quarter has often been a problem for the Oklahoma City Thunder this season, but that's when they made their move Monday night against the Sacramento Kings. Russell Westbrook had 19 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists before being ejected, and Oklahoma City rallied from a 15-point first-half deficit to beat Sacramento 95-88. Carmelo Anthony added 20 points, Paul George scored 18 and Steven Adams had 13 points and 13 rebounds for the Thunder, who avoided what would have been a fourth straight home loss thanks in large part to a dominant third quarter in which they outscored the Kings 31-16. ""We were definitely more focused,"" George said. ""We've been in this position where we played a sub-.500 team and for whatever reason, we tried to turn it on and win the ballgame late in the fourth. Tonight we took it at them early, got that cushion and that carried us through the finish."" Buddy Hield scored 16 points and Willie Cauley-Stein added 15 for Sacramento, which scored only 36 second-half points and is 1-16 on the road against Oklahoma City since the Thunder franchise moved from Seattle. Oklahoma City was up 91-77 with 2:51 left before official Matt Boland called two quick technical fouls on Westbrook after he complained about being called for traveling on a play on which he thought he'd been fouled. Another official, Gediminas Petraitis, then called a technical foul on Thunder coach Billy Donovan for protesting Westbrook's ejection. Hield made all three technical free throws and Cauley-Stein went 1 of 2 from the line with 2:35 left, pulling Sacramento to 91-84. But the Kings made only one field goal the rest of the way, and George blocked a shot and came up with a steal in the final two minutes. ""Melo, he was able to score about 15 points that (third) quarter,"" Hield said. ""He was helping open up the gap for him. (Westbrook) started making plays for everybody else. We got it back under 10, but we've got to be a little more experienced and a little more controlled. We've got to do better at executing late. We have to do a better job at helping each other out and make plays down the stretch."" The Kings led 24-20 after the first quarter and stretched their advantage to 48-33 after two free throws by Bogdan Bogdanovic with 3:03 left in the half. The Thunder closed the half on an 11-3 spurt to pull to 52-46. The Thunder seized control with an 11-0 run in the third quarter, highlighted by consecutive alley-oop passes from Westbrook for dunks -- first to Anthony, then to Adams. Anthony's two free throws put Oklahoma City ahead 75-66 with 1:39 left in the quarter. ""We just had to decide that we wanted to play (and) pick it up, take it up another level,"" Anthony said. ""Once we decided we wanted to do that in the second half, we changed the outcome of the game."" After the teams went scoreless for the first three-plus minutes of the fourth, Sacramento pulled within seven on a basket by Cauley-Stein, but Patrick Patterson hit two 3-pointers in a 17-second span and Alex Abrines followed with another to extend the Thunder's lead to 86-70. TIP-INS Kings: Hield traveled back to Norman on Sunday to visit practice at No. 4 Oklahoma. Hield led the Sooners to the 2016 Final Four. ... The Kings, who beat the Thunder on Nov. 7 in Sacramento, haven't won two straight over the Oklahoma City franchise since the 2007-08 season, when the team was in Seattle. ... The Kings made 15 of 25 free throws, while the Thunder went 14 of 29 from the line. Thunder: Ace defender Andre Roberson sat out for the eighth straight game with patellar tendinitis in his left knee. ... For the 14th straight game, Westbrook recorded a double-double with at least 20 points. The only guard in NBA history to have a longer such streak was Michael Jordan, with 15 straight in 1989. ... George, the NBA steals leader, had five. ... Westbrook's 16 rebounds were three off his career high. ... At halftime, the team showed a video with Thunder players reciting excerpts from Martin Luther King Jr.'s famed ""I Have A Dream"" speech. THE EJECTION With Oklahoma City up by 14 and the game seemingly under control, Westbrook looked to finish it off with a driving layup, but collided with Cauley-Stein as De'Aaron Fox appeared to hit Westbrook in the face. Boland ruled that Westbrook had traveled, setting off the slew of technical fouls. Westbrook didn't stick around to answer questions after the game, but Donovan said Petraitis later apologized to him for calling the technical foul on the coach. ""The official made a terrible mistake and he acknowledged it,"" Donovan said. ""I was yelling to the other official across the floor to get his attention and (Petraitis) just T'd me up. He came by and apologized to me. I definitely didn't deserve a T. . I've been doing this long enough, I know when I'm close to getting a T and when I deserve a T. That was totally undeserved and should not have been called.""","400975389"
"CHICAGO --  Zach LaVine is making the most of his limited minutes. The guard scored 18 points in his second game with Chicago as the Bulls ended the Miami Heat's seven-game winning streak with a 119-111 victory Monday. ""I'm still a little tired, a little winded, but I feel good,"" LaVine said. ""It goes by really quick, I look up and like, man it's already seven minutes, but I try to make the most of the 20 minutes, and I think I'm doing a good job so far."" Justin Holiday made a career-best seven 3s and scored 25 points for the Bulls, who have won three straight and 14 of their last 21. LaVine tore an ACL last season with Minnesota and was traded in a package for Jimmy Butler in the offseason. He scored 14 points in his Bulls debut Saturday against Detroit. The Bulls are limiting LaVine to 20 minutes per game in his first week back. He scored 13 points in 12 minutes in the first half, and his four-point play with 0.9 seconds left before the break put the Bulls ahead 55-48 after a 14-2 run. ""That was pretty disgusting basketball,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. LaVine also had five rebounds, five assists and two steals. ""He came with a lot of confidence shooting, and he's just so fast out there,"" Nikola Mirotic said. The Bulls hit 16 of 39 3-pointers (41 percent), their eighth straight game with at least 10 3-pointers, a franchise record. ""We weren't communicating very well,"" Heat guard Josh Richardson said. ""We knew the game plan coming in, we were going to have to make them drive it, or make thing tough on them from the 3-point line. We just didn't do that."" Holiday had four 3-pointers in the third quarter, including one that gave Chicago its first of two 19-point leads in the third, 82-63. Mirotic scored all 18 of his points in the fourth quarter for the Bulls, holding off the Heat, who closed to a 105-100 deficit with 3:39 to play on James Johnson's 3-pointer. Holiday made a jump shot and two free throws, and rookie Lauri Markkanen made a 3-pointer down the stretch. Markkanen had 17 points and nine rebounds. ""They lit us up,"" Spoelstra said. ""They have been playing well for 20 games. It's not like they're sneaking up on us. They've been playing good basketball. They play hard. They compete."" Heat starter Tyler Johnson injured his left ankle in the third quarter. He was helped to the locker room and didn't return. Goran Dragic scored 22 points to lead the Heat. Off the bench, Kelly Olynyk had 21 points and eight assists and Wayne Ellington had 20 points. ANOTHER ONE DOWN Spoestra said Johnson got X-rays on his ankle that were negative and should get an MRI on Tuesday. ""We were all thinking the worst,"" Spoelstra said. ""Right now he just has it wrapped in tape so that's a good sign as well."" The Heat are already down guard Dion Waiters, who had season-ending ankle surgery. YOUNG GUN Markkanen made his 100th career 3-pointer in his 41st game, the record for fastest to get to 100 in NBA history. MORE TIME? Hoiberg said LaVine will be on 20-minute restriction on Wednesday against Golden State and then re-evaluated for possible extended action after that.","400975390"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Los Angeles Lakers had won four straight games behind a stalwart defense. It didn't come with them to Memphis. The Grizzlies shot 51 percent from the field and 46 percent from 3-point range, and eight Memphis players reached double figures in a 123-114 victory over the Lakers on Monday. ""We let them move the ball wherever they wanted,"" said Lakers coach Luke Walton, whose team had limited opponents to an average of 95.3 points during the winning streak. ""... They just didn't feel us. That's not how we've been playing defense over this stretch."" Dillon Brooks matched his season best with 19 points while Marc Gasol had 17 points and seven rebounds for Memphis. Tyreke Evans had 15 points and 12 assists. Wayne Selden and James Ennis III added 13 points each. Brooks converted his first four shots, starting with a pair of 3-pointers. The Grizzlies kept hitting shots into the third, making 12 of 23 to build a 97-77 entering the fourth. ""I just felt confident in my shot,"" said Brooks, who finished 6 of 8 from the field, including 4 of 5 from outside the arc. ""... Coach (J.B. Bickerstaff) has been stressing shoot and shoot with confidence. Once the first shot went in, I felt good.""

""It's an absolute honor,"" Walton said, adding of King: ""What really separates him, is he really emphasized doing it through a peaceful manner."" Bickerstaff, Memphis' interim coach, said it is a matter of recognizing the price paid by others in the fight to reach where players are today.

"CLEVELAND -- Once the lead swelled to 14, Kevin Durant waved both arms like a boxing referee stopping a fight. Another knockout on the road for these Warriors. Durant scored 32 points, Stephen Curry added 23 and Golden State extended its road winning streak to 13 with a 118-108 Martin Luther King holiday victory Monday night over the Cleveland Cavaliers, their struggling NBA Finals foes. Durant scored 16 in the third quarter for the defending champions, who clamped down on defense and pulled away in the fourth to remain unbeaten outside Oracle Arena since Nov. 22. It's not that they play poorly at home, but Durant said the Dubs take a different identity when they travel. ""At home, we just relax a little bit,"" Durant said. ""This is who we are when we're on the road."" LeBron James scored 32 points and Kevin Love 17 for Cleveland, which had its home winning streak stopped at 13. Isaiah Thomas, getting his first taste of the Warriors-Cavaliers rivalry, had 19 points in 32 minutes -- his most in five games as he returns from a hip injury. It was Golden State's second straight win over Cleveland, which has dropped eight of 10 dating to a loss to the Warriors on Christmas Day. The Cavs were down just 93-91 entering the fourth, but missed 17 of 19 shots to open the period, and Golden State throttled away. ""It seemed like the rim just got smaller and smaller,"" James said. ""But I like our effort. If we continue that going into our next few games, then I like where we are."" The teams have met in the Finals each of the past three years. And while there's no guarantee there will be a fourth matchup, at this point only one of them looks prepared in January for June. Durant, though, expects the Cavs to improve as they incorporate Thomas. ""Everyone knows it's going to take a while to get into a comfortable groove here,"" he said. ""It's a new system, so I don't think this game was any indication of what's going to happen with this team down the line. They'll be much better than they are right now -- and we all know that."" Cleveland was home after going 1-4 on a road trip that included blowout losses in Minnesota and Toronto. For three quarters, the Cavs matched the Warriors shot for shot. But with Durant and Curry on the bench, a Golden State lineup of Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, David West, Klay Thompson and Shaun Livingston stretched the lead. ""That unit, they won us the game with their energy and their effort,"" Durant said. ""They pushed the basketball and they set us up well to kind of end the game in the last three or four minutes. That's what a well-rounded team does."" Despite their recent struggles, the Cavs remain a confident bunch, and they showed some early swagger. After he and his teammates were introduced to ""Gloves Are Comin' Off"" by rapper 7kingZ, James came out swinging. He was in attack mode from the start, scoring 16 points in the first quarter and setting the tone for the Cavs. Later in the half, James retreated down the lane for a huge block on Durant, blasting the ball off the glass to trigger memories for Cleveland fans of his famous chase down on Iguodala in the closing minutes of Game 7 of the 2016 Finals. DUNK CITY Curry threw down a two-handed dunk in the third quarter that surprised his teammates. ""It was like a dream,"" Curry said. ""I thought I was going to wake up and I was going to be back in my bed in the hotel, but it actually happened. Somebody said it was like a unicorn sighting. It was pretty cool for me to get a dunk in that situation."" After being asked several times about the play, Curry said, ""Seven dunk questions. This is crazy.""

"SALT LAKE CITY --  Offense trumped defense on a night when one of the NBA's most efficient offensive teams met one of the top defensive units. Victor Oladipo scored 28 points and the Indiana Pacers shot 54 percent from 3-point range in a 109-94 win over the Utah Jazz on Monday. ""Execution,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""We talked about establishing our pace, but controlling the tempo. We didn't want to get in an up-and-down game and allow the crowd to get into the game. Our guys did a nice job of taking opportunities early when we had them. And if we didn't, we made them defend and were able to execute and score. ""Guys have confidence. When we get good ball movement and we're sharing the ball, we shoot the ball a lot better."" Oladipo got going late in the second quarter during a 15-2 run that gave Indiana a 14-point lead. Then his back-to-back buckets early in the third capped a 9-0 surge to push the advantage to 67-47. He also had six rebounds and six assists. ""Guys were getting wide-open shots,"" Oladipo said. ""Guys shooting the ball with confidence. ""Just ball movement, getting the right shot, making the right play. Most of all, defensively, making it tough on them."" Domantas Sabonis finished with 15 points and eight rebounds for the Pacers, and Thaddeus Young scored 17. Donovan Mitchell scored 23 for the struggling Jazz, while Derrick Favors added 16 points and seven rebounds. Utah has lost 15 of 19. ""We're not playing with a lot of confidence on offense right now, both individually and collectively,"" coach Quin Snyder said. ""If that's the case, you can't force that. You just got to connect even more and, in some respects, it puts more pressure on your offense. ""But that pressure can't be felt by any one guy. It's got to be collective. When you turn the ball over, that's not confidence. That's just, we have to be more mentally tough."" The Jazz put themselves in a hole with seven first-quarter turnovers, but rallied with a 14-0 spurt in the second to cut the deficit to 38-37. They never got that close again. The Pacers were efficient on offense all night, shooting 53 percent from the field and 14 of 26 from 3-point territory. Indiana is 15-0 when shooting better than 50 percent. ""There were times we just didn't talk to each other and I think that's the biggest thing,"" Mitchell said about Utah's defense. ""We've got to be able to talk and communicate and understand."" TIP-INS Pacers: Indiana began the night ranked second in the NBA in 3-point shooting at 38.3 percent. Jazz: Raul Neto returned from a 15-game absence due to a concussion and bruised left knee. ... Rudy Gobert went through an extensive workout with braces on both knees before the game. He's thought to be close to returning from a left PCL sprain and bone bruise. TURNER OUT Pacers center Myles Turner did not play due to a ligament sprain and muscle strain in his right elbow. He will not play the remaining three games of the road trip. The team lists him as week-to-week depending on how quickly Turner heals, but said he will not need surgery. SEFOLOSHA'S STATUS Jazz forward Thabo Sefolosha has been diagnosed with a serious right knee sprain and wore a bulky brace before the game. The team has not announced a timeline for his return, but there are fears it could be a long-term injury. QUOTABLE ""He's a very confident kid with a lot of talent,"" McMillan said of Oladipo. ""We knew that he had potential in making the move to trade him for Paul (George). He's showing pretty much what I think the league expected him to become. He's come out very aggressive this season.

"LOS ANGELES --  Chris Paul came back to Staples Center to play against his old team and things got heated. The final minutes of the game were filled with technical fouls, ejections, swearing, bumping -- and that was just the beginning. Lou Williams scored 31 points, Blake Griffin added 29 before his ejection, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat Paul and the Houston Rockets 113-102 on Monday night for their fifth victory in a row. The tempers that flared during the fourth quarter carried over after the game, when several security guards were present outside the Houston locker room. Citing anonymous NBA sources, ESPN reported several Rockets players headed toward the Clippers' locker room, seeking a confrontation, but were escorted away by security before anything got physical. Asked about that, Clippers coach Doc Rivers would only say his team was in its own locker room. ""Their entire team was not in their locker room,"" he said, referring to the Rockets. Paul had 19 points, six rebounds and seven assists for the Rockets, whose three-game winning streak ended. ""It's always like that when you lose, especially when you're playing against a former team, all the emotions that go into it, familiar faces and stuff like that,"" Paul said. ""For us, we've got to be better. Give them the credit, they won the game."" Things got testy with 3 1/2 minutes to go. Griffin scored under the basket and Paul was called for a foul. Paul ran over to the referees in disbelief. On his way back up court, Griffin went out of bounds and bumped Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni, who became irate and cursed in Griffin's direction. ""After he said what he said, I said the same thing back,"" Griffin said. Asked what he said, D'Antoni replied, ""You mean after he hit me? Just that I didn't appreciate him. But other than that, it's good."" The referees reviewed video of the play and confirmed the foul on Paul, while also assessing double technicals to Griffin and D'Antoni. ""Coach told me he (Griffin) elbowed him and I saw him talking crazy to Coach. I always got our coach's back,"" Paul said. ""You probably can tell me what I said better than I did. Whatever it is, I'm sure my mama is going to tell me to wash my mouth."" Rivers said he didn't see the Griffin-D'Antoni interaction, and added, ""I don't think a coach should ever get engaged with a player personally, but I've been guilty of it before."" The crowd was on its feet with 1:12 to go after Griffin caught the ball near the midcourt sideline and slammed it off Eric Gordon's back in order to keep it from going out of bounds. Nine seconds later, Griffin and Trevor Ariza received double technicals after exchanging words, and both were ejected. ""He asked me if I was still coming to his birthday party and I said, `Yeah, I'm going to try,"" Griffin said, smiling. Griffin high-fived players on the Clippers' bench as he stormed off the court, tearing off his jersey in the process. ""I know Blake was upset on the last play. He felt like somebody tried to do dirty to him,"" Rivers said. ""I'm glad nobody got hurt."" Walking into his postgame interview, Rivers joked: ""We're honoring Martin Luther King Jr. Day; we're non-violent."" Griffin said: ""We were where we were supposed to be; we were in our locker room. We can't control what anybody else does."" Paul got booed when he brought the ball up court for the first time. Some fans stood and applauded a video tribute to him during a timeout in the first quarter, when Paul waved from the bench, but most appeared to not have forgotten Paul's desire to leave last summer after six years without a title in Los Angeles. Gordon, another ex-Clipper, had 19 points and Ariza added 17. Houston shot 40 percent with injured star James Harden out. Griffin and Williams dominated the third quarter, combining for 20 points while extending the Clippers' lead to 92-84. Griffin ran off nine in a row and Williams added two 3-pointers. ""It's an emotional game. It was a big game for us to try to get over .500,"" Williams said after his 13th straight game of 20 or more points. TAKING IT PERSONAL Williams insisted he harbors no ill will toward the Rockets, who took him out of a losing situation with the Lakers only to trade him to the Clippers a short time later. But it still bothered him. ""I'm a very productive basketball player,"" he said. ""A lot of productive basketball players usually don't get traded that much, especially in a short period of time, so I took it very personal."" MOVING ON Rivers said the Clippers didn't mention Paul in their pregame discussions. ""Chris was great for us, but Chris decided to leave us,"" Rivers said. ""We don't talk about him. We talked about the way to win the game."" TIP-INS Rockets: Harden (hamstring strain) is on track to return later this week. ... Besides Paul, the ex-Clippers on the Rockets' roster are Gordon and Luc Mbah a Moute. Clippers: C DeAndre Jordan (sprained left ankle) is likely to return Saturday at Utah.

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  With Bismack Biyombo and rookie Khem Birch providing boards and blocks, the Orlando Magic won for the first time in 2018. The duo combined for 26 rebounds and nine blocked shots in Orlando's 108-102 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night. Statistically the worst rebounding team in the NBA, the Magic had a 51-37 edge on the boards and broke a seven-game losing streak against a team that had won five straight. ""Biyombo is a very hard-playing guy and Birch hurt us, so the rebounding was problematic,"" said Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau. ""I thought we were in position to win but if you don't rebound the ball, you're putting yourself in a big hole."" Evan Fournier scored a season-high 32 points for the Magic, and D.J. Augustin added 11 points and three assists in a 35-point fourth quarter. Magic guard Arron Afflalo and Timberwolves forward Nemanja Bjelica were ejected with 7:58 left in the second quarter when they got into a fight while the game was being played. Afflalo threw at least one punch in the fight, which came four minutes after both players had been assessed technical fouls. ""I don't want to feel like a victim here, that's part of the game,"" Bjelica said. ""But he took a swing at me, and I was just trying to protect myself, first of all, and to calm him down because he was wild. ""I don't know what's wrong with that guy, but at that point I have to protect myself and my family."" Afflalo was unavailable for comment after the game. Birch, who has spent much of the season going back and forth to the NBA G League, contributed 12 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks on less than 19 minutes. ""It's hard to take out a player who plays hard, so that's what I did,"" said the 6-foot-9 rookie from UNLV. ""When you play limited minutes, you've got to go as hard as you can. You don't want to mess up the opportunity."" Birch finished the first quarter by making the first four free throws of his NBA career, and blocked a couple of shots in the second quarter to keep the Timberwolves from pulling away. ""He's an NBA player, not a G League player,"" said Magic coach Frank Vogel. ""He really plays that role well, the role of shot-blocking and rebounding. And he's got good instincts on the defensive end."" Jimmy Butler had 28 points and seven rebounds for the Timberwolves, who had won their five preceding games by an average of 18.8 points. ""I'm glad we (expletive) lost, coming in here on our high horse thinking we are a really good team and we haven't done anything yet,"" Butler said. ""Good for us, man. They played better than us."" Fournier and Augustin hit 3-pointers during a 14-4 fourth-quarter run that put Orlando ahead to stay, and Augustin's three free throws with 2:10 left gave the Magic a nine-point lead, the biggest of the game for either team. Jeff Teague and Karl-Anthony Towns answered with 3-pointers to keep the Timberwolves in it, but Biyombo scored five straight Magic points to regain an eight-point lead with 50 seconds left. A loss would have dropped Orlando (13-31) to the worst record in the NBA. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Minnesota shot only 10 free throws. ""Very unusual for us,"" Thibodeau said. ""I want to take a look at as well."" ... Now fourth in the Western Conference, the Wolves are 6-11 against teams from the East. Magic: F Marreese Speights missed the game for personal reasons. ... With 10 points and seven rebounds in the first half, Birch exceeded his career totals in both categories. ... Biyombo had 10 rebounds and three blocks in the first quarter. MORE FROM BUTLER ""I think we were comfortable,"" Butler said. ""We didn't play hard, we didn't rebound, we didn't guard, we didn't execute, we didn't do anything. We were going through the motions out there. When you do that in this league, you can get beat by anybody.""","400975395"
"BOSTON --  Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans eventually were too big for the Boston Celtics. Davis had 45 points and 16 rebounds as he and DeMarcus Cousins controlled the lane and led the Pelicans to a 116-113 overtime victory on Tuesday night, ending the Celtics' seven-game winning streak. ""It was a great win for us. They tested us,"" said Davis, who just missed matching the 48 points he scored Sunday during a win in New York. Cousins added 19 points and 15 rebounds, and Jrue Holiday scored 23 points. The trio combined for all 12 Pelicans points in OT as New Orleans handed the Celtics their first loss of 2018. Ian Clark added 15 points for the Pelicans, whose size inside ended up prevailing in overtime when Boston's barrage of 3-pointers stopped falling. Kyrie Irving led Boston with 27 points, 24 after halftime as the Celtics rallied from a 12-point deficit and led by as much as five late in regulation. ""For some reason tonight, the whole game we were a little careless. It just carried over there at the end,"" said Al Horford, who had 14 points and nine rebounds. ""We thought we had it. It just got away from us."" Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown added 16 points apiece for the Celtics, who attempted a season-high 50 3-pointers. Rather than challenge Davis and Cousins inside, the Celtics lived outside and it cost them in overtime when they went just 1 for 4. ""I thought we did a great job defensively in the first half trying to contain Kyrie. You know that that's not going to last the entire game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We came up with stops when we absolutely had to and then we were able to make some plays down the stretch that were the difference in the game."" Horford's 3-pointer early in OT gave Boston a 107-106 lead and Boston went up 113-110. A jumper by Cousins cut the lead to 113-112, then Holiday added two more field goals and Boston couldn't catch up from there. ""They kept worrying about me so much diving to the rim, Jrue was able to hit them little midrange jumpers. He kind of took over that overtime for us and got some separation for us,"" Davis said. New Orleans survived a rough start to the fourth, opening the period 3 for 13 and going without a field goal from 6:40 remained until the 1:50-mark, when a layup by Clark cut Boston's lead to 101-98. The Pelicans went ahead 104-102 in the final minute of regulation before Irving drove for a layup to tie it at 104-all with 11 seconds left. Irving scored 16 in the third to help Boston back into it, but New Orleans scored the last six points of the third for an 87-80 lead, and went ahead by 10 early in the fourth. Boston battled back again, tying it at 95-all when a dunk by Brown invigorated the home fans. SECOND WIND The Pelicans overcame Boston's five-point lead late despite a rough fourth quarter for Davis, who was 0 for 3 from the floor and scored only four points in the period. ""I think they did a good job on him but also he had played a long stretch of minutes. And I thought he was fatigued more than anything,"" Gentry said. ""But when we needed him most, when we needed Jrue most, that's when they came through. And that's the big thing."" TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis was warmly greeted by Celtics fans. He had 25 points at halftime. Celtics: The Celtics were playing their first game since returning from London, where they beat the Philadelphia 76ers 114-103 on Thursday. ... Boston shot just 35 percent (18 for 51) in the first half. ... Boston's previous high for 3-pointers attempted was 43 against Atlanta on Nov. 18. FAREWELL JOJO The Celtics announced during the game that Hall of Famer Jo Jo White, a two-time NBA champion with Boston, had died at age 71. Boston coach Brad Stevens said White was always ""super kind"" during what little time he got to spend with the two-time NBA champion, whose No. 10 was retired in 1982. ""He was always clearly really appreciative to have been a part of the Boston Celtics,"" Stevens said. ""You just appreciated how he treated everybody. And he was around, you could tell he had an influence on our guys and an impact on our guys. It's really sad.""","400975396"
"DENVER --  Michael Malone wasn't all that thrilled about the lack of composure in the final quarter. Or all the turnovers. Or the shot selection. Or even the defense. Still, he won't quibble with the outcome. ""We survived,"" Denver's coach said. Nikola Jokic scored 29 points and grabbed a season-high 18 rebounds, Gary Harris hit two late free throws and the Nuggets held off the Dallas Mavericks 105-102 on Tuesday night after nearly blowing a 23-point lead. ""We lost focus in the fourth quarter and we gave them a chance to come back in the game,"" Jokic said. ""That was bad."" The Nuggets led 82-59 with 4:04 left in the third before Dallas staged a massive comeback. The Mavericks cut the deficit to one on a three-point play by Dennis Smith Jr. with 10.4 seconds remaining. After Harris made two free throws, the Mavericks had a chance for a last-second shot, but Dwight Powell couldn't corral a long pass as the buzzer sounded. ""We never give up,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""There are some things to build on here."" So, what exactly changed in the fourth? ""I don't know. I'll have to go back and watch film to figure it out,"" said Smith, who finished with 25 points. The Nuggets unraveled during a fourth quarter in which they were outscored 33-19. They turned the ball over several times, leading to 10 points, hit just 3 of 7 free throws and allowed Dallas to drain three 3-pointers. ""I thought we looked like a poorly coached team in that fourth quarter,"" Malone said. ""I take that very personally. We all have to be better down the stretch. If that game is 10 seconds longer, we probably lose. ""But I'm not going to say it's a complete waste -- we got a win. I'm proud of our guys for having enough fortitude down the stretch to get the win."" Harris finished with 25 points and Will Barton added 22 for the Nuggets, who won for just the second time in six games. Trying to address the issue of slow starts, Malone tweaked the starting lineup by inserting Barton and sending Mason Plumlee to the bench. The change worked as Denver led at halftime. That's significant because it halted a streak of seven straight games in which the Nuggets trailed at intermission. Denver made protecting the paint a point of emphasis in this contest. When the Mavericks beat the Nuggets 122-105 on Dec. 4, they dominated points in the paint with 64. That figure comes with a caveat -- Jokic was sidelined with an ankle sprain. This time, Dallas had 42. Harris and Jokic combined to score Denver's opening 22 points, before Plumlee got in the scoring act with a free throw late in the first quarter. TIP-INS Mavericks: J.J. Barea sat out with a strained groin. ... F Harrison Barnes contributed 17 points, while reserve Devin Harris had 16. Nuggets: The team had two buzzer-beaters -- Barton on a 3-pointer to end the first quarter and Jokic with a tip-in to close out the second. ... Jokic had seven assists. INJURY UPDATE Carlisle said it's looking like at least February until Dorian Finney-Smith (left knee), Nerlens Noel (left thumb) and Seth Curry (left tibia) return. ""Right now Nerlens is on track to be on the floor before any of them,"" Carlisle said. ""If all goes well it's very possible he could be back playing in the first week of February."" YOUTH IS SERVED A reason for Denver's disparity between its home record (16-5) and road mark (7-16) is plain, old youth. ""It's our reality. Jamal (Murray) is 20. That's not an excuse, he's 20 years old,"" Malone said. ""We have a lot of young players and we have to help them get through these tough times."" SPORADIC JOKIC Malone isn't worried about Jokic's up-and-down performances. All part of his learning curve. ""This is his third year in the NBA. He was a second-round pick. Now all of a sudden people want him to be Superman,"" Malone said. ""Very few players in NBA history come in their first, second and third year and put a franchise on their back. What you love about Nikola is he doesn't shy from it.""","400975397"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard says he's finally feeling close to normal. Lillard, who dealt with a hamstring injury late in December before straining his right calf earlier this month, scored 31 points in a 118-111 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night. ""When I came back I knew that it would take some time to just to be able to move comfortably. The last few games, each game has gotten better,"" said Lillard, who missed five games with the hamstring and two with the calf. ""Tonight I just felt good. I felt almost normal at times."" CJ McCollum had 27 points, including six 3-pointers, and the Blazers snapped a three-game losing streak. Devin Booker had 43 for the Suns, who have lost three straight and five of their last six. The Trail Blazers led by as many as 27 points in third quarter but Booker rallied the Suns in the final period with 21 points. His 3-pointer got the Suns within 103-93 with just over seven minutes left and Portland coach Terry Stotts put his starters back in. Booker hit another 3-pointer to narrow Portland's lead to 107-99. McCollum answered with a basket, and Portland got a stop before Al-Farouq Aminu's 3 from the corner with 3:30 left. Another 3-pointer by Aminu put Portland up 117-105 with 1:12 left and essentially put the game out of reach. Booker finished with five 3-pointers, four of them in the fourth quarter alone. ""I never count us out. I don't care if we're down 20 with a minute to go. You've got to keep playing through the whistle and I think we showed that tonight,"" Booker said. ""You're never out of a game. This is the NBA. You never know what can happen."" It was Portland's first game back home after a four-game road trip. The Blazers dropped consecutive games to Houston, New Orleans and Minnesota. The Suns were without Marquese Chriss for the third straight game because of a right hip strain. Dragan Bender started in his place. Phoenix was also without T.J. Warren because of low back soreness. Both Chriss and Warren were considered day-to-day. Portland's Shabazz Napier, who has helped give the Blazers a spark off the bench, was available after nursing a lower back strain. He had his back wrapped with an ice pack while the team warmed up for the second half. Napier finished with 11. Lillard hit a 3-pointer with the first shot of the game, and the Blazers opened 8 for 8 from the field. Lillard finished the opening quarter with 12 points, second only to Booker with 13. Pat Connaughton's 3-pointer put the Blazers up 45-36, and McCollum hit a 3-pointer to stretch the lead to 66-51 going into the half.  Lillard and Booker each finished the half with 20 points. Portland pulled away in the second half, going up 80-56 after McCollum's steal and layup. The Suns opened the half just 1-of-13 from the field. The game got a bit testy early in the fourth quarter, when Maurice Harkless and Booker exchanged words. Both were given technical fouls. Troy Daniels finished with 18 points off the bench for Phoenix. For the Suns, the rally came too late. ""I finally found a combination at the end there where we had shooters on the floor and we moved the basketball to give us a little bit of a chance,"" said Suns interim coach Jay Triano. The teams met in the season opener in Phoenix, with the Blazers winning 124-76 for the worst loss in Suns' history. Portland won the second meeting 114-107 in Portland on Oct. 28. TIP-INS Suns: It was the first of a four-game road trip for the Suns. ... Going into the game, Phoenix was 4-4 on the road in the Western Conference. Trail Blazers: McCollum's career high for 3-pointers is seven. ... Portland has traditionally enjoyed a strong home-court advantage, but this season was 10-10 going into Tuesday's game. The victory gave the Blazers a four-game winning streak at the Moda Center. THREE-GUARD LINEUP Stotts has been experimenting more and more (when warranted) with a three-guard lineup, with Lillard, McCollum and Napier. ""When they made their run in the first quarter, we went to it in the first quarter and it was good. We had a lead in the third quarter, so I was trying to kind of preserve `Bazz's minutes, otherwise I probably would have gone to it in the third quarter as well,"" Stotts said.","400975398"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Nic Batum said it felt like old times having coach Steve Clifford back on the bench Wednesday night. ""Even when we were up 25 points, he was still screaming at us, still wasn't happy,"" Batum said with a laugh. ""He wasn't happy after the game either. I missed him a lot. It's cool to have him back."" Michael Kidd-Gilchrist scored 21 points, Dwight Howard had another double-double and the Charlotte Hornets used a record-setting first half to beat the Washington Wizards 133-109 in Clifford's first game since Dec. 1. Clifford returned after missing 21 games because of headaches caused by sleep deprivation . The 56-year-old Clifford said it was great to be back and his focus is squarely on winning. The Hornets were 9-21 in Clifford's absence and had fallen eight games under .500. ""The newness or whatever excitement wears off because we need to win these games,"" Clifford said. ""I mean this is important, this stretch of home games. Physically, I feel really good -- but we need to win, so that's the best thing."" The Hornets made 12 of their first 13 shots and scored a franchise-record 77 points in the first half to build a 16-point lead. They extended that to 28 in the second half in a game that was never close. Kemba Walker had 19 points, Howard had 18 points and 15 rebounds and Jeremy Lamb had 16 points for the Hornets, who won for the fifth time in their last seven games. The Hornets shot 65 percent from the field in the first half, including a pair of four-point plays from Walker and Marvin Williams. ""They had everything. Everything they wanted they had,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""Give them credit, they were playing great basketball. Good to have coach Cliff back and I'm sure they were inspired by it and they played well. They made shots, they moved the ball, and they competed."" Bradley Beal had 26 points for the Wizards, whose five-game road trip got off to a rocky start. Brooks was upset with his team's play and suggested changes are coming. ""You just have to find guys that are going to compete,"" Brooks said. ""It's not about nothing else. It's not about shots. It's not about how many minutes. It's not about how many shots you get. It's about competing. We all get paid to compete, regardless."" TIP INS Wizards: Have allowed at least 100 points in 16 straight games. ... Were outscored 50-30 in the paint. Hornets: The 10 straight field goals made to start the game are the most to start a game since 2002-03. ... With a 23-point lead in the fourth quarter, Hornets fans started chanting ""We want (Malik) Monk."" Clifford put the rookie in with four minutes to play and he hit a 3-pointer. THE ALTERCATION Charlotte's Michael Carter-Williams and Washington's Tim Frazier were given double technical fouls and ejected after an altercation with four minutes remaining in the game. It started when Jason Smith fouled Carter-Williams, who went to retaliate before Frazier stepped in the middle. ""I thought they were getting cheap shots a little bit,"" Carter-Williams said. ""I don't think I should have gotten ejected from the game -- one tech is probably deserving. It is what it is. I think the game got a little out of hand. Things happen."" With the Wizards down by 20, Brooks elected to have Howard, a 52 percent free-throw shooter, come off the bench to shoot Carter-Williams' free throws. With the crowd booing Brooks' decision, Howard walked on to the floor and sank both free throws. He glanced over at the Wizards bench and raised his palms incredulously as if to say, ""Why?"" The crowd roared with delight after Howard made both shots, and Clifford quickly removed him from the game. SPARSE CROWS The teams played in front a sparse crowd because of the wintry weather that has gripped Charlotte, which led to most schools being closed. Across town, the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League played in an empty arena because the game was closed to fans due to the wintry mix.","400975399"
"ATLANTA --  With a chance to win the game, Kent Bazemore wasn't the first option for the Atlanta Hawks. He wound up with the ball -- and it worked out just fine. Bazemore swished a jumper over Anthony Davis with 2.1 seconds remaining and the Hawks rallied from 19 points down to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 94-93 Wednesday, thrilling a sparse crowd on an icy night in Atlanta. The Hawks wanted to go to Ersan Ilyasova in the corner, but the Pelicans thwarted that play. So Dennis Schroder passed instead to the 6-foot-5 Bazemore, who feigned a drive before pulling up from 18 feet to hit the shot against the 6-10 Davis. ""That's one of my favorite moves,"" Bazemore said. ""It's almost like you're out there by yourself. You can't worry that the guy defending you has like a 7-10 wing span. You've got to rise up and make the shot."" It was a tough night for Davis, who was held to just eight points on 2-of-8 shooting -- one night after scoring 45 points in a big win at Boston. ""We did it by committee,"" Bazemore said. ""We showed him a crowd all night. We made it tough."" Tied at 92, DeMarcus Cousins drew a blocking foul on rookie John Collins with 13.7 seconds remaining, earning a trip to the foul line. Cousins made only one, giving the Hawks a chance to pull out the victory. New Orleans had one last chance, inbounding the ball to Cousins near the hoop. He came up short on a quick shot, pleading with the officials for a foul call while the Hawks celebrated. ""The ball movement that we had in the first half wasn't there,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We didn't have enough plays at the end to finish the game."" Bazemore led the Hawks with 20 points, Collins added 18 and Schroeder had a double-double -- 13 points and 15 assists. Jrue Holiday paced the Pelicans with 22 points, while Cousins had 19 points and 14 rebounds. Coming off a victory over San Antonio, the Hawks won back-to-back games for only the second time this season and snapped the Pelicans' three-game winning streak. Atlanta missed seven straight shots during two different stretches in the first quarter and endured another long drought at the beginning of the second, going nearly 5 minutes without a field goal. New Orleans ripped off 12 straight points to erase an early deficit and led three times by 19 before settling for a 60-45 lead at the break. But the Pelicans made only 3 of 18 shots in a 10-point third period, allowing the Hawks to grab a 71-70 lead heading to the fourth. WINTER BLUES The game was played after a winter storm moved through the Deep South, leading most schools and businesses in metro Atlanta to shut down for the day because of treacherous roads. The upper deck wasn't even used, allowing everyone in the estimated turnout of around 5,000 to watch the contest from the lower level. The announced attendance was 10,894, the smallest crowd of the season at Philips Arena. The Hawks came into the night ranked last in the league with an average attendance 14,239 -- more than 1,300 less per game than the next-lowest team, the Indiana Pacers. TIP-INS Pelicans: Davis was held below 13 points for only the second time this season. The first came in an October loss at Portland, when he played only 5 minutes and scored two points before leaving with a knee injury. ... New Orleans missed is first eight shots of the second half and finished with a season-low 33 points over the final two quarters. ... Darius Miller made 3 of 4 beyond the arc and ended with 17 points.

"NEW YORK --  The news about Kawhi Leonard was bad, though at least there's some consolation for the San Antonio Spurs. The way LaMarcus Aldridge is playing, they might be able to hang on until their other star forward gets back. Aldridge scored 34 points and the Spurs responded to the latest absence of Leonard by beating the Brooklyn Nets 100-95 on Wednesday night. ""L.A. is the reason we've kept a pretty good record and stayed in the hunt with so many injuries, in-and-outs, Kawhi and Tony (Parker) being gone so long,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""It's L.A. every night. Maybe somebody else will step up with him, but he's been a warrior for sure. We'd be in deep kimchi if he isn't playing the way he is."" The Spurs announced earlier Wednesday that Leonard would be out indefinitely so he can continue rehabilitating from the right thigh injury that forced him to miss the start of the season. ""We didn't feel he was ready. His confidence level wasn't there, so we decided to give it some more time,"" Popovich said. They were fine without him Wednesday, thanks also to Patty Mills' seven 3-pointers and 25 points, and Pau Gasol's 13 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. ""It was one of those things that we got told this morning and it was like, we can't do anything about it, we can't control it, so this is the group,"" Mills said. ""We don't know how long he's going to be out for, but this is our group and we've got go and get the job done."" Mills combined with Aldridge on the most important moment of the game, a three-point play for Aldridge with 53 seconds remaining on a pass from the reserve guard after the Nets had cut a 17-point deficit to three. Allen Crabbe scored 20 points and Joe Harris had 18 for the Nets, who lost their third straight. ""Obviously they get the ball to Aldridge and Gasol and then they obviously make plays to their shooters off the post-up actions, and Patty Mills had a great day today as well,"" Nets point guard Spencer Dinwiddie said. Mills went 5 for 5 off the bench in the first half, all 3-pointers, and finished with the most 3-pointers by a Spurs player this season. TIP-INS Spurs: San Antonio was also without Manu Ginobili because of a bruised right thigh. ... Ginobili and Davis Bertans had shared the Spurs' high of six 3-pointers in a game this season. Nets: Brooklyn has lost five straight at home. ... The Nets have dropped the last six meetings. KAWHI'S CONCERNS Leonard has played in just nine games after missing the beginning of the season because of right quadriceps tendinopathy. He also was sidelined briefly because of a shoulder injury. Popovich said Leonard hadn't sustained another injury, but also didn't seem confident in his ability to play at the level that had him finishing third in the voting for NBA MVP last season. ""He didn't reinjure it or anything but he was having pain, but not right after games, but maybe the next day at noon or that kind of thing and so the pain wasn't dissipating,"" Popovich said. ""It wasn't going in the right direction, it was going the other way and you've got to be confident in your body to go out there and play at the level that he's expected to play."" POPOVICH ON ...

"TORONTO --  The Toronto Raptors have done a good job of avoiding lengthy losing streaks this season. The struggling Detroit Pistons, meanwhile, are paying the price for making a habit of slow starts. Jonas Valanciunas had 17 points and 16 rebounds, C.J. Miles scored 21 points and the Raptors beat the Pistons 96-91 Wednesday night. Kyle Lowry scored 18 points and DeMar DeRozan had 17 to help the Raptors avoid their first three game losing streak of the season. Toronto lost at home to Golden State last Saturday before losing at Philadelphia on Monday. ""We don't even want to lose two games in a row,"" DeRozan said. ""Tonight was one of those games where it could have made it three. We had to buckle down and understand we had to get back to protecting home court."" The Raptors improved to 16-3 at home, the second-best record in the league behind San Antonio (19-2). Toronto has not lost back-to-back games at Air Canada Centre since last Jan. 22 and 24, when they lost to Phoenix and the Spurs. Andre Drummond had 25 points and 17 rebounds but the Pistons fell behind by 13 in the first quarter and lost for the seventh time in eight road games. Avery Bradley scored 19 points, Tobias Harris had 12 and Langston Galloway 11 for the Pistons, who have lost seven of 10 overall. ""In the last three quarters we fought hard but the first quarter counts, and there's just not very many times when we play a good defensive first quarter,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""It's disappointing, you're working out of that hole."" The Raptors led by as many as 15 in the first half but trailed 79-75 early in the fourth quarter before rallying. Toronto took the lead for good on a layup by Miles at 6:43, the first basket in a 10-2 spurt that gave the Raptors a 90-83 lead with 4:47 left. Van Gundy was frustrated by a pair of defensive miscues that gave Lowry and Miles 3-point opportunities during the pivotal stretch. ""When it was winning time, we didn't do our job,"" Van Gundy said. Bradley started for Detroit after missing Tuesday's practice because of a sore right groin, the same injury that kept him out of the final seven games in December. Following the game, Bradley said he is set to visit a specialist in Philadelphia on Thursday. DeRozan scored 10 points in the first and Miles had seven as Toronto led 31-18 after one. Detroit shot 6 for 20 in the first quarter and then made 14 of 25 attempts in the second and took advantage of nine Raptors turnovers to pull to 54-51 at halftime. Drummond scored 11 of Detroit's 22 points in the third quarter. The score was tied 73-73 heading to the fourth. ""We made it complicated on ourselves but we've got to give Detroit credit,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. They were really getting into us, getting after us and doing something a little different defensively that threw our rhythm off a bit with their traps."" TIP-INS Pistons: F Stanley Johnson (strained right hip flexor) missed his third straight game. ... Guard Luke Kennard was available but did not play.

"CHICAGO --  When the Splash Brothers are making their shots, even Kevin Durant is content with a supporting role. Such is life for the Golden State Warriors. Klay Thompson scored 38 points, Stephen Curry added 30 and the Warriors beat the Chicago Bulls 119-112 on Wednesday night for their franchise record-tying 14th straight road win. ""It was an old-school Splash Brother game,"" coach Steve Kerr said. The ""Splash Brothers"" nickname for Thompson and Curry has faded in prominence since Durant joined the duo before last season, but the sharpshooting guards can still put on a show. Thompson was 7 for 13 from 3-point range and Curry was 6 for 11 from behind the arc; no other player made a 3 for the Warriors. ""When they got it going like that, you just play your role and know your place, man,"" Durant said. Durant had 19 points, eight rebounds and seven assists as Golden State moved into a tie for the third-longest road winning streak in a season in NBA history. The Los Angeles Lakers hold the record with 16 straight road wins during the 1971-72 season. Next up for the NBA-leading Warriors (37-9) is a prime-time showdown with Houston on Saturday in the finale of a five-game trip. ""It's going to be a very tough game Saturday, probably the toughest of the trip,"" Thompson said, ""and if we could go undefeated on this road trip that would be incredible."" Nikola Mirotic scored 24 points for Chicago, which dropped to 14-8 since its 3-20 start. Robin Lopez scored 12 of his 16 points in the first half, and Kris Dunn also had 16. ""We played three quarters of really good basketball, but you take one off against a team like this, you're not going to win,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. The Warriors played without Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala due to injuries, and Jordan Bell sprained his left ankle when he challenged Lopez's dunk on the Bulls' first possession. Bell stayed down for a while and then was helped to his feet. He tried to put pressure on his leg and grimaced before he opted for a wheelchair ride off the court. The 23-year-old Bell was selected by the Bulls in the second round of the June draft and then dealt to the Warriors for financial considerations. X-rays were negative, but he was using crutches and a walking boot after the win and will have an MRI on Thursday. ""It was definitely way worse than a normal sprain,"" Bell said. ""Like I said, I thought I broke it."" Thompson and Curry led the way as Golden State outscored Chicago 32-12 in the third quarter to open a 95-78 lead. Curry made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 9:23 left in the period, sparking a 19-0 run for the Warriors. The Bulls made a late charge, closing to 112-107 on Dunn's fast-break dunk with 2:55 left. Dunn landed awkwardly on the play and his face slammed into the floor. He was being evaluated for a possible concussion after the loss. The NBA champion Warriors responded with Thompson's driving layup and a three-point play for Durant. Thompson also made two foul shots with 17.4 seconds left to help Golden State secure the win. LaVINE'S NIGHT Bulls guard Zach LaVine had five points on 2-for-12 shooting in his third game of the season after recovering from left knee surgery. He has been on a minutes restriction, but the plan is to re-evaluate the situation at this point for possible extended action. ""We'll get together with the medical staff tomorrow and we'll map out a plan moving forward for the next week,"" Hoiberg said. ""He feels great and I think had a great first three games for us."" TIP-INS Warriors: Green is dealing with right shoulder soreness, and Iguodala has a bruised left calf. ... F Omri Casspi played for the first time in a week after being sidelined by lower back soreness. Casspi was available for Golden State's win at Cleveland, but Kerr held him out. ""I wasn't comfortable playing him yet, because he hadn't really played enough with that bad back,"" Kerr said. ""I'm a little sensitive to bad backs. I wanted him to get a good workout (on Tuesday)."" Bulls: Hoiberg had lunch with Kerr after he got the job with Chicago. ""I think the world of Steve,"" said Hoiberg, who is in his third season with the Bulls. ""He's been great to me since I've been in the league."" ... The Bulls lost 143-94 at Golden State in their first meeting of the season on Nov. 24.","400975403"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  In a pivotal moment, a rookie got the best of a veteran, stemming a late rally by the New York Knicks. Courtney Lee got a technical foul while jawing with Memphis rookie Dillon Brooks, setting up three pivotal free throws by Tyreke Evans in the Grizzlies' 105-99 win Wednesday night. The Knicks, who had trailed by 18 in the third quarter, were within 102-99 when the teams set up for a jump ball with 17.8 seconds remaining. That's when Lee and Brooks began talking smack. After a warning from official Derrick Stafford, Lee was called for a technical. That led to a free throw by Evans to extend Memphis' lead. Two more free throws from Evans, who finished with 23 points and 10 assists, provided the final margin. ""I'm lost for words,"" Lee said. ""I wasn't expecting to get a tech like that."" He later added: ""I wasn't even talking to (Stafford). I was talking to the rookie and nothing was even said that should have even been a technical foul. I've been in this league 10 years. I've heard every combo with somebody being heated. ... I've heard 10 times way worse things than what was said between me and (Brooks)."" The technical foul thwarted a fourth-quarter rally that came close to erasing a Memphis lead that was still at double figures with six minutes left. Three-pointers from Lee and Tim Hardaway Jr. made a significant dent in the Grizzlies advantage. Lee's 3-pointer with 48.5 seconds left set the stage for the stretch. Memphis had shot well and dominated throughout the first three quarters, still shooting 51 percent while carrying an 88-73 lead into the fourth. All that despite missing Marc Gasol due to illness. JaMychal Green added 18 points and 13 rebounds, while Brooks and Jarell Martin added 17 points each to help Memphis win its second straight. Kristaps Porzingis led the Knicks with 21 points, while Enes Kanter finished with 20, including 18 in the first half. Lee and Michael Beasley had 18 points each. Besides Gasol, Memphis continued to be without starting point guard Mike Conley and forward Chandler Parsons, both dealing with long-term injuries. TIP-INS Knicks: Have lost seven straight road games in Memphis. New York's last road win against the Grizzlies was in March 2011. ... Lee converted a free throw with 5:05 left in the second quarter -- his 45th straight, setting a franchise record. Chris Duhon held the record of 44, set during the 2008-09 season. Lee now has 48 straight. ... Television analyst and former Knicks star Walt Frazier took a ball to the face in the first half. He never missed a play and returned after treatment at halftime. Grizzlies: Memphis also was without F/C Brandan Wright due to illness. ... With Gasol out, Deyonta Davis started the first game of his career. ... The Grizzlies, who beat the Lakers on Monday, had not won consecutive games since Oct. 26-28.","400975404"
"MILWAUKEE --  Something got into Hassan Whiteside on Wednesday night, and there wasn't much the Milwaukee Bucks could do about it. Whiteside had a season-high 27 points along with 13 rebounds and six blocks to lead the Miami Heat over the Bucks 106-101. Whiteside, averaging 13.8 points coming in, shot 10 for 12 and got his 600th career block in the third quarter. He also forced a crucial jump ball late in the fourth. ""He was a monster tonight,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""You could see it from his very first block. You could see it from his very first over-the-top rebound in traffic, and you could see it from his very first drive that he was playing with a different aggressiveness."" Goran Dragic and Kelly Olynyk added 15 points apiece to help Miami rebound from a loss at Chicago on Monday that snapped the Heat's season-best seven-game winning streak. Olynyk scored 10 points in the final quarter to help his team avoid back-to-back losses for the first time since Dec. 3 (Golden State) and Dec. 6 (San Antonio). Khris Middleton had 25 points to lead Milwaukee, which lost to Miami for the second time in four days. Giannis Antetokounmpo added 22 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Bucks, who lost 97-79 at Miami on Sunday. Miami used a 7-0 run late to take control. Whiteside, whose previous season best was 26 points, slammed home an alley-oop dunk to begin the run, and it was capped by two free throws from James Johnson for a 100-93 lead with 2:34 remaining. Two free throws by Middleton got Milwaukee to 102-98 with 43 seconds to go. But then after a missed shot by Miami's Justise Winslow on the next possession, the loose ball was grabbed by both Antetokounmpo and Whiteside, which led to the jump ball. ""There really wasn't a plan,"" Whiteside said. ""I was surprised they called a jump ball. I felt like I had the ball."" Whiteside did not need a plan. The jump ball was at the Miami free-throw line and Antetokounmpo swatted it out of bounds under the Heat basket. That led to two free throws by Dragic for a 104-98 lead with 12 seconds left. ""He tried to win the tip but just hit it a little bit too hard,"" Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. ""And that pretty much is the game."" Middleton answered with a 3-pointer to trim the deficit to 104-101 with 10.6 seconds remaining before Wayne Ellington clinched it with two free throws with 9.5 seconds left. TIP-INS Heat: Starter Tyler Johnson did not play after he sprained his left ankle in the third quarter Monday. ... Miami has three more road games left on a five-game trip. Bucks: The team already has lost three home games this month after suffering a total of three of them in November and December. NOT TODAY Johnson wanted to play so badly he stopped by Spoelstra's office before the game. ""He's a psycho,"" Spoelstra said. ""I told him, `not a chance.' He was doing treatment all afternoon. ... We all got a good laugh out of it. I think he was being serious, but no chance."" QUIRKY SCHEDULE Milwaukee not only is facing Miami for the second time in four days, the Bucks played Washington on Monday for the second time in 10 days. Milwaukee also battled Toronto in a five-day span and Indiana in a six-day span in early January. ""This isn't something new,"" Kidd said. ""This is the way the schedules have been and it's just the way it falls.""","400975405"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Carmelo Anthony is getting comfortable in his new role. He scored 27 points to help the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Los Angeles Lakers 114-90 on Wednesday night. Anthony became one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history by playing mostly isolation ball, but coach Billy Donovan has asked him to become more of a catch-and-shoot scorer. It worked in this one -- the 33-year-old forward made 10 of 15 shots overall and shot 4 of 6 on 3-pointers in one of his best performances of the season. ""Once you accept something, regardless of what it is, you become comfortable with it,"" he said. ""I think you start putting your all into it and you start working on that role and on that acceptance and it's becomes fun. I think right now, I accepted that role early in December and the game is starting to become fun again. Fun for me and fun for us as a team."" Steven Adams had 21 points and 10 rebounds and Russell Westbrook added 19 points and seven assists for the Thunder, who won their third straight. The Thunder shot 48 percent overall and outrebounded the Lakers 54-30. ""They just big-boyed us,"" rookie Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma said. ""Steven Adams, we couldn't stop him from getting rebounds today. He was the head of the snake in that department."" Lakers rookie point guard Lonzo Ball sat out his second straight game with a sore left knee. The Lakers are 0-8 when he doesn't play, and they have scored fewer than 100 points in six of those games. The injury news got worse for the Lakers. Kuzma left with a finger joint sprain and did not return, and forward Kentavious Caldwell-Pope left with a right Achilles tendon strain and did not return. ""Just play as a team defensively, just be solid,"" Kuzma said. ""There's got to be a lot of team basketball."" Seven of Adams' rebounds were on the offensive end. The Thunder have gotten used to him bailing them out. ""We can take any shot that we want because he will go get it,"" Thunder forward Paul George said. ""We feel that. Russ feels that, Melo feels that. It puts us in a better rhythm knowing there is a guy that, whether it is a good or bad shot that we take, it's possible to get an offensive basket anyways by Steven. It allows us to be more aggressive. There is not many guys that physically can match him. He is in a category of his own."" Julius Randle scored all 16 of his points in the first half for the Lakers. The Thunder led 60-54 at halftime behind 16 points from Anthony and 14 from Adams. Westbrook had just two points until scoring eight in the final three minutes of the second quarter. Oklahoma City started strong in the second half. A 3-pointer by George bumped the lead to 11, and a 3-point play by Westbrook midway through the quarter pushed the margin to 14. Westbrook got Corey Brewer off balance with multiple crossover dribbles before blowing by him for a layup that gave the Thunder an 86-70 lead. A 3-pointer by Anthony made it 91-70 and forced the Lakers to call timeout late in the third quarter. The Thunder controlled the game the rest of the way. ""They just hit shots,"" Kuzma said. ""We didn't really defend them too well. They've got a lot of good players."" TIP-INS Lakers: F Brandon Ingram returned after missing a game with a mild left ankle sprain. He had eight points in 26 minutes. ... Shot 55 percent from the field in the first half, but just 47 percent in the game. ... Caldwell-Pope scored 10 points in 15 minutes. He was one of two Lakers to score in double figures. Thunder: Boxer Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather attended the game. ... G Andre Roberson returned after missing eight games with left patellar tendinitis. He finished with four points and three steals in 17 minutes.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Donovan Mitchell had another big game and added to his growing list of spectacular dunks with a one-handed jam in the third quarter. Still, coach Quin Snyder had a little critique for the rookie. Mitchell's defense could still use some work, says Snyder. Not that it mattered much for Utah on Wednesday night, when Mitchell scored 23 of his 34 points in the second half to lift the Jazz over the Sacramento Kings 120-105. ""He played very well tonight,"" Snyder said. ""There were a number of things on the defensive end that he's going to hear about. He's gotta keep getting better in every aspect of the game. That's what he wants to do."" Rodney Hood had 25 points and eight rebounds, Joe Ingles added 14 points and Derrick Favors had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Utah won for only the fifth time in 20 games. Ingles made three 3-pointers in the third quarter when Utah scored 36 points to break open a tight game. He later added an assist with a blind backward pass over his shoulder that led to Jonas Jerebko's dunk. Mitchell, who set a franchise rookie record with 41 points against New Orleans on Dec. 1, provided the game's signature moment 30 seconds later. Utah's outstanding rookie split a pair of defenders at the arc, then drove in for a dazzling, uncontested dunk. Mitchell scored the next six points for Utah, and Hood added six straight to make it 85-67. ""He's ultra-athletic,"" Hood said of Mitchell. ""When he gets in the lane, we want him finishing like that. Before long, people will start giving him respect and they'll spread when he goes to the lane. We need him to keep doing that."" Mitchell said the dunk had extra meaning for him. ""I fed off of this one just because somebody in the crowd was talking and I heard them the entire time,"" Mitchell said. ""Usually I don't let that get to me, but when you're up by that and we're all playing well it's easy to think about other things."" Mitchell, the 13th overall pick by Denver before being traded to Utah, finished 14 of 19 from the floor with three assists. He scored 12 points in the fourth quarter for the Jazz, who have won four straight in Sacramento. ""What a stud,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""He's playing in an open system with a stretch four so he's got some space to attack. He gets to any spot he wants on the floor."" Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 25 points and Willie Cauley-Stein had 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Kings. George Hill added 20 points and Zach Randolph had 12 for Sacramento. The Kings have lost six straight and 10 of 13. The Jazz trailed by 10 early in the first quarter but closed the period on a 15-3 run and went up 23-21 on Hood's buzzer-beating 3-pointer. Ingles beat the shot clock buzzer with a 23-foot jumper midway through the second and added a 3-pointer that extended Utah's lead to 44-35. Hood's third 3 put the Jazz up by 10 at halftime. DUNK CONTEST FOR DONOVAN Mitchell is getting a lot of push to be in this year's dunk contest during the All-Star break, but the rookie isn't sure if he'll be part of the festivities in Los Angeles. ""I'd love to do that, but there are a lot of guys in the league who have bounce, who have dunk-contest bounce as opposed to game bounce,"" Mitchell said. ""People don't understand, they're two different things. You could do tricks in the dunk contest that you can't do in the game. I would enjoy it."" TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell has scored 30 or more in five games this season. ... Favors had 10 of Utah's 17 rebounds in the first half, including all five offensive rebounds. ... Thabo Sefolosha sat out his second consecutive game with a sprained right knee. Kings: De'Aaron Fox fouled out late in the fourth quarter. He had six points and four assists. ...

"LOS ANGELES --  Credit the Goon Squad with a big assist. The Clippers' bench narrowed a 10-point deficit to one heading into the fourth quarter, and Los Angeles hung on for a 109-104 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night. Blake Griffin had 20 points and 12 rebounds, Montrezl Harrell added 18 points and Lou Williams had 17 for the Clippers in their season-high sixth straight win. Los Angeles is 12-3 in its last 15 games, tied with Golden State for the NBA's best record over that span. ""They were huge,"" Griffin said of the reserves. ""We rely on them heavily. This team trusts each other. That's what happens when everybody gets a touch, gets a shot."" The Clippers were just 7 of 14 from the free-throw line over the final 3:09, but escaped with the help of last-second turnovers by Will Barton and Wilson Chandler. The Nuggets had 21 turnovers. ""That's back-to-back nights where defenses have turned up the pressure, turned up the heat and we have not handled it well,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. Gary Harris scored 19 points in the Nuggets' fifth straight road loss. Nikola Jokic added 18 points, Barton had 17 points and Mason Plumlee had 16 points and 14 rebounds. The Nuggets led by five early in the fourth, but the Clippers scored eight straight points, including five by Wesley Johnson, to go up 90-87. ""This team is a physical, tough team,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We have a bunch of young guys who are hungry. They're trying to create a career."" Neither team led by more than seven points the rest of the game. Clinging to a 99-98 lead, Harrell missed a pair of free throws, shaking his head as he backed away from the line. He got fouled twice more in succession and made 3 of 4, extending the lead to 102-98. Harrell came up with a block on Plumlee at the other end, and Johnson hit a 3-pointer, making it 105-98. ""It was big for us. I made him drive it and go wide,"" Harrell said. ""We just kept fighting."" Denver got to 106-104 on four straight points by Harris and two free throws from Barton. ""We're getting to a spot of being a little more consistent in those moments, but ultimately guys are still learning,"" Nuggets forward Richard Jefferson said. ""Most of the guys who are in these positions are in these positions for the first time."" The Nuggets ran off 11 straight points for a 79-69 lead in the third only to blow all of it. The Clippers answered with their own 11-0 spurt, including consecutive 3-pointers by Tyrone Wallace and Harrell, to lead 80-79. Emmanuel Mudiay's basket sent Denver into the fourth leading 81-80. HE SAID IT ""If teams are watching us, they're just going to ratchet up the pressure and watch us turn the ball over and self-implode."" -- Malone. BACK TO BACK The Nuggets fell to 2-7 in the second game of a back-to-back. They were coming off a win over Dallas on Tuesday. They've won just one back-to-back this season. Jefferson, a 17-year veteran, said his younger teammates need to realize intensity is going to increase in the second half and they can't play with the same focus they do in the first half. ""Instead of a nine-point lead, it goes to a tie game,"" he said, ""and now you're playing off a back-to-back, you lost your cushion and you've energized them for no reason.""

"Joel Embiid puts on a show scoring 26 points as the Sixers beat the Kyrie Irving-less Celtics 89-80. (2:18) BOSTON -- Joel Embiid is headed to the NBA All-Star game for the first time, and he celebrated with another impressive performance. Embiid scored 26 points and matched a career best with 16 rebounds, leading the 76ers to an 89-80 win over the Boston Celtics on Thursday night. Dario Saric scored 16 for Philadelphia, which won for the sixth time in seven games. T.J. McConnell had 15 points -- all in the second half. Just one week after Boston erased a 22-point deficit on its way to a 114-103 victory over Philadelphia in London, the Sixers led by as many as 21 and turned away one last rally by the Celtics down the stretch. ""We knew that it was going to be the same team. It wasn't going to be any new plays,"" Embiid said. ""We were just physical. Last time they played us when they had that comeback, they were more physical than us. So tonight I think we were more physical than them."" Boston played without All-Star guard Kyrie Irving, who rested a sore left shoulder. Al Horford and Marcus Morris each scored 14 points. After winning seven in a row, Boston has lost two straight. ""I don't want to take anything away from Philadelphia,"" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. ""They certainly made us look poor. If you're not going to own your own space, then you're going to turn the ball over."" The Celtics had no answer for Embiid, who was 10 for 19 from the floor and 6 of 7 at the foul line. He also had six assists and blocked two shots. The Sixers forced 19 turnovers and outrebounded the Celtics 41-31 while avoiding a season sweep. ""It's been a trend for us the last two games. For whatever reason, we've been sloppy on offense,"" Horford said. ""Other teams are putting pressure on us and speeding us up a little bit and we're not handling it too well."" Marcus Smart scored 13 and Jaylen Brown had 12 points for Boston. Embiid scored 10 in the third quarter and McConnell had nine points in the period, helping the Sixers pull away. Jayson Tatum's 3-pointer with 2:01 remaining trimmed Philadelphia's lead to 86-79, but Boston's rally fizzled from there. PLAYOFFS? Halfway through the season, much-improved Philadelphia (21-20) is in playoff contention. The Sixers are coming off wins against the top two teams in the Eastern Conference this week in Toronto (30-13) and Boston (34-12). ""We feel like we're right there with them,"" Embiid said. ""I don't know what seed we're going to be, but that's a potential matchup in the playoffs, so you always want to come out and like try to dominate, let them know that it's not going to be easy."" ALL-STAR INDEED Embiid pulled down 16 rebounds for the third time in his career. He got the news earlier Thursday that he was the first Philadelphia player selected as an All-Star starter since Allen Iverson in the 2010-2011 season. Embiid is the first Sixers All-Star since Jrue Holiday in 2013. ""I'm just very proud of him,"" coach Brett Brown said.

"CLEVELAND --  There was none of the usual postgame chatter or music in the Cavaliers locker room. The mood was somber and quiet, not the same place. ""Right now we're in Strugglesville,"" LeBron James said. ""But it felt like a win. We needed it. Definitely."" Isaiah Thomas made two free throws with 11 seconds left and Cleveland came up with a defensive stop in the frantic final seconds after blowing a 23-point lead to beat the Orlando Magic 104-103 on Thursday night and snap a four-game losing streak. After Thomas made his shots, Orlando's Elfrid Payton missed a contested layup with three seconds left. The three officials ruled there was an inadvertent whistle and held a jump ball at midcourt. Magic forward Aaron Gordon grabbed the toss and sank a 45-footer as the horn sounded and Cleveland's crowd shrieked in disbelief. But Gordon committed a jump-ball violation with the move and Cleveland only had to inbound the ball to come away with a victory following a crazy and exhausting final sequence that left everyone dazed. ""No, I don't,"" said Thomas when asked if he knew what happened. ""It was a lot of back and forth. I'm just glad we just came out with the win."" James committed six turnovers and went 2 of 8 from the free-throw line but closed in on 30,000 career points, Thomas scored 21 and came through in crunch time and the Cavs got their fourth win in 13 games. However, some of the same problems -- defensive lapses, stagnant offense -- that have plagued the Cavs for much of the season resurfaced in the second half, when Orlando outscored Cleveland 56-37. ""Obviously we know we've been struggling as of late,"" James said. ""We're just trying to figure out how we can put two halves together. Obviously we had a great first half on Monday (against Golden State), great first half today and the same result. So we've got to keep pushing, keep watching film and seeing ways we can be better."" James scored 16 and now needs 25 to become the seventh player in NBA history to reach 30,000. He'll likely reach the plateau on Saturday when Cleveland hosts Oklahoma City. The Cavs were rolling to a rare, easy win before they went cold from the outside and were outscored 33-17 in the third quarter by the Magic, who have dropped 17 of 19.  Cleveland went 1 for 17 on 3-pointers in the second half. Payton scored 19 and Gordon 17 for Orlando, which felt a few calls should have gone their way in the final seconds. Thomas was sent to the line with 11 seconds left when referee Kane Fitzgerald called a foul on Orlando's Shelvin Mack. Magic coach Frank Vogel felt Mack had tied up Thomas to force a jump ball. ""I'm disappointed for our guys,"" Vogel said. ""I felt like they deserved the victory. We didn't get the breaks down the stretch."" ROSE RETURNS Cavs guard Derrick Rose returned after missing more than two months with ankle injuries and scored nine points in 13 minutes. Rose deepens Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue's rotation and the former league MVP gives the Cavs another proven scorer. ""I thought he looked pretty good,"" James said. ""For as long as he's been out, can't ask for much. He gave us everything he had. Defensively he was in tune, offensively he made some great moves."" CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN Before the game, James was chosen as one of the captains for this year's All-Star game after receiving the most votes in balloting by fans, players and media.

"HOUSTON --  Eric Gordon scored in a variety of ways Thursday night. One shot stood out from the rest. Gordon banked in a half-court heave at the end of the third quarter, part of a 30-point performance that helped the Houston Rockets to a 116-98 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""When I shot it, I thought it was going to go in somehow,"" Gordon said. ""It looked good from that distance, but it was good to get that one to go in. It felt good to knock down a shot like that."" Gordon connected from a step behind the half-court line, sending Houston to the fourth with an 89-70 lead. After hitting the shot under heavy pressure from Andrew Wiggins, Gordon gave a high-five to Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, who was sitting courtside near the play. James Harden returned to the Rockets' lineup after missing seven games with a left hamstring strain. He finished with 10 points on 3-for-15 shooting, and added seven assists, two steals and two blocks in 26 minutes. Houston went 4-3 in his absence. ""Other than missing a lot of shots that I normally make, I thought I was active, especially, defensively,"" Harden said. ""I was trying to create opportunities and get guys involved, and obviously, those guys had great games tonight."" Chris Paul had 19 points, nine assists and six rebounds for the Rockets, and Clint Capela added 20 points. Houston has won 15 of the past 17 meetings with Minnesota, including a 10-game winning streak at home. Gordon made 11 of 19 shots, including 7 of 13 from 3-point range. He fell just short of his season-high 33 points against Utah on Dec. 18. With Rockets small forward Trevor Ariza sitting out the first part of a two-game suspension for a postgame locker room incident Monday night in Los Angeles, Luc Mbah a Moute got the start and scored 14 points in 32 minutes. Along with Ariza, reserve guard Gerald Green also served the first of a two-game suspension for the altercation with the Clippers. ""When we get the guys back, we can get there, but it's just the matter of, can we get the same mentality when we get everybody together, can we defend and have a force that's championship level?"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We'll see."" Jimmy Butler led Minnesota with 23 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns added 22 points, 16 rebounds and five blocks. Wiggins finished with 16 points. The Timberwolves struggled to contain Houston's 3-point shooting. The Rockets hit 17 of 39 from beyond the arc while improving to 24-4 when making at least 15 3s. Minnesota has lost back-to-back games following a five-game winning streak. ""Things can change very quickly in this league,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We've slipped, we've got to play with more of an edge, and we've got to bounce back. The games keep coming."" ALL-STAR HARDEN Harden was voted a starter for the NBA All-Star Game for the second straight year. Harden also replaced Kobe Bryant in the starting lineup in both 2014 and 2015. Harden has been named an All-Star in each of his six seasons with the Rockets, trailing only Hakeem Olajuwon (12 appearances) and Yao Ming (eight appearances). ""That's some great company right there,"" Harden said. ""It's an honor and it's something that I never take for granted."" CP3 STEALS By picking off a bad pass from Jeff Teague, Paul earned his 1,958th steal, passing Derek Harper to move into 13th place on the NBA's career steals list. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Towns fell one block shy of his career high, which he has accomplished three times. ... Former Rockets PG Aaron Brooks and C Cole Aldrich did not play in the game. Rockets: Rookie C Zhou Qi was sidelined by a right elbow injury despite participating in pregame warmups.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Portland's home court was once one of the NBA's toughest for visitors -- but was a source of frustration for the Trail Blazers earlier this season. But they appear to have their home mojo back, as the Blazers won their fifth consecutive home game Thursday night, beating the Indiana Pacers 100-86. Damian Lillard scored 26 points and Jusuf Nurkic had 19 points and a season-high 17 rebounds to lead Portland (24-21). C.J. McCollum scored 16 points and Shabazz Napier 13 for the Blazers. Just six weeks ago, the Blazers lost six consecutive games during a late-November, early December stretch. But starting Dec. 28 with a victory over Philadelphia, Portland has returned to its winning ways in Moda Center. ""Overall our team has just locked in a little bit more,"" Lillard said. ""We had a rough stretch. We're not the first team or the last team that'll have that. The important thing when you have times like that is to stay together and stay with it. I think we're just in a better place on the floor as a group."" Several wins during this streak looked like Thursday's, a game in which Portland had most of the answers during the fourth quarter. Tied at 74 after three quarters, the Blazers outscored Indiana 26-12 during the final period to pull out the win. ""In the third quarter, I thought we gave them a lot of opportunities,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""In the fourth quarter, it was good to see the lead expand without having very many mistakes."" Portland took control late in the third quarter, when the Blazers held Indiana scoreless for more than five minutes. It was part of Portland's 21-2 run, during which Shabazz Napier scored eight points to help erase a six-point deficit and give the Blazers an 89-76 lead midway through the fourth quarter. Napier kick-started the rally during the final seconds of the third quarter, when he made a backcourt steal, then hit a corner 3-pointer as time expired to tie the game at 74. Victor Oladipo and Darren Collison scored 23 points each for Indiana (24-21). Indiana coach Nate McMillan had an eye on the stat sheet in assessing what went wrong for the Pacers. Portland outrebounded Indiana 57-46, and scored 24 second-chance points to the Pacers' 10. ""That's the hustle game you have to win,"" McMillan said. ""We have to give help to our bigs down in the paint. They outworked us, and won that game."" Nurkic had one of his most productive games as a Blazer, missing his career high by three rebounds. Nurkic got going early, hitting his first three shots during the first five minutes. Stotts said he didn't recall running plays for Nurkic, saying he was doing it all on effort. ""When he got in the paint, he was finishing early,"" Lillard said of Nurkic. ""He played strong. Even on the defensive end, he was contesting shots at the rim. . When he plays that way on both ends, we're a much better team."" Indiana was without forward Myles Turner, the team's second-leading scorer this season. Turner has missed five consecutive games with a right elbow injury. McCollum sprinted from the floor to the locker room early in the fourth quarter with a brief bout of nausea, but returned a few minutes later. Portland led 52-47 at halftime, and the difference was a pair of buzzer-beaters: McCollum's 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter, and Lillard's desperation layup off a drive to finish the second quarter. TIP-INS Pacers: The last time Indiana won in Portland was Nov. 28, 2007. ... Of the 12 games Turner has missed this season, two came against Portland. ... Lance Stephenson missed the team's morning shootaround with an illness, but played. He finished with no points on 0-of-6 shooting from the floor and missed both of his foul shots. ... Indiana is 2-1 on its current five-game road trip, having won at Phoenix and Utah. Trail Blazers: Led by 12 boards from Nurkic, Portland outrebounded Indiana 29-18 in the first half. ... Nurkic had a double-double in the first half with 12 points and 12 rebounds. ... Portland swept the season series from Indiana for the third time in four seasons. The Blazers won 114-96 over the Pacers on Oct. 20. ... Al-Farouq Aminu is averaging 13 points and 10 rebounds in his last four games against Indiana. MAKING UP FOR POOR SHOOTING Portland won despite shooting just 39.4 percent from the floor (37 of 94), and 31.2 percent from 3-point range (10 of 32). Only once has Portland shot worse and won a game this season. The Blazers made up for it in other ways, like free throw shooting. They were 16 of 16, the third time they've been perfect from the line in a game this season, an NBA high. The Blazers also converted 14 offensive rebounds into 24 second-chance points.","400975412"
"TORONTO --  Kyle Lowry turned in his best game since returning from injury, turning it on in the fourth quarter to help his Toronto Raptors grind out another home win. Lowry scored nine of his 24 points in the final period, DeMar DeRozan added 21 and the Raptors beat San Antonio 86-83 on Friday night to snap a four-game losing streak against the Spurs. Jonas Valanciunas had 15 points and 11 rebounds as the Raptors improved to 17-3 at home, the second-best home record in the NBA behind San Antonio's mark of 19-2. Lowry made eight of 16 shots, going 4 of 9 from 3-point range, in his third game after missing three with a bruised tailbone. Raptors coach Dwane Casey said Lowry looked stronger than he had in his previous two outings. ""I thought he had a lot of bounce,"" Casey said. Lowry got the Raptors off to a quick start, making a 3-pointer on his first shot of the game. ""Just being aggressive,"" he said. ""It's that time of year when everyone is kind of hitting a little bit of a rut, a little bit of a lull. We've got to continue to get better and take the step on the journey to making us a better team."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 17 points and 14 rebounds, Pau Gasol scored 15 points and Patty Mills had 13 as San Antonio lost for the fourth time in six road games. The Spurs are 11-15 away from home. It had been more than two years since Toronto last beat San Antonio. The Raptors won 97-94 at home on Dec. 9, 2015. ""They're a well-rounded group,"" DeRozan said of the Spurs. ""Everybody understands their roles and they play extremely hard."" San Antonio guard Manu Ginobili missed his second straight game because of a sore right thigh. Ginobili returned to Texas after the Spurs won at Brooklyn on Wednesday. The Spurs shot 34 percent, making 31 of 91 attempts. Their season worst was a 33.7 percent showing in an Oct. 27 loss at Orlando. Toronto is 8-0 this season when holding opponents below 90 points. ""It was a tough one, and we couldn't score,"" San Antonio guard Tony Parker said. Parker shot 1 for 9 against the Raptors while Aldridge finished 6 for 25 after missing nine of 11 attempts in the first half. ""My shot just never felt good tonight,"" Aldridge said. The Spurs trailed 70-69 after a 3-pointer by Bryn Forbes at 6:52 of the fourth, but DeRozan and Lowry connected on back-to-back possessions, giving Toronto a 74-69 lead with 5:11 remaining. After a jump shot by Mills, Toronto reeled off a 6-0 run including baskets by Lowry, Valanciunas and DeRozan to lead 80-71 with 2:40 left. Another 3-pointer by Forbes made it 86-83 with six seconds left. DeRozan was fouled but missed both free throws, giving San Antonio a chance to tie, but the Spurs couldn't get a shot off in time. After making seven of 23 shots in the first quarter, the Raptors hit 11 of 20 attempts in the second, including a buzzer-beating jumper from DeRozan that gave Toronto a 44-37 lead at halftime. Toronto led 55-41 on DeRozan's three-point play at 7:33 of the third but Aldridge did all the scoring in an 8-0 Spurs run that cut the gap to 63-60 heading to the fourth. TIP-INS Spurs: Aldridge has 19 double-doubles this season, one more than he had all of last season. ... Kyle Anderson matched his career high with 11 rebounds. Raptors: G Fred VanVleet (right knee) missed his second straight game. ... DeRozan had a team-leading six assists. HOME SWEET HOME After playing nine of their past 11 games on the road, the Spurs will be at home for eight of their next nine, including six straight. ""Going home doesn't guarantee wins but it definitely gives us better mojo, better energy,"" Aldridge said.","400975413"
"NEW YORK --  Down by 16 points early in the second half against the Heat, the Nets dug in on defense. DeMarre Carroll tied a career-high with 26 points, Spencer Dinwiddie had 15 and the Brooklyn beat Miami 101-95 on Friday night. Brooklyn snapped a five-game losing skid at Barclays Center and a seven-game home losing streak to the Heat. The Nets also improved to 11-1 when holding opponents under 100 points this season. The Heat led 64-48 with 8:53 left in the third quarter but scored just five points the rest of the period as Brooklyn closed to within two. ""What were we up by, like 16 or so?"" Miami's Hassan Whiteside said. ""I think that was really the turning point of the game because it should've been over, you know, you up 16 against a team in the third quarter. Shouldn't be no way they come back from that. We've got to do a better job of playing with a lead and it shouldn't have even come down to the fourth quarter."" Whiteside had 21 points and 13 rebounds, and Goran Dragic scored 17 points for the Heat. Caris LeVert and Joe Harris each added 12 points for the Nets. D'Angelo Russell played 14 minutes and went 0-for-5 from the field for Brooklyn in his first action after missing 32 games following left knee surgery. LeVert made an acrobatic layup to give the Nets a 95-91 lead with 57.8 seconds remaining and then made a step-back jumper to ice the game at 97-91. ""I thought Caris and Quincy (Acy) came in the game and changed the energy,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. Carroll hit a 3-pointer from the wing to give Brooklyn an 89-86 lead with 4:19 left. ""There were so many big plays,"" Atkinson said. ""At the end of the day, this is a player's game. DeMarre hits a big three, Caris and Spencer have two big-time drives in the pick-and-roll and we made plays, but more importantly we got stops."" Brooklyn took a 79-77 lead with 8:57 remaining on a corner 3-pointer from LeVert. It was Brooklyn's first lead since the 5:41 mark of the first quarter. Whiteside led Miami with 15 points and eight rebounds at the half as the Heat took a 53-43 lead into the locker room. Carroll led Brooklyn with 11 points at the half. TIP-INS Heat: Coach Erik Spoelstra praised Dragic before the game. ""He means everything to our team. In our eyes, he's having an All-Star season. There's a reason why we are where we are in the East, and he's a big part of it."" ... Isaiah Whitehead (G-League assignment) and Jeremy Lin (ruptured patella tendon) were out for Brooklyn. Nets: Atkinson said Russell will play in short stints as he works his way back from left knee surgery. ...

"DETROIT --  John Wall felt the third quarter wasn't much different from the first two. The Washington Wizards just made more of their open shots. Wall and the Wizards scored 45 points in the third, and although most of their 20-point lead slipped away in the fourth, they were able to hold on for a 122-112 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. Bradley Beal and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 26 points each, and Wall added 16 points and 11 assists. Washington shot 16 of 20 from the field and 6 of 8 from 3-point range in the third. ""It's the same looks we had in the first half,"" Wall said. ""We missed some easy, wide-open 3s early in the first half. In the second half, guys started to knock them down and the floor started to open up a little bit more."" The Pistons trailed 83-63 in the third, but the deficit was down to four in the fourth when Wall made a big 3-pointer to put the Wizards up 107-100. Oubre added a four-point play a short while later to push Washington's lead to nine. Andre Drummond had 14 points, 21 rebounds and eight assists for the Pistons, who have lost four straight. Both teams were struggling coming into the game. The Wizards lost by 24 at Charlotte on Wednesday, and they fell behind by 15 in the first quarter at Detroit. It was tied at 46 at halftime, though. ""Our guys coming off the bench to start the second quarter just were not ready for the pressure that their bench guys brought,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""The third quarter I really don't know what the problem was."" Washington dominated the third. Beal scored 13 points in the period and Wall, who was scoreless in the first half, added 10. ""John is one of the best players in the league,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""He competes. He's been banged up at times and I love his warrior mentality. He's not going to tell the world that he's banged up, he's just going to go out there and compete for his team."" The Wizards led 91-74 after three before Detroit rallied, with substitutes Stanley Johnson, Luke Kennard and Anthony Tolliver helping lead the comeback. TIP-INS Wizards: Beal scored at least 20 points for the 35th time this season. No guard in the Eastern Conference has done it more often. ... Oubre set a career high in scoring. His previous mark was 22 points earlier this season. Pistons: Drummond had 14 rebounds in the first half and played almost the entire second before fouling out. LEUER'S ANKLE Detroit forward Jon Leuer told the Detroit News earlier Friday that he had decided to have season-ending ankle surgery. ""He's tried everything to get back,"" Van Gundy said before the game. ""Did not want to go to the route of anything season-ending, right up to the very last day earlier this week. He gave it everything he could to try to get back."" The 6-foot-10 Leuer has played in only eight games this season. BIG HALF The 76-point second half was the highest-scoring half of the season for the Wizards. They had 73 in the second at Philadelphia on Nov. 29. ""The way we just got whooped the other day, we definitely wanted to come back and get a win,"" Wall said.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies celebrated Zach Randolph's return and then sent him and his new team away with their seventh straight loss. Dillon Brooks scored a career-best 22 points, Ben McLemore had a season-high 21 and the Grizzlies beat the skidding Sacramento Kings 106-88 on Friday night for their third straight victory. The game was a backdrop to Randolph's first return to Memphis since spending eight years as a key figure in the Grizzlies' success. The power forward received a standing ovation when he was introduced with the starting lineups, and the Grizzlies showed a tribute video between the first and second quarters. ""It's emotional, man. It's a great feeling,"" said Randolph, who finished with four points and six rebounds. ""It's home for me. I love the people, and I love this city."" While Randolph was saluted, there wasn't much to celebrate for the Kings outside of holding the Grizzlies to a 10-point second quarter -- the lowest-scoring period of the season for a Sacramento opponent. Otherwise, the Kings were limited to 40 percent shooting and were outrebounded 49-44 while committing 21 turnovers. ""We just had some bad turnovers, unforced turnovers,"" said rookie guard De'Aaron Fox, who had 16 points and six assists to lead the Kings. He said for most of the night, the Grizzlies ""got to their spots, got what they wanted."" It's all part of the growing pains for the Kings as coach Dave Joerger plays youngsters like Fox and fellow rookies Justin Jackson and Bogdan Bogdanovic. Joerger announced earlier this week that he would start sitting veterans on a rotating basis to give more time to the younger players. Bogdanovic and veteran Vince Carter had 15 points apiece against the Grizzlies. ""You can see the progress,"" said Joerger, the former Memphis coach. ""There's positive things that are happening, but there's going to be some inconsistency."" Tyreke Evans added 14 points and six assists for Memphis, while Andrew Harrison finished with 12. McLemore, who had not gotten off the bench in eight of the previous 11 games, was 6 of 13 from the field against Sacramento, where he played four seasons before signing with the Grizzlies in the offseason. The teams were tied 40-all at halftime. But the Grizzlies opened the third quarter with a 22-7 run and the Kings never really threatened the rest of the way. Afterward, Randolph was hugging former teammates, fans, ball boys and arena workers. After dressing, he walked the court signing autographs and posing for pictures. ""It was great,"" said Grizzlies center Marc Gasol, who played alongside Randolph on the Memphis front line. ""It was beautiful. All the fans did a great job of showing Z-Bo how much he meant to the city and the franchise. ""Z-bo got the big night, and we got a great win."" TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento has lost 14 of its last 15 games in Memphis. ... Carter hit five 3-pointers, making him the oldest player in NBA history (40 years, 358 days) to make that many in a game. .

McLemore's previous season high was 17 points against Oklahoma City on Dec. 9. ... Brooks has reached double figures in three straight games. ... Memphis has won four straight home games, tying its longest streak of the season. NO INTROS NECESSARY Randolph wasn't the only one back who had recent ties to Memphis. Carter also played for the Grizzlies last season before signing with the Kings, and Joerger was the Grizzlies' coach until the end of the 2015-16 season.

"Devin Booker knocks down the triple over Jamal Murray and then imitates his celebration after starting a petty war. (0:28) DENVER --  A sturdy plane and a good night's sleep did wonders for the Phoenix Suns. Devin Booker scored 30 points, T.J. Warren had 25 and the Suns defeated the Denver Nuggets 108-100 on Friday night. Josh Jackson and Isaiah Canaan added 16 points apiece off the bench for Phoenix, which snapped a seven-game losing streak to the Nuggets. The Suns benefited from an earlier arrival than their last game in Denver. Mechanical issues delayed their flight for the Jan. 3 game until five hours before the opening tip, and the Nuggets raced to a 134-111 win. Phoenix led that game by two at halftime before fading in the second half. ""To be in that game as long as they were, I was surprised and proud of them,"" Suns center Tyson Chandler said. ""I didn't play and I was falling asleep on the bench. I was exhausted."" The extra night in Denver helped Phoenix to its first win against the Nuggets since Nov. 20, 2015. Jamal Murray scored 30 in his return to the lineup and Nikola Jokic had 14 points and 17 rebounds for Denver. Murray missed Wednesday's game at the Los Angeles Clippers with concussion symptoms. He was evaluated by doctors before the game and cleared to play. Murray was one of the few bright spots for Denver. The Nuggets have lost six of eight, including two at home to teams who combined were 34 games below .500. ""How many times do we need to come in at halftime to talk about effort?"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""As a coach, it's the hardest thing to do that. ""I can't coach effort. I can't make you play hard. I can't draw it up on a board. It's something that you have to bring to the table as a professional athlete every night. We didn't have that collectively."" The Suns grabbed the lead with a 17-3 run to start the second quarter and never trailed again. They led by as many as 15 in the first half, but Murray scored seven straight points to start the third quarter to get Denver within 62-59. Phoenix scored the next 11 points to push the lead to 14. Denver made it 101-97 on a 3-pointer by Jokic and runner by Gary Harris with 3:57 left, but the Nuggets missed their last six shots and the Suns pulled away. ""You're a little concerned, they've got momentum, they're at home, they're starting to come back,"" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. ""We executed pretty good plays and got fouled."" Harris finished with 16 points and Trey Lyles had 15 points and seven rebounds in his second start of the season. TIP-INS Suns: Warren missed the previous two games with lower back soreness. ... F Marquese Chriss missed his fourth straight game with a hip injury. Triano said Chriss might undergo further testing. ""I know that he is concerned,"" Triano said. ""I'm sure he will do what he wants to do."" ... The Suns won on the road for the first time in 2018. Nuggets: G Monte Morris was brought up from the G League but did not dress once Murray cleared the concussion protocol and was able to play. ... Several Colorado Rockies players were on hand during the team's winter caravan. Charlie Blackmon, Chris Rusin, Tony Wolters and manager Bud Black sat courtside. Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller also was courtside. THROWBACK FRIDAY Chandler and Nuggets center Mason Plumlee exchanged hard fouls at the end of the second quarter, evoking memories of the 1990s NBA. Chandler's foul was slightly harder and resulted in a flagrant-1 call, but both players kept their cool. ""It was nothing personal,"" Chandler said. ""He fouled me hard, I fouled him back hard and it ends there."" BLUE BLOODS The Kentucky Wildcats were well-represented in the game. Four of the 10 starters played at least one year for coach John Calipari, including the two leading scorers in the game. ""That's the powerhouse,"" Booker said. ""Calipari knows what he's doing over there. Trey's playing really well now, too. I'm really proud of all of these guys.""","400975417"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Tim Hardaway Jr. had his best game Friday night since returning from a leg injury that sidelined him for more than a month. The New York Knicks needed all of it, too. Hardaway scored 31 points as the Knicks rallied for a 117-115 victory over the Utah Jazz. ""I think I'm just getting accustomed to everything, getting my feet wet, getting my rhythm back,"" he said. ""It's one game. It felt good. Came here yesterday with some of the guys. Got a lot of shots and a lot of reps up in here. Ran up and down a little bit to get our wind. It really helped us out today. That played a huge part in my individual success and in other guys' as well."" Hardaway pulled up for a 3-pointer from the top of the arc and finished the four-point play after a foul, then added a dunk to give the Knicks a 109-100 advantage with 3:21 remaining. The fifth-year guard was 6 for 7 from behind the arc as New York shot 55 percent from 3-point range. ""We were trying to keep him around that 25- to 28-minute range and he was playing really well,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""We debated it at halftime whether we should start him in the second half or bring him off the bench. We decided, `Let's start him and get off to a good start and then try to get him out quicker."" The Jazz missed three straight 3-pointers on one possession with less than 30 seconds left that would have tied the game at 115 after a late 11-2 run that included Joe Johnson's corner 3 and Rudy Gobert's three-point play. Courtney Lee's 13-point third quarter helped the Knicks rebound from a 10-point deficit to take an 85-78 lead into the fourth. Lee and Kristaps Porzingis scored 18 points apiece. ""There were a few actions that they executed well,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We gave up some stuff in transition where we didn't communicate, and our pick-and-roll defense was not where it needed to be. We weren't as aggressive or physical as we needed to be. ... It wasn't any one thing. It was too many things. ""They had too much space and when a player gets going, Hardaway in particular, the basket starts to look really big."" Gobert had 23 points and 14 rebounds in his first game since Dec. 15 due to a sprained knee, but the second-team All-NBA center looked athletic in his return. He also had three blocks. Rodney Hood had 18 points, while Donovan Mitchell and Ricky Rubio each scored 17. The Jazz took a 55-49 lead into halftime thanks to an aggressive Hood, who returned to the starting lineup for the first time in nearly a month. A 16-6 stretch highlighted by a pair of twisting layups from Gobert and Derrick Favors' dunk pushed the margin to 48-38 before the Knicks chipped away right before the break. ""We came out lackadaisical,"" Mitchell said about the second half. ""They came out there fighting and holding us and being aggressive. We just kind of let them do that to a certain extent."" TIP-INS Knicks: Hornacek plans to keep Hardaway on a minutes restriction of about 25 per game during the current seven-game road trip as he continues to work his way back from his injury. He played 27 minutes against Utah. Jazz: Utah hasn't won consecutive games since the first week of December. ... Hood sat out after bruising his lower left leg late in the game. His status will be updated Saturday. GOBERT BACK Gobert played 30 minutes in his return, though Snyder has the big man on a minutes restriction. Snyder wasn't sure if Gobert would be available Saturday on the second night of a back-to-back. Snyder said it was possible, but the decision would be made later. SWITCHING UP Snyder moved Hood back into the starting lineup for the first time since Dec. 21. Joe Ingles was sent to the bench for the first time all season. ""We haven't started games well -- that's no secret,"" Snyder said. ""That's no one guy's fault. If that's anybody's fault, it's mine. Guys are going to play about the same minutes, they just play it at slightly different times.""

"LOS ANGELES --  They were missing three injured starters and made two free throws all night. Hard to imagine the Los Angeles Lakers could find a more unlikely way to win. Reserve guard Jordan Clarkson sparked an undermanned team with 33 points, seven assists and seven rebounds, leading Los Angeles to a 99-86 victory Friday night over the Indiana Pacers. The Lakers won for the first time in nine games this season without rookie point guard Lonzo Ball. And they did it despite going 2 for 14 from the foul line, a franchise low at 14.3 percent. ""It was defense,"" coach Luke Walton said. ""Our defense was awesome tonight. That was the challenge all day to the guys. It doesn't matter who's out, how many guys are out, if we defend the way we're capable and compete on that end of the floor."" The Lakers held Indiana to 38.1 percent shooting, including a miserable 2 of 25 from 3-point range. ""We missed shots, turned the ball over and they made shots,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""That was really the game."" The Lakers first grabbed control in the second quarter. Players took turns aggressively slashing through the lane and then Clarkson got hot, scoring nine points as Los Angeles outscored the Pacers 29-14 in the period. ""I was just hooping today,"" Clarkson said. ""I was comfortable, not thinking too much."" Walton said in his experience, players have breakout offensive games when they're not thinking about scoring. ""To me, guys normally have nights like that when they stop thinking about offense,"" Walton said. ""You kind of get lost in doing other things when you're as gifted as he is offensively. That's when you have nights like that."" The Lakers shot 55 percent from the floor. But at the foul line, Clarkson made two of his three free throws; the rest of the team was 0 for 11. ""It's like a virus or something,"" Clarkson said. Victor Oladipo led Indiana with 25 points, but most of his teammates struggled offensively. Darren Collison shot 1 of 9 and Lance Stephenson was 1 for 12. It marked the first time this season the Pacers, the NBA's third-best shooting team, finished under 40 percent in consecutive games. ""They just didn't go in,"" Oladipo said. ""We were getting open looks, too, and they weren't going in. It's part of the game."" TIP-INS Pacers: Three former UCLA players returned to Los Angeles with Indiana, including two rookies making their first appearances as pros: forward TJ Leaf (18th overall draft pick) and C Ike Anigbogu (47th). Both have struggled to earn playing time, while Collison has become a fixture at point guard. ... C Myles Turner missed his sixth consecutive game with a strained right elbow. Lakers: Maybe it's Staples Center. The Lakers played without three regulars in Ball (knee), F Brandon Ingram (ankle) and G Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (strained Achilles). So all five players on the court for the opening tip were not typically starters. Their arena-mates, the Clippers, have been playing down at least three starters for most of the season. BALL MOVEMENT Although the rookie point guard is not a big-time scorer, Ball leads the Lakers in assists and defensive rebounds. And until Friday, the Lakers had been winless without him. But against the Pacers, they had 26 assists and moved the ball well. ""Our guys were making the right play all night long,"" Walton said. ""That led to good shots and that led to assists. It's that simple.""","400975419"
"CLEVELAND --  LeBron James came up just short of 30,000 points. Oklahoma City nearly got there, too. Unable to stop Paul George, Russell Westbrook or Carmelo Anthony, the Cavaliers were embarrassed 148-124 on Saturday by the Thunder, who not only rolled to their fourth straight win but kept James shy of a historic milestone. George scored 36 points, Westbrook had 23 and 20 assists and Anthony dropped a season-high 29 points as the Thunder tied the record for the most points given up by a Cleveland team in a regulation game. Philadelphia scored 148 on the Cavs back in 1972. ""I've never in my basketball life gave up 148 points, not even probably playing video games,"" James said. ""They got everything that they wanted. Inside, outside, they had it moving."" A roller-coaster season in Cleveland is on a steady, accelerating descent. The Cavaliers have lost 10 of 14, and in the past 12 days, the three-time defending Eastern Conference champions have been blown out by 28, 34 and 24 points. It's gotten so bad, so quickly that coach Tyronn Lue's job could be at stake. ""I would hope not, but I really don't know,"" James said when asked if Lue could be fired. ""I don't know what's going to happen with our team. I have no idea what conversations have been going on. Me personally, I've been trying to stay as laser-sharp as I can to keep my guys ready to go out and play. ""Obviously, it hasn't resulted in wins, but I got to stay as fresh mentally as much I can with the struggles. I can't worry about job securities and trades and things of that nature. I just stay as focused as I can every night to go out and compete and try to help us win ballgames."" James finished with 18 points and remains seven shy of becoming the seventh player in NBA history to reach the 30,000-point plateau. His next chance is Tuesday when the Cavs visit San Antonio. James entered the fourth quarter within reach of 30,000. But after he missed two shots, James was replaced with 6:37 remaining and the Cavs trailing 128-101. The 33-year-old hoped to make history in front of his home fans and family, but it wasn't to be. James will eventually get to 30,000 and join Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 points), Karl Malone (36,928), Kobe Bryant (33,643), Michael Jordan (32,292), Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) and Dirk Nowitzki (30,808) on the select list. The Thunder didn't want to be props in a ceremony for James. ""I was hopeful it took two games for him to get that,"" George said. ""I've been part of a lot of those baskets he's had. That's an achievement or a milestone I didn't want to be a part of."" Oklahoma City center Steven Adams scored 25 points on 12-of-13 shooting, and the Thunder's starters combined for 121 points as the Cavs were unable to do anything defensively. That's been a major problem all season with the league's oldest team. ""We gotta go back to the drawing board on that end,"" said Isaiah Thomas, who finished with a season-high 24 points but was exposed on the defensive end. ""As players, we gotta take pride in defense. We gotta take pride in getting stops as a group collectively."" The Thunder had their way with Cleveland in the first half. They scored 76 -- the most given up in any half by the Cavs this season -- and took the air out of the Quicken Loans Arena crowd. Before the second half began, the arena's in-game emcee told the fans, ""The first half is over. Forget about it."" That was impossible as the Thunder extended their lead to 24 when Anthony drained a 3-pointer from the top of the key, sapping whatever energy Clevelanders had left. The Cavs made one last push with James making a layup to cut the lead to 12. But Oklahoma City didn't let up and eventually pushed the lead to 31. 30K CLUB When he reaches 30,000 points, James will be the youngest player to do so, but it wasn't by design. ""It's never been a chase,"" he said. ""I don't chase points. I don't chase anything when it comes to scoring. When I get it, I get it and that's how I've gotten to this point in my career. The disappointing thing is that we lost, so it doesn't matter."" TIP-INS Thunder: G Andre Roberson played his second game after missing eight with left patellar tendinitis. He had a forgettable six-second span, missing four straight free throws and committing a foul. ... Coach Billy Donovan first watched James play as a high school sophomore, when he stood out more than others. ""In seeing him at that age you see a lot of times young kids that are sophomores with his ability -- maybe not all of his ability -- but you see talented players,"" Donovan said. ""They never get better. A lot of times it's difficult to get better because there's such a microscope. The thing that's amazing to me is he's had a lot of attention on him and a very, very young age and he always got better."" Cavaliers: C Kevin Love played only three minutes before leaving with an unspecified illness. ... With the Feb. 8 trade deadline approaching, there is growing speculation that Cleveland will make a deal -- or two -- to improve the league's oldest roster. Lue doesn't necessarily believe change is essential. ""I like the group that we have,"" he said. ""We just haven't been healthy the whole year. I'm just focused on coaching the guys that we have.""","400975420"
"ATLANTA --  Lauri Markkanen wasn't feeling his 3-point shot against Atlanta's perimeter defense, so the Bulls' big man decided to attack inside. ""That was their game plan, but I can do much more than just shoot from the outside,"" he said. ""I missed I don't know how many 3s, but that wasn't going for me tonight. I had to figure out something else."" Robin Lopez scored 20 points, Markkanen added 19 and Chicago easily beat the Hawks 113-97 on Saturday night. The Bulls, coming off a 7-point home loss to defending NBA champion Golden State three days ago, have won four of five and 15 of 23. They never trailed, taking an 11-point lead midway through the first quarter on Lopez's dunk and going up 17 on Markkanen's dunk in the closing seconds of the first half. The closest Atlanta got in the third was 10 points on John Collins' dunk. The lead swelled to 25 midway through the fourth on Portis' 3. ""I thought that we really played a complete game tonight,"" Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I thought that we played with the right mentality."" Dennis Schroder scored 18 points and Dewayne Dedmon had 11 for Atlanta, which showed why it's spent the season at or near the bottom of the NBA standings. The Hawks began the game ranked seventh in 3-point shooting, but they had little chance of competing after missing 34 of their first 38 shots beyond the arc. Atlanta, coming off a dramatic late victory over New Orleans, was attempting to win three straight for the first time this season. ""The shot isn't falling, but you have to find another way to win the game,"" Schroder said. ""We didn't do it tonight. We have to keep moving on to the next game."" With the Hawks poorly defending inside, Markkanen took his game to the rim. The 7-foot, 227-pound Finn, a prolific 3-point shooter, had five dunks. He went 0 for 4 beyond the arc, marking the first time in 17 games that he didn't hit a 3. Markkanen hit 100 3s in his first 41 games, faster than any rookie in NBA history, but he wants to make the adjustment inside when teams focus on taking his perimeter game away. ""I know I can't just shoot 3s,"" Markkanen said. ""I've got to get to the rim. Eventually that's going to open a lot more space for 3-pointers and stuff like that. I just try to mix it up."" TIP-INS Bulls: Hoiberg said G Kris Dunn, in the NBA's concussion protocol, will not join the team Monday in New Orleans. Dunn is still suffering headaches, dizziness and soreness from losing two front teeth after his face hit the floor. ... Chicago is 7-16 on the road but has won four of its last six away from the United Center. ... The Bulls have hit at least 10 3s in 10 straight games. Hawks: The team's best 3-point veteran shooters, F Ersan Ilyasova and G Marco Belinelli, were a combined 0 for 12 beyond the arc. Atlanta finished 11 for 48. ... The Hawks have dropped three straight in the Bulls series after winning seven in a row. BULLISH START Chicago did as it pleased in the first half, dishing out 18 assists on 21 field goals to begin the third quarter with a 55-38 lead. They scored the game's first 14 points in the paint on five dunks, and Atlanta had no one capable inside to defend Lopez, who had 16 before intermission on 8 for 9 shooting. Portis finished with 14 points and Justin Holiday had 13 for the Bulls. ""We knew it was going to be an important game for us after a tough loss against Golden State,"" Nikola Mirotic said. ""I think that game gave us confidence that we can beat any team in the league.""","400975421"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kelly Olynyk thought he was fouled. Dwight Howard clearly disagreed. Charlotte coach Steve Clifford was more concerned about the way his Hornets ""butchered"" the fourth quarter. Olynyk scored 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, including a free throw with 0.2 seconds left following Howard's disputed foul, to help the Miami Heat erase a five-point deficit in the final 34 seconds and stun Charlotte 106-105 on Saturday night. The foul came after Charlotte's Kemba Walker missed on a drive to the basket. Olynyk grabbed the rebound and drove the length of the floor, and Howard appeared to hook Olynyk's right arm on the way to the basket just as Olynyk started to lose control of the ball. Olynyk fell to the ground as the whistle blew, enraging the home crowd. Olynyk missed the first free throw, but calmly made the second to give the Heat the lead. Charlotte's inbound heave was deflected away as time expired. ""He had already lost the ball and was falling before I even pushed him,"" Howard said. ""I just thought that it was something that shouldn't have been called at that point in the game. They should have just let the clock run out and let the teams duel it out in overtime."" Olynyk saw it a little different. ""We were just trying to push the ball and make a play and they fouled,"" Olynyk said. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said his team has worked on that scenario in practice with his point guards, but never with the 7-foot Olynyk. ""I think it surprised them,"" Spoelstra said. The crowd stood shouting and booing as officials left the floor. Clifford was more upset by the fourth-quarter collapse. He called out his team for a ""total lack of concentration, intensity and technique"" in his opening statement following the game. Wayne Ellington had 26 points on six 3-pointers and Joe Johnson added 22 points for the Heat. Nic Batum scored a season-high 26 points and Walker had 22 for Charlotte, which had a two-game winning streak snapped. Howard had 14 points and 15 rebounds. With Miami trailing 105-100, Johnson got free for a dunk. The Hornets inbounded the ball to Batum, but Josh Richardson stripped the ball and passed it to Johnson, who knocked down a 3-pointer from the wing to tie it. ""I didn't see him,"" Batum said. ""I was facing the (inbounder) and he came in from behind. I had no idea he was behind me. I barely touched the ball. ... I don't have eyes in the back of my head."" The Hornets trailed by eight in the third quarter before Batum got hot. The French shooting guard scored 14 points during a 16-6 run to give the Hornets their first lead since 2-0. Charlotte stretched the lead to 10, outscoring the Heat 35-17 in the third quarter. ""They just lit us up,"" Spoelstra said. ""It looked a lot like last night. Guys took ownership of it. Our defensive intensity in the fourth quarter was the best part and the most consistent part of it during the game."" Down 10 to start the fourth quarter, Olynyk made three 3-pointers to help cut the lead to three. TIP-INS Heat: Goran Dragic sat out with a bruised knee. ... The Heat shot 51 percent from the field in the first half to build a 57-48 lead. Hornets: Howard had 14 points and 15 rebounds for the Hornets.","400975422"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Jrue Holiday dunked as he was fouled by Grizzlies rookie Dillon Brooks, and that was the first sign the less heralded member of the Pelicans' ""Big Three"" was about to take over. Holiday made Memphis pay for trying to lock down All-Star big men Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, following his dunk with a pair of layups on penetrating dribble drives, then adding floaters from five and 12 feet. ""Anthony told me to be aggressive. He told me to get to 20 points this game and we would win,"" Holiday said. ""I just listened to the captain."" Holiday scored 13 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter, Cousins had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and New Orleans beat Memphis 111-104 on Saturday night. Holiday said the attention Memphis paid to Cousins and Davis often left him with only one defender to beat. ""In situations like that, you just have to make a play,"" Holiday said. Davis had 21 points and 12 rebounds but did not score his first points of the second half until he dunked with 1:15 to go in the game, giving the Pelicans a 108-102 lead. ""We've got other guys who are able to score,"" Davis asserted, noting that Memphis was ""sending two guys at me, (or) three guys and I was just trying to facilitate other guys."" Darius Miller added 12 points in a reserve role for New Orleans, which never trailed but nearly blew a 21-point lead. Trailing 59-44 at halftime, Memphis scored the first 13 points of the third quarter, part of a 16-2 run that trimmed New Orleans' lead to a single point with most of the third quarter remaining. The Pelicans briefly rebuilt their lead to 12, but it was back to a single possession by the end of the quarter after Wayne Selden -- who scored a career-high 31 points against the team he played for earlier this season -- hit a 3 to make it 83-81. New Orleans didn't lead by double digits again, and Cousins had to briefly leave the game after committing his fifth foul with nearly seven minutes to go. But Cousins came through with a late block on Tyreke Evans that led to Davis' dunk on the other end. ""They made some tough 3s to cut the game and even get it to one point, but I do like the fact that we maintained our poise and were able to finish,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""Obviously, Wayne Selden played his best game as a pro. He shot the heck out of the basketball. He was one of the main reasons they were able to stay in the game."" Marc Gasol scored 16 points for Memphis, which lost for only the second time in six games. Evans scored 12 points against his former team and former LSU player Jarell Martin had 11. But the Grizzlies were short-handed. Guards Mario Chalmers (right shoulder) and Andrew Harrison (left shoulder), who were listed as questionable following Friday night's victory over Sacramento, did not play against the Pelicans. It got worse when starting forward JaMychal Green left with a right ankle injury with 9:05 left in the third quarter. ""I can't say enough positive things about what our guys did tonight. They competed against all odds, all circumstances,"" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We just decided it wasn't going to be an easy night for the other side when it very well could have been after getting down in the first half. Again, nothing but a lot of respect and a lot of credit to our guys for their makeup and fortitude."" TIP-INS Grizzlies: Green had 16 rebounds and eight points before leaving the game. ... Brooks had 10 points before fouling out in the final minute. Ben McLemore also scored 10. ... Went 15 of 16 on free throws. ... Fell to 5-16 on the road. Pelicans: The game marked the eighth time this season Cousins, Davis and Holiday each had at least 20 points in the same game. ... Finished 26 of 32 on free throws. ... Went just 7 of 27 from 3-point range. ... Improved to 12-9 at home. SHOT SELECTION Davis attempted only two shots the entire second half, but Holiday defended his teammate's decision-making, given Memphis' efforts to try to deny Davis the ball. ""That's the unselfishness that our team really feeds off of and that's what makes him a leader,"" Holiday said. ""He can force as many shots as he wants to, but getting us good shots"" is his priority.","400975423"
"PHILADELPHIA --  It's only January, yet Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown wants his team keeping an eye on the standings. ""He mentioned that we could jump to sixth (in the Eastern Conference) if we won,"" guard Ben Simmons said. ""Obviously, it was a big game, and we did a really good job of closing it out."" Joel Embiid had 29 points and nine rebounds and the 76ers pulled away from the undermanned Milwaukee Bucks 116-94 on Saturday night for their seventh win in eight games. Simmons added 16 points and nine assists, and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot scored 16 points in a rare start as the Sixers (22-20) moved past Milwaukee (23-22). For a franchise that had won 75 games the previous four seasons combined, Philadelphia is eagerly eyeing its first postseason berth since 2012. ""We've been able to find our identity,"" Embiid said. Khris Middleton had his first career-triple double -- 23 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists -- for the Bucks in their second straight loss. They were without top scorer Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was sitting out the first of two games to rest a sore right knee. Fellow starter Malcolm Brogdon also wasn't available due to a family matter. Tony Snell (15 points) and Sterling Brown (14 points) moved into the lineup, and the Bucks rallied from 16 points down to tie it before being outscored 32-14 in the fourth quarter. ""We were short-handed and they played hard,"" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. ""But turnovers cost us there to start that fourth quarter."" Antetokounmpo practiced Friday, but the Bucks announced Saturday morning the two-time All-Star would be out until Friday against Brooklyn to ""manage"" his ailment. Knee pain also kept Antetokounmpo sidelined on Nov. 22 and Dec. 23. ""Hopefully, after missing these two games, he doesn't have to miss any more,"" Kidd said. Philadelphia was without its top two shooting guards. JJ Redick (cracked bone below his knee) is out at least a week and Jerryd Bayless (sore left wrist) didn't dress. Luwawu-Cabarrot, a French guard in his second NBA season, stepped into the starting lineup and made 3 of 5 3-pointers. His 3-pointer capped a 13-0 run early in the fourth as Philadelphia built a 97-82 lead. ""It was a big opportunity for me to show up and step up,"" Luwawu-Cabarrot said. The Sixers showed good depth early. Nine players scored in the first quarter, and they built a 53-37 lead before halftime. After committing just three first-half turnovers, the Sixers threw it away 11 times in the third, and Middleton and Eric Bledsoe (14 points on 5-of-18 shooting) helped the Bucks rally to tie it. Embiid responded with a dunk and a block on Bledsoe and a three-point play to end the third and give the Sixers an 84-80 lead. Middleton was 9 of 20 from the field. It was his first double-figure rebounding game of the season. TIP-INS Bucks: Brogdon is expected back Monday. ... Marshall Plumlee, signed to a two-way contact five days earlier, had six points and six rebounds in his team debut. ""He was great,"" Kidd said. ... Milwaukee plays the Sixers three more times, including at Philadelphia on April 11 to end the regular season. 76ers: Rookie G Markelle Fultz participated in shootaround as he tries to regain his shooting form following a right shoulder injury. The No. 1 overall pick has missed 38 straight games. ... Simmons didn't attempt a 3-pointer for the 12th time in 13 games. He's 0 for 10 from long range. ... With the game in hand, fans turned their attention to Sunday's NFC championship game with several ""Eagles"" chants. The Sixers are flying to Memphis earlier than usual Sunday so they can watch the game on TV. THANKS, DOC Embiid played on after aggravating a right hand injury from last month. Brown gave a nod to the team's often-criticized medical staff for Embiid being voted an All-Star despite his numerous injuries. ""They deserve a hell of a lot of credit,"" Brown said. Embiid still isn't cleared to play back-to-back games following knee surgery last March. Brown said his fitness level is 85-90 percent. ""His muscle tone and his stomach, he physically looks good,"" Brown said. ""But we see a little bit of a decline in fourth periods.""","400975424"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden felt closer to normal after struggling in his first game back from a hamstring injury, and the Houston Rockets got a big game from Chris Paul to down the Golden State Warriors on Saturday night. Paul scored 33 points with 11 rebounds, Harden bested Stephen Curry twice in the final seconds and the Rockets held off the Warriors 116-108 to snap their 14-game road winning streak. The victory gives Houston a 2-1 series advantage over Golden State after the reigning NBA champions had won the series the previous three seasons. ""Obviously they're a championship caliber team for the past four years ... and that's what we're trying to build our way up to,"" Harden said. Harden stepped back from Curry for a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired to make it 114-108 with 1:10 left, then blocked Curry's 3-point attempt after a timeout. Harden finished with 22 points. Paul added two free throws with 28 seconds left. Golden State lost away from home for the first time since Nov. 22. The Warriors had won seven straight in Houston. ""It's been a good streak, disappointing end to it,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""But we didn't deserve to win tonight. We played pretty poorly, did a lot of things to hurt ourselves and we're playing a great team. Can't get away with it."" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni raved about the performance of the 32-year-old Paul . ""The guy is a winner, he's been a winner, he's going to win,"" D'Antoni said. Kevin Durant led Golden State with 26 points, Draymond Green had 21 and Curry added 19 on a night he went 5 of 15 on 3-point attempts and 6 of 20 overall. It was just the sixth time in his career that he'd attempted 20 or more shots while making six or fewer. ""It was just one of those nights where I personally didn't have the right vision on the floor,"" he said. ""So I've got to take that responsibility for that one. It was pretty bad."" The Warriors were wrapping up a five-game road trip and had won the first four games to tie a franchise record for consecutive road wins. But they struggled from the outset Saturday and trailed by double digits for most of the first half. It was Harden's second game back after missing seven with a strained hamstring. He was in a much better rhythm than in his return Thursday night, when he scored a season-low 10 points. He had eight assists, two steals and two blocks Saturday. The Rockets got the victory despite missing Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green, who were both serving the second game of a two-game suspension for an altercation with the Clippers. Clint Capela added 18 points for Houston on a night when top reserve Eric Gordon went 0 for 9 from 3-point range and finished with just six points. Golden State led by four before Houston went on a 9-2 run, with the first five points from Paul, to take a 109-106 lead with about three minutes left. TIP-INS Warriors: Green surpassed the 4,000-point mark (4,019) and added seven rebounds to also reach 3,000 rebounds. ... Golden State had 19 turnovers. ... Young finished with 16 points.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  There was no Jimmy Butler, practically no Karl-Anthony Towns in the first half, and the visiting Toronto Raptors were shooting 54 percent. These are the types of games the Minnesota Timberwolves of the last few years didn't win. This season's revamped team is showing the toughness needed to compete with the league's top teams. Andrew Wiggins scored 29 points, Towns had all 22 of his points in the second half and the Wolves rallied from 11 down to beat the Toronto Raptors 115-109 on Saturday night. ""We've got a lot of guys that know how to play,"" Wiggins said. ""That's the NBA for you. Someone's injured, the next person just steps up. We have a good team, a lot of guys that can step up and make plays."" With Butler out with a sore knee and Towns in foul trouble, Wiggins almost single-handedly kept the Wolves in it with 22 first-half points. In the second half, the Wolves got big minutes from Marcus Georges-Hunt (12 points), Gorgui Dieng and Tyus Jones (nine points apiece) and the seldom-used Shabazz Muhammad (seven points). The Wolves bench outscored Toronto's 37-39. ""If you're in this league, you're a great player,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""So when someone's out, it's an opportunity for someone else to step in. As long as we play hard, we feel like we're going to have a chance to win every night."" The Wolves snapped a two-game skid. Kyle Lowry led Toronto with a season-high 40 points on 14-for-25 shooting, including 6 of 10 from behind the arc. Towns had three early fouls and no shot attempts in eight first-half minutes, and the Raptors looked primed for their third straight win. But Towns finally got going after halftime, scoring 12 of the Timberwolves' first 21 points, and Minnesota outscored the Raptors 33-21 in the quarter en route to snapping their two-game winning streak. Minnesota went 32 for 42 from the line, while Toronto went 19 of 21. ""We didn't match their intensity coming out of the locker room in the second half,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""We knew they were going to come. We just didn't move offensively. We were standing, watching the ball. We were trying to run our sets, but we played in mud."" Minnesota led by as many as 10 in the fourth before the Raptors answered with an 11-0 run to retake the lead. DeMar DeRozan's 3-pointer put Toronto up 106-104 with 3:12 left. But Wiggins and Towns hit back-to-back 3s and Georges-Hunt added three free throws to help give the Wolves their third straight home win over the Raptors. TIP-INS Raptors: DeRozan scored 20 points.

ALMOST, NOT QUITE The Raptors nearly wrapped up their first home-road back-to-back set of the season with impressive wins against two of the West's best teams. They beat San Antonio on Friday night at home. ""We've got to come out with a little bit more energy on the back-to-back, but it's no excuse,"" Lowry said. IN THE HUNT Georges-Hunt had career highs in points (12) and minutes (29), including his three crucial free throws in the closing minutes. Afterward, Thibodeau lauded his mental toughness. ""Just stay relaxed and just act like nobody's in the gym,"" Georges-Hunt said.","400975426"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The offensively challenged Utah Jazz found a way to score points in droves Saturday night. Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points and helped Utah close out a 125-113 win over the Los Angeles Clippers with their second-highest point total this season. Despite missing starting guard Rodney Hood because of a leg injury, Utah set season bests for points in the first quarter (39) and first half (76). It never trailed while ending the Clippers' six-game winning streak. ""Just playing with force,"" Jazz center Rudy Gobert said. ""Being aggressive. Moved the ball. Our defense got a lot of deflections, a lot of steals and got a lot of easy stuff from that. ""It felt good, but at the same time they were scoring too much. So it didn't feel great. It's kind of like you're having fun offensively, but can't get a stop. If you get stops, the game is over in the third."" The Jazz drove to the basket at will in the first half, shooting 62.5 percent en route to a 76-59 halftime lead. They began the night ranked 26th in the league in points per game. ""Honestly, we just didn't have it,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""They played a lot harder than us, which I rarely say. They played desperate. ""We didn't handle their pressure. They pressured us in the first half. Second half, we were much better. But in the first half, I just didn't think we were ready for the intensity that they were going to bring."" Joe Ingles got aggressive and finished with a career-high 21 points, reaching the 20-point mark for just the third time in his career. Mitchell had his 21st game of 20-plus points, most among rookies, and also had seven assists and four rebounds. Derrick Favors had 14 points and 12 rebounds. ""When the ball sticks or stays on one side of the floor, we're not going to be as efficient,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We're a team that needs the ball to move side-to-side. And when it does, Joe's usually involved in helping it move and he's the beneficiary, a lot of times, of that movement. He was ready to shoot and aggressive."" Lou Williams paced the Clippers with 31 points, a franchise-record 10 steals and seven assists, and he helped cut the lead to single digits in the fourth quarter. He's the first player in league history to reach 30 points, 10 steals and seven assists in a game since steals became a recorded stat. Blake Griffin added 25 points and eight rebounds. ""We're a very resilient group,"" Williams said. ""We were out here again tonight with another lineup and we fought hard and fell short. But it's a very resilient group."" TIP-INS Clippers: DeAndre Jordan missed his fourth straight game with a left ankle sprain. ... LA allowed 50 points in the paint. ... The Clippers were outrebounded 56-34. Jazz: Gobert played 28 minutes as he works his way back from a sprained knee. He wasn't as effective as his 23-point, 14-block effort Friday, but was able to play the second night of a back-to-back. He finished with 16 points, seven rebounds and three blocks. HOOD-LESS Hood did not play after suffering a lower left leg contusion Friday night. He's averaged a career-high 16.7 points. ""I think it's collective,"" Snyder said about replacing his offense. ""It's more about us being efficient offensively. We've got a little bit of a Chinese water torture as far as how we need to score. Everybody's got to do a little bit. ""Our guys are great about being unselfish and not caring who gets shots. Different guys are going to get shots. The way we've been balanced, we've had a lot of guys lead us in scoring and have big nights. That's what we need."" QUOTABLE ""I've had the most fun that I've had in years coaching a group,"" Rivers said before the game. ""It does remind me a lot of my first year in Orlando, we had that crazy group of guys. It's just a fun group to coach. They're extremely coachable. They want to do right. They get along and play together and sometimes you're fortunate enough to win games.""","400975427"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard tried to make a final statement as the NBA All-Star roster deadline nears. The Portland guard hit his first nine shots -- including seven 3-pointers -- and scored 31 points as the Trail Blazers beat the Dallas Mavericks 117-108 on Saturday night for their season-best sixth consecutive home win. Lillard, who didn't miss a shot until late in the third quarter, went 10 of 15 from the floor and handed out nine assists to lead Portland. Backcourt mate CJ McCollum scored 26 points, while Evan Turner had 17 points and Al-Farouq Aminu 13. Portland tied a season high with 18 3-pointers. Six Blazers made at least two each, led by Lillard's seven. NBA All-Star reserves, voted by the coaches, will be announced Tuesday. Portland's next game isn't until Monday, and by then, many coaches will have already voted. Saturday's performance might have been Lillard's last All-Star statement. Lillard didn't see Saturday's game as an All-Star audition, but rather, what he's supposed to do. ""I gotta play at a certain way and perform at a certain level for us to be able to win games,"" he said. ""That's why my job is. I don't have anything else to say about it."" Turner spoke up on Lillard's behalf. ""He's been playing at a high level,"" Turner said. ""An All-Star level. They screwed him the last two years, right? When's the make-up call? They owe him a couple. That's case enough."" Wesley Matthews led Dallas with 23 points. Dirk Nowitzki and Dennis Smith Jr. scored 21 points each, with Nowitzki setting a season high. Portland led by 18 points in the second half but had trouble putting away the pesky Mavericks. Dallas whittled away at Portland's advantage during the fourth quarter, getting as close as five points with 36 seconds remaining. A dunk by the Blazers' Ed Davis with 17 seconds left put the Mavericks away. Portland led 62-45 at halftime, after the Blazers shot 57 percent (24 of 42) during the first half. ""First half, I thought was bad. Second half was very good. You've got to play both halves, so we've got to get a better start,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. Portland led 33-20 after the first quarter, and its dominance was particularly evidence on the final two baskets. Shabazz Napier stripped J.J. Barea at midcourt and finished with a rare dunk. Seconds later, McCollum had a layup after blowing by Yogi Ferrell so quickly the Dallas guard fell to the ground. TIP-INS Mavericks: Barea returned to the lineup after missing Tuesday's game at Denver. He scored 12 points. ... This is the second time this season Dallas has had a four-day break in between games. The Mavericks are 0-2 in that situation. ... Devin Harris suffered a head injury during the first half and didn't return. Trail Blazers: Matthews left the Blazers for Dallas following the 2014-15 season, but he's still popular in Portland, as fans warmly cheered him during pregame introductions. ... Last season, Lillard averaged 28.3 points in three games against the Mavericks. NURKIC REACTS TO TECH The game got chippy down the stretch, with three technical fouls during the final five minutes. The most prominent happened after Blazers' Jusuf Nurkic and Dallas' Salah Mejri became entangled under the basket. As the two released, Mejri flew to the ground. After consulting the television monitor, Nurkic was assessed a technical. ""I thought he locked my arm and I didn't like that. So I let him know -- dirty plays -- I don't like that,"" Nurkic said. ""The refs are going to do what they're going to do. He got fouled and then he locked my arm on purpose. That's not good.""","400975428"
"BOSTON --  After a near-miss in their last game, the Orlando Magic were rewarded for another solid effort. Elfrid Payton had 22 points and the Magic won for just the third time in their last 20 games, overcoming Kyrie Irving's 40 points to beat the Boston Celtics 103-95 on Sunday. ""It feels good to get a win, especially after playing well,"" Payton said. ""We felt we played well against the Cavs and didn't come out with the victory. So to get the win today feels good."" Orlando snapped a 14-game losing streak at Boston. The Magic had lost 10 in a row on the road overall since early December including a one-point loss to Cleveland in its previous game. Irving sat out Boston's previous game to rest a sore left shoulder. Despite his efforts, the Celtics dropped their season-worst third straight overall and at home. ""We haven't played well consistently on both ends for a while now,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""I felt like they were shooting layups for the most part tonight."" Evan Fournier added 19 and Aaron Gordon had a double-double with 11 points and 12 rebounds for the Magic. ""Was a really good win for us and we are playing really hard right now,"" Fournier said. ""We almost let it slip, but made a few plays to close the deal and it feels really good."" Trailing 59-58 at halftime, Orlando outscored the Celtics 32-12 in the third quarter while shooting 60 percent. The Magic held Boston to four field goals, three by Irving, and led 90-71 after three. ""I thought Payton was the leader of the pack,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""The Elfrid in the third quarter was the guy driving the engine."" Jayson Tatum sparked a fourth-quarter run by scoring seven of his nine points to draw the Celtics to 93-84, but both teams traded points and Orlando maintained control the rest of the way. SURE SHOTS Orlando shot 61 percent on combined 27 of 44 in the second and third quarter. The Magic came into the game 14th in the NBA in field goal percentage. BENCH STRENGTH Shelvin Mack and D.J. Augustin combined for 20 points as the Magic bench outscored the Celtics 38-8. Boston reserves shot 4 for 19 from the field. TIP-INS Magic: G Aaron Afflalo completed his two-game suspension and didn't play. ... Nikola Vucevic missed his 12th game and is hoping to return after the All-Star break. ... Orlando made one of its first 16 shots in the fourth quarter. Celtics: Marcus Morris (12) scored in double figures for his fourth straight game. Jaylen Brown added 17 for Boston. Boston had been one of five teams not to lose three straight.","400975429"
"LOS ANGELES --  When the Los Angeles Lakers complement their up-tempo offense with solid defense, this long-struggling team actually looks pretty good. Even without Lonzo Ball, the Lakers were plenty good enough to run right past the New York Knicks, who couldn't keep up. Jordan Clarkson had 29 points and 10 assists, Julius Randle added 27 points and 12 rebounds, and the Lakers beat New York 127-107 on Sunday for their sixth win in eight games. Kyle Kuzma added 15 points as the Lakers (17-29) continued a midseason surge of solid play. Rookie point guard Alex Caruso set career highs with nine points and eight assists, making the most of more than 30 minutes of playing time while Ball missed his fourth straight game with a sore left knee. The Lakers thought they did nothing spectacularly, but everything well -- particularly on the defensive end, where they forced 17 turnovers. Los Angeles also won its fifth straight game at Staples Center after a 6-14 start to the home schedule. ""Defense. That was the only message at halftime,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""During our home win streak, we have been really, really good defensively."" Los Angeles took the lead late in the third quarter and pulled away down the stretch, scoring 10 consecutive points in a rally led by Clarkson and Randle. The Lakers finished on a 17-4 run. ""Randle and Clarkson, they were killing us,"" New York coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""We tried multiple guys on both of them, but they took it to whoever was guarding them. That was a big key. We couldn't get any stops."" Kristaps Porzingis, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Michael Beasley scored 17 points apiece for the Knicks, who have lost 12 of 16. New York slipped to 2-2 on its seven-game trip. Despite a solid shooting game, the Knicks couldn't answer the aggressive transition game favored by the Lakers, who put up their highest-scoring performance in two weeks. ""They just played harder than us in everything,"" said Enes Kanter, who had 12 points and 14 rebounds for New York. ""They got a lot of offensive rebounds. We got a lot of turnovers. I don't think we can play like this in road games and expect to get a win."" Clarkson followed up his 33-point performance Friday against Indiana with another high-energy effort. The veteran guard hit 12 of his 19 shots and added six rebounds. TIP-INS Knicks: Porzingis drew a technical foul with 8:04 to play for vociferously protesting a foul call against teammate Ron Baker. The ensuing three-point play put the Lakers up by 11. ... Courtney Lee added 16 points. Lakers: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also missed his second straight game with a right heel injury. ... Kuzma jammed a finger on his right hand during the second quarter, but iced it and continued playing. ... Brandon Ingram played through a mild left ankle sprain after the team determined he was healthy at game time. He managed 10 points on 4-of-13 shooting. BALL OUT Walton said Ball might miss several more games, but the club is hoping he'll be able to travel on their five-game trip starting Friday. The rookie point guard also missed six games around the holidays with a sprained left shoulder. The Lakers went 0-6 without him then. TEXAS TANDEM Caruso is on a two-way contract that allows him only 45 days with the Lakers, and he's keeping track of his time in the Notes app on his phone. He has already formed an impressive tandem with Clarkson, his former opponent in college when Caruso was at Texas A&amp;M and Clarkson was at Missouri. ""I'm getting better each game, but I'm just getting acclimated to (the NBA),"" said Caruso, who has played 15 games in the big show. While Caruso feels his strengths are on defense, his ball-handling acumen allows Clarkson to be more aggressive in looking for his shot. The duo also is friends off the court. ""He's from Texas, I'm from Texas, you know what I'm saying?"" asked Clarkson, who grew up in San Antonio.","400975430"
"DETROIT --  Spencer Dinwiddie hit the big shot against a familiar foe. Dinwiddie's jumper with 0.9 seconds left lifted the Brooklyn Nets over Detroit 101-100 Sunday, the Pistons' fifth straight loss. After a basket by Andre Drummond put the Pistons ahead with 4.7 seconds left, Dinwiddie took the inbounds pass, drove to 14 feet and drained a jumper against his former teammates. The Pistons picked Dinwiddie in the second round of the 2014 draft, despite a knee injury, and he played 46 games for them over two seasons. ""That was a heck of a shot,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I'm happy for Spencer, because he was here, obviously, but I'm happier for the team. I wasn't sure we had the poise and understanding to get a win like this."" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy blamed himself for the final basket, where Ish Smith, generously listed as six feet tall, was covering the 6-foot-6 Dinwiddie. ""Ish did a great job of guarding him, but I probably should have had more size out there against him,"" Van Gundy said. ""Ish gave him a tough look, but Spencer was able to get above him and make a great shot."" Dinwiddie finished with 22 points. Tobias Harris led the Pistons with 20. Caris LeVert split a pair of free throws with 13.7 seconds left, giving the Nets a 99-98 edge. It was the second time he missed a free throw in the final 42 seconds. Langston Galloway misplayed the ensuing inbounds pass, but was able to knock the ball to Drummond. Detroit's center nearly traveled in a rare drive from outside the 3-point arc, and flipped in a go-ahead shot. ""I felt like we were focused and locked in tonight,"" said Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, who finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Nets. ""We were playing a really good team on their floor, but we trusted Spencer to make that last play."" On Jan. 10, the Pistons routed Brooklyn 114-80 behind 22 points and 20 rebounds from Drummond. That was Detroit's last victory, with three of the five defeats coming at Little Caesars Arena. ""We don't play again until Wednesday, so I have some time to think about how to fix this,"" Van Gundy said. ""We just don't play hard on a consistent basis. We've fallen behind early, but even when we had a great start on Friday (against Washington), we didn't keep it going."" The Nets led 53-48 at halftime. The Pistons had one offensive rebound in the half, slowed by Drummond's three fouls. ""I think the key was the way we started,"" Hollis-Jefferson said. ""That was big, and it is what you need to do to win games like this."" Drummond picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter, sending him back to the bench. Brooklyn quickly moved the lead to 11 as Detroit struggled to get open shots. Detroit trailed by nine going into the fourth quarter. Smith's 3-pointer with 2:58 left tied it at 92. ""This was huge,"" said Joe Harris, who had 12 points for Brooklyn. ""We're getting into these games and we're finally starting to finish them."" TIP-INS Nets: D'Angelo Russell played 14 minutes in his second game back from a knee injury, finishing with three points and one assist. ... The win ended Brooklyn's four-game losing streak in Detroit. Pistons: Johnson played his second game after missing three with a recurring hip problem, finishing with a season-high 18 points in 26 minutes. ""I though Stanley was really good defensively, and he played well on the offensive end, too,"" Van Gundy said. NEW ARENA, BETTER RESULTS The Nets are now 1-0 at Little Caesars Arena after going 8-44 in Detroit during the 29 seasons that the Pistons played at the Palace of Auburn Hills.","400975431"
"SAN ANTONIO --  Indiana made itself at home at an arena that's rarely hospitable to visiting teams. Victor Oladipo scored 19 points and the Pacers defeated San Antonio 94-86 on Sunday night, snapping the Spurs' 14-game home winning streak. San Antonio lost at home for the third time this season and the first since Nov. 10 against Milwaukee. ""It's just a great win for this young team to come into San Antonio, where they only lost two games,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""This has always been a tough place to play and to end the road trip when you're a little fatigued and a little tired. The challenge was mentally give yourself a chance by giving the effort, staying connected, playing together, and they did."" The Pacers became the first Eastern Conference team in three years to sweep a season series from the Spurs. With Manu Ginobili, Rudy Gay and Kawhi Leonard out with injuries, San Antonio made a last-minute lineup change, bringing Tony Parker off the bench for the 14th time in 1,165 career games. Asked if Dejounte Murray would continue to start at point guard, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said, ""We'll see."" Murray had eight points, seven rebounds, four assists and four turnovers in 28 minutes. ""A little different, so I guess we're figuring where we need certain things (with Parker) coming off the bench to start the game,"" Spurs guard Danny Green said. ""Trying to get a happy medium of getting some fast pace, slower pace, getting it inside, working outside, but turn the ball over a little less, move it a little bit better."" Parker responded with 12 points, five assists and one turnover, but LaMarcus Aldridge struggled without the veteran point guard. The Pacers stymied Aldridge offensively even without the injured Myles Turner, limiting the Spurs forward to a season-low 10 points. Aldridge finished 5 for 14 from the field. ""Thaddeus (Young) did a really nice job of making LaMarcus work,"" McMillan said. ""You don't stop those guys, but he was physical and made it tough for him to score. The rest of our guys did a good job defending and just keeping them in front."" Indiana, which led by as many as 17 points, had 15 steals while forcing 20 turnovers. ""We did a great job just getting stops and moving the ball,"" Oladipo said. ""They're a tough team to play against. Well-coached team, great players over there, it was a tough-fought team win. We've just got to build on it."" Darren Collison added 15 points for Indiana, which snapped a three-game losing streak in San Antonio. The Spurs pulled within 83-76 with 5:03 remaining on Davis Bertans' 3-pointer, but San Antonio committed two turnovers on the next two possessions. ""It happens a little too much with our team,"" said Pau Gasol, who had 14 points. ""We get a little bit out of whack. We don't execute, we're a little sloppy at times and we pay the price. We can't afford mistakes like that."" TIP-INS Pacers: Turner missed his seventh straight game with an injured right elbow. He high-stepped halfway down the baseline in celebration after Al Jefferson dunked on Gasol early in the fourth quarter. ... The Pacers concluded their longest trip of the season, going 3-2. ... Indiana came in averaging 106.5 points per game, which was 10th in the league. Spurs: Ginobili was a late scratch after being listed as questionable with bruised right thigh. ... Popovich said he is still not sure when Leonard will return as he continues to rehabilitate right quadriceps tendinopathy. ... Spurs players have missed 123 games collectively because of injuries and sat out 10 games for rest. ... Aldridge's previous low was 11 points against at Boston on Oct. 30. BIG WIN The difficulty of winning in San Antonio was not lost on veterans Collinson and Jefferson. ""It's big time,"" Collison said. ""Al and I were just talking about all that it takes to get a victory here. It's a good win all around. If we can continue to keep this up, the way we've been playing, beating teams like this, we're going to have a very good time.""","400975432"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker thinks the Charlotte Hornets can still be a playoff team, and the All-Star point guard would like to be around to see that happen. However, Walker has resigned himself to the fact there is little he can do about reports the Hornets have put him on the block before the Feb. 8 NBA trade deadline. ""I'm over it,"" Walker said. ""I'm not even thinking about it anymore. I just want to win."" Walker helped his team do just that on Monday night, scoring a game-high 26 points as the Hornets bounced back from a tough loss to beat the Sacramento Kings 112-107. Hornets owner Michael Jordan told the Charlotte Observer on Monday night that ""It's not like we are shopping him. We would not just give him up. I love Kemba Walker. I would not trade him for anything but an All-Star player."" Jeremy Lamb had 18 points, and Dwight Howard added 14 points, 16 rebounds and six blocks for the Hornets, who have won six of their last nine to improve to 19-26. Marvin Williams and Nic Batum each had 14 points. Walker made five 3s, but struggled shooting the ball over finishing 6 of 20 from the field. That all didn't matter to coach Steve Clifford, who was happy his team could get a win. ""They won at Golden State. They won at Philly. They beat Denver,"" Clifford said of the 13-33 Kings. ""It's the NBA so you have to understand this league."" The Hornets were coming off an emotionally crushing 106-105 loss to the Miami Heat on Saturday night in which they surrendered a five-point lead in the final 34 seconds and lost on a last-second free throw following a disputed call. However, they came out with a purpose against the Kings, closing the first half with an 11-2 run to build a 12-point lead at the break. They extended the lead to 20 in the second half before allowing the lead to dwindle to three with 1:25 remaining after a 3-pointer by Bogdan Bogdanovic. But there would be no collapse on this night. Howard hit two clutch free throws and Willie Cauley-Stein was called for goaltending on a put back by Howard. Walker added two more free throws after two Kings misses to push the Charlotte lead to nine with 23 seconds left. Skai Labissiere had 23 points and Buddy Hield added 18 for the Kings, who have lost eight straight games and 11 of their last 12. The Kings trailed by 20 in the third quarter, but battled back late behind Hield's shooting. He had 10 points in the fourth quarter. ""We've all got to come collectively as a group and want to win,"" Hield said. ""It's tough when you're not winning. You've got to learn how to win and it's a learning process right now how to finish games when you're down 10, 12, with five minutes to go and try to find a way to execute."" TIP INS Kings: The starting backcourt consisted of Vince Carter and De'Aaron Fox. Fox was 11 months old when Carter played in his first NBA game. ... Rookie Justin Jackson, who played at North Carolina, got a nice hand from Tar Heels fans when he checked into the game late in the first quarter. Hornets: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist did not play because of an abscess in his first arm, which meant Treveon Graham got the start this season. Kidd-Gilchrist is expected back in the starting lineup on Wednesday, Clifford said... Howard picked up his ninth technical of the season. WHEN TWO TREES COLLIDE: There was a crazy play in the third quarter when Cauley-Stein went up for a monster dunk in the lane but was rejected by Howard. However, the impact of the collision sent Howard to the floor, allowing Cauley-Stein to corral the loose ball and come back with a two-handed, hang-on-the-rim-for-emphasis dunk. GOOD FROM DEEP: The Hornets made 16 of 40 shots from 3-point range, but got plenty of open looks from deep that didn't go down. ""Just moving the basketball,"" Walker said. ""Whenever you have an open shot just being aggressive and making them. We're all creating for each other to get the best shots possible and whenever we did we just knocked them in tonight.""","400975433"
"ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Hawks are starting to see some results from their improved play. Dennis Schroder scored 20 points , Taurean Prince broke out of a slump with 17 and Kent Bazemore did a stellar job defensively, leading the Hawks past the Utah Jazz 104-90 on Monday night. Still saddled with one of the league's worst record, Atlanta (14-32) has won three of its last four, four of six and is .500 over its past 14 games. ""We've got to keep it going,"" said Prince, who matched his scoring output from the last four games combined. The Hawks began to pull away late in the third quarter, closing with a 13-3 run for a 74-63 lead that was their largest to that point. Dewayne Dedmon knocked down a 3-pointer, Malcolm Delaney converted a four-point play and Schroder scored off a couple of drives. It got totally out of hand at the start of the fourth. The Jazz missed their first five shots, and the Hawks put the game out of reach with a 10-0 spurt that included a three-point play from rookie John Collins and Bazemore's jumper beyond the arc. Atlanta led by as many as 26 in the final period . Bazemore and Marco Belinelli had 11 points apiece for Atlanta, which knocked down 12 of 26 from 3-point range . The Jazz, on the other hand, made only 4 of 15 outside the stripe. ""There were times it looked like we didn't want to play. Including me,"" said Donavan Mitchell, who was held to 13 points by Bazemore. Battling a hand injury, Prince had hit 7 of 24 shots for 17 points over the last four games. He made 6 of 11 -- including a couple of 3s -- against the Jazz. ""It's OK to get tired of yourself sometimes,"" Prince said. ""You've just to work through it. I've got to continue to take my shots and continue to play defense."" Alec Burks came off the bench to lead the Jazz with 17 points. Utah's starters combined for just 40 points. Mitchell , averaging 19.3 points a game, was limited to 5-of-13 shooting ""He's a good player,"" Bazemore said. ""I just tried to match his energy."" EXTRA POINT At the end of the first half, the officials checked out the replay of a long jumper that Belinelli took with more than four minutes to go in the second quarter. Originally ruled a 2-pointer, it was changed to a 3 after the replay showed Belinelli's foot behind the stripe. So, when the Hawks returned for the third quarter, they had a 42-41 lead instead of being tied at 41. LONG SHOT Belinelli also had the best shot of the night, though this one didn't count. After a frenetic last few seconds of the first half, in which both teams turned it over and the Jazz failed to get off a shot before the buzzer, Belinelli hurled one up from a 3-point line at his own end of the court -- about a 65-footer. Nothing but net. TIP-INS Jazz: Missed their first 10 shots but bounced back to lead 20-19 by the end of the opening period. ... Former Hawks star Joe Johnson had four points in 16 minutes. The 36-year-old Johnson played for the Hawks from 2005-12, making the All-Star game in six of seven seasons. Utah is the third team he's played for since being traded by Atlanta. ... Rudy Gobert had 10 rebounds. Hawks: Coach Mike Budenholzer picked up a technical with 3:55 left in the game with his team up by 21 points. After the Jazz made the free throw, Budenholzer yelled at official Courtney Kirkland, ""The game's not over."" ... Eight players hit 3-pointers. ... Ersan Ilyasova was held to five points but grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds. A THREE ... AND ONE MORE Both teams converted four-point plays. Just before the midway point of the first quarter, Joe Ingles hit a trey -- Utah's first points of the game -- and tacked on a free throw after being fouled by Prince. Then, late in the third quarter, Delaney swished a 3 from the corner. He was fouled by Royce O'Neale and made the free throw, giving Atlanta a 72-63 lead.","400975434"
"HOUSTON --  Chris Paul wasn't thrilled with how the Houston Rockets played Monday night. The veteran was perfectly happy with the outcome though. James Harden scored 28 points and the Rockets overcame a big early deficit to beat the Miami Heat 99-90. ""You have those games during the season where (you) win the game and move on ... out of 82 of them sometimes it's going to be ugly, but you just want to win,"" Paul said. Miami led by double digits before halftime, but the game stayed close throughout most of the second half. It was tied with about three minutes left when Harden hit a 3-pointer just before the shot clock expired. That was the start of a 7-2 run that made it 95-90 with 38 seconds left. James Johnson missed a 3-pointer on the other end, but Miami's Hassan Whiteside grabbed the rebound. Harden blocked his layup, and Houston added a dunk by Clint Capela with 18 seconds left. ""They did a really good job of trying to run you off the 3-point line,"" Harden said. ""So that was kind of tough for us tonight, but defensively that second half we locked up, controlled the game and that was it."" Whiteside led the Heat with 22 points and 13 rebounds. The team was missing Goran Dragic for the second straight game because of a bruised left knee. ""They finished and finished in high fashion, making shots, and we struggled to get clean looks on the other end,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Houston was at full strength for the first time in a while with Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green back after serving two-game suspensions for an altercation with the Clippers. Ariza had three points and five rebounds in 29 minutes, but Green did not play. Paul added 16 points as Houston won its third straight, and Eric Gordon had 16, too, despite continuing to struggle from long range. Gordon ranks fourth in the NBA with 136 3-pointers this season, but has gone a combined 0 for 16 the last two games. Houston led by 3 entering the fourth, and the teams exchanged leads several times in the first few minutes of the quarter. The Rockets led by a basket after a 3-pointer by Paul with about eight minutes left before Miami scored the next four points to go up 83-81. Houston then used a 5-1 spurt, with a 3 from P.J. Tucker and a dunk from Capela, to make it 86-84 with about five minutes left. After ending Golden State's 14-game road winning streak with a victory in their last game, the Rockets looked sluggish early in this one and trailed by 14 during the first quarter. The Heat got a boost in the first quarter from Whiteside, who scored 14 points. The Rockets got going late in the first quarter and had cut the deficit to 50-46 by halftime. ""We get an emotional victory on Saturday and then ... we just didn't come out of the gates very well,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""But after that our defense was solid ... (and) it just came down to James and Chris just creating and getting buckets."" TIP-INS Heat: Jones had three blocks. ... Josh Richardson finished with 12 points. ... Miami made 7 of 30 3-pointers. Rockets: Capela had 14 points with eight rebounds. ... Paul had six assists and five rebounds. ... Monday was Houston's first win this season when scoring below 100 points after losing the first three. ... Houston made 15 3-pointers to improve to 25-4 this season when making at last 15. PERFECTION Houston improved to 18-0 this season in games where Capela, Harden and Paul all play, including 14-0 when starting those three with Ryan Anderson and Ariza. Monday was the first time since Dec. 31 D'Antoni has been able to use that lineup. THEY SAID IT Paul on the improvement of the Heat, who have won 9 of 12: ""(Spoelstra's) really got those guys playing hard, playing with the right spirit and it was a really good test for us.""","400975435"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Marc Gasol and Tyreke Evans led the Memphis Grizzlies in scoring, yet it was the play of a recent two-way signee that provided the spark for a fourth-quarter comeback. Myke Henry connected on a 3-pointer late in the third quarter -- his first NBA points -- then added nine more points in the fourth as Memphis erased a double-digit fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 105-101 on Monday night. Henry, who was signed by the Grizzlies on Jan. 13, was 3 of 5 from the field in the fourth, including converting two of his three 3-point attempts. That and 10 fourth-quarter points from Evans, who finished with 18 points and eight assists, helped Memphis come back from 10 down with 9:45 left. Consecutive 3-pointers by Henry started the Grizzlies in the right direction. Eventually, Memphis used a 13-2 burst to take their first lead of the night. ""Life comes at you fast, and you, obviously, have to be ready for changes,"" Henry said. ""I was ready. It's been a journey, and I'm just taking it day-by-day."" Memphis took the lead for good when Gasol's 3-pointer broke a 95-all tie with 4:16 remaining. Gasol scored 19 points, Mario Chalmers added 17 points, including a pair of free throws with 6.2 seconds remaining, to seal a victory that seemed unlikely when Memphis faced a 15-point deficit late in the third and trailed 83-74 entering the fourth. ""When we were up 14 or 15 points, we come in and we let them sort of back in, get a little momentum,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said of the difference. He later added that ""we started the fourth period pretty poorly."" Dario Saric led the Sixers with 22 points and added 10 rebounds, and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarott finished with a season-high 20 points. Robert Covington added 18 points and Joel Embiid had 15 points and 14 rebounds as the Sixers ended a three-game winning streak. The Sixers hurt themselves with 10 of their 24 turnovers in the fourth. Memphis collected 20 points off Philadelphia's 10 miscues down the stretch. ""Poise. Lack of judgment. Leadership. I thought that we had not much leadership,"" Brown said of the play down the stretch. ""I thought our poise was poor."" Evans said the key for the Grizzles was young players stepping up and helping Memphis overcome the third-quarter deficit. Especially, Henry. ""He was just playing the game, taking what the defense gave him,"" Evans said, adding: ""That's the first time seeing him play like that. He helped a lot."" TIP-INS Sixers: Have reached 100 points in 34 of 43 games and 10 of last 11. ... Have lost 10 straight in the series. ... Saric has reached double figures in 24 straight games. ... Luwawu-Cabarott started his third game of the season. ... Ben Simmons, the Sixers third-leading scorer at 16.6 points a game, was limited to six points on 3 of 8 from the field. Grizzlies: G Wayne Selden received two technicals -- the second in the third quarter. ... Has a five-game home winning streak. ... Memphis shot 42 percent in the game, compared to 45 percent for Philadelphia -- only the third time this season Memphis has won when shooting a lower field goal percentage. ... The 15-point deficit was the largest the Grizzlies have overcome in a win this season. FLYING WITH THE EAGLES To no one's surprise, the Sixers have a seat on the Philadelphia Eagles bandwagon headed to the Super Bowl. The Sixers left Philly earlier than planned Sunday so they could arrive in Memphis before the NFC Championship game between the Eagles and Vikings. ""What an amazing event for (Philadelphia),"" coach Brett Brown said. He said enthusiasm is clear across the city, including during the Sixers' win at home Saturday against the Milwaukee Bucks. ""The place (was) about the blow up."" He said the atmosphere is ""just maniacal, just bananas what's going on in our city.""","400975436"
"MILWAUKEE --  Khris Middleton spent three-plus years under Jason Kidd's tutelage, blossoming into a dangerous scorer with the Milwaukee Bucks. He showed off what he learned in the Bucks' first game without Kidd. Middleton scored 35 points, Malcolm Brogdon added a career-high 32 and Milwaukee beat the Phoenix Suns 109-105 on Monday night hours after firing Kidd. ""It's tough for me,"" Middleton said. ""He took my game to another level. He took this team to a whole other level. Today was a tough day."" Assistant Joe Prunty was promoted to replace Kidd for the rest of the year. After a slow start, the Bucks heeded the new coach's call to focus. The sharpshooting Middleton couldn't miss in the final minute. Brogdon had a steal with 40 seconds left after the Bucks double-teamed guard Devin Booker in the backcourt. Brogdon lobbed a cross-court pass to Middleton, who hit a jumper from the left corner with 24 seconds left for a 105-100 lead. Middleton also hit a fade-away jumper from nearly the exact same spot with defender Isaiah Canaan in his face with 54 seconds left for a three-point edge that roused the crowd at the Bradley Center. ""We're professionals. It's about regrouping and coming out there and doing your job,"" Brogdon said. T.J. Warren had 23 points for Phoenix, which has lost four of five. Troy Daniels added 15 points on 5-of-10 shooting from 3-point territory. ""To me it felt like a playoff atmosphere game,"" Daniels said. ""They were physical, we were physical. We were right there trying to fight back."" It was an emotional night for the Bucks following the surprise firing of Kidd. His three-plus season tenure included two playoff appearances but stretches of inconsistency on both ends of the floor. Other than a 33-win season in 2015-16, the Bucks hovered around .500 under Kidd as a young core of Antetokounmpo, Middleton and Brogdon turned into top-flight players. ""He's been a great teacher for me. Mostly, I was a spot-up shooter. He allowed me to post up and expanded my game to pick-and-rolls and driving,"" Middleton said. The Suns fell to 17-30, making them an ideal opponent for the Bucks to beat in their first game under Joe Prunty, the former assistant who will replace Kidd the rest of the season. Prunty was fiery at times on the sideline and jawed with an official, a contrast from Kidd's typically mild-mannered demeanor. Middleton and Brogdon sparked the Bucks in the closing minutes by dominating in the backcourt. Eric Bledsoe added 19 points for the Bucks against his former team. He was dealt to Milwaukee earlier this season in a trade that sent Greg Monroe to Phoenix. Monroe finished with 19 points and seven rebounds. The Bucks started slow, then used a 24-10 in the first quarter to get back in the game that was tied at 53 at halftime. TIP-INS Suns: Monroe played for the first time in three games, and his 30 minutes were his most since playing 34 on Jan. 3 against Denver. Coach Jay Triano said he wanted to give a break to Tyson Chandler, the 35-year old starting center averaging about 26 minutes over his previous nine games. ""He has been going hard,"" Triano said. ""We'll give (Monroe) a chance to come back home where he was and see how he plays."" Bucks: Prunty stuck with a plan put in place by Kidd to rest Antetokounmpo for a second straight game because of knee soreness. HOT POTATO Turnovers punctuated sloppy stretches during the night, with the Bucks coughing up the ball 18 times. But Milwaukee also forced 22 turnovers, including four steals by the lightning-quick Bledsoe. ""They were more aggressive than we were. They were aimed at the ball,"" Triano said. SUN RAYS Booker was 2 of 14 from the field and finished with 14 points but added eight assists. ... F Jared Dudley had a season-high nine assists. QUOTABLE ""Once they made the decision, which was a tough one, that they did, they put the onus on the players. We understand that it's going to take us as a group collectively."" -- veteran Bucks G Jason Terry, who also played with Kidd in the NBA.","400975437"
"NEW ORLEANS -- DeMarcus Cousins considered the most impressive statistical night of his career and only half-jokingly asserted that he was most proud of the stamina he needed to log a career high of more than 51 minutes on the court. Cousins had 44 points, 24 rebounds and 10 assists, Anthony Davis scored 34, and the All-Star pair led a 17-point New Orleans comeback in the final five minutes of regulation before the Pelicans pulled out a 132-128 victory over the Chicago Bulls in double overtime Monday night. ""My strength coach had the nerve to ask me, do I want to lift after this game? I almost lost it. If I had some energy, we would have fought,"" Cousins said. ""I'm just glad it's over. Seriously. I think [the Bulls] feel the same way, too."" In between several moments of brilliance in the second overtime, Cousins' body language suggested he could barely stand. His feet hardly left the floor on a 3-pointer that rolled around the rim and in. He also managed to hit a turnaround jumper and calmly made two free throws to ice the game with 8 seconds left. Davis, who fouled out in the first overtime, called Cousins' performance ""legendary,"" adding that his fellow big man -- more than anyone -- earned the day off from practice the Pelicans were given on Tuesday. When the game was finally over, an excited Davis jumped on Cousins and wrapped his arms around his neck. ""He played his heart out,"" Davis said. Cousins became the first NBA player since Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972 to have as many as 40 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists in a game, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. Few others have done it. Cousins' assists included alley-oop lobs to Davis and a couple of long passes to him for breakaway baskets. ""You dream about moments like that as a kid -- a game coming down to the line and just making big plays down the stretch,"" Cousins said. ""I think we just willed our way through this game."" And yet Cousins' heroics nearly never happened. Even after the Pelicans' stunning 23-4 run in the last five minutes of regulation gave them a 114-112 lead on Davis' free throws with 3.2 seconds left, Chicago's Justin Holiday was fouled by Darius Miller attempting a 3-pointer in the final second of the period. Holiday's first two free throws looked perfect. His last, for the win, rattled out. ""It wasn't meant to happen,"" Holiday said. ""I had the opportunity. I don't miss free throws. Obviously after the game we can talk about things we did wrong, but when we get an opportunity like that, that's what is on my mind right now."" After Holiday had swished the second free throw, Davis recalled, ""I looked at DeMarcus and we both just shook our head with sad faces, like, 'We had this one.' ""And then he missed, and it was, 'All right. Let's go get it.'"" Jerian Grant had 22 points and 13 assists, and Robin Lopez also scored 22 for the Bulls, who appeared well on their way to their fifth victory in six games when they opened the fourth quarter with a 23-5 run to take their largest lead at 104-86. ""A lot of good things and obviously we had a chance to win it at the end,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""A lot of things we can learn as well and grow from."" TIP-INS Bulls: Lauri Markkanen had 14 points and 17 rebounds. Zach LaVine had 19 points, Holiday 15 and Nikola Mirotic 14. ... Came in having made at least 10 3s in 10 straight games and in 32 games total this season, but went 8-of-31 from deep in New Orleans. ... Chicago shot 48.9 percent (45-of-92) overall. Pelicans: E'Twaun Moore scored 15 points, including a 3 in the second overtime, to help the Pelicans win for the fifth time in six games. ... Often guarded by his brother, Jrue Holiday had one of his lowest recent scoring totals, with 12 points, after averaging 25.6 points in his previous five games. ... Miller scored 10 points. ... Won despite shooting only 41.6 percent (47-of-113). STUNNING FINISH Chicago still led by 17 when Bobby Portis hit a pair of free throws with 5:06 left in the fourth quarter, but New Orleans tied it at 110 on Jrue Holiday's 3 with 46 seconds left. Davis gave New Orleans its first lead of the fourth quarter with an alley-oop dunk of Jrue Holiday's lob. Markkanen tied it with a driving layup before Davis and Justin Holiday each hit two free throws in the final seconds. New Orleans had a chance to win at the end of the first overtime, but Ian Clark's 3-point attempt was short and Jrue Holiday's rushed putback also rattled out.","400975438"
"DALLAS --  Dennis Smith Jr. scored his first points on a 360-degree dunk before the rookie Dallas guard focused more on the bigger task: trying to slow the high-scoring Washington duo of Bradley Beal and John Wall. The Mavericks did that Monday night, holding the Wizards guards to 28 percent shooting in a 98-75 victory that completed a two-game season sweep of the Eastern Conference playoff contenders while easing Dallas' slide back toward to the bottom in the West. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle didn't want to give his players too much credit, though. ""I thought the defense certainly looks good on paper, but there were an awful lot of missed shots,"" Carlisle said. ""They had a lot of looks where we weren't in the best position possible."" Washington coach Scott Brooks agreed. ""We couldn't make a wide-open shot, couldn't make a layup, and we couldn't even make non-contested free throws,"" Brooks said. ""It was one of those nights."" Harrison Barnes had 20 points and 10 rebounds, Smith scored 17 and the Mavericks stopped their second three-game losing streak since the beginning of January. Barnes, who scored a season-best 31 points in a 113-99 win at Washington in November, was 9 of 16 from the field. Beal scored 18 and Wall had 11 -- the only double-digit scorers for the Wizards -- as the guards combined to go 8 of 29 from the field. Beal was 7 of 12 on free throws, and the Wizards were just 16 of 27 from the line. Wall, who was a game-time decision because of a migraine, missed all four of his 3-point attempts as Washington went 7 of 32 from long range (22 percent) and shot 31 percent overall. The Wizards had their second-lowest point total behind a 116-69 loss at Utah in December. ""It was a little difficult trying to play through it, but there is no excuse for the way we played or how we got our tails whooped,"" Wall said. Dirk Nowitzki had just two points when he converted a four-point play to start the fourth quarter to give Dallas its biggest lead to that point at 75-54. Nowitzki, who finished with eight points and nine rebounds, hit his 3 before the foul by Mike Scott from the same left corner where Yogi Ferrell connected at the third-quarter buzzer. Ferrell scored 14 points along with Wesley Matthews, who was 4 of 8 from 3-point range. TIP-INS Wizards: F Markieff Morris and Brooks got technicals in the first half. Morris was complaining about no-calls on fouls after he was called for one when he knocked the ball loose as Smith was going up for a dunk on a 3-on-1 break. Brooks got his in the final seconds of the half, not long after Morris was called for an offensive foul. ... Porter left with a right hip strain and didn't return. Mavericks: C Salah Mejri was ejected after getting two technicals when he kept arguing with official David Guthrie despite Matthews trying to push him away. ... G Devin Harris is in the concussion protocol and missed the game. He was injured in Saturday's loss at Portland. ... The Mavericks held an opponent to season lows in points in the first half (37) and the game. UNFRIENDLY WORDS Dallas guard J.J. Barea got a technical in the second half when he and Wall exchanged words after Barea fouled him in the fourth quarter. Asked about it afterward, Wall said, ""It was cool. It was funny. Just a little midget trying to get mad out there. I paid him no mind."" At first, Barea shrugged off the ""midget"" comment, but he got slightly more agitated the more he talked about it after the game. ""When they ask me who I don't like in the NBA, I got a guy now,"" Barea said. ""Nothing new to him. I don't think even his teammates like him."" MORE WORDS Smith and Beal ended up with their arms locked after a whistle, and stayed that way for several seconds. It led to a brief exchange, and wasn't the only time they could be seen talking during the game. ""He's just like all rookies, they hate being called rook from the get-go,"" Beal said. ""He wasn't having it, but at the end of the day, that's the title. We all went through the process at one point.""","400975439"
"DENVER --  Jamal Murray showed he can be the closer the Denver Nuggets have been looking for all season. The second-year guard scored a career-high 38 points, including a go-ahead three-point play in the final minute, and Denver beat the Portland Trail Blazers 104-101 on Monday night. After a solid rookie season, Murray has emerged as a leader this year on a team that lacks a go-to player in the fourth quarter. He embraced that role Monday in a game the Nuggets needed. ""Jamal Murray's a guy that can make (shots) throughout the game but he can also make big plays down the stretch,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""It's great to see a young, 20-year-old guard, second year in the NBA, who's not afraid of the moment."" Nikola Jokic had 16 points and 12 rebounds, and Will Barton hit four free throws in the final 10 seconds to secure the win and spoil Jusuf Nurkic's return to Denver. The Nuggets had lost six of eight. ""We needed this win,"" Murray said. ""It was a division game and we had lost a few in a row. To come out here at home and get this W, it's going to get us back started again."" Nurkic had 19 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks in his first game back at Pepsi Center. Damian Lillard had 25 points and seven assists for Portland. Nurkic played two-plus seasons with the Nuggets to begin his career, and was playing his first game in Denver since getting dealt to Portland last season. He received a smattering of boos when he was introduced as a starter and a few during the game. He said it didn't feel special to be back. ""It was just another game,"" he said. He nearly had a happy return, but the Trail Blazers couldn't hold a late lead. Lillard gave Portland a 93-86 advantage with a 3-pointer, but the Nuggets rallied to take a 97-95 lead on Mason Plumlee's dunk. CJ McCollum made two free throws and Lillard hit a running bank shot to give Portland a 99-97 lead with 41.7 seconds left. He was fouled on the play but missed the free throw. ""What bothers me the most is I've got to make that free throw,"" Lillard said. ""We were in position to win. Everybody contributed to us being in that position and I've got to be able to shut the door on them."" Murray's three-point play with 33.6 seconds remaining gave Denver back the lead. The Trail Blazers had two chances to go back in front but couldn't convert. Barton hit two free throws, and after Nurkic's dunk, sealed it with two more foul shots with 1.8 seconds left. Nurkic got going in the third quarter on both ends of the floor. He had 11 points, six rebounds and blocked Jokic's shot near the basket. Later in the possession he stole the ball from his former teammate, which led to a Portland fast break. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard was selected the Western Conference player of the week by the NBA on Monday. He averaged 29.3 points and eight assists as Portland swept its three games last week. ... The Trail Blazers had more steals (eight) than fouls (seven) in the first half. ... Portland has scored 100 or more points in 12 straight games. Nuggets: Murray's previous career high was 32 points. ... F Wilson Chandler came off the bench after starting all 42 games in which he had played this season. ... F Kenneth Faried was inactive with left ankle soreness. UPON FURTHER REVIEW Denver caught a break when the officials reversed themselves and decided to review a ruling that the Nuggets knocked the ball out of Lillard's hands with 9.2 seconds left. ""They told me they weren't going to review, so I called timeout,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""Then once I called timeout, they said they were going to review it. I probably shouldn't have called timeout."" Lillard said he was fouled on the play, but that non-call was not reversible. ""When they went to review it I knew we were going to be on the wrong side because they can't go back and change it to a foul,"" he said.","400975440"
"LOS ANGELES --  Playing short-handed, the Minnesota Timberwolves grew up a bit. Andrew Wiggins scored a season-high 40 points and Jeff Teague added 30 to help them hang on for a 126-118 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night that snapped the Wolves' four-game road skid. Without injured Jimmy Butler and Jamal Crawford, the Timberwolves overcame 56 percent shooting by the Clippers and made 33 of 39 free throws -- led by Teague's 16 of 17 -- to win for the seventh time in nine games. ""They are playing as well as anybody in the league, so to come in here and get a win, we did do a lot of good things,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We got great contributions from everybody."" Clippers coach Doc Rivers and assistant Mike Woodson were ejected with seven seconds left, two of four technicals the team received in the final 4:50. Their second straight loss dropped the Clippers into ninth place in the Western Conference, a half-game behind Denver for the final playoff spot. The Wolves led by five early in the fourth quarter only to have the game devolve into a back-and-forth affair in which neither team led by more than three until the final 2:44. That's when the Wolves pulled away to a 121-114 lead on a 3-pointer by Namanja Bjelica and five straight points by Teague. ""We just stayed aggressive, attacked the rim a lot,"" Wiggins said. Blake Griffin had a triple-double with 32 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high 12 assists for the Clippers. But he had a technical and committed two big turnovers in the closing seconds. ""I can't be the one to get a tech in the fourth quarter. I put us in a hole and sort of started the onslaught of techs in the last four minutes,"" Griffin said. ""We got good looks, a couple calls didn't go our way. At the end of the day, it wasn't the calls."" One of those calls was a 3-pointer by Lou Williams in the left corner that got waved off when Montrezl Harrell was whistled for an offensive foul with the game tied 106-all. ""That hurt,"" Griffin said. With Minnesota leading 121-118, Karl-Anthony Towns' bad pass out of bounds gave the Clippers the ball. But they lost it in a wild scramble on the floor before Griffin regained it only to get called for a double dribble. Griffin turned it over again on an out-of-bounds pass before Rivers was tossed out after assistant Sam Cassell drew a technical on the Clippers' bench. Woodson got a technical and then was booted. ""I literally got thrown out for saying, `You guys gave us some tough calls tonight,"" Rivers said. ""That was it. No swear words, nothing. ... Just like players can lose their composure, officials can lose their composure as well. Sam got a technical for saying, `Three seconds.' Blake said, `Over my back' and got a technical."" Rivers added: ""One ref told me I couldn't talk. I thought I was the head coach. As long as I'm respectful, I can say whatever I want. ... I guess you can give a guy a tech for anything."" Los Angeles was limited to one field goal over the final 2:44, when the Clippers made all four free throws. Harrell and Williams led another strong performance by the Clippers' bench, chipping in with 23 and 20 points, respectively. ""Not a great officiated game, but it happens in the NBA once in a while,"" Williams said. ""They got some calls that went their way that kind of shifted the momentum."" Towns finished with 11 points -- well below his 20.2 average -- and 17 rebounds. TRIPLE-DOUBLE Griffin notched his seventh career regular-season triple-double, and second this season. It was his third 30-point game of the season, and he just missed equaling his season high of 33 points. LOU WILL Williams has scored 20 or more points off the bench in nine straight games, the longest streak among active players and tied for the third-longest streak since 1983-84. His 473 points since Dec. 22 are the most in the NBA. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Improved to 3-0 against the Clippers this season. ... Crawford sat out with a sprained left big toe in his second game at Staples Center since leaving the Clippers as a free agent last summer. He played all 82 games last season. ""It's still sore, but it's improving,"" he said. ""I'm hopeful every day."" Clippers: C DeAndre Jordan missed his fifth straight game with a sprained left ankle, but could return soon. His next game will tie Randy Smith (715) for the most in franchise history. ... G Austin Rivers (right ankle) sat out his 10th straight game and could be two weeks from returning. ... F Danilo Gallinari (left glute) is close to coming back. ... G Jawun Evans missed the game with a sore abdominal muscle.","400975441"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- Garrett Temple took over in the fourth quarter and led the struggling Sacramento Kings to a big win. Temple scored 19 of his career-high 34 points in the final quarter to lift the Kings to a 105-99 win over the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night. Willie Cauley-Stein had 21 points and nine rebounds and Buddy Hield added 13 points for the Kings, who stopped an eight-game losing streak. Temple accounted for all of Sacramento's points during a 17-6 run that put the Kings ahead 103-97 with 23.5 seconds to go. ""Garrett was in a rhythm,"" teammate Vince Carter said. ""He was out there with veteran guys who just know how to make the right play. It was us being cognizant of `Hey, the hot guy's open, get it to him immediately.' And it worked out that way."" Temple, whose previous career best was 23 points in the fourth game of this season, started 33 games before being demoted. Against Orlando, he hit all seven field goal attempts in the fourth quarter, including three 3-pointers. The rest of the Kings were 2 for 12 in the period. ""Garrett has been a fantastic leader for us and I couldn't be happier,"" Sacramento coach Dave Joerger said. ""He's the ultimate professional. For him to have this kind of night, I'm just tickled. He deserves it."" Temple's big game came with Kings regulars Zach Randolph and George Hill out of the lineup. Evan Fournier led the Magic with 22 points and Elfrid Payton had 21 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. Aaron Gordon added 16 and Jonathon Simmons had 14 for Orlando, which struggled mightily to score in the final quarter. Magic coach Frank Vogel didn't know whether to direct his postgame ire at his team's unwillingness to guard Temple or its sloppy play offensively. The Magic were 6 of 20 from the field in the final period and committed four turnovers. ""You gotta cool a guy like (Temple) down and nobody could get it done,"" Vogel said. ""Offensively, we didn't make great decisions in the fourth quarter. Their switching turned us into one-on-one players and we're not a one-on-one team. We chose to play in traffic all night, put our he Payton's pull-up jumper with 7:13 remaining had given the Magic 91-86 lead. Orlando made just one more field goal -- a dunk by Bismack Biyombo with 5:33 left -- before Payton made a meaningless layup with under one second to play. Sacramento rallied from an 11-point third-quarter deficit to take a 94-93 lead on Temple's 3-pointer with 5:11 left in the game. Temple followed that with two perimeter jumpers and another 3-pointer to help the Kings to a 101-97 lead with 1:31 to go. The two teams played dead even for the first 30 minutes of the game before Simmons hit a hot streak that gave the Magic their biggest lead of the game, 79-68. The Magic forward scored 14 points in the third period, including three 3-pointers and a three-point play. However, as was the case all game, the Magic defense gave up the lead almost as fast as they got it. Hield started the comeback with a 3-pointer and Cauley-Stein continued to be unguardable in the paint. His dunk cut the deficit to 82-77 by the end of the third quarter. A three-point play by Skal Labissiere made it a one-point game with over minutes to play. TIP INS Kings: PG De'Aaron Fox left the game with 5:03 left in the second quarter with abdominal strain. ... PF Zach Randolph, who has started 39 games this season, was inactive. He has no injury, but didn't play for the second straight game. His replacement, Labissiere, had 10 points and nine rebounds. .

A MAGIC SOLUTION Tuesday's win over Orlando was the second time in less than a year that Sacramento ended an eight-game losing streak by beating the Magic. The Kings were on an eight-game slide last March when they beat Orlando 120-115. ""It's a happy locker room,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""We break a losing streak, but we've been getting better. We fought like crazy."" STILL MISSING VUCEVIC Orlando lost center Nikola Vucevic with a broken hand on Dec. 23 and a month later, Vogel says his team only now has adjusted to playing without a guy who has been the focal point of the team's offense for all six of his seasons in Orlando ""Basically, we lost our most complete offensive player and our identity had to change dramatically,"" Vogel said. ""We're starting to put guys in different positions where they can get comfortable with a new identity and be successful.""","400975442"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Russell Westbrook had one goal on the Thunder's final possession: make it to the rim. The Brooklyn Nets left him just enough space, and the reigning MVP put Oklahoma City over the top once again. Westbrook made a go-ahead layup with 3.3 seconds left to help the Thunder rally from a 15-point second-half deficit and beat the Nets 109-108 on Tuesday night. ""They sat in the paint all game long,"" Westbrook said. ""I was just trying a way to get to the basket."" The lead changed six times in the final 2:23. Brooklyn went ahead 108-107 on a driving layup by Spencer Dinwiddie with 7.8 seconds left, but Westbrook answered with his own. After three timeouts, Dinwiddie missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer, with the Thunder's Andre Roberson guarding him closely. Westbrook had 32 points and Paul George added 28 points and nine rebounds after being left off the NBA All-Star roster earlier in the day. Oklahoma City committed a season-low four turnovers while extending its winning streak to five games. ""I really thought this was one of the best wins we've had all year,"" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said, noting that Brooklyn made 16 3-pointers to seven for the Thunder. ""From a statistical standpoint, you don't normally win a game like that."" Joe Harris led the Nets with 19 points while Dinwiddie and DeMarre Carroll had 13 each. The Nets ended a two-game winning streak, matching their longest of the season. ""We can talk about the last plays, but I do think we gave up 35 points in the fourth quarter and made a ton of mistakes,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I loved our competitive spirit all game, how we defended, but I thought in the fourth quarter we made some fundamental mistakes."" Oklahoma City rallied with stellar 3-point shooting in the fourth quarter, going 5 of 8 after making only 2 of 17 attempts from behind the arc. Brooklyn went 10 of 18 from 3-point range in the first half and outscored the Thunder 21-10 over the final seven minutes of the half to lead 59-47 at the break. The Nets led 68-53 after two free throws by Rondae Hollis-Jefferson with 8:20 left in the third quarter. Westbrook scored eight points during a 12-0 run that cut the margin to 68-65, but 3-pointers by Harris and D'Angelo Russell helped the Nets rebuild their lead to 83-68 with 1:28 left in the quarter. They were up 85-74 going into the fourth. The Thunder's five fourth-quarter 3-pointers -- including two each by backups Raymond Felton and Patrick Patterson -- quickly closed that gap. Westbrook's 16-foot jumper with 6:13 left put Oklahoma City up 97-96 -- its first lead since the second quarter. ALL-STAR SNUB Westbrook, normally curt and brief with media after games, passionately defended George, saying it was ""unbelievable"" and ""outrageous"" that George didn't join him as an All-Star reserve. George entered the game averaging 20.8 points per game and ranked second in the NBA with 2.16 steals per game. George was gracious when discussing the situation, saying it's much tougher to make an All-Star team in the loaded Western Conference than it was in the Eastern Conference, when he was with the Indiana Pacers. ""I wasn't an All-Star to the voters or whoever that made the list,"" George said. ""Everybody that thought the same wasn't an All-Star, apparently. Life goes on."" TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn has had 22 games decided by six points or fewer, the highest total in the NBA. ... Dinwiddie, who hit a floater from 14 feet with 0.9 seconds left to give the Nets a 101-100 win at Detroit on Sunday, has made six baskets to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime this season, tied for the NBA lead. Thunder: Anthony scored 10 points and now is 30 away from becoming the 21st player to reach 25,000 career points. NEXT UP Nets: Continue their five-game trip at Milwaukee on Friday night. Thunder: Host Washington -- and former Thunder coach Scott Brooks -- on Thursday night.","400975443"
"SAN ANTONIO --  LeBron James became the youngest player ever with 30,000 career points, then got upstaged by the youngest player on the court. Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray -- a friend and mentee of James -- had 19 points, 10 rebounds and seven steals to lift San Antonio over the slumping Cleveland Cavaliers 114-102 on Tuesday night. ""He's fearless, he's not impressed,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of the 21-year-old. ""He really sets the pace for us. He's a fine defender. He's learning how to play the game and doing a fine job."" Murray, making his second start since replacing a healthy Tony Parker, needed that fortitude while battling James in the fourth quarter. He soared for a tip follow, then rose to disrupt James' driving layup, which led to a 3-pointer by Danny Green that gave the Spurs a 105-94 lead with 4:20 remaining. ""(Murray) was great,"" said LaMarcus Aldridge, who had 30 points for San Antonio after being selected as an All-Star reserve earlier in the day. ""He's very athletic and he brings something at that position that we haven't had in a while. I was proud of him down the stretch. I thought he kind of grew up tonight."" James had 28 points while becoming the seventh member of the 30,000-point club, yet he couldn't keep the Cavaliers from dropping their 10th in 13 games. ""I don't ever fully appreciate what I do anytime I accomplish something, no matter if it's a win or a loss,"" James said. ""I'm looking forward to the moment when I can be done with the game and I can sit back with my family and my friends and we can drink some wine and talk about all the accomplishments that I had and feats I was able to accomplish."" Murray's effort helped San Antonio push past Cleveland in a battle between teams entangled in turmoil. The Spurs denied reports that injured superstar Kawhi Leonard is unhappy with how the team is handling his right quadriceps tendinopathy and wants to be traded. The Cavaliers, meanwhile, acknowledged reports that they held a team meeting to address Kevin Love's early exit due to illness from a blowout loss at Oklahoma City and his subsequent absence from the following day's practice. The airing of grievances eventually focused on the team's poor play, which included a 148-124 loss to the Thunder on Saturday. ""If you're going to speak out and talk, you've got to back it up and we didn't do that tonight,"" Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said. ""We talked about that this morning."" Love said the Cavs have a history of thriving on chaos, and they seemed to put the dysfunction aside early as James got the seven points he needed to reach his milestone. After missing his first two midrange jumpers and a pair of free throws, James made two driving layups and a 20-footer, and then rose above Green for a 19-foot jumper with one second remaining in the first quarter to reach the mark. The shot put Cleveland up 29-25. At 33 years and 24 days, James is the youngest player to get 30,000. Bryant was 34 years and 104 days when he got there. ""It's just a special moment,"" James said. ""It's something I never set out to do. I'm not even a score-first guy when it comes to playing basketball. I love getting my teammates involved and seeing my teammates be excited about scoring and me getting assists. For me to sit here and be the youngest player ever to reach 30,000 ... I put a lot of work into my game and it's been a byproduct of that."" TIP-INS Cavaliers: With 30,021 points, James joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 points), Karl Malone (36,928), Kobe Bryant (33,643), Michael Jordan (32,292), Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) and Dirk Nowitzki (30,808) on the list. ... Iman Shumpert returned after missing two months following arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. He played seven minutes Nov. 27 against Philadelphia in his previous appearance. ... Cleveland's bench is averaging a franchise best 41.1 points per game this season. ... The Cavs have allowed 100 points in four straight games. Spurs: Aldridge is the first Spurs player who didn't play his rookie season in San Antonio to make the All-Star team since Artis Gilmore in 1986. ... San Antonio is 38-7 at home against Cleveland. ... Pau Gasol did not play after spraining his right wrist against Indiana on Sunday. ... The Spurs have had at least one player selected for the All-Star Game in 39 of 41 years, missing out in 1989 and 1997. A CHANGE IS COMING After resisting making a change to the starting lineup, Lue said he is ready to do so. ""I'm going to make a change,"" Lue said, but declined to specify the move. NO RELATIONSHIP STATUS UPDATE Popovich denied reports that Leonard's relationship with the team had soured and that he wanted to be traded from the only franchise he has played with. ""I don't even know why you would ask that,"" Popovich said. ""(The relationship is) no different than it has been for the whole time he's been here."" ON-THE-JOB TRAINING James gave Murray some advice after the lanky point guard fouled the Cavaliers' veteran under the basket in the fourth quarter. ""`Great D, don't reach at the end,"" Murray recalled James saying. ""That was a mental thing for me.""","400975444"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Kevin Durant mouthed off to official James Williams, got tossed late and might have cost himself another assist during a career night of dishing out the ball. ""I told him he was wrong,"" Durant said afterward of arguing with Williams in the first half over a carry. Stephen Curry scored 17 of his 32 points in the third quarter to go with seven assists and six rebounds, and the Golden State Warriors used a big second half to beat the New York Knicks 123-112 on Tuesday night. Durant added 14 points, a career-high 14 assists and two blocks before his ejection with 2:50 left for a second technical. Zaza Pachulia added 13 points in Golden State's seventh straight victory in the series. ""Second half, his whole thing was like he's trying to get me. ... He was searching for me, he's looking to try to tech me up to get me back because he's still got his feelings hurt from the first half,"" Durant said. ""That's what's been going on around the league the whole year, a bunch of that. ""I gotta keep my head a little bit but I was upset. I'm a human being, too, I get upset,"" Durant added. Curry made 8 of 15 from deep while sporting sneakers featuring the faces of his daughters Riley and Ryan and the message ""I can do all things."" ""I had those in my closet for a while and it's actually something with (Under Armour) you can obviously design your shoes so I did it a long time ago,"" Curry said. ""Just walked by `em today and was like, `all right, let me go back and rock the Curry 1s with my daughters on the side to give me a little inspiration.' It's nice being home and all that kind of stuff."" The Warriors bounced back from Saturday's eight-point defeat at Houston to improve to 10-0 following a loss this season. Michael Beasley scored 21 points and Courtney Lee contributed 20 as New York lost for the third time in four games and sixth in eight. ""We got lucky a little bit in the first half,"" Lee said. ""They were missing a lot of opens shots, and then in the second half those shots that they were missing went down and we weren't able to get stops and get out and convert on those opportunities."" The Warriors opened the third on a 16-9 burst to lead for the first time all night, then went on to score 100 or more points for a 14th straight game. Draymond Green had 12 points, six assists and five rebounds as the Warriors finished with 40 assists. Curry and Thompson shot a combined 4 for 16 in the first half, including 2 of 10 on 3s, before Curry found his stroke and wound up 9 for 19 overall in his 14th 30-point performance of the season. Thompson struggled to nine points on 4-for-10 shooting, missing all three of his 3-point tries. The Knicks made 11 of their initial 20 shots while the Warriors began 8 of 18 and 1 for 8 from behind the arc to fall behind 29-19 -- Curry missed four of his first five field goals. Andre Iguodala, who had dealt with a bruised left calf that kept him out the previous two games, returned to the Warriors rotation and scored five points in 20 minutes off the bench. ALL KINDS OF ALL-STARS Green and Thompson were named All-Star reserves, joining Curry -- a captain -- and Durant. The Warriors became the first team in NBA history to have four All-Stars in back-to-back seasons. It will be the ninth time in NBA history that a team has had four All-Stars play in the game. ""For us to all go is pretty special,"" Thompson said. ""First time in NBA history to have four guys go two years in a row is incredible."" Golden State had the same four All-Stars a year ago. ""I'm proud of them, amazing to have four All-Stars two years in a row,"" Kerr said. ""We're obviously really lucky to have these guys all together at once on the roster. What I love is they're so unselfish, they play together so well. That's why they're all All-Stars. It wouldn't work if they were selfish and looking for their own shot, looking for their own points."" TIP-INS Knicks: F Kristaps Porzingis was held out with left knee irritation. ... The Knicks dropped to 3-7 on the road vs. the Western Conference. ... New York's 14 turnovers led to 16 Golden State points. Warriors: Durant notched his 16th career double-double of points and assists. ... Rookie Jordan Bell missed his second straight game with inflammation in his left ankle. ...

QUOTEABLE Three years after Thompson's 37-point quarter on Jan. 23, 2015, against the Kings, Kerr recalled the moment. ""It was almost surreal, the frenzy. It was the combination of Klay going crazy and licking his chops and his teammates and the joy that they had for him and with him,"" Kerr said. ""They were just hunting shots for him. It was like a pack of hyenas.""","400975445"
"LOS ANGELES --  Kyle Kuzma scored 17 points in the fourth quarter, showing off a spectacular array of big shots and slick passes. And if Boston's Marcus Smart hadn't missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer, it still wouldn't have been enough for a win because the Los Angeles Lakers couldn't hit their free throws down the stretch. ""That's why we've got practice tomorrow,"" Kuzma said with a grin. The Lakers still have much to learn, but they took another major step with a victory in this hallowed NBA rivalry. Kuzma scored 28 points and the surging Lakers sent the Celtics to their fourth consecutive loss, 108-107 Tuesday night. Jordan Clarkson scored 22 points in the sixth consecutive home win by the Lakers, who have won three straight and seven of nine overall during their best stretch of the season. Kuzma hit five 3-pointers and dominated down the stretch, yet Los Angeles nearly gave it away by missing 10 of its 17 free throws in the fourth quarter, including four in the final 20 seconds. The Lakers are the NBA's worst team at the free-throw line and also at the 3-point line, where Kuzma's teammates were a combined 2 for 19 -- which made this win all the more improbable to coach Luke Walton. ""I have confidence that those guys that missed them tonight will make them in the future,"" Walton said. ""But hopefully we can remedy that sooner rather than later."" Kyrie Irving scored 33 points for the Eastern Conference-leading Celtics, who opened a four-game road trip by extending their longest losing streak in nearly two years. Smart added 22 points and led the Celtics back. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed two free throws for Los Angeles with 5.7 seconds left, but Smart's final miss over Caldwell-Pope's defense allowed Los Angeles to snap a four-game losing streak against Boston. ""It was a great game for us to learn from,"" Irving said. ""Minor details, you know? Getting offensive rebounds and blocking out. Taking opportunities to force them into tough shots."" Irving led the Celtics back within two points late, but Kuzma and Julius Randle came up with big baskets on offensive rebounds. Smart then hit two free throws for Boston with 19.2 seconds left after Josh Hart missed two for LA, trimming the lead to 106-105. Clarkson hit two free throws, and Terry Rozier hit a twisting layup with seven seconds left before Caldwell-Pope's misses. TIP-INS Celtics: Al Horford returned with 13 points and 12 rebounds after missing the last game in the concussion protocol after taking an elbow to the head. ... Boston beat the Lakers 107-96 on Nov. 8. Lakers: Caldwell-Pope (right heel) and Brandon Ingram (sprained left ankle) played after being questionable before game time. Ingram had seven points on 2-for-11 shooting. ... Kuzma has 15 20-point games this season, the most by a Lakers rookie since Eddie George in 1995. ... Fans near courtside included Ryan Leaf, Dodgers stars Kenley Jansen and Yasiel Puig, and comedian Nick Kroll. HAYWARD HERE Gordon Hayward was with the Celtics after traveling to Los Angeles last week. He will stay in town for the next 7-10 days to continue his rehabilitation from his horrifying left ankle injury just five minutes into the season. Boston coach Brad Stevens said the move is designed ""just to mix it up"" during Hayward's extensive rehab, which is still proceeding on schedule. Stevens said Hayward could begin traveling with the team full-time by early March as he continues to work toward a return. Until then, he'll watch practice from the sidelines while staying as stationary as possible. ""He's a really good spot-up shooter,"" Stevens said with a grin. KUZMAGIC Kuzma, the Lakers' impressive rookie forward from Utah, had his best offensive game since Christmas. He put the Lakers ahead during a 3  1/2-minute stretch of the fourth quarter with 13 points and a behind-the-back assist to Larry Nance Jr. for a dunk that brought Staples Center to its feet. He added four rebounds and three assists without and turnover and did it all in less than 27 minutes of play. ""His fourth quarter was incredible,"" Walton said. BALL OUT Lonzo Ball missed his fifth consecutive game with a sore left knee for the Lakers, but they've developed a solid offensive approach in the absence of the rookie point guard. Replacements Tyler Ennis and Alex Caruso contributed little offensively, but Clarkson had another outstanding playmaking game, and Randle contributed 14 points and 14 rebounds.","400975446"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  DeMarcus Cousins told Jrue Holiday it was time to take over. Holiday did just that, scoring 19 points -- including two baskets off drives on back-to-back possessions in the final 2  1/2 minutes -- to propel the Pelicans to a 101-96 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night. Davis scored 19 points and DeMarcus Cousins had 16 points and 13 rebounds as New Orleans won for the sixth time in seven games. Cousins said he noticed late in the game that Hornets center Dwight Howard would not leave him to help, so he urged Holiday to take his man 1-on-1, knowing there would be nobody to help on defense. ""That's their rim protector, that's the guy to clog up the paint for them,"" Cousins said. ""You can tell his main concern was to make sure I didn't score. He wanted it to be a tough night for me offensively and we just kind of took advantage of it. I noticed it and I told Jrue `the paint was wide open.' Jrue's a big guard. I don't think anybody in the league can guard him 1-on-1 and I told him `just take advantage of it."" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said he liked the way Holiday attacked the rim. ""The one thing Demarcus kept saying to us was that we have to have the guards drive it because Dwight would not leave my body,"" Gentry said. ""Because Demarcus has the range to shoot 3s, he stayed into his body so Jrue was able to turn the corner and get to the basket."" Howard had 22 points and 16 rebounds in his 1,000th career game to lead the Hornets, who fell to 2-2 on the five-game homestand. With 2:14 left, Holiday drove left through the lane and a made a tough contested shot over Nic Batum to give New Orleans the lead. After a turnover by the Hornets, Holiday took Michael Kidd-Gilchrist to the hole and scored again. Batum answered with a 3 from the wing to cut the lead to one with one minute remaining -- but that was as close as the Hornets would get. Holiday and Davis both made a pair of free throws to push the Pelicans' lead to four before Kemba Walker turned the ball over on a poor entry pass with 10 seconds left, sealing Charlotte's fate. TIP INS Pelicans: Jameer Nelson had two big 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter to give the Pelicans a boost. Hornets: Howard is battling for the league lead in technical fouls with 10, one behind Golden State's Draymond Green, who has 11. ... Walker became only the second Hornets player with 900 career 3-pointers. The other is Dell Curry (929). ... NBA Hall of Famer David Thompson was on hand for the game. HOWARD'S LONGEVITY: Hornets coach Steve Clifford said one of the reasons Howard is still playing at a high level in his 14th season is how well he's taken care of himself. ""It's easy to forget this is a guy that had had significant injury issues,"" Clifford said. ""He had major back surgeries last year in Orlando and he's had a knee problem since he was in high school, so it just speaks to how badly he wants to keep playing at a high level."" DISAPPOINTED FOR DRUMMOND: Howard said he was disappointed to see Detroit's Andre Drummond was left off the All-Star team despite averaging an NBA-best 15 rebounds per game. ""He is playing unbelievable basketball,"" Howard said. ""Fifteen rebounds is a lot of rebounds. When I came into the league 13 was the highest and for a guy to have 15 or rebounds every night and not be in the All-Star game was disappointing."" KEMBA NO CALL: With less than a minute to play, Walker drove to the basket but didn't get a call. It turned out to be a crucial play. ""It's a judgment call, but there was definitely contact on that drive,"" Clifford said.","400975447"
"DETROIT --  Ricky Rubio was inbounding from the left corner -- not the easiest angle for the most important pass of the game. ""We were trying to get the ball to Donovan (Mitchell), but Joe (Ingles) was so open,"" Rubio said. ""He was one of the options, too, and we found it and it worked."" Ingles made a tying layup in the final seconds of regulation, then added two straight 3-pointers in overtime to lift the Utah Jazz over the Detroit Pistons 98-95 on Wednesday night. The Pistons lost their sixth straight by blowing a nine-point lead late in the fourth quarter. Detroit had a chance to tie at the end of overtime, but Tobias Harris missed from the left corner, and the rebound went out of bounds off the Pistons. Andre Drummond had 30 points and 24 rebounds for Detroit, and he fueled a 10-0 run that put the Pistons ahead 88-79, but Utah closed strong in the fourth. Down by two, Mitchell had a spinning, driving shot blocked out of bounds by Drummond with 5.9 seconds remaining. After a timeout, the Jazz had to inbound from over in the corner. Mitchell cut toward the basket from the left side, then circled back toward the top of the key. Ingles then made his own cut along that same path with Detroit's Stanley Johnson trailing him. Drummond was patrolling the area around the basket, but he was a few feet from the hoop. Rubio had a clear lane to pass to Ingles, who caught the ball under the basket and was able to lay it in before Drummond could recover and block the shot. ""They just did a good job reading it,"" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. ""We thought Joe might get a late look. We wanted Donovan and Joe Johnson involved in the play as well, but Ricky found Joe (Ingles). It was a heck of a pass, and Joe made a good cut."" That layup tied it at 89, and Luke Kennard's perimeter shot at the other end missed. Drummond opened the scoring in overtime, but Ingles made his two 3-pointers and Mitchell added one of his own to put the Jazz up 98-91. ""We had a great look to win it at the end of the fourth and a great look to tie it at the end of overtime, but we didn't make anything,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. MILESTONE Drummond surpassed 2,000 offensive rebounds for his career. At 24, he became the youngest player to reach the mark. Dwight Howard and Moses Malone did it at 25. Drummond was left off the All-Star team this week, and a message Tuesday night on his Twitter account -- ""Guess I gotta start doing back flips after every point I score to get attention around here!"" -- suggested he wasn't thrilled with being passed over. He played a terrific game Wednesday, scoring the first seven points of Detroit's big fourth-quarter run. ""Andre did everything for us tonight, but the rest of us have to give him more support,"" teammate Anthony Tolliver said. COMEBACK Down nine with 3:17 to play, the Jazz scored eight straight points to get back in it. Rubio then had a pass stolen, but Drummond made only one of two free throws with 11.8 seconds left, and Utah got the ball back down two. TIP-INS Jazz: Mitchell and Rudy Gobert scored 15 points each. Rubio had 11 points and 10 rebounds. ... Rodney Hood (lower leg) did not play. ... Rubio went to the locker room with 5:31 left in the fourth when he appeared to be bleeding around the eye.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo decided to share Wednesday night's All-Star selection party with his teammates. They joined right in. A night after the announcement came, Oladipo had 21 points and nine assists to help the Pacers pull away from the Phoenix Suns 116-101. ""I drew a lot of attention and guys were open. When my teammates are playing well, shooting the ball well, it makes it that much easier for me and everyone else,"" Oladipo said. ""When we play as a unit on both ends of the floor we're really effective."" Indiana was efficient and dominant despite playing without two starters. The Pacers never trailed, never allowed the Suns to get closer than 10 points after the first quarter, built a 38-point lead in the third and still led by 27 with 4:41 left to play. Five Pacers scored in double figures and Oladipo wasn't even Indiana's top scorer. Thaddeus Young had 22 points. Sure, Phoenix looked like a team ready to head home following the final stop on a four-game road trip. But Oladipo and the Pacers took full advantage with a devastating one-two combination: a 13-4 scoring flurry to end the first half and a 16-2 spurt to start the second. That made it 79-44, all but assuring Indiana of its fifth win in six games and its second double-digit victory over Phoenix in 10 days. ""They were a physical team, and we didn't match their physicality,"" Suns coach Jay Triano said. ""For us to compete with a team like this we've got to have everybody play well and it didn't happen."" Josh Jackson scored 20 points and Greg Monroe had 16 points and a season-high 17 rebounds for the Suns, who have lost two straight and five of six. The Suns started the second half with three turnovers and five missed shots before making their first basket -- Jackson's 3-pointer to cut the deficit to 79-49 with 7:24 left in the third. Phoenix only managed to make the score more respectable by finishing the game on a 16-4 run. TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix was 9 of 35 on 3-pointers but still extended the league's longest active streak of consecutive games with a 3 to 1,106. Dallas holds the NBA record at 1,108. ... Devin Booker and Troy Daniels each scored 19 points. Pacers: Bojan Bogdanovic scored 17 points and grabbed seven rebounds while Al Jefferson had 10 points. ... Lance Stephenson had seven points, nine rebounds and four assists. ... The 15-point victory coupled with last week's 23-point rout gave Indiana its most lopsided season sweep over Phoenix in franchise history. ... The Pacers shot 56.2 percent from the field and are 16-0 when topping 50 percent this season. SHORT-HANDED Pacers guard Joe Young made his first career start because point guard Darren Collison was out for personal reasons. McMillan made the announcement shortly before the tip but provided no details about why Collison was out or how many games he might miss. Young had six points. Starting center Myles Turner also sat out again, missing his eighth straight with an injured right elbow. Turner's replacement, Domantas Sabonis, was selected for the Rising Stars Challenge game Wednesday and finished with 19 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Indiana also lost backup forward TJ Leaf with a sprained right ankle early in the second quarter. He did not return. HE SAID IT ""This was an embarrassing game,"" Booker said. ""I'm not sure how many transition points they had, I'm sure it was a lot. A lot more than we had.""","400975449"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Ben Simmons wasn't among the players selected as an All-Star Game reserve -- and the rookie showed what the league will be missing. Simmons had 19 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists for his fifth triple-double of the season to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 115-101 victory over the Chicago Bulls. Dario Saric added 21 points and 10 rebounds and Joel Embiid had 22 points for the 76ers, who have won seven of 10. ""I wish I did make it,"" Simmons said, ""but hopefully there will be plenty more years."" Embiid, picked to be a starter for the Eastern Conference last week, thinks the omission spurred Simmons. ""He was focused,"" Embiid said. ""He just wanted it."" Philadelphia played without guards JJ Redick (left leg), T.J. McConnell (personal) and Jerryd Bayless (left wrist), but Simmons picked up the slack. The rookie was just two assists away from a triple-double in the first half when he helped the 76ers to a 55-41 halftime lead with 11 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. His slam dunk with 7:40 left in the third quarter was part of a dominating period for Philadelphia. Embiid's 3-pointer with 4:23 left in the third stretched the 76ers' lead to 25 points at 79-54. Embiid threw his hands up to get an already excited Philadelphia sports crowd even more revved up. Philadelphia has had difficulty protecting late leads this season and blew a 15-point second-half advantage in Monday's 105-101 loss at Memphis, but the 25-point cushion was more than enough for the hot-shooting 76ers. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown ostensibly called out Simmons and Embiid after the loss to the Grizzlies, saying, ""Our stars weren't stars tonight."" He had praise for them following Wednesday's victory. ""They were really good tonight, and they were really good in the areas we needed them to be,"" he said. Bobby Portis scored 22 points and Zach LaVine had 21 for the Bulls. The Bulls, who began play five games behind the eighth-place 76ers in the East, have been playing better basketball of late. But Chicago still could have been reeling from Monday's 132-128 double-overtime loss to New Orleans in which the Bulls blew an 18-point fourth-quarter lead. ""There was probably a little hangover from that game, but you can't let it affect the way you play,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I don't think we came out with any grit, toughness tonight. It just kind of became `my-turn shot.' A guy took a bad one and he said, `Well, if he's going to take a bad one, I'm going to take a bad one.' It just kind of trickled down."" RISING STARS Chicago did get some good news before the game as Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen were selected by the league's assistant coaches to the Rising Stars game, which features first- and second-year players and will be played on Feb. 16. Dunn will play on the U.S. team while Markkanen will compete for the World squad. Embiid, Simmons and Saric will team with Markkanen on the World team in the Rising Stars game. FLY, EAGLES, FLY With Philadelphia set to play the Patriots next week in the Super Bowl, the crowd erupted in several E-A-G-L-E-S! chants during the game. ""I was happy,"" Embiid said. ""Got one more game. Saint Nick (Foles) did a great job."" TIP-INS Bulls: Ryan Arcidiacono, who played college ball at nearby Villanova, received a loud cheer when he entered with 3:13 left in the first quarter. ... Dunn (concussion) missed his third straight game. 76ers: Former Phillies left-hander Cole Hamels got a standing ovation when he was introduced in the second quarter. ... Former heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield and NFL Hall of Famer Franco Harris sat a few seats from each other courtside. ... Philadelphia made 16 3-pointers, finishing 16 for 32.","400975450"
"ATLANTA --  On a night starter Jonas Valanciunas earned credit for setting a high-energy tone in a runaway win, Toronto coach Dwane Casey still criticized a lackadaisical final few minutes from his backups. The explanation from Casey was simple: ""We're building for something bigger."" Valanciunas had 16 points and 13 rebounds, and the rested Raptors used strong 3-point shooting to beat the Atlanta Hawks 108-93 on Wednesday night. Playing in their first game since Saturday's loss at Minnesota, Toronto made 14 3-pointers, including eight in the first half. The Raptors improved to 25-6 when making at least 10 3s this season. Toronto's big lead was 32 points, but Atlanta's reserves, led by rookie John Collins' 13 points and career-high 16 rebounds, had the stronger finish to the game. ""It was a letdown at the end,"" Casey said. ""I was disappointed at the way that last group went in. It's a game of habits and that's what I just told the young guys. ... You create bad habits and it shows up in weird places."" Casey wants his players to win home-court advantage throughout the conference playoffs. The Raptors entered the game 1  1/2 games behind Boston in the race for the No. 1 seed in the East. Fred VanVleet added 19 points off the bench and All-Star starter DeMar DeRozan had 14 as Toronto moved to 3-0 against Atlanta this season. The Raptors won the first two games of the season series by an average of 23.5 points. ""It feels like this year they've played really, really well against us,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I think you have to give them credit whey we have not played well."" Dennis Schroder led Atlanta with 20 points. Kent Bazemore had 13 points. The Raptors had good reason to feel comfortable. They arrived in Atlanta on Sunday and in a rarity had time to focus on fundamentals in two practices. ""We tried to focus on getting back to the basics,"" said Jakob Poeltl, who had six points. ""... I think it showed tonight."" Toronto had 12 blocks and 10 steals. Before the game, Casey wasn't sure what to expect following the unusually long rest. ""It's an unknown,"" Casey said. ""Hopefully it's good, the break is good, but sometimes rust is something else, too, when you get out of game rhythm."" The Raptors showed no rust. They were never threatened after stretching their lead to 17-6 with an 11-0 run, capped by Serge Ibaka's 3-pointer, in the first quarter. TIP-INS Raptors: Valanciunas reached double-double status with his rebound and jam midway through the third period. ... VanVleet finished three points shy of his career high of 22 points against Cleveland on Jan. 11. ... The Raptors coasted despite their two All-Stars, DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, combining to make only 7 of 22 shots. Lowry had nine points while making 3 of 10 shots. Hawks: F DeAndre Bembry is expected to miss another one to three weeks after an MRI revealed a left adductor strain. He suffered the groin strain on Jan. 5 ... Schroder matched his career high with eight rebounds. NO HARM Following a video review, officials ruled no flagrant foul after Schroder had contact with Lowry in the third quarter, knocking Lowry to the floor. ROOKIE HONOR Collins will represent the U.S. team in the Rising Stars game as part of All-Star weekend on Feb. 9 in Los Angeles. Collins is averaging 10.6 points and 6.9 rebounds and has made 59 percent of his shots from the field. Collins called the honor ""truly a blessing. This is something I've been working for all year. ... It will be fun."" FREE SANDWICH The biggest cheer of the night from the home fans came in the final minute. The Hawks offered every fan a free Chick-fil-A sandwich if a visiting player missed two straight free throws. With 34.9 seconds remaining, cheers began when Lucas Nogueira hit the rim on his first free throw. He drew iron again on his second miss, earning an unexpected ovation.","400975451"
"DALLAS --  James Harden is an All-Star for the sixth straight season. New Houston teammate Chris Paul will miss the February party for the second year in a row following nine consecutive appearances for the Western Conference. The Rockets aren't exactly pleased about the Paul part. ""He averages what 19 (points) and nine assists?"" Harden asked after getting 25 points and 13 assists in a 104-97 win over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night. ""What are we rewarding? We're winning and he's putting up the numbers, there's no question. ""Obviously, we have a lot of depth on this team, but I'm not doing it out there by myself. He's controlling the games as well."" Paul scored 12 points with seven rebounds and four assists as the Rockets beat their Texas rivals for the sixth straight time. The streak started with a four-game sweep last season. Houston won its fourth straight game and seventh in the past nine. After missing the first 14 games with a left knee injury, Paul later sat another three with a left abductor strain. But the Rockets are 24-5 in games he has played, and won his first 15 starts. He is averaging 18.8 points, 8.8 assists, 5.9 rebounds and 1.9 steals per game. ""People that should be watching games don't watch the games and see how important a guy is,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said before the game. ""It's perplexing."" Wesley Matthews matched a pair of season highs with 29 points and seven 3-pointers for the Mavericks, who lost for the seventh time in 10 games since a season-best four-game winning streak that helped lift them out of last place in the West. Trevor Ariza had 23 points and Eric Gordon scored 17 on 4-of-7 shooting from beyond the arc. Southwest Division-leading Houston was up and down from beyond the arc, going 10 of 14 in the first quarter and 2 of 15 in the second. The Rockets finished two shy of their season high in 3s, going 21 of 51. Harden shot 6 of 10 and Ariza was 5 of 14, missing his last four. Chris Paul went 3 of 8. ""It was a tough game and we were playing from behind,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We got up 3-0 and things look pretty promising at the moment and then it was just like boom, boom, boom."" Ariza, who combined with Harden and Chris Paul to go 9 of 10 from 3-point range in the first quarter, was suspended two games for entering the Clippers' locker room after a feisty game in Paul's first game against his former team since the offseason trade that sent him to Houston. Clint Capela had 16 points and 13 rebounds. That included an alley-oop dunk on a pass from near midcourt by Harden in the fourth quarter, when the Rockets took their biggest lead at 20 after a 15-point edge in the first 6 minutes was cut to six at halftime. TIP-INS Rockets: Capela extended a career best with his 11th straight double-digit scoring game, and the Rockets improved to 16-2 when he scores at least 15. ... Houston was just 11 of 23 on free throws, in part because Harden, an 87 percent free-throw shooter, matched his season low with two attempts. Mavericks: G Yogi Ferrell scored 19, going 4 of 5 from long range. ... Matthews was 7 of 14 from 3. ... Rookie PG Dennis Smith Jr. was chosen for the Rising Stars game. Smith is among rookie leaders in points, assists and steals. ... G Kyle Collinsworth was signed to a second 10-day contract. ... G Devin Harris, who has been in the concussion protocol, missed his second straight game and will be out at least two more, Carlisle said. LOOK OUT ABOVE Harden's half-court lob to Capela for the dunk surprised D'Antoni, and one of his opponents. ""I just looked at him like, `That was ridiculous, he can't do that.' It was just so good,"" D'Antoni said. ""Even Wesley Matthews just like looked at him, `Are you kidding me? You're half court and you do that?' It's just a great play."" QUIET DALLAS FRONTCOURT Dirk Nowitzki scored seven points in a season-low 15 minutes, including just 4 minutes in the second half. Fellow starter and leading scorer Harrison Barnes had a quiet 10 points. Carlisle said Nowitzki wasn't feeling well. ""It was a stomach thing or something like that,"" Carlisle said.","400975452"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  LaMarcus Aldridge took a night off to rest, and the San Antonio Spurs replaced his 22.5-point average with a balanced attack. Pau Gasol ended an assist short of a triple-double, Patty Mills scored 15 points and San Antonio beat the Memphis Grizzlies 108-85 on Wednesday night, with eight Spurs finishing in double figures. ""We shared the ball, it was great ball movement, 29 assists, a lot of guys in double figures,"" said Gasol, who finished with 14 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists. ""When (Aldridge is) not in the lineup, we just try to maybe create more ball movement, more motion, more flow and then the offense balances itself out."" Bryn Forbes and Danny Green also finished with 14 points each. Davis Bertans and Dejounte Murray each had 11 points. Memphis led only once in the game, after scoring the opening basket, and the Spurs led by 17 early in the fourth. Memphis cut the advantage to single-digits only once the rest of the way, with about eight minutes left. The Spurs answered with the next six points, including four from Tony Parker to take the lead to 91-76 with about six minutes to go. Memphis was playing short-handed with several players dealing with injuries and illness, meaning more playing time for the Grizzlies younger players. They got a firsthand look at the Spurs character. ""It's a clinic on how to play the game the right way,"" Memphis interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""When you watch them play, it's amazing that it is so unique to our league. ... The ball moves, they move. Doesn't matter who shoots it, they just throw the ball to the open man. ""It sounds so simple, but it's the way the game is supposed to be played."" Marc Gasol led the Grizzlies with 18 points and seven rebounds, while Deyonta Davis added 12 points. Dillon Brooks finished with 10 points as the Grizzlies were hampered by 43 percent shooting, including 2 of 18 from outside the arc, and 18 turnovers. ""We weren't following the game plan,"" Brooks said. ""... We didn't compete hard enough on both ends. Very lackadaisical out there. Need to change that around."" Spurs: Joffrey Lauvergne made his first four shots and finished with 10 points. His eight rebounds were a season high. ... Rudy Gay, Manu Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard also sat out for San Antonio, each dealing with long-term injuries. ... Bertans started his second game of the season. ... Pau Gasol is 17-10 in games against his younger brother Marc. ... Spurs are 28-1 when outshooting their opponents. ... Have won five straight against the Grizzlies.

The two 3-ponters was a season low. ... Missed all 11 of their 3-pointers in the second half. CHANGING OF THE GUARDS Murray, who had a career-high seven assists, started his third straight game after replacing veteran Tony Parker in the lineup. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich spoke highly of the way Parker handled the change. ""He was great,"" Popovich said of Parker. ""He thought it was good for the team, and giving Dejounte a chance to see what he could do. He was mature, and really made it easy on me to make a decision like that. He was fantastic."" RISING STAR Before the game, it was announced that Brooks, the Grizzlies rookie forward, was named to the Rising Stars World Team for All-Star weekend. Brooks is a native of Canada. ""It feels amazing,"" he said, later adding: ""It feels good to be recognized with all the best rookies.""","400975453"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard figured Portland's 43-point third quarter against Minnesota might be the best span for the Blazers in recent memory. Lillard had 31 points a day after getting his third All-Star nod and the Trail Blazers beat the Timberwolves 123-114 on Wednesday night. He called that third quarter a ""showcase."" It was the most points Portland has had in a single quarter all season. ""When we watch film and when we're in training camp and stuff like that, if we could just watch that whole quarter, they'd say, `This is how we want to play, this is how the ball needs to move, this is how we need to screen, this is the pace we need to have. And what's going to allow us to do that is defending the way we did,"" said Lillard, who had 13 of his points during the period. CJ McCollum added 28 points in Portland's seventh straight win at home, longest streak of the season. Lillard made six 3-pointers and the Blazers had 17 3s in the game, one shy of their season high. Andrew Wiggins had 24 points for the Timberwolves, who had won seven of their last nine games but trailed by 19 points early in the fourth quarter. Lillard was named as an All-Star reserve Tuesday. He also spoke to reporters before the game about making the team after being snubbed in past years. ""It's not my first All-Star game. But I did have to make this one happen. Everybody knows that the last two years I felt like I should have made it and I didn't. But I just had to keep on playing, stay with it and stay positive,"" he said. Minnesota didn't have Jimmy Butler, who missed a third straight game with a sore right knee. Jamal Crawford returned after missing two games with a strained big toe on his left foot. ""We've got to be able to play through any situation,"" Karl-Anthony Towns said. ""Jimmy's an amazing player, one of the best in the league so when you lose him it puts a huge task at hand for us bit we've got to be able to go out there next man up and get the job done."" The Timberwolves were coming off a 126-118 victory over the Clippers in Los Angeles on Monday night. Wiggins scored a season-high 40 points in the win that snapped a four-game road skid. The Trail Blazers lost 104-101 in Denver on Tuesday, snapping a three-game winning streak. Minnesota led by eight points early, but Lillard's 3-pointer got the Blazers within 27-25 late in the opening quarter. Portland finally caught up with the Timberwolves at the end of the half, pulling into a 54-all tie after Al-Farouq Aminu's 3-pointer and a pair of free throws from Lillard. Lillard and Aminu each hit 3-pointers to push Portland's lead to 63-60. Aminu's dunk extended it to 76-68 midway through the third quarter. Lillard's two 3s put the Blazers up 88-74. ""We played the kind of game we wanted to play, from the effort standpoint and focus,"" Lillard said. The Timberwolves won the first two meetings of this season's series, both at home. ""When you're on the road and you're short-handed you've got to play with great intensity the whole time,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""If you let up at all you're going to be in trouble. TIP INS Timberwolves: With a 3-pointer and free throw in the second quarter, Crawford added to his career four-point play total with 52, an ongoing NBA record. ... Minnesota's Butler and Towns were also named reserves. Trail Blazers: Portland has won 11 of its last 12 games against the Timberwolves at the Moda Center. ...

WHAT RUSS SAID: Lillard also addressed Russell Westbrook's comment Tuesday night that players are ""Talking about getting snubbed until they get in."" Some thought the comments were directed at Lillard. ""Because he's played against me, he's played against our team, he knows what I've accomplished,"" Lillard said. ""Not just this year, but over my career. So it was a little bit disappointing, but I know that I earned my spot this year."" CONNAUGHTON'S NIGHT: Portland's Pat Connaughton came off the bench with 12 points, including three dunks and two 3-pointers. ""That's a nice combination,"" Terry Stotts said.","400975454"
"LOS ANGELES --  The Boston Celtics refused to panic, even as the Eastern Conference leaders were staring at a four-game losing streak. One night after falling to the lowly Los Angeles Lakers, they returned to Staples Center to remind everyone why they're among the NBA's best at 35-14. The Celtics' defense hounded the Clippers all night, forcing 19 turnovers and holding them to 44.3 percent shooting in a 113-102 victory on Wednesday night. ""This is a hard league,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""You're going to have your ups and downs. We were really fortunate to win 16 games in a row earlier this year. We could have lost about 11 of them. Sometimes things go your way, sometimes they don't."" They were back to going the Celtics' way Wednesday night. ""They do a good job defending, but we got some good shots, some wide-open shots, and just missed,"" Clippers forward Blake Griffin said. Griffin led all scorers with 23 points, but after the first quarter, the Celtics forced him to settle for the outside shot. Griffin was just 1 of 7 from 3-point range. The Celtics countered with five players scoring in double-figures, led by Kyrie Irving's 20 points and Jayson Tatum's 18. ""Our guys, for the first time in a while, got a little disbanded by their ball movement and attack,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""They have so many athletes, they really like targeting some of our guys with footspeed."" Terry Rozier added 15 points off the bench for Boston, and Marcus Morris also had 15. ""It felt like we were getting a lot from a lot of people,"" Stevens said. ""Offensively, this was one of our better games. The way we moved the ball and shared. That was encouraging."" The Celtics made 14 3-pointers, though it took them 40 attempts. Irving also led the team in assists (seven) and tied for the lead in rebounds (eight). TIP-INS Celtics: C Al Horford hit his head in a loose-ball scramble in the closing seconds against the Lakers on Tuesday, but the team said he did not suffer a concussion. Horford, who has had concussions in the past, was held out against the Clippers as a precaution. ... G Marcus Smart was also out after cutting his hand on broken glass at the team hotel Wednesday and needing stitches. The team said it is investigating the incident. Clippers: C DeAndre Jordan returned after missing five games with a left ankle sprain. By playing Wednesday, he tied Randy Smith (715) for most games played in team history. ... F Danilo Gallinari said his glute injury is improving, but there is still no timetable for his return. He has not played since Dec. 9th, and has played in only two games since Nov. 5th. JORDAN RETURN Jordan finished with 15 points and 14 rebounds, playing 31 minutes. ""I thought he looked OK,"" Rivers said. ""I didn't think he was explosive. He had a couple of dunks, but you could see he was ready to play, but he clearly wasn't 100 percent. ""He didn't roll a lot tonight, which is part of our offensive package. He didn't get behind the defense a lot tonight, but I was happy to have him on the floor."" THAT'S PROGRESS Stevens was pleased with the way the Celtics battled the Clippers inside. Despite missing Horford, they outrebounded Los Angeles 47-40. ""Defensively, I thought we did as good a job as we could holding our ground,"" he said. ""It was good we battled the way we did. We needed to. We didn't do enough the last couple of games.""","400975455"
"MIAMI --  Forgetting De'Aaron Fox is a mistake that Miami will remember. Fox's rebound dunk with 3 seconds left capped a huge closing rally by the Sacramento Kings, who erased a 12-point, fourth-quarter deficit to stun the Heat 89-88 on Thursday night. It was Sacramento's first win at Miami since 2001, and the Kings closed it with a 17-4 run in the final 5:46. ""I just went to crash the glass and I just showed my athleticism,"" Fox said. Buddy Hield scored 24 points for Sacramento, which got 14 from Fox, 11 from Bogdan Bogdanovic and 10 from Zach Randolph. The Kings improved to 4-26 all-time at Miami. ""Not a pretty game, but we played really hard,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""Both teams kind of had to grind it out so it's a good win for us at a place we don't get a lot of wins."" Goran Dragic scored 23 points for Miami, and he was the only Heat starter to finish in double figures. Wayne Ellington had 20 and Justise Winslow added 11 for the Heat -- who used an 11-0 run to take a 12-point lead midway through the fourth. Miami gave the game away in the fourth, and fell apart in the final moments. Hassan Whiteside fouled out with 21 seconds left while trying to set a screen for Dragic, and the Kings -- down one -- decided to run the clock down as much as they could on the ensuing possession. Bogdanovic missed a jumper, and all the Heat had to do was secure one last rebound. It didn't happen. Fox wasn't boxed out by anyone, so he had an unimpeded lane to the rim. There were three Heat players nearby -- Dragic jumped for the rebound, Bam Adebayo and James Johnson never left the floor, and even if they had it probably wouldn't have mattered since Fox timed his leap perfectly to catch and slam home what became the game-winner. ""We didn't get a blockout and we didn't jump,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""That probably summed up the evening as much as anything. One guy went for it and the rest of us spectated. That's not how you win NBA games."" Miami's Josh Richardson missed a wild jumper as time expired, the capper to his 2-for-13 shooting night. His teammates weren't much better: The Heat shot 38 percent, compared with 47 percent by the Kings. ""Couldn't get stops,"" Dragic lamented. Kings guard George Hill did not play. He's been prominent in trade rumors in recent days, with reports suggesting that Sacramento and Cleveland are discussing a deal that could send the veteran to the Cavaliers. TIP-INS Kings: The last time the Kings won in Miami, Vlade Divac started for Sacramento -- and he turns 50 next week. ... Hield has reached double digits in 10 of his last 11 games. ... Sacramento isn't leaving Miami until Friday, taking advantage of having two full days off before it plays again. Heat: Dragic was 8 for 14 from the field; the rest of Miami's starters were 7 for 31. ... The Heat had won their last four at home. ... Udonis Haslem was not with the team for personal reasons. HE SAID IT Joerger, asked pregame of what he's seen on tape of the Heat: ""Haven't watched them, to be honest with you."" PRAISING CARTER The Heat have great respect for Sacramento's Vince Carter, the NBA's oldest active player. ""He has a class about him, and is somebody that's been able to reinvent himself many times over,"" Spoelstra said. ""To be a superstar, to be a starting role player, to be a bench role player, to be a bench mentor ... it takes a unique kind of guy with character to be able to do that."" Carter has taken the floor at Miami 33 times, but got no minutes Thursday. NEW UNIFORMS Miami broke out its ""Vice"" uniforms, trimmed in fuchsia and blue and paying homage to the city in the 1980s. ""I think they're the hottest uniforms in NBA history. I love them,"" Dragic said. The uniforms will be worn 14 more times.","400975456"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Thunder stars Paul George and Carmelo Anthony couldn't find their shooting rhythm, so Russell Westbrook went into attack mode and overwhelmed the Wizards. Westbrook scored a season-high 46 points, and Oklahoma City beat Washington 121-112 on Thursday night for its sixth straight victory. ""I just read the game honestly and if it's time for me to take over, then that's what I do,"" Westbrook said. George scored 18 points on 6-for-19 shooting and Anthony added 13 on 4-for-11 shooting. Westbrook filled in the gap by making 19 of 29 field goals in one of his most efficient shooting performances of the season. ""We need him to be that way,"" Oklahoma City reserve point guard Raymond Felton said. ""Some nights he can score 46, some nights he can score 20. Whatever it is, we still need him to be aggressive the way he was tonight."" Steven Adams added 12 points and 10 rebounds for Oklahoma City, which has won 20 of 28 after an 8-12 start. Anthony is still getting used to his team winning when he has off nights. ""I've got to remind myself that I am on the team with somebody else, and they do some of the things that you are capable of doing that you have been doing your whole career,"" he said. ""But for me to be on the same side as that -- I don't have to go after it every night. I just take what the other team is giving us. It's a beauty to watch when it's working and when it's clicking, especially now when we are winning games."" Bradley Beal scored 41 points, John Wall had 21 and Markieff Morris added 20 for the Wizards, who committed 23 turnovers. The Thunder took a 54-40 lead into halftime, but Washington tied the score at 68 before the Thunder rallied. Felton hit back-to-back 3-pointers to put the Thunder up 10, and Oklahoma City led 82-74 at the end of the period. A powerful right-handed jam by Westbrook gave the Thunder a 92-85 lead in the fourth, and a steal by George led to a dunk by Westbrook that put Oklahoma City up 99-89 with just under seven minutes to play. Westbrook punctuated his performance with a two-handed breakaway jam with about a minute remaining. ""We came back,"" Beal said. ""I don't think the deficit was too bad. It was just those offensive rebounds and those turnovers down the stretch. ""We clawed back into the game, we were moving the ball in transition efficiently, getting rebounds, and all of a sudden, that kind of died down and stopped. When that happens, the game totally flipped in their favor and the momentum changed."" TIP-INS Wizards: Coach Scott Brooks spent seven years as Thunder coach. ... Went more than four minutes without scoring to start the game. ... C Ian Mahinmi committed three fouls in three minutes in the first quarter and finished with four fouls in 11 minutes. Thunder: George drained a 3-pointer at the first-quarter buzzer but was called for a technical foul on the play. ... Westbrook will be on the Team LeBron All-Star squad along with former Thunder player Kevin Durant. JOKE'S ON WESTBROOK Anthony had Westbrook, whose name appeared last, convinced the list of All-Stars was in order of selection. After Westbrook learned that the list was alphabetical, he responded to his teammate. ""See, I told you man, it's in alphabetical order man,"" he told Anthony. ""Of course I was first."" STAT LINES Westbrook is averaging just 2.5 3-point attempts during Oklahoma City's win streak. He averaged 4.6 per game before that. ""Yeah, trying to keep attacking the basket and find ways to get in the paint and make plays happen,"" he said.

"DENVER --  Gary Harris gave his bruised right foot a final test during pregame warmups and determined it was good enough to go. Then he proved it. Harris scored 23 points, Trey Lyles had 21 and the Denver Nuggets beat the New York Knicks 130-118 on Thursday night. ""I felt good right before the game so I went out there and gave it a go,"" said Harris, who tweaked the foot last Friday against Phoenix and aggravated the injury Monday night against Portland. Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic added 18 points apiece for the Nuggets, who defeated the Knicks for the 10th time in a row in Denver. New York hasn't won in the Mile High City since 2006. Seven Nuggets scored in double figures. Denver hit 14 of 28 3-pointers led by Harris, who connected on four of his six shots from beyond the arc. ""Once you hit your first few shots you can kind of tell how your body is feeling, especially with the flow of the game,"" Harris said. ""You just figure out where you're going to get your shots and once you get them, you've just got to knock them down."" Denver shot 60 percent from the field to New York's 55 percent, ending a streak of eight games in which the Nuggets had been outshot by the opposition. ""Guys made their shots,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""The other thing we've been stressing is less play calling, more freedom of movement, more pace and just be hard to guard, like we were last year. It was pace and it was movement and it was a night where we finally made some shots consistently."" Kristaps Porzingis, back after missing Tuesday's loss at Golden State with a sore knee, and Michael Beasley each scored 21 points for the Knicks. Enes Kanter had 20 and Trey Burke 18. Trailing by 13 at the half, the Knicks cut it to 99-92 heading into the final period after Burke connected on a fadeaway shot. The Nuggets, though, scored 10 straight points to start the fourth quarter, including 3-pointers by Will Barton and Lyles to rebuild Denver's lead to 109-92. New York put together a 9-0 burst to pull to 114-106 but Porzingis fouled out with just under 5 minutes remaining and Murray drained a key 3-pointer with 2:41 remaining to put the Nuggets back up by 11 points. Harris added a jumper a little more than a minute later to quash the Knicks' comeback bid. ""Without him out there, that takes away a little bit of a weapon,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said of losing Porzingis. ""You can short roll him and he can make a mid-range shot, which he just did right before he fouled out, or he can space out for 3. Offensively, they were fine. Thirty-two assists, they moved the ball and guys did a good job that way. But defensively is where it wasn't very good."" Porzingis said the Nuggets exerted pressure on the Knicks from the start. ""First quarter, 39 points. That's way too many,"" he said. ""They shot the ball great. Part of it is our defense and part of it is just them having a really good night. We did a better job in the second half, but it still wasn't enough."" The Nuggets had their highest point total in a half this season, leading by as many as 18 points before settling for a 73-60 advantage at the break. Harris scored 18 points during the first two periods. TIP-INS Knicks: C Joakim Noah was not with the team, having been excused for personal reasons. He's expected to miss two games. ... F Kyle O'Quinn was held out of the game because of a bruised left calf. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was inactive after recently returning from a leg injury. Nuggets: F Kenneth Faried missed a second consecutive game with left ankle soreness. ... The 39-point first quarter matched a season high for the opening period. Denver also had a 39-point first quarter against Orlando on Nov. 11. HOME STREAK The Nuggets' home winning streak against the Knicks is their second-longest against an opponent. Denver has won its last 11 at home against the Chicago Bulls.","400975458"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Kevin Durant called himself a ""jerk."" The Minnesota Timberwolves had a different description of the Golden State Warriors' All-Star forward, calling him ""the best scorer in the world."" Durant had 28 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, and the Warriors made a season-high 21 3-pointers in a 126-113 victory over the Timberwolves on Thursday night. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson each added 25 points for Golden State. Durant was fined $15,000 by the NBA earlier in the day for his comments about referee James Williams after being ejected from Tuesday's win against the New York Knicks. He later apologized and said he had acted like a ""diva"" and a ""jerk."" Also on Thursday, Durant said he was the first pick in the NBA All-Star draft conducted by team captains Curry and LeBron James. ""Life could be much worse. It was definitely a fun day,"" Durant said. ""I was looking forward to seeing who was going to be on the All-Star teams, looking forward to my fine and most of all looking forward to playing tonight."" Durant went 6 of 9 on 3-pointers and continually pushed the ball down the court to create open shots for Curry and Thompson. Durant hit two 3s and Curry added a third in a 67-second span late in the third quarter, during which the Warriors (39-10) went 8 of 11 on 3-pointers, leading Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau to throw up his arms in frustration. Minnesota's Jamal Crawford said Durant has become a better passer, making him even more of an offensive threat. ""He's even more dangerous. He's already the best scorer in the world,"" Crawford said. ""If he has the assists, that just makes it tough to deal with."" The Warriors matched their previous season high of 18 3-pointers by the end of the third quarter. They made 57 percent from behind the arc in the game, with Thompson hitting seven and Curry connecting on five. That pinpoint shooting allowed Warriors coach Steve Kerr to forgive his team for 15 turnovers and inconsistent defense. ""Our guys are so talented they lit up the scoreboard. They can win a lot of games without being totally dialed in and defending at a high level and that's what happened tonight,"" Kerr said. ""It wasn't our best effort, but talent wins."" Karl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 31 points and 11 rebounds. Crawford added 21 points and Jeff Teague had 17 points and seven assists for Minnesota, which played its fourth straight game without Jimmy Butler, who has a sore right knee. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Thibodeau said before the game that Butler, an All-Star reserve, is ""close"" to returning, Minnesota is 2-2 in the four games Butler has missed. Warriors: Curry became the fifth player in Warriors history to score 14,000 points, ending the game with 14,023. Curry, who is in his ninth season, trails Wilt Chamberlain (17,783), Rick Barry (16,447), Paul Arizin (16,266) and Chris Mullin (16,235) on the franchise list. GRAND TIMES Zaza Pachulia played in his 1,000th regular-season game, becoming the third Warriors player to reach that mark this season, joining David West and Andre Iguodala. It was game No. 109 for Pachulia in a Warriors jersey. Most of his games, 556, were played with the Atlanta Hawks. BAD MATCHUP Towns was unstoppable near the basket at times and the Timberwolves had a 60-44 advantage on points in the paint. But that didn't matter against the Warriors' outside marksmanship. ""You can't beat the Warriors if you're playing 2 versus 3. You can't trade 2s for 3s,"" Towns said. ""We did a great job fighting all night, but it seemed like we got so close, they just started raining 3s again. No matter, uncontested, contested, it didn't matter. They hit them when they needed to hit them. That's the sign of a championship team right there.""","400975459"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker likes the Charlotte Hornets' chances with Dwight Howard altering shots in the lane. Walker scored 29 points and made two key 3-pointers down the stretch that helped Charlotte beat the Atlanta Hawks 121-110 on Friday night. Howard was key in turning back the Hawks' rally. He finished with 18 points, 15 rebounds and a season-high seven blocks. ""(Dwight) just has to do it,"" Walker said. ""We just have to do it. He always tells us when guys are going to the basket he's going to try and block it. That is what he is there for."" Nicolas Batum and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist each added 19 points as Charlotte rallied to regain a lead it maintained since the second period, but surrendered halfway through the fourth. Howard has two games of at least six blocks in his past three. ""It's very important that we all do the little things, getting deflections,"" said Howard, who registered his 29th double-double this season. ""Everybody's stepping in, taking away somebody rolling to the basket, and then running out and making sure guys don't get open 3s."" Jeremy Lamb scored 12 points for Charlotte, which tied its season high with 13 steals. Marvin Williams finished with 11 points for the Hornets, who closed with a 12-0 run for their fourth consecutive home victory against Atlanta. ""Giving up 121 points, it's going to be tough to win,"" said Kent Bazemore, who led Atlanta with 26 points. ""Kemba made some great plays down the stretch. With Nic Batum, those guys are seasoned vets, and they work well together."" Taurean Prince added 21 for Atlanta, including a steal and dunk to put the Hawks ahead 105-104 with less than 4 minutes to play. Mike Muscala helped Atlanta take a fourth-quarter lead with 14 points, but the Hawks fell to 0-2 in the season series. Ersan Ilyasova and Dennis Schroder scored 11 points apiece for Atlanta. John Collins shot 4 for 5 for 10 points for the Hawks, who have the NBA's worst record. ""It (stinks) for us to be down at half and work our way back, to have (Bazemore) do what he does, then have it all go down the drain,"" Collins said. ""Always tough to see that happen. It has been the Achilles' heel of our story."" With 4:34 left until halftime, Walker went hard to the court after slipping on a drive to the basket and appearing to hit his head on Collins' knee. He did not leave the game. TIP-INS Hawks: The Hawks have lost six of seven. ... Collins attended a game at his alma mater, Wake Forest, against Duke, on the trip. He got a video tribute and warm reception at the game. Hornets: All five starters scored in double digits. . Charlotte wore its black Buzz City uniforms. DWIGHT'S SLIGHT Howard made a few headlines with a quote Friday that he wanted to ""kill"" the Hawks. Atlanta traded Howard to Charlotte in the offseason. ""I think they kind of took it and ran with it,"" Howard said. ""I was just talking to a couple of the UFC fighters before I did the interview and I was talking about fighting and stuff like that. . Killing them is not always scoring a million points, but doing all the little things that matter."" MORE FROM BAZEMORE With his parents in attendance on his father's birthday, Bazemore missed his career high by two points. He said he had extra motivation from their presence, despite the team's status at the bottom of the NBA. ""We give the effort every night regardless of our record,"" Bazemore said. ""That's a great foundation to becoming one of those playoff teams.""","400975460"
"CLEVELAND --  Before leaving the Cavaliers' locker room, LeBron James made sure doughnuts from the team's tasty postgame spread were packed in his bag. He had enough turnovers. James recorded his 63rd career triple-double -- overcoming a career-high 11 turnovers -- and J.R. Smith scored 23 points as Cleveland showed some signs of ending its stunning slump with a 115-108 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. James finished with 26 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds as the Cavs, following a minor lineup switch by coach Tyronn Lue, won for just the fourth time in 11 games. However, James kept Indiana close in the fourth quarter with six turnovers -- most of them coming on errant passes. ""It's a four-interception game for a quarterback with a win,"" James said when asked to assess his uneven performance. ""That's what I think of it. I just made some bad decisions."" With the highest turnover total by an NBA player this season, he joined James Harden and Russell Westbrook as the only players with a quadruple-double in the last 15 years. It was sometimes ugly, but it was a much-needed win for the Cavs, who beyond losing have been bickering and backbiting each other. Earlier this week, Cleveland's players challenged each other during a heated team meeting. There are still problems to be worked out on the floor, but at least for one night there was mostly harmony. Still, there were a few curious moments. At one point in the first quarter, Kevin Love grabbed one of his 13 rebounds and turned and bent down to hand it to 5-foot-9 guard Isaiah Thomas, who left Quicken Loans Arena before the locker room was opened to media members. Also, during a timeout, Love tossed his hoodie in the face of teammate Jeff Green, who didn't look pleased. Following the game, Green playfully returned to the locker room to challenge Love, who said it was all done in fun. ""Hey, Kev, they thought you were serious,"" Green yelled to Love, who was surrounded by reporters. ""Tomorrow we're putting on the gloves."" Cleveland stopped Indiana from sweeping all four games between the clubs this season. Victor Oladipo scored 25, Darren Collison 19 and Domantas Sabonis 17 for the Pacers, who kept attacking and closed within five in the final minute before Cleveland closed it out. Smith made seven 3-pointers and Derrick Rose scored 14 points for the Cavs. Cleveland was without Dwyane Wade, who was excused from the team to attend to a personal matter. With the Cavs unable to snap out of their prolonged, puzzling slide, Lue returned to a proven starting lineup with Thomas joining James, Love, Tristan Thompson and Smith -- the latter four starters that led Cleveland to three straight NBA Finals. Lue moved Jae Crowder out of the starting lineup and replaced him with Thompson, who took over at center and moved Love back to his usual spot at power forward. The new/old look paid off and Rose came up big, scoring seven straight points in the third when Lue pulled an ineffective Thomas. Rose recently returned after missing two months with ankle injuries that had him considering whether to continue playing. ""He was really, really good tonight,"" James said. ""He made his jump shots, got to the rim, made plays. That's the backup point guard that we were thinking we were going to have, and to see him look healthy tonight and play with so much composure, it was great to have him."" SWISH Smith has been in a miserable shooting funk, but found his stroke. One of the NBA's best -- and least shy -- outside shooters, Smith came in shooting just 5 of 31 from long range in his previous five games. ""I just told myself I'm going to just shoot it and see what happens,"" he said. ""I just said hell with it, just shoot it. If it goes in great, if I miss, shooting percentage can't go no lower."" NO SWEEP Oladipo said the Pacers weren't thinking about sweeping the Cavs. ""Those three games are in the past, obviously,"" he said. ""You can't judge yourself off the past. You've got to live in the moment. Today was a tough loss. We did some great things, especially in the second half, that we can carry over to tomorrow."" TIP-INS Pacers: Surrendered a season-high 73 points in the first half. ... F/C Myles Turner (right elbow) missed his ninth straight game. ""He's practicing but he's just not ready,"" said coach Nate McMillan. ... Collison returned after missing Wednesday's game against Phoenix because of a personal reason. Cavaliers: A video tribute for James was played in the first quarter to recognize him reaching 30,000 points. The seventh player to reach the 30,000-point summit, James waved as the crowd gave him a warm ovation. ... Cleveland's chemistry -- or lack of it -- has been a burning issue since the team's heated meeting. Lue said players don't have to like each other, but respect is imperative. ""I was on a team where guys didn't like each other but we won a championship,"" said Lue, a member of the 2001 Los Angeles Lakers. ""Once you get between the lines, you have to like who you're playing with. Once you leave here, you don't have to go out and hang out together and things like that, but you have to respect your teammate and play for your teammate.""","400975461"
"TORONTO --  Ricky Rubio's big 3-pointer gave the Utah Jazz back-to-back wins for the first time in more than a month. Rubio drained the winning basket with 4 seconds remaining as the Jazz earned a 97-93 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Friday night. ""Ricky is mentally tough,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""He wants those shots and he got one tonight. It was good to see him knock it down."" Rubio had missed all four of his shot attempts in the second half, but didn't flinch before firing up the game-winner. ""It was easy to take that shot,"" Rubio said. ""I was open and I had to take it. There was no other option. It felt good and I let it fly."" Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points, Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 15 rebounds and Rubio finished with 14 points for the Jazz, who won consecutive games for the first time since a six-game winning streak was snapped on Dec. 4. Utah also won at Detroit on Wednesday night, beating the Pistons in overtime. ""It's a big confidence booster to pull two games out like this,"" Mitchell said. ""We showed a lot of grit."" With Utah trailing 93-92, Rubio made his 3-pointer for the 14th -- and final -- lead change of the game. After DeMar DeRozan missed a jumper, Royce O'Neale sealed it with a pair of free throws. Joe Ingles scored 11 points and Derrick Favors had 10 for Utah. Jonas Valanciunas had a season-high 28 points and 14 rebounds, and DeRozan added 19 points for the Raptors, who lost for the fourth time in 22 home games. Toronto had won its previous four meetings with the Jazz. Serge Ibaka had 10 points and 10 rebounds, and C.J. Miles scored 10 points for Toronto. Valanciunas connected on 12 of 16 shot attempts, but the rest of the Raptors combined to shoot 25 for 79. ""We couldn't make a shot all night,"" DeRozan said. ""We've got to help the big fellow out."" The Raptors trailed by six to begin the fourth, but started the quarter with a 7-0 run. A 3-pointer by Miles sparked a 10-2 Raptors run that gave Toronto a 91-85 lead with 2:24 left, but a dunk by Favors and a 3 by Ingles cut it to 91-90 with 1:20 remaining. ""They did a good job of scratching and clawing, making everything tough on us,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. Valanciunas made two free throws to put Toronto up 93-90, but Mitchell replied with a pair at the line. DeRozan missed a pull-up jumper and Ingles grabbed the rebound before Rubio's decisive 3. ""I'm not afraid to take those shots,"" said Rubio, a six-year veteran. ""That's where experience comes in. I know how to be good in those moments."" TIP-INS Jazz: Rubio led Utah with six assists. ... Utah posted its seven double-digit comeback of the season. . G Rodney Hood (left leg) missed his fourth straight game.

"CHICAGO --  Coach Luke Walton is curious to see if the Los Angeles Lakers' recent success at home will travel during a five-game road trip. The answer in the opener Friday night was positive -- with a few tense moments along the way. Brandon Ingram scored 25 points, including eight in the final 3:18, and the Lakers rallied late for a 108-103 victory over the Chicago Bulls after losing a 12-point, fourth-quarter lead. Jordan Clarkson had 19 points and Brook Lopez added 17 for the Lakers, who have won four straight and eight of 10. Six of the eight wins were at home. ""Coach told us the start of our road trip has to be really good for us to continue the success,"" Ingram said. ""We knew we had to come in here and take care of business and not just think of the games we won at home."" Los Angeles trailed 95-92 with less than four minutes to play before Ingram -- who also had nine rebounds and was 10 for 18 from the field -- started the rally with a pair of free throws. ""Brandon was big down the stretch,"" Walton said. ""He seemed to get a little more aggressive."" Nikola Mirotic scored 14 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter, and Denzel Valentine and Bobby Portis had 16 apiece for Chicago, which has dropped three straight. ""We did not get off to a good start tonight,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""Our grit, toughness wasn't there. Give our guys credit for continuing to fight. Our second unit got us back into that game and got us back in it again in the fourth after falling behind double digits."" Los Angeles led by as much as 17 in the first half before Chicago rallied to tie the score at 68 early in the third quarter. The Lakers, though, answered with 11 straight points and led 84-72 entering the fourth. The Bulls rallied again and took a 92-90 lead with 5 1/2 minutes remaining on Valentine's 3-pointer. It was Chicago's first lead since 3-2. Mirotic hit a 3-pointer to give the Bulls the 95-92 lead before Los Angeles took control. Ingram's free throws started a 13-2 run that sealed the win. ""We just stayed together,"" Ingram said. ""We all had a good attitude and a winning attitude and we all wanted to win. We just tried to make the right plays down the stretch, we utilized the time down the stretch and we made plays for each other.""

Bulls: Zach LaVine, playing in just his seventh game of the season following ACL surgery last February, played a season-high 26 minutes. His minutes restriction was lifted to 26-28 minutes before the game ... Chicago was 17 for 36 on 3-pointers and now has made at least 10 3s in each of its last 11 home games. DUNN STILL OUT Chicago G Kris Dunn missed his fourth straight game with a concussion, and it's unclear when he might return. ""The symptoms really haven't changed much,"" Hoiberg said. ""He's feeling a little bit better today, but he's still doing very limited physical activity."" Dunn, who suffered the concussion following a hard fall in a game on Jan. 17, still is experiencing headaches, fatigue and grogginess. SIBLING RIVALRY Brook Lopez got the better of his twin brother, Robin, who finished with eight points and four rebounds in 19 1/2 minutes. ""It's pretty great,"" Brook said of getting the win. ""I didn't say a word to him. Like any other game."" NO CLOSER Without Dunn, the Bulls have struggled down the stretch of close games. ""He really had developed into our closer,"" Hoiberg said.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Lou Williams was doing his part to keep Los Angeles' offense flowing, and coach Doc Rivers gave the scorer a little extra incentive to make sure the Clippers kept the pressure on the Memphis Grizzlies. ""I told him in the middle of the third (quarter): `If we don't win, we've got practice (Saturday),"" Rivers recounted after the Clippers' 109-100 victory over the Grizzlies on Friday night. ""From that point on, Lou was phenomenal."" As often happens, Williams got rolling early and kept on going, ending up with 40 points and 10 assists, overshadowing a triple-double by Memphis center Marc Gasol. ""I'm a scorer, but just the opportunity to be out on the floor with what's expected of me,"" said Williams, who played 34 minutes. ""It's unique. ... Usually, I'd play to 25 minutes a game. I think I have more of a leadership role now."" Williams was 12 of 19 from the field and the Clippers shot 49 percent, going 10 of 27 from outside the arc, to snap a three-game skid. Milos Teodosic added a career-high 18 points, DeAndre Jordan had 15 points and nine rebounds, and Blake Griffin finished with 14 points. Williams scored 22 points as the Clippers took a 58-50 lead at halftime, then closed out the game with 11 in the fourth quarter after Rivers' warning about practice. Gasol triple-double included 13 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. Memphis was hindered by 20 turnovers leading to 22 Clippers points. Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who is having to use younger players right now because of injuries, noted the Grizzlies handed out 31 assists on 39 field goals, but that was only half the equation. ""We need to continue to be unselfish with the ball, continue to assist our teammates,"" Bickerstaff said, ""but we have to be sure with our passes. Be sure that we're completing our passes to our teammates."" Mario Chalmers had 17 points and 10 assists for the Grizzlies. Jarell Martin also had 17 points, and Dillon Brooks contributed 15 points. After the Clippers' lead reached 14 early in the fourth, Memphis did get the deficit to eight points on two occasions in the final 4:35 only to have Williams score again each time to prevent the Grizzlies from getting any closer.

"MILWAUKEE --  Giannis Antetokounmpo took eight days off and missed back-to-back games to manage chronic pain in his right knee. ""I definitely felt lost because this is what I love to do, to play games,"" Antetokounmpo said. The All-Star forward returned to the lineup Friday night, scoring 41 points and adding 13 rebounds to help the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Brooklyn Nets 116-91. He sealed it late, dribbling between his legs before hitting a jumper over Quincy Acy and drawing a foul. Antetokounmpo made the free throw, and hit a 3-pointer on the next possession. ""If I'm open I'm going to shoot it,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I'm going to go with the flow of the game."" Khris Middleton added 21 points for the Bucks in their second game since coach Jason Kidd was fired Monday. They also beat the Nets for the ninth consecutive time. ""We're growing. We're out here having fun,"" Middleton said. ""As long as we play unselfishly, we're a very dangerous team."" DeMarre Carroll and D'Angelo Russell had 14 points apiece for Brooklyn. ""Total domination by the Bucks,"" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I thought they were better at every position."" Milwaukee built a 28-point first-half lead. Brooklyn, which had just 35 points at the half, scored 37 in the third quarter and got within seven points late in the period. ""Energy and enthusiasm has to be there and we need it every game,"" Milwaukee coach Joe Prunty said. ""In the third quarter, we had a little bit of a lull."" The Nets, coming off a one-point loss to Oklahoma City on Tuesday night, struggled offensively throughout the first half, connecting on just 26 percent of their shots, including 4 of 20 from 3-point range. Milwaukee led 58-35 at the half. ""I'm disappointed. I felt that after Oklahoma City we'd come in here and give a better effort,"" Atkinson said. ""That wasn't the case. I thought our shot selection was, quit honestly, very poor. We weren't sharing the ball."" The Bucks opened on a 16-2 run and led 33-15 after the quarter, led by Antetokounmpo with 11 points. TROUBLE FOR BROWN Police officers used a stun gun on Bucks rookie guard Sterling Brown and arrested the 22-year-old Friday after a confrontation at a pharmacy parking lot. ""It's a personal issue I'm dealing with right now,"" Brown said before the game. Brown had what appeared to be a bruise and scratches on the right side of his face. Officers contacted a man believed to be Brown after seeing a vehicle parked across two handicapped parking spots while doing a business check at about 2 a.m. Asked if there could be any discipline for Brown, coach Joe Prunty said: ""We believe it will be resolved quickly."" Brown entered the game midway through the first quarter. He scored four points in 27 minutes. ""I thought Sterling did a nice job in terms of focus,"" Prunty said. ""Came here and did his job and competed."" SILVER LINING After missing 31 games with a knee injury before returning to action last week, D'Angelo Russell showed signs of his old form. ""He got in a good stretch there,"" Atkinson said. ""He looked like he did in the beginning of the year for us."" Russell made consecutive 3-pointers from about 28 feet late in the third quarter.

"NEW ORLEANS --  DeMarcus Cousins raced down the lane after his missed free throw, trying to make a hustle play and help the New Orleans Pelicans preserve a signature victory over one of the NBA's elite teams. Moments later, Cousins was sitting on the court, pain in his foot and shock on his face. He tried to get up as his teammates pursued the Houston Rockets toward the other end of the court, then went back down on his back and placed both hands on his head. Anthony Davis scored 27 points, Cousins had 15 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists before seriously injuring his left Achilles tendon, and New Orleans survived a furious Houston rally for a 115-113 victory on Friday night. A person familiar with the situation said an MRI confirmed an Achilles tear, ending Cousins' season a little more than a week after he was voted an All-Star starter. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Pelicans have not yet announced the imaging results. The injury, which occurred with 12 seconds left in the game, all but squelched the jubilation from the Pelicans and their fans, who otherwise would have been celebrating not just a victory over the team with the NBA's second-best record, but a fourth straight victory overall and seventh in eight games. ""We were just figuring everything out. That's the tough part,"" Davis said. ""We've got to keep going and just keep finding a way to win. ""We've got enough guys in here who are professionals who are always ready when their number's called, so we've got to make sure that we stay locked in."" Jrue Holiday scored 21 points and unconventionally sealed the victory by purposely missing a free throw with 1.8 seconds left, causing time to run out as players grappled for the rebound. ""Right now, just praying everything's OK,"" Holiday said, adding that Cousins' injury made the victory ""bittersweet."" ""Just unfortunate, really. I think we've been doing really well, got in a great groove,"" Holiday added, noting that Cousins' triple-double against Houston was his second in three games. ""The way we've been playing, and him in particular, has been awesome."" Darius Miller hit six 3-pointers, including one with 1:52 left to give the Pelicans a five-point lead, and finished with 20 points. Chris Paul scored a season-high 38 points before fouling out in the final seconds and nearly led Houston back from a 21-point, third-quarter deficit. James Harden had 23 points and 11 assists, and Eric Gordon scored 27 points. ""We waited too long to get back in it,"" Paul said. ""We picked up our pace a little bit. We started getting a few stops, and then it was too little, too late."" Houston tied it at 104 on Luc Mbah a Moute's layup with 2:34 to go. And the game was tied once more at 109 on Trevor Ariza's 3 with 1:17 to go before Holiday's driving floater and Cousins' follow shot gave New Orleans the lead for good. ""It is one game of 82,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""We deservedly lost, but we will come back."" Cousins, however, might not. ""I feel horrible for him -- everything that he's done and what he's tried to do this year for us,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""The improvements in all areas that he's made, on and off the court, it's just been great. I don't want that to happen to a guy that's trying to better himself."" TIP-INS Rockets: Harden moved into second in Rockets history in assists with 3,347, passing Allen Leavell's 3,339. ...  Harden missed eight of nine 3-point attempts, although six of his free throws came after he was fouled on 3s. ... Former Pelican Ryan Anderson, who came in averaging 10.1 points, did not score, missing all three of his shots. Pelicans: Piled up 24 assists on 27 field goals in the first half, after which they led 66-53, and finished with 36 assists on 44 made shots. ... Recently acquired guard DeAndre Liggins contributed a pair of timely 3s in the second half. ... Davis scored 16 points in the first quarter, highlighted by two alley-oop dunks. ROARING BACK The Rockets' comeback bid began after Miller's 3 gave the Pelicans an 81-60 lead with 5:54 left in the quarter. Houston responded with a 20-6 run, during which Paul scored 10 on two 3s, a layup and two free throws. However, Paul committed his fifth foul with 7:29 left, and went to the bench for more than three minutes, during which the Pelicans' lead crept back to eight. Paul returned with four minutes left and the Rockets scored the next eight points to tie it. ""We have to come out and play a little harder, you know? That is all that was. In the second half we picked our intensity,"" Harden said. ""But give them credit. They came out and nailed some tough shots.""","400975466"
"DALLAS --  Damian Lillard had to defeat a stomach bug before he could lead the Portland Trail Blazers past the Dallas Mavericks. Lillard ""ate something weird"" and missed all four shots he took and had a pair of turnovers in the first quarter. ""I kind of had a stomachache,"" Lillard said. ""A kind of weird feeling in my throat like I was going to throw up, so I was kind of winded. I just felt kind of sick, like it was stomach flu or something."" He started feeling better in the second quarter and his game reflected that, as he scored a game-high 29 points in the final three quarters to lead Portland to a 107-93 victory Friday night. ""I just kept drinking water,"" Lillard said. ""I just kept telling myself it's a mental battle. We had to get the job done and that's what we did."" Lillard had 14 points in the third quarter when Portland closed out the victory. ""He can get on a rhythm,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""He is just capable of doing that. After getting off to a slow start offensively, missing four to five shots, he is capable of getting hot."" C.J. McCollum added 20 points and Jusuf Nurkic had 12 for the Trail Blazers (27-22), who have won four of their past five games -- including two wins against the Mavericks. Ed Davis had 15 points and 13 rebounds off the bench. ""I just tried to come with energy,"" Davis said. ""The ball was finding me and rebounds were falling into my hands, so I was just trying to give a spark to help the team."" Portland played without forward Evan Turner, who was out for personal reasons. Maurice Harkless started in his place and had five points in 17 minutes. Harrison Barnes scored 21 points and Dennis Smith Jr. had 18 for the Mavericks (16-33) in the first game of a back-to-back. Dallas travels to Denver for a road contest Saturday. Wesley Matthews added 12 points for the Mavericks, who struggled and shot 39.3 percent from the field. ""We were committed to the defensive end, that's for sure, but our offense really wasn't there,"" Matthews said. ""No matter what you do on the defensive end, you don't put the ball in the basket you don't really put much pressure on them."" The Trail Blazers led 52-44 at halftime and never trailed in the second half. Dallas was as close as two points -- 65-63 -- in the third quarter, but used a 20-4 run in the fourth quarter to put the game out of reach. ""They hit some hellacious shots,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We had a poor shot-making night, and that combination can lead to problems quickly with these guys."" FAMILY SUPPORT Davis had a big game with his mother, Angela Jones, in attendance, who traveled to Dallas from Virginia to see him get a double-double. ""It's just always good to see family in the stands, especially my mom,"" Davis said.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The Philadelphia 76ers accomplished a series of rare feats against the Spurs. They won in San Antonio, swept the season series against the five-time NBA champions and made the Spurs look bad while doing so. Ben Simmons scored 21 points, Joel Embiid had 18 points and 14 rebounds, and Philadelphia held the Spurs to a season-low point total in a 97-78 victory Friday night, snapping a 13-game losing streak in San Antonio. The 76ers celebrated afterward, cheering in the locker room and singing along as music played loudly in the background as they dressed to leave the AT&amp;T Center. ""We're happy, we won,"" Simmons said. ""We're playing well. We're playing good team basketball."" They had reason to celebrate. The 76ers became just the second Eastern Conference team in three years to sweep a season series from the Spurs, joining the Pacers, who completed the feat Sunday. San Antonio had not lost at home to Philadelphia since 2004, but the 76ers didn't have a healthy Embiid and Simmons before. The 76ers opened a double-digit lead they would never relinquish with 1:35 left in the first quarter, extending the lead to as many as 25 points. ""The old Sixers, the old Sixers,"" Simmons said when asked about the losing streak. ""We've got to come in with a new mentality and we've got to leave the past and play the way we play."" Simmons added seven assists and five rebounds. LaMarcus Aldridge had 18 points for San Antonio, which lost for just the fourth time at home this season. The Spurs set season lows for total points and points in any half, and matched their season worst in the first quarter. ""If I was a San Antonio fan tonight, I'd ask for my money back,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. San Antonio's only lead was 5-3 on Pau Gasol's dunk three minutes into the game. Gasol finished with 11 points and Dejounte Murray had 10 points and nine rebounds. The Sixers used their athleticism and length aggressively, applying full-court pressure early to disrupt the Spurs' offense and quickly rotating their defenders. ""Philadelphia was great. They were physical. Brett's got them really executing well and playing with confidence and they did it at both ends of the floor,"" Popovich said, referring to coach Brett Brown, his former assistant. ""Their defense got us out of everything and our defense wasn't great. Their speed got us. We didn't get back in transition. So, I thought they did a great job."" After matching a season low for points in the first quarter with 13, the Spurs had a season-worst 31 points in the half. San Antonio was 0 for 10 on 3s and shot 35 percent overall in the first 24 minutes. ""We played really well defensively,"" Embiid said. ""We were physical, we got the stops we needed and on offense we took care of the ball."" The Spurs finished 3 for 24 on 3s and shot 40 percent overall. It was their worst 3-point outing since going 1 for 12 against Chicago on Oct. 21. ""They outcompeted us on both ends,"" Murray said. ""They were running, getting what they want. They knew what we were doing on a lot of stuff. We just had a bad night."" TIP-INS 76ers: The 76ers' last victory in San Antonio was Jan. 3, 2004. Derrick Coleman had 20 points and 11 rebounds to lead Philadelphia to an 83-77 victory, which snapped the Spurs' 13-game winning streak and was also their fourth home loss at the time. ... G Jerryd Bayless was a late scratch from the lineup with a sore left wrist. ... The starting lineup of Embiid, Simmons, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot is 3-1 collectively. Spurs: Kawhi Leonard was not available to play as he continues to rehabilitate from right quadriceps tendinopathy, but was in uniform on the bench for the first time since returning to the injured list. ... Aldridge grabbed his 7,000th career rebound, becoming the only player in the NBA with 16,000-plus points and 7,000-plus rebounds since he entered the league in 2006. .. The Spurs' previous low was 34 points in the first half against Orlando on Oct. 27. San Antonio matched its season low of 13 points in the first quarter that was set Dec. 30 at Detroit. ... Gasol became the 34th player in NBA history to play 40,000 career minutes. PRAYERS FOR BOOGIE Embiid was shocked to learn New Orleans center DeMarcus Cousins had suffered a left Achilles tendon injury during the fourth quarter against Houston on Friday. ""Oh my God,"" said Embiid, who has battled injuries throughout his career. ""Injuries suck. I went through it my first two years and then my third year I got injured again. All I can say is I'm going to pray for him. I'm a firm believer in God and I pray a lot, so, he's definitely going to be in my prayers. I think right now he's the best big man in the league offensively. Hopefully he gets back on the court pretty soon."" SWAT TEAM Patty Mills, who is generously listed at 6 feet, blocked 7-footer Embiid from behind in the third quarter, drawing loud gasps from the crowd. It was Mills' seventh block this season.","400975468"
"PHOENIX --  The New York Knicks did not look like a worn-out team playing consecutive nights at the end of its longest road trip of the season. Instead, the Knicks methodically and persistently took it to the young and frequently frustrated Phoenix Suns. Enes Kanter scored 15 of his 20 points in the first quarter and the Knicks never trailed in a 107-85 victory on Friday. ""Most teams cash that last one in because they are ready to go home,"" New York coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""Our guys didn't."" Kristaps Porzingis added 19 points and Tim Hardaway Jr. 15 for the Knicks on the final stop of a seven-game trip that ended with games on consecutive nights at Denver and Phoenix. Trey Burke scored 15 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter for New York. ""They really got after it. They made a concerted effort to really go out there every play,"" Hornacek said. ""I told them after the game I don't think there was one stretch of a two-minute period where we let up."" T.J. Warren scored 20 points, and Josh Jackson had 18 for Phoenix. The Suns' Devin Booker was ejected after drawing his second technical foul with 4:03 left in the third quarter. He also was called for a flagrant 1 foul earlier in the quarter. Booker scored 12 points on 4-of-12 shooting. He wasn't the only one frustrated with the officiating. ""I think we all were,"" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. ""But we have to be able to handle it a lot better than we did for sure."" The 85 points matched the fewest allowed by the Knicks this season and came after they gave up 130, 123 and 127 in their previous three games, all losses. ""I think we knew if we wanted to win this game it had to be defensively,"" Kanter said, ""and I think we did a really good job."" Phoenix never led for the second game in a row, losing its third straight and sixth in its last seven. New York opened the second half with a 14-2 run to lead 67-51 on Porzingis' fast-break dunk. The run featured the flagrant foul against Booker, who grabbed Hardaway by both shoulders on a breakaway dunk, pulling the Knicks guard backward onto the floor on a layup attempt. TIP-INS Knicks: New York went 3-4 on the trip. ... Knicks haven't played at home since a loss to New Orleans on Jan. 14. ... New York has no road trip longer than four games the rest of the season. ... Knicks swept the two games against the Suns this season after Phoenix won both in 2016-17.  ... Knicks are 12-12 against the Western Conference. ... New York improved to 12-9 when shooting at least 48 percent. Suns: Phoenix was down to one true center, Greg Monroe, after Tyson Chandler was a late scratch due to illness. Alex Len already was out with an ankle injury. ...  Booker got his first start of the season at point guard. ... Len missed his second straight game with a sore ankle. ... Marquese Chriss, back after missing six games with a sore hip, was 1 for 12 from the field for three points. BOOKER T'S Booker was tossed after exchanging shoves with Kanter under the Phoenix basket. Kanter also drew a technical on the play. ""Obviously Book is smart enough to know that he's trying to get in his head,"" Booker's friend and teammate Tyler Ulis said, ""but it's hard not to react in that situation."" Kanter said the technical he got was well worth it. ""We needed that energy,"" he said. ""I know I am going to get fined, but we needed the juice so I will take that for a win anytime."" Booker's first technical came when he slammed the ball against the stanchion after a foul call against teammate Troy Daniels in the first half. ""I know four years ago it was a technical,"" Triano said, ""but if we called technical every time (someone) throws the ball at a stanchion now, there would be a lot more.""","400975469"
"Carmelo Anthony joins an illustrious list of NBA superstars with 25,000 career points. (0:45) DETROIT --  Carmelo Anthony made a free throw for his 25,000th point, and although there was no real reaction from the crowd in Detroit, the Oklahoma City star slapped hands with teammates and raised his right hand with pride. ""It's a special moment,"" Anthony said. ""To kind of know what it took to get to this point and the amount of work that was put in to get to this point, the teammates that I've played with over the years, and for me to still be at a point in my career where I still have a lot more to go."" Anthony became the 21st NBA player to reach the 25,000-point mark , and Russell Westbrook added 31 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds to lift the surging Thunder to a 121-108 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. Although it was a night of triumph for Anthony, Oklahoma City lost guard Andre Roberson to what looked like a serious leg injury in the third quarter. Anthony scored his 25,000th point with 8:30 left in the third. He would add four more points and finish the game with 21. Paul George, who was named to the All-Star team Saturday, scored 26 points, and Westbrook was impressive throughout. ""That's a really good basketball team, and when those three get rolling, it is hard to stop them,"" Detroit's Tobias Harris said. ""We had a chance going into the second half, but we were stagnant against a really good defense, and then we couldn't get a stop, so we were always taking the ball out of the net."" Anthony's milestone moment was part of a 15-0 run for the Thunder at the start of the second half that pushed their lead to 27, but Roberson was taken off on a stretcher later in the third after landing hard on the court. His left leg seemed to give way as he was beginning to jump for an alley-oop, and he sailed through the air and appeared to land on his tailbone or lower back. Coach Billy Donovan said it's a patellar tendon injury, and the Thunder would find out more after returning to Oklahoma. The scary injury put a damper on Oklahoma City's seventh straight victory. It's the NBA's longest current winning streak. A group of five Detroit backups helped cut the deficit to nine around the midway point of the fourth, but Oklahoma City was able to hold on. ""I think Dre's situation probably took a lot out of us,"" Donovan said. ""We lost a little bit there, and rightfully so."" Detroit has dropped seven in a row, the league's longest current skid. The Pistons now face back-to-back games against LeBron James and the Cavaliers. QUITE A SPLIT Detroit's reserves actually outscored Oklahoma City's 64-25, but the Thunder's starters outscored Detroit's 96-44. ""Their starters just dominated us,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""When those three are playing like that, you aren't going to be able to stop them, but we had to do a much better job of doing the things we could control. We didn't do a good job of getting back on defense and we didn't do a good job on the boards."" HISTORY The Pistons infamously picked Darko Milicic over Anthony in the 2003 draft, and Anthony hasn't forgotten. ""I was thinking about it after the game, the irony of me getting 25,000 points here in Detroit, knowing after that '03 draft, what things could have been,"" he said. TIP-INS Thunder: It was the 15th triple-double of the season for Westbrook and the 94th of his career. Pistons: F Reggie Bullock (right thumb sprain) returned after a one-game absence and scored 16 points. Harris led Detroit with 21.","400975470"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo and Lance Stephenson delivered the perfect combination for the Indiana Pacers. After watching their fatigued and foul-prone teammates spend most of the first 3 1/2 quarters scrambling to stay close, the tag-team energizers took matters into their own hands Saturday night. They drove and dished, they made shots and they defended. It was a knockout finish. Oladipo scored 24 points, Stephenson added a season-high 21, each had five rebounds and six assists, and the Pacers overcame a late 10-point deficit to get past the struggling Orlando Magic 114-112. ""When that energy (is there), when the crowd is into it, the players are into it, the bench is into it -- it's unlike any other,"" Oladipo said. ""It's a great environment to be a part of. It might be a little tougher you know, playing as hard as we did yesterday and coming in (tonight) and trying to repeat. But it's a part of the NBA."" The Pacers powered through on grit. After trailing by as much as 21, Oladipo's 21-footer in the midst of a 15-0 run finally gave the Pacers their first lead at 107-106 with 3:30 to play. And they closed it out by finishing the game on an 18-6 run over the final 6:15. Still, it almost wasn't enough. After Domantas Sabonis missed 1 of 2 free throws with 20.5 seconds to go, Orlando got two chances to tie the score and one to win it. But Aaron Gordon missed a 16-footer with 12.5 seconds left then missed two free throws with 7.9 seconds to go and Jonathan Simmons missed the go-ahead 3-pointer before Oladipo finally corralled the last rebound. ""We knew it was going to be a tough second half. We played lockdown defense and we fed off of (the energy),"" Stephenson said. ""I know we had a tough rebounding night, but we made up for it. We just kept playing."" Magic coach Frank Vogel expected nothing less from his former team. Each time he sensed the Pacers were about to make a run, Vogel called timeout even after the Pacers cut a 106-96 deficit to 106-95 on Sabonis' layup with 5:32 to go. But the last timeout didn't slow down Oladipo, Stephenson or the Pacers, who scored the next six points to take a 111-106 lead. Gordon had 22 points, 11 rebounds and four assists and Evan Fournier wound up with 19 points for the Magic, who have lost seven straight in the series and 19 of their last 22. ""We knew we'd have to win the second half different than we won the first half, our intensity would have to be greater,"" Vogel said. ""That's what it looked like, and we weren't able to hang on."" TIP-INS Magic: Elfrid Payton had 12 points and five assists on a night Orlando shot 54.5 percent from the field and scored 70 points in the first half. ... Only 10 opponents have failed to score at least 100 points against the Magic this season. ... Orlando has lost 18 of its last 20 to Indiana, dating to March 2013, and hasn't won in Indianapolis since 2014. Pacers: Thaddeus Young scored 20 points and Sabonis finished with 18 points and nine rebounds. ... After shooting 33.3 percent in the first quarter, Indiana shot 63.4 percent from the field in the second half. ... Indiana has given up 143 points in the first half of its last two games. ... The Pacers have won 10 of their last 11 home games against Orlando. HE'S BACK Pacers center Myles Turner returned to action Saturday after missing the previous nine games with an injured right elbow. But he didn't start. ""We're going to be patient with his return and work him back into the rotation,"" coach Nate McMillan said before the game. ""And Domantas has been doing a pretty good with the starting unit."" In less than 11 minutes, Turner had four points three rebounds and no blocks. FIGHTING THROUGH Vogel wasn't sure how long he'd last on the sideline. During pre-game availability, Vogel acknowledged he's tried myriad treatments to fight off a cold and his voice was still pretty weak. ""I'm going to try to coach but I've been coughing an awful lot so we'll see how that goes,"" Vogel said. He did make it through but is now 0-3 at Indiana and 0-7 against his former team.","400975471"
"ATLANTA --  With John Wall held out with a sore knee, Washington's winning game plan was executed to near perfection by his backups. Tomas Satoransky and Tim Frazier combined for 21 assists with only three turnovers and Washington used balanced scoring and strong 3-point shooting for a 129-104 runaway victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. ""I thought we played with a great spirit,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""Our mindset was right where it needs to be. It's defending and passing the ball. It was a simple game plan but they did it with great effort, great passion. Now we just need to keep doing it."" Markieff Morris matched his season high with 23 points while making four 3-pointers. Frazier had a season-high 14 assists. ""I think everybody just picked up the slack for John Wall not playing,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Wall, selected to his fifth All-Star team as a reserve Tuesday, was held out due to a recurrence of soreness and swelling in his left knee. He missed nine games earlier in the season with soreness in the knee. The Wizards, who had lost two straight and four of five, pulled away with a strong start to the second quarter and never trailed. ""No offense to Atlanta, but we're a lot better team than they are,"" Morris said. ""They're a young team."" Mike Scott, who began his career in Atlanta, had 19 points. Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr. each had 18 for Washington. Washington made 18 3-pointers, matching its high mark for the season. Taurean Prince, Tyler Dorsey and Dewayne Dedmon each had 14 points to lead Atlanta. The Wizards pulled away with an 11-2 run to open the second quarter. Kelly Oubre Jr. opened the quarter with a powerful left-handed jam and free throw. Oubre, who had 15 points, capped the run with a 3-pointer for a 38-20 lead. Washington's superior long-range shooting was decisive. While Atlanta made only 2 of its first 16 3-pointers, the Wizards made 10 of 17 in the first half and led 61-45 at the break. Morris made each of his three 3s in the half and four of five for the game. Satoransky, making his first start of the season, sank a 3-pointer for the first points of the game. He had 11 points. TIP-INS Wizards: Brooks said the knee has bothered Wall the last two games. Brooks said Wall, who was with the team, wanted to play against the Hawks. ... Ian Mahinmi and Atlanta's John Collins were called for fouls following a brief second-quarter collision and stare-down under the Hawks' basket. No technical foul was called. ... The Wizards, who made 18 of 32 3s, also made 18 3s against Houston on Dec. 29. Hawks: Atlanta wore its alternate black and ""volt"" green City Edition uniforms. Schroder wore matching fluorescent green shoes. ... The Hawks have lost three straight as they continue to hold the NBA's worst record. ... Ersan Ilyasova had 12 points.

""I would love more pace but this might be who we are,"" Budenholzer said. QUOTABLE Brooks said Wall's toughness in playing with the sore knee the last two games is ""pretty incredible."" Brooks said before the game he'd never have been able to overcome such an injury in his 10-year career as a player with six NBA teams. ""I marvel at his toughness and his ability to play through it all,"" Brooks said. ""I had to be completely healthy to get my four points and three assists and not have a bad meal on top of that and a good night's sleep and a bunch of good players around me.""","400975472"
"MIAMI --  Wayne Ellington was not the first, second or probably even the third option on Miami's final possession. He was the right option. Josh Richardson scored 19 points, Ellington capped his 17-point effort with a 3-pointer that sealed the outcome with 4 seconds left, and the Heat beat the Charlotte Hornets 95-91 on Saturday night to snap a two-game slide. The Heat rallied from a 15-point second-half deficit and atoned for letting a close game slip away against Sacramento on Thursday by holding Charlotte to 13 points in the final quarter. ""The great thing about this league is you have opportunities to learn. You either win or you learn,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""The other night, that was a tough lesson but we really wanted to make amends for how we finish games defensively."" Kelly Olynyk scored 16 points and James Johnson added 10 for Miami. The Heat went 4-0 against the Hornets this season, winning by five, six, one and four points. ""They play really hard,"" said Hornets guard Kemba Walker, who led all scorers with 30 points. ""They are really disciplined and have a lot of heart. That's why they're so good."" Dwight Howard finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds for the Hornets. ""I don't think we executed in the fourth quarter,"" Howard said. ""They got some good stops and they were able on their end to make some buckets. We just have to do better."" Walker had a chance to tie the game when he went to the line down by two with 30 seconds remaining, but made only the first. James Johnson corralled the rebound for Miami, the Heat called time and set up a play to run down the clock. Charlotte gambled and didn't foul, hoping Miami wouldn't make a 3-pointer. The plan backfired when Ellington connected from the top of the arc as the shot clock was expiring. ""Their depth is one of their great strengths,"" Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. Miami led by as many as 10 late in the first half, but the third quarter brought huge trouble. Charlotte outscored Miami 27-4 over an eight-minute stretch of that period, the Hornets shooting 10 for 18 from the field in that span while Miami shot 2 for 16. Charlotte led by 15 twice in the third, only to see that trimmed down to seven by the end of the quarter. Miami clawed within one point on four occasions in the fourth, couldn't get over the hump on the first three, then finally got the lead back at 92-90 on a three-point play by Richardson with 1:21 left. ""We wanted to make sure we got some stops,"" Ellington said. ""We dug in and made sure we didn't have any regrets."" TIP-INS Hornets: Howard blocked four shots, the last of those giving him 2,000 in his career. ... Charlotte scored 13 points in the fourth, and missed its final five shots. ... The Hornets were 28 for 35 from the foul line, compared to Miami's 11 for 18. Heat: Ellington now has 150 3s this season, a career-high with 33 games left. ... Miami has had a different starting lineup in three consecutive games. ... The Heat love weekends -- they're 17-8 on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and 11-13 on all other days of the week. ... It was the eighth time the Heat won a game this season when it did not hold a lead going into the fourth quarter. IN MEMORY The Heat held a pregame moment of silence for longtime agent Henry Thomas, who died Saturday. Thomas represented several Heat players over the years, including Udonis Haslem, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Tim Hardaway. ""I feel like I lost a dad,"" said Haslem, who missed Thursday's Heat game so he could be at Thomas' bedside. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Thomas was part of the team's extended family. LATE SCRATCH Charlotte was without Michael Carter-Williams, sidelined with a strained left shoulder. His absence provided an opportunity for rookie Malik Monk to get back into the rotation, after playing a total of 10 minutes in the Hornets' last six games. But Monk missed all four of his shots in seven scoreless first-half minutes.","400975473"
"Kyrie Irving starts hot vs. the Warriors on Saturday by shooting a perfect 7-of-7 from the field and 3-of-3 from deep. (1:10) OAKLAND, Calif. --  The ""M-V-P!"" chants reigned down, and Stephen Curry played every bit like one yet again. Mouthpiece dangling and shots dropping. He has had so many brilliant back-and-forths with Kyrie Irving in recent years, and this one will surely be added to that list among the best. Curry scored 49 points with 13 of those over the final 1:42 and hit eight 3-pointers, lifting the Golden State Warriors past the Boston Celtics 109-105 on Saturday night in what is already being hyped as a potential NBA Finals matchup come June. Irving scored 37 points on 13-for-18 shooting with five 3s, but Boston failed to build momentum from a win at the Clippers on Wednesday night and lost for the fifth time in six games. ""The way he started the game tonight was pretty crazy,"" Curry said. ""We try to bring the best out of each other. Tonight was one of those nights, just a fun way to play."" The NBA's top teams from their respective conferences put on quite an entertaining show. Curry made a go-ahead 3 with 1:42 to play, scored on a driving layup the next time down before eight late free throws. He also made three of his 3s over the final 4:20 of the third quarter for the Warriors, who had lost the last two matchups to the Celtics and two in a row at home. The Warriors fell 92-88 at Boston on Nov. 16 in which they squandered a 17-point lead. Kevin Durant added 20 points and nine rebounds for the Warriors, who haven't lost to the same Eastern Conference opponent twice in the same season during fourth-year coach Steve Kerr's tenure. Draymond Green had 15 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. Curry's 3-pointer with 4:20 left in the third put Golden State up 70-63, he hit another at the 2:52 mark then connected once more at 2:12 as Golden State grabbed momentum heading into the final period up 80-73. The two-time NBA MVP scored 18 points in the third, shot 16 for 24 and 8 of 13 from long range while notching his second 40-point game of the season and 29th of his career in the regular season. Fans chanted ""M-V-P!"" as he made two free throws with 43 seconds left, two more at the 10.3 mark, another pair with 6.9 seconds left and two more at 1.6. Irving was sensational himself. Plenty familiar with Golden State from three straight Finals matchups with the Cavaliers, he hit his first seven shots with three 3-pointers while Jaylen Brown converted his first four field goals including two 3s. Boston built a 34-24 lead late in the opening quarter and stayed ahead by 10 going into the second. He didn't miss his first shot until a driving floater 4:16 before halftime. Irving too appreciates the push from Curry. ""Oh yeah. I've been going against him for the last seven years,"" Irving said.  ""This special team that they have now, adding KD, you've seen how they've kind of transformed from the first year they won it to now being two-time champions. The bench, everyone. It's always a high-level game."" Curry isn't about to make a bold prediction about Finals time. He learned that lesson already. ""I got in trouble last time,"" Curry said, ""if I was thinking about going back to Boston in the summer."" HAYWARD PROGRESS Coach Brad Stevens still doesn't expect Gordon Hayward to play again for Boston this season as he recovers from a gruesome broken left ankle suffered early in his Celtics debut last October. Hayward hasn't lost his shooting stroke as he rehabs. ""He makes a lot of shots standing still. I mean a lot. He's a heck of a stand-still shooter now,"" Stevens said. ""He's really good in a chair too. Nothing new. We don't anticipate him being back this season."" Kerr has been so impressed with the Celtics' resiliency without the star guard. ""I was devastated for him and I'm happy to see he's recovering well,"" Kerr said. ""Their recovery as a team without him has been amazing. Two losses to start the year and then they just took off."" TIP-INS Celtics: Second-year F Brown, who played collegiately at nearby Cal, scored 20 points. Durant hit a 3 from the top of the arc over Brown midway through the first quarter. ... Boston shot just 32.9 percent in beating the Warriors last time, including 7 of 32 from deep, but made 14 of 27 3s on Saturday. Warriors: Curry has made at least five 3-pointers in five straight games, one off the NBA record. ""I'm shooting 30 3s next game,"" he cracked. ... G Patrick McCaw missed his second straight game but said he is improving from a strained mid-back and hopes a few days before the next game will give him time to be ready. ... Rookie F Jordan Bell missed his fourth straight game with left ankle inflammation. ... C Damian Jones was recalled from the G League Santa Cruz Warriors, who will play their second ever game at Oracle on Sunday night against the Austin Spurs. So Jones could play again in Oakland on Sunday if sent down again.","400975474"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Kicked back in the office chair at his locker, Jimmy Butler put his feet up on another chair and called reporters over. Following his first game back after a four-game absence, Butler's first comments about himself regarded his 4-of-14 shooting. The Minnesota Timberwolves know Butler's impact goes well beyond his shooting, and it showed again against Brooklyn. Butler scored 21 points, Karl-Anthony Towns had 16 points and 19 rebounds for his NBA-leading 43rd double-double and Minnesota beat the Nets 111-97 on Saturday night. ""Like a bum,"" Butler said of his return. ""I couldn't buy a basket. But, hey, there's other ways to change the game. So, I'll be all right. Go get some work in tomorrow, come out firing again."" Butler added six rebounds and five assists after missing four games with right knee soreness. Andrew Wiggins scored 21 points and Jamal Crawford added 16 to help the Timberwolves snap a two-game skid. ""The intensity is so much different,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said of Butler being on the court. ""I thought first game back, a lot of big plays. When the game was in the balance, he made big play after big play."" Jahlil Okafor scored 21 points, and Nick Stauskas added 15 for a short-handed Brooklyn squad that has lost six of eight games. Nets coach Kenny Atkinson was ejected in the fourth quarter after coming out on the court to argue a call. Players and coaches had to restrain the enraged Atkinson. ""Guys are a little fatigued,"" Atkinson said. ""This is a tough road trip. I'm glad we didn't give in. This team doesn't give in. The majority of the time I've been here, the attitude's been excellent. I knew they weren't going to give up. Even after I got thrown out, they still kept fighting for the old man."" After a lopsided loss in Milwaukee on Friday night, Brooklyn struggled mightily in the first quarter. The Nets shot 33.3 percent and had nine turnovers in the quarter. The Wolves built the lead to 26 early in the second before Brooklyn found some footing with its reserves in Okafor and Stauskas. The lead would close to five early in the third before Towns made his impact. Towns, who was elected to his first All-Star Game, was scoreless until 3:46 in the first half. He attacked the offensive glass, grabbing a career-high nine offensive rebounds. He had eight points in the third as Minnesota quickly countered Brooklyn's run. ""Karl had a great offensive rebounding game, and overall rebounding game,"" Thibodeau said. ""I thought he had great impact on the game. We didn't close out that second quarter well, but he had some big-time offensive rebounds and that really put us over the top."" ATKINSON'S OUTBURST Atkinson said his reaction was regarding a call against Joe Harris, but the coach declined to get into specifics. Harris said the frustration could be mounting. ""You can't necessarily put it all on one game,"" Harris said. ""Especially, we're at the end of a long road trip where we lost some tough games, been in some close ones. Kenny's just trying to fight for his guys."" WIGGINS CONTINUES SCORING In the four games Butler missed, Wiggins stepped up his scoring with 25.8 points per game. He scored at least 20 points for the fourth time in five games and has tied or been the team's leading scorer in four of five games after doing so just once over the previous 24 games. TIP-INS Nets: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (right groin strain) and Caris Levert (sore left groin) were out of the lineup for Brooklyn. Hollis-Jefferson was injured in Friday's game in Milwaukee and Atkinson wasn't sure if he will return for the next game. Levert was a late scratch. ... D'Angelo Russell was also held out for the second game of the back-to-back with the team managing his return from knee surgery. ... G Isaiah Whitehead was recalled from the Long Island Nets of the G League earlier in the day. ... Stauskas scored double-figures for the fourth time this season and the first time since he had 21 points on Dec. 27. Timberwolves: Butler has missed six games for Minnesota this season. The Wolves are 2-4 without him in the lineup. ... Minnesota has lost back-to-back games six times this season, but hasn't had a three-game losing streak. ... The 11 points allowed in the first was the fewest by Minnesota this season and the 30-11 advantage was the largest lead after the first this season.","400975475"
"DENVER --  The Denver Nuggets' offense has carried them most of the season, but this time they leaned on their defense -- and Nikola Jokic -- to hold off the Dallas Mavericks. Jokic completed his second triple-double with a late jumper to put Denver ahead, and the Nuggets held on for a 91-89 victory Saturday night. Jokic had 11 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists. Gary Harris scored 24 to help Denver rally from nine points down in the fourth quarter for its third straight win. The 91 points were the fifth-fewest Denver has scored in a game this season, and it came two nights after the Nuggets put up 130 in a win over New York. ""You never know how the game is going to go so we adjust to what the game gives us,"" Jokic said. ""We missed open shots and layups, but that's the kind of game it was."" Nuggets point guard Jamal Murray was healthy but did not start after violating a team rule, coach Michael Malone said after the game. After averaging 26.7 points in his previous three games, Murray struggled early Saturday before scoring all 15 of his points in the second half. ""My whole tempo was off,"" Murray said. ""Normally I start games with up tempo and I didn't come out talking and with the same energy I normally do."" The Mavericks were missing guards J.J. Barea (oblique strain) and Devin Harris (personal reasons) but played well without them even though it was the second of back-to-back games. They faltered down the stretch, going 4:27 without a field goal late in the game. Harrison Barnes had 22 points and Dennis Smith Jr. had 13 points, six rebounds and six assists for Dallas. The Mavericks have lost three in a row. Dallas trailed by 13 early but quickly erased the deficit and took a three-point lead in the second quarter. The Mavericks went on a 16-1 run to end the third and take a 74-66 lead. Denver rallied to get back into it, and Jokic drained a jumper from the top of the key to give the Nuggets a 91-89 lead with 1:12 left. Barnes missed a 3-pointer, but an offensive foul was called on Jokic with 12.7 seconds left. After Mason Plumlee blocked Smith's layup out of bounds, Wesley Matthews missed a 3 at the buzzer. ""We got the ball back and we did get a look on the last shot,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""The thing was a fraction of an inch to the left and we are having a party right now. They got lucky. They dodged a bullet tonight."" TIP-INS Mavericks: Carlisle said he hopes Barea's oblique injury is not a long-term issue. ""I hope it's a one-nighter,"" he said. ""It happened on a freakish play (Friday) night where he was reaching for the ball."" ... Harris missed his second straight game for personal reasons and fourth in a row overall. He had missed the previous two games with a concussion. Nuggets: Malone said F Wilson Chandler left in the first half with symptoms of a migraine. He did not return. ... F Tyler Lydon had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Friday and is expected to miss the rest of the season. Lydon was hurt Wednesday while playing for the Rio Grande Valley Vipers in a G League game. THROWBACK SATURDAY The Nuggets hosted 1990s alumni Tom Hammonds, Reggie Williams and Robert Pack as part of their 50th anniversary season. They were honored at halftime, and before the game reminisced about the 1994 first-round upset of the Seattle SuperSonics. ""We were underdogs. Nobody expected us to do anything,"" Pack said. ""We not only won, but we won on their court against the No. 1 seed."" The flight home from Seattle after the Game 5 win was as memorable for Hammonds as the 3-2 series win. ""We're flying back across the Rockies and we hit some bad turbulence,"" he said. ""I said, `We just made NBA history and now we're getting ready to die!' The plane was going up and down, up and down, but we finally made it back.""","400975476"
"CHICAGO --  The Milwaukee Bucks came into the season expecting to be in the top half of the Eastern Conference playoff race. They just might make a run if they keep playing like this. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 27 points and Milwaukee beat the Chicago Bulls 110-96 on Sunday. The All-Star forward added nine rebounds and eight assists to help the Bucks improve to 3-0 since interim coach Joe Prunty replaced the fired Jason Kidd. Milwaukee hasn't exactly been beating the heavyweights, knocking off Phoenix and Brooklyn before taking out Chicago. Even so, this is encouraging. ""I see that guys are playing harder,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Some guys -- I don't know what they're thinking in their heads. Maybe (they were) not OK with what happened. I just see guys playing hard."" Khris Middleton added 20 points and seven rebounds. Jason Terry came off the bench to score a season-high 12 points, nailing four of Milwaukee's 13 3-pointers. The Bucks shot just over 53 percent overall for the game and used a big second quarter to build a 19-point halftime lead, sending Chicago to its fourth straight loss. ""Right now, you can tell guys are a little bit looser,"" Middleton said. ""With Joe, he preaches confidence. His plays are designed for us to move the ball side to side more. And just, not necessarily playing off one matchup, but just trying to use the matchup as a decoy to get other guys shots."" He said Prunty is ""much more relaxed"" and that teams ""usually take on the personality of the coach."" Denzel Valentine scored 18 for the Bulls. Lauri Markkanen added 17 points and 10 rebounds, but Zach LaVine had another rough outing. The two-time slam dunk champion finished with six points on 2-of-11 shooting in his eighth game back from a torn ACL in his left knee, after going 3 of 17 in a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. Coach Fred Hoiberg insisted LaVine will find his rhythm, and he likes what he is seeing from him on defense, particularly when he's guarding the ball. ""I'm not worried.,"" Hoiberg said. ""Zach's offense will come. He's a proven scorer. There's no doubt about that. He's missing shots that he normally makes and shots that he made when he first came back in those first couple games. ... The encouraging thing is, his defense has been better."" TIP-INS Bucks: Terry hadn't scored in double figures since a 15-point outing against Charlotte on April 10. That was also the only time in 74 games last season that he finished with 10 or more. ... G Malcolm Brogdon missed his second consecutive game because of a sore right calf. ... The Bucks had 11 steals -- nine in the first half. Bulls: Markkanen now has 721 points, surpassing Hanno Mottola (715) as the career leading scorer among NBA players from Finland. He also recorded his 12th double-double -- second among NBA rookies. ... The Bulls don't have a timeline on when G Kris Dunn will return from a concussion. He missed his fifth game in a row. BREAKING IT OPEN The Bucks took a 61-42 lead to the locker room after outscoring Chicago 35-22 in the second quarter. Milwaukee got back-to-back 3-pointers in the opening minutes of the period from the 40-year-old Terry and bumped the lead to 20 near the end of the half. Sterling Brown and Middleton nailed 3s and a cutting Antetokounmpo threw down a dunk to make it 56-36. The Bucks then shook off 3s for Chicago by Valentine and Nikola Mirotic, with former Bull Tony Snell hitting one of his own and Antetokounmpo burying a turnaround jumper from around the foul line to make it a 19-point game. PARKER'S PROGRESS Forward Jabari Parker said he expects to know a target date this week for his return from the second major knee surgery of his young career. The Chicago product played 2-on-2 on Saturday and had ""a good workout"" prior to Sunday's game. Parker, the second overall pick in the 2014 draft, was averaging 20.1 points when he tore his left ACL in a game against Houston on Feb. 8, 2017. It was his second major injury to that knee in three seasons. He had surgery six days later, and the Bucks said it would take a year for him to return.","400975477"
"Devin Booker gets Ryan Anderson one-on-one and takes him to the rack to finish with a finger roll. (0:20) HOUSTON --  James Harden wasn't sure if Houston's first afternoon game of the season was to blame for the Rockets' lack of energy. ""I don't know, but it was pretty ugly,"" Harden said. ""We won, but it wasn't pretty."" Harden had 27 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Rockets to a 113-102 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday. Harden fell two assists shy of his third triple-double of the season. The Rockets beat the Suns for the 14th time in their past 16 meetings, including seven straight. But after struggling to find a flow, making just 11 of 37 3-pointers (29.7 percent) and committing 12 turnovers, the Rockets knew something was off. ""We just didn't play well, spirit-wise, energy-wise,"" Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""Hopefully, we'll learn a little bit from it, but these are the dog days right now, and they've got to find within themselves to be able to concentrate for 48 minutes and get `Ws."" Rockets guard Gerald Green said D'Antoni kept reminding the team throughout the game that they were playing with fire against the Suns, who came in 17-32. ""Luckily, we didn't get burned,"" Green said. ""We can't do those things if we want to be a good team."" Houston led 60-53 at halftime and outscored the Suns 32-24 in the third quarter to provide enough of a lead to hand Phoenix a fourth straight loss. Rockets forward Trevor Ariza injured his left leg early in the first quarter after colliding under the basket with Marquese Chriss on a dunk attempt and landing awkwardly. Ariza was slow to get up, made both free throws and then, after jogging down the court in apparent pain, committed a foul to stop play and check himself out of the game to head to the locker room. D'Antoni said Ariza injured his hamstring and would be re-evaluated on Monday. Houston had another scary moment late in the fourth quarter when Harden was slow to shake off an apparent leg injury sustained during a jump-ball tangle with Josh Jackson. Harden, who missed seven games earlier this month with a hamstring strain, finished the game. Chris Paul added 17 points and five assists for Houston, making all nine free throws. Paul played just 27 minutes and less than two minutes in the fourth quarter. ""We just didn't look in sync today,"" Paul said. ""I don't know if it's because of our first afternoon game or what it is, but no excuses."" Devin Booker had 31 points and 10 assists for Phoenix, shooting 5 for 9 from beyond the arc. He scored 21 points in the second half to keep the Suns close. Booker was playing at the point guard position for a second straight game and said although it's not his natural position, he's working to make adjustments and better learn the position. Booker said he injured his ribs and hip and will have an X-ray evaluation on Monday in Memphis. ""It was a tough fall, but I'll bounce back,"" Booker said. T.J. Warren added 24 points for the Suns. Phoenix center Tyson Chandler returned to action after missing two of the three previous games due to illness. Chandler had 11 points and 15 rebounds in 30 minutes, picking up his first double-double of 2018. His last double-double came on Dec. 31 in a 123-110 loss to Philadelphia. Suns center Greg Monroe was ejected late in the third quarter after picking up two technical fouls for arguing with an official following an offensive foul called on him. Monroe was given the first technical and appeared to continue talking to the official while the teams were walking to the other end of the court. It was the second straight game a Suns player was ejected. Booker was tossed in a loss to the Knicks on Friday. TIP-INS Suns: Phoenix center Alex Len missed his second straight game with an ankle injury and will be a game-time decision for Monday night's game in Memphis. In his place, Dragan Bender played 25 minutes off the bench, getting five points and four rebounds. Rockets: Luc Mbah a Moute had 13 points in 32 minutes off the bench. Mbah a Moute, usually known for his versatile defense, has scored in double figures in three of his past four games. Houston is 9-1 when Mbah a Moute scores in double figures. HE SAID IT Green was called for goaltending on a block where his offhand appeared to graze the net and rim. He received a technical after arguing with officials. ""I told the ref, `I jump extremely high so I have to be able to control myself to keep my neck from hitting the rim,"" he said. ROCKETS WELCOME FLIGHT LEGEND The Rockets welcomed pilot and former U.S. Air Force general officer Chuck Yeager, who was the first pilot to break the sound barrier in 1947. The pilot, who turns 95 on Feb. 13, received a standing ovation by the Toyota Center crowd and posed with D'Antoni after the game.","400975478"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Blake Griffin and his Clippers teammates figured they deserved the unpleasant critique from coach Doc Rivers at halftime. So they took it to heart and completed the franchise's greatest road comeback in more than a decade. ""He got into us a little bit. He said all the things we needed to hear,"" Griffin said of Rivers' locker-room talk before the Clippers' dominant third quarter. ""When coaches say what you need to hear and players come out and execute on it, it's a perfect harmony."" Griffin had 27 points and 12 rebounds, capped by his crushing 3-pointer with 43 seconds left, and Los Angeles beat New Orleans 112-103 on Sunday in the Pelicans' first game since a season-ending injury to All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins. Lou Williams added 22 points, DeAndre Jordan had 12 points and 19 rebounds, and Tyrone Wallace scored 19 points for the Clippers, who erased a 21-point, first-half deficit and snapped New Orleans' four-game winning streak. It was the largest comeback of the season for the Clippers -- and the largest road comeback since 2004, when they were coached by Mike Dunleavy, who is now a college coach in New Orleans with Tulane. ""We never feel like we are out of a game. We find hope in being na<U+FFFD>ve,"" Williams said. ""We never think we are going to lose."" Anthony Davis had 25 points and 17 rebounds for the Pelicans. New Orleans had won seven of eight coming in, but was playing for the first time all season without Cousins, who averaged 25.2 points and 12.9 rebounds before tearing his Achilles tendon in the final seconds of a victory over Houston on Friday night. Davis had a scary moment late in Sunday's game when he tried to beat Jordan off the dribble. He slipped near the edge of the paint and went down with his legs splayed. He remained in the game, but kept trying to stretch out his groin. Having played more than 40 minutes, including the entire second half, Davis received prolonged treatment after the game and did not speak with media, but there was no indication from team officials that he would miss New Orleans' next game. His slip resulted in a turnover with the Pelicans trailing 105-102, and Griffin then sank his decisive 3 on Los Angeles' next possession. Jrue Holiday scored 20 points and E'Twaun Moore 18 for the Pelicans, who led 62-51 at halftime but fell behind for good when they were outscored by 14 points in the third quarter. ""We didn't make shots to start the quarter and we let it affect our aggressiveness defensively,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We have to get past that."" The Clippers took their first lead when Williams hit a 20-foot jumper and left-wing 3 in succession to make it 72-70 late in the third period. The Pelicans briefly regained a 75-74 lead on Jameer Nelson's 3 before falling behind for good on Griffin's layup as he was fouled. Without Cousins, New Orleans relied more on a smaller lineup and attempted 35 3s, but hit only nine. The Pelicans also made only 2 of 19 3s attempted in the second half. ""We got a lot of good, wide-open shots that didn't go down,"" Holiday said. ""We need to start attacking the basket, as we did in the first half. I feel like sometimes teams give us the jump shot and we take it. Tonight we had too many misses, and from there they came down and hit their shots."" TIP-INS Clippers: Williams has scored at least 20 points in each of his past 12 games in a reserve role. ... Clippers reserves other than Williams combined to score 12 points. ... Teodosic scored 12 points. Pelicans: Davis' rebound total gave him a franchise all-time high of 3,857, eclipsing David West's mark of 3,853. ... The Pelicans tied their largest lost lead of the season, having also lost to Golden State on Dec. 4 after leading by 21. ... Asik, who was averaging 7.4 minutes per game, played eight minutes in Cousins' absence and had four points and three rebounds. BEFORE THE BREAK New Orleans scored the first eight points of the game, starting with Davis' alley-oop dunk, and led the entire first half. Despite Davis scoring only six points in the first 24 minutes, the Pelicans opened up a 56-35 lead on a 3 by Dante Cunningham, who started in Cousins' absence. Ian Clark and Darius Miller each hit 3s, Clark added a layup and reserve center Omer Asik scored twice inside during a 20-7 Pelicans run in the second quarter. The Clippers closed the gap with a 16-6 spurt that began with Williams' 3, included Jordan's dunk of Griffin's alley-oop lob and ended with Griffin's 3.","400975479"
"CLEVELAND --  Two-game winning streaks are rarely cause for a celebration. The Cleveland Cavaliers can't be choosy these days. LeBron James had 25 points, 14 assists and narrowly missed his second straight triple-double, and Cleveland beat the Detroit Pistons 121-104 on Sunday night. The Cavaliers won consecutive games for the first time since a five-game winning streak Dec. 9-17. ""For the most part throughout 48 minutes, this is one of the best games we've had obviously as of late,"" said James, who was 8 of 15 from the field, 8 of 9 from the foul line and had eight rebounds. ""Every game is something to build on. I think tonight was another positive note to that."" The Cavaliers beat Indiana on Friday following a tension-filled week that included a heated team meeting, starting lineup change and persistent trade rumors. A couple of wins could add some much-needed humor for a team that had 10 lost of 13 before beating the Pacers. ""What was it ""Major League"", the skipper said we've won two games in a row, that's a winning streak,"" Kevin Love after scoring 20 points with 11 rebounds. ""That's what it feels like right now. We'll take what we can get."" Kyle Korver's 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter broke a 95-all tie. James added two free throws and a three-point play, and J.R. Smith hit a pair of 3-pointers as Cleveland pulled away. Smith, with his second strong game in a row, had 15 points. Detroit has lost eight straight, the longest current stretch in the league. Tobias Harris and Anthony Tolliver each scored 20 points for the Pistons, who continued to struggle despite several changes in the starting lineup by coach Stan Van Gundy. ""A loss is a loss,"" Van Gundy said. ""We fought hard, but in the last eight minutes we slowed down. We haven't found a starting lineup that can hold their own. We're just getting pummeled by good teams."" Cleveland led by 10 points in the first quarter, but its inconsistent play surfaced again. Tolliver, added to Detroit's starting lineup, hit five 3-pointers in the half. The Pistons led 61-58 at halftime. Isaiah Thomas, who had 14 points, sparked a 10-0 run late in the third quarter that erased an 85-80 deficit with a free throw and two drives to the basket. The Pistons regained the lead but faded down the stretch after playing Saturday against Oklahoma City. ""No excuses,"" Tolliver said. ""If you can't play back-to-backs, then you can't be in this league. If you're out there and you're playing, you're going to come out of the game."" James recorded his 63rd career triple-double Friday but also had a career-high 11 turnovers. He had three turnovers in 38 minutes Sunday. Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue expects Dwyane Wade will return for Tuesday's game in Detroit. The veteran guard was excused from the team following the death of his longtime agent Henry Thomas.

BRINGING A SPARK Channing Frye had seven points and seven rebounds in 21 minutes. He also had a put-back dunk and a reverse layup, both causing his teammates to jump around on the bench. ""He lightened the mood just by that put-back dunk,"" Love said with a laugh. ""That was a very, very athletic play very seldom seen by a player like Channing Frye. When we were at shootaround he said he doesn't dunk before noon. It will go on the career highlight reel.""","400975480"
"TORONTO --  Raptors guards DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry are bringing their coach along to next month's NBA All-Star Game. Fred VanVleet scored a career-high 25 points, DeRozan had 19 and the Raptors beat Los Angeles 123-111 on Sunday to snap the Lakers' winning streak at four games. The victory guarantees the Raptors (33-15) will have the second-best record in the Eastern Conference through Feb. 4, meaning Dwane Casey will coach Team LeBron at next month's All-Star Game in Los Angeles. Brad Stevens, whose Boston Celtics lead the Eastern Conference, is ineligible after coaching last year's game. Lowry showered Casey with water during a postgame celebration inside the Raptors' locker room. Casey said it was an ""honor"" to represent the East on All-Star weekend. ""To put a light on our program and see what we're doing is the most important thing,"" Casey said. Casey is the first coach in Raptors history to earn the All-Star spot. ""It's something that, for the last couple of years, we've been fighting for,"" DeRozan said. ""What an accomplishment. You want to be able to see your coaching staff get in there and be able to coach an All-Star Game."" DeRozan, however, will be playing for Team Steph, pitting him against his own coach. ""I wish he was coaching us,"" DeRozan said. ""I'm going to talk crazy trash to him, for sure."" Lowry had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Jonas Valanciunas added 13 points and 10 boards as the Raptors won their seventh straight over the Lakers. ""We just didn't play well enough to win against a team like this on the road,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""We didn't make shots. You've got to really go after it and get it. For whatever reason we didn't play with that edge tonight and they made us pay for it."" Toronto is 18-4 at home this season, the second-best mark in the NBA behind San Antonio (20-4). C.J. Miles scored 13 points, Serge Ibaka had 11 and Delon Wright 10. Julius Randle had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Jordan Clarkson scored 17 for the Lakers. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 16 points, Larry Nance Jr. had 15 and Brandon Ingram 14. Randle and Valanciunas were each issued a technical foul after Valanciunas shoved Randle late in the second, upset after being elbowed in the face when Randle drove to the basket on the previous possession. An angry Randle got up and approached Valanciunas, but teammates and referees stepped between them. TIP-INS Lakers: G Alex Caruso scored a career-high 11 points. ...

"OKLAHOMA CITY --  The Thunder and Philadelphia 76ers aren't even in the same conference, yet they played as though they were longtime rivals. Russell Westbrook scored 37 points, Paul George added 31, and Oklahoma City beat Philadelphia 122-112 on Sunday night for its eighth straight victory. The game was more intense than usual from the start, with a lot of extra trash talking and bumping. The teams combined for 51 fouls and 61 free throw attempts. It carried over from Oklahoma City's triple-overtime victory in Philadelphia in December. ""Leading into this game, after a little talk after game one, I think to this game, I kind of was looking forward to it,"" Westbrook said. ""But you know -- Oklahoma City 2-0."" Westbrook made just 6 of 20 shots in the first half, when he was knocked to the ground trying to take a charge as Joel Embiid threw down a vicious dunk over him. He was 8 of 13 in the second half and also had 14 assists and nine rebounds. George shot 9 of 17 a day after being named the All-Star replacement for New Orleans' DeMarcus Cousins. The Thunder are 7-0 when George scores at least 30 points and 11-4 when he scores at least 25. Steven Adams added 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Thunder. He made 10 of 11 shots for the Thunder and grabbed 10 offensive rebounds. Embiid had 27 points and 10 rebounds, and Ben Simmons added 22 points for the 76ers. It was a bittersweet day for the Thunder. The team announced Sunday that guard Andre Roberson is expected to miss the rest of the season after having surgery on a ruptured left patella tendon. Roberson, who was a second-team All-Defense selection last season, was injured when his knee buckled and he fell during the third quarter Saturday at Detroit. ""It's tough,"" Westbrook said. ""Dre is my boy. I love having him on the floor with me, and it's a tough situation for him. We are just going to continue to lift him up and pray for him, keep our spirits high for him and keep this thing rolling."" George hit a 3-pointer at the first-half buzzer to trim Philadelphia's lead to 58-57. A dunk by Simmons put the 76ers up 75-68 early in the third before the Thunder got things going. Oklahoma City went on a 12-0 run, and a reverse layup by Westbrook put the Thunder up 86-79 and forced the 76ers to call timeout. George closed out the surge with a 3-pointer that put Oklahoma City up 10. The Thunder led 92-83 at the end of the third. Oklahoma City shot 60 percent from the field in the period and held Embiid to two points. Philadelphia left its starters in to start the fourth, and they helped the 76ers take a 98-97 lead early in the quarter. Oklahoma City pulled away late. Westbrook's 3-pointer with just under three minutes to play put the Thunder up seven, and he followed with a jumper to make it a nine-point game with two minutes left. ""We made runs, they made runs,"" Simmons said. ""But down the stretch, we didn't take care of the ball and execute."" TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid picked up his third foul with 8:34 left in the second quarter and the 76ers up 37-36, but he played the rest of the half. ... Shot 50 percent from the field.

"SAN ANTONIO --  The Spurs almost ruined Gregg Popovich's 69th birthday. Popovich blew a fuse instead of candles at halftime after seeing a lack of effort from his veteran team. Bryn Forbes scored a season-high 23 points and San Antonio overcame its sluggish second quarter for a 113-98 victory Sunday night over the Sacramento Kings, who saw coach Dave Joerger exit the game in the opening minutes after suffering a dizzy spell. Popovich had a direct message to the Spurs at halftime during a second straight listless performance. ""Come ready,"" Forbes said. ""He kind of snapped on us at half, told us we weren't ready, we had to pick it up. Our effort wasn't great in the first half, he said."" The Spurs outscored the Kings 64-48 from there, but it was the effort they put into the advantage that pleased Popovich. LaMarcus Aldridge and Manu Ginobili each added 15 points in San Antonio's 13th straight win over Sacramento. Dejounte Murray had 14 points and 10 assists, and Pau Gasol had 14 points and 11 rebounds. ""Second half I thought Bryn and Dejounte were great at both ends of the court and that's the effort and the execution of doing your job that we need,"" Popovich said. ""They were great and other people followed."" Joerger exited two minutes into the game after slapping his hands together after a non-call, taking two steps toward midcourt and then turning toward his bench and dropping to one knee. He braced himself with one hand on the court and another on a staff member before rising with the help of assistant Elston Turner. Joerger was taken to the locker room and examined by a Spurs team doctor. A San Antonio official said Joerger was experiencing lightheadedness and was being kept in the locker room for precautionary reasons. ""He's OK, he'll be all right,"" Turner said. Joerger left with the team afterward. His status for Tuesday's game in New Orleans is unknown. De'Aaron Fox finished with 26 points and Vince Carter added 21 for Sacramento. The Kings finished 18 for 34 on 3-pointers. Popovich left for the locker room with 1.4 seconds remaining in the first half even though Fox was shooting free throws. He had cause to be upset. The Spurs scored only 20 points in the second quarter, two nights after setting several scoring lows in a 97-78 loss to Philadelphia. ""We had some bad lapses of plays offensively and defensively,"" said guard Danny Green, who did not play in the second half. ""Obviously, he wasn't too happy about it and we weren't happy about it, but had to make some changes in the second half."" Popovich had a long talk at halftime, with most of the Spurs returning to the court with less than a minute remaining before the start of the third quarter. Popovich also sat starters Gasol, Green and Kyle Anderson in favor of Forbes, David Bertans and seldom-used Darrun Hilliard. ""Coach got on us, really tough,"" Murray said. ""We didn't even get to get out and get any shots up. You know, so it was mainly a mental thing. The great thing about it is there's two halves to basketball, so you know we had a bad first half and we got to make up for it in the second half."" The Spurs responded by outscoring the Kings 30-19 in the third quarter. TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento was without six players, including C Willie Cauley-Stein (bruised right knee bone and sprained left foot), G Garrett Temple (sprained right ankle) and F Skal Labissiere (sprained left shoulder). ... Sacramento's last win in San Antonio came on Jan. 20, 2012. Spurs: Kawhi Leonard missed his 12th game as he continues to rehab his right quadriceps tendinopathy, but was in uniform and sitting on the bench for the second straight game. ... Ginobili returned after a six-game absence due to a bruised right thigh. He played 25 minutes. SING AND DANCE The Spurs serenaded Popovich with their rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" following Sunday's game. ""Did I lead the singing? No, no, I was backup dancer,"" San Antonio veteran guard Patty Mills said. ""I leave the singing to the singers. I know my scouting report, so I stick to that."" FAMILY FAVORITE Carter was happy to learn that he was one of the top five favorite players of Ginobili's 3-year-old son, Luca. Ginobili is sixth on his son's list. ""It's pretty cool,"" Carter said. ""My kids are the same way, I'm not their favorite. I'm OK with that."" ACHES AND PAINS Ginobili said it took longer for him to heal than in previous seasons after missing six games with a bruised right thigh. ""Last year I felt like every bruise and every ache, I was recovering very fast,"" he said. ""This one is the first this season, and yeah, it took me a little longer. But I think the hit was harder than we all thought because it was a lot of blood in the area, so it took us time to get it out of there. So, we'll see, hopefully it's the first and last, so we won't have to experiment anymore.""","400975483"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  The Indiana Pacers finally found a solution to their struggles Monday night. Turn up the defensive intensity and share the ball. The combination worked perfectly. Victor Oladipo scored 25 points, Myles Turner added 22 and the Pacers had just enough energy to make two late charges in a 105-96 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. ""Everybody contributed,"" Oladipo said. ""It's a collective team thing. We had to do a great job of playing team defense, making them work -- I think we did a great job of that tonight."" Whether it was fatigue from playing their fourth game in six nights or the Hornets' slower, half-court style, the Pacers didn't look like themselves most of the night. For more than three quarters, their preferred up-tempo style slowed down and their energy level seemed to be low. All that changed in the fourth quarter when everyone started playing their part. Six players scored in double figures, including Thaddeus Young with 16 points and Darren Collison with 13. Domantas Sabonis had his 12th double-double this season with 11 points and 10 rebounds. Collison had six assists, backup point guard Cory Joseph added five and, of course, Lance Stephenson provided a late burst of energy as he wound up with 10 points. The result: Indiana won its second straight and fourth in five games. ""We finally found our groove in the fourth and wore them down,"" Young said. ""Defensively, we got into them more, pushed up on the ball, got a few steals, forced them into some bad shots and just played with a lot of energy and passion."" The difference showed. Charlotte scored only 14 points over the final 10 minutes and 18 in the fourth quarter, losing its second in a row. Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 23 points, making a trio of 3-pointers. Dwight Howard had 22 points and 11 rebounds but took only three shots in the second half. Nicolas Batum made five 3s and scored 22 points. After Oladipo made a 19-footer with 9:50 to go, the Pacers didn't look back. Sabonis scored Indiana's next five points and when the 13-4 spurt ended with Sabonis' 20-footer, the Pacers led 94-86 with six minutes remaining. Then Turner's 3 spurred a 7-0 run, giving the Pacers a 103-89 advantage with 2:46 left. Charlotte never recovered. ""Their defense was really good and we didn't respond well,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. TIP-INS Hornets: Howard dominated the first half, scoring 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting and grabbing seven rebounds. He wound up with the 697th double-double of his career. ... The Hornets were outscored 40-21 off the bench and were just 9 of 31 on 3s. They also had 16 turnovers. ... Charlotte has lost three straight and 14 of its last 16 in Indianapolis. Pacers: Young has scored in double figures in 12 consecutive games. ... Indiana shot 54.2 percent from the field and improved to 18-0 when shooting 50 percent or better this season. ... The Pacers had a 54-42 scoring advantage in the paint. Neither team led by more than six through the first three quarters. COMING BACK Turner looked more comfortable Monday with a brace on his injured right elbow. The numbers reflected it, too. He was 8 of 11 from the field, 4 of 6 on 3s, and had four rebounds and one block in his second game back. He missed the previous eight. ""I just played,"" he said, noting he didn't get much of a chance Saturday because of foul trouble. Batum also acknowledged he's rounding into form, too, after missing the first 12 games with a torn ligament in his left elbow. ""Injuries have been tough for me, so it feels good to be getting my shooting back,"" Batum said after going 8 of 17. THEY SAID IT Hornets: ""Individual stats don't matter,"" Howard said. ""Winning is all that matters."" Pacers: ""I love playing with Domantas,"" Turner said. ""I almost feel bad because he does all the dirty work and it kind of just leaves the easy stuff for me.""","400975484"
"ATLANTA --  Kent Bazemore's favorite play, a chase-down blocked shot, was even sweeter when the defensive gem followed his biggest shot of the game. Bazemore scored 22 points, including a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 2:09 remaining, and the Atlanta Hawks rallied after trailing by 11 in the third quarter to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 105-100 on Monday night. The clutch 3 by Bazemore gave the Hawks a 99-96 lead they did not relinquish. The margin was only one when Bazemore chased down former teammate Jeff Teague for a blocked shot that stood following a replay review by officials. ""By far my favorite play in the game of basketball is the chase-down block,"" Bazemore said. Bazemore added a layup to stretch the lead back to three. He also had a chase-down block in the first half. ""He fuels our team with great competitive spirit and great competitive energy,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. A layup by Taj Gibson cut Atlanta's lead to 101-100. Following a missed short jumper by Dennis Schroder, Minnesota called timeout with 14.5 seconds remaining. Unable to make the inbounds pass, Teague was whistled for a five-second violation before trying to call a timeout. Schroder had 18 points, including four free throws in the final 11.3 seconds. The Hawks began the night with the NBA's worst record but have won six straight home games against teams from the Western Conference. Jimmy Butler had 24 points and Andrew Wiggins scored 18 for Minnesota. Butler was sharp in his second game back after missing four with right knee soreness. He went 7 for 15 from the field and made each of his nine free throws. Minnesota appeared to be on the verge of putting the game away when it led 71-60 in the third period. Atlanta quickly trimmed the margin back to single digits. ""I felt like we could have put them away in that third quarter but we just didn't get it done,"" Gibson said. ""When you give a team like that confidence late in the game, it gets scary. They started hitting shots."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Began the night one game behind San Antonio for the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference. ... Minnesota fell to 1-7 on the road in January. ..

TECHNICALLY SPEAKING With the game tied at 90, Teague and Gibson each were called for a technical foul by official Lauren Holtkamp following Teague's offensive foul. Schroder made only one of two free throws. ""All through the game Schroder kept cursing her out,"" Gibson said. ""He kept yelling at her the whole game. All I said to her was you've got to do the same thing on both sides. You can't let him talk to you any kind of way and when Jeff says a few words to you, you blow up on us. That's bad. She just gave me a tech. I've been going through that with her over the years. She has a short whistle."" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said: ""Sometimes we're not going to get calls on the road and we didn't. You can't react that way.""

"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Memphis Grizzlies put together their biggest scoring quarter of the season, creating enough of a buffer for an easy victory over the shorthanded Phoenix Suns. Tyreke Evans scored 27 points, Wayne Selden added 17 points and the Grizzlies sent Phoenix to its fifth straight loss with a 120-109 victory on Monday night. The major turning point came in the second quarter, when Memphis outscored the Suns 42-21 creating a double-digit lead that eventually would swell to 25 in the third quarter. ""I thought we competed in the first quarter, then in the second quarter we hit a bit of a slump,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said, later adding: ""We dug too big of a hole."" Phoenix played without leading-scorer Devin Booker, who suffered a right rib contusion in the Suns' loss Sunday at Houston. X-rays on the Phoenix guard before Monday night's game were negative. In a game where both teams seem destined for lottery picks in the draft, it was the potent second-quarter for Memphis that made the difference after a first filled with turnovers and inconsistent offense. Memphis' 17 field goals included the Grizzles converting all three of their shots beyond the arc. Jarell Martin made all three of his shots in the frame, and Evans was perfect on his four attempts. Memphis had 12 of its 29 assists in the second. ""We did a great job sharing the ball,"" said Martin, who finished with nine points. ""We moved the ball pretty well, limited turnovers and got good looks."" Once Memphis went into halftime up 64-47, the Suns never got the deficit under 10 the rest of the way. Dillon Brooks, Deyonta Davis and Marc Gasol scored 12 points apiece for Memphis, Gasol also grabbed 10 rebounds. Davis missed only one of his six shots on the night, part of the Grizzlies shooting 57 percent for the game. T.J. Warren led the Suns with 24 points on 10 of 18 shooting, while Josh Jackson scored 20 points. ""I thought defensively, we picked it up, especially in the second quarter,"" Gasol said. ""That allowed us to run and create easy points."" TIP-INS Suns: Troy Daniels converted a 3-pointer with 9:15 left in the first quarter, the 1,109th consecutive game with a 3-pointer. That surpassed the Dallas Mavericks record of 1,108 between 1999-2012 for the longest in NBA history. ... Won the previous two over the Grizzlies this season -- both games by two points. ...Injuries resulted in Isaiah Canaan starting his first game of the season. ... Tyler Ulis and Jared Dudley both scored 13 points, Ulis handing out seven assists. Grizzlies: It was Gasol's 33rd birthday. He recorded his 20th double-double of the season. .Evans led the team in scoring for the 20th time this season. He has scored at least 25 points in 14 games. SUNS DOWN In addition to Booker, center Tyson Chandler didn't play, resting on the second night of a back-to-back. Marquese Chriss who is dealing with a left ankle sprain, also sat out. ""We had a lot of talent in the locker room,"" Triano said of the injuries and rest. Before the game, the Suns interim coach went through the list of who was available and who wouldn't play, adding: ""Don't ask me about starters, because I've just gotten a lot of this information (and) haven't had time to process it."" HELPING HANDS The Grizzlies had 29 assists in the game, led by six each from Selden and Andrew Harrison. ""That's the conversation we're having with our guys,"" interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""Making the extra pass, going from good to great and just sacrificing what you think might be a good opportunity, but it's more important to get your teammate a great opportunity.""","400975486"
"MILWAUKEE -- What a difference a week makes for the Milwaukee Bucks. They won their fourth straight game since coach Jason Kidd was fired by beating the Philadelphia 76ers 107-95 on Monday night. And now they're getting forward Jabari Parker back in a few days. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 18 rebounds, and Matthew Dellavedova scored all 10 of his points in the fourth quarter for the Bucks, who moved to 27-22 and look like a contender again in the Eastern Conference. ""Anytime you go 4-0 in a week, it's a good week,"" said center John Henson, who had 13 points. ""Just playing well. We beat the teams we're supposed to beat."" The 76ers didn't have All-Star center Joel Embiid, who sat out to rest. Milwaukee has also beaten losing teams in Phoenix, Brooklyn and Chicago under new coach Joe Prunty, the assistant who took over on an interim basis after Kidd was fired last Monday. Still, this is progress for a squad that at times has played down to the level of its opponents. ""We're just playing harder, trusting one another,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Just in general having fun when we've been out there."" Dario Saric had 19 points to lead the cold-shooting Sixers, who were 2 of 26 from 3-point range a night after going 11 of 29 in a loss at Oklahoma City. Ben Simmons added 16 points. ""Maybe we left them in Oklahoma,"" Saric said about the off night from the arc. He missed all eight of his 3-point attempts. The Sixers started out having all the fun in the paint, scoring 22 of their first 26 points in the lane. But the Bucks, who focused on making life difficult for Philadelphia on the perimeter, started figuring out how to limit the Sixers down low, too. Philadelphia was overpowered without Embiid in the middle, and Antetokounmpo picked up his 22nd double-double of the season. ""Without Joel, we knew that if we were going to win, we needed a successful 3-point night,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We had to find points from somewhere."" Milwaukee also announced during the game that Parker was cleared to return Friday against the New York Knicks, nearly a year after being sidelined with the second major left knee injury of his career. Parker tore his left ACL on Feb. 8, 2017, against Miami. At the time, he was averaging a career-high 20.1 points and 6.2 rebounds as one of the franchise cornerstones. TIP-INS 76ers: Embiid is set to play in back-to-back games for the first time when Philadelphia hosts Miami on Friday before visiting Indiana the next night. The 7-foot center has had an extensive injury history that includes foot and knee surgeries that have limited his ability to play since he was drafted third overall in 2014. Elected a starter for his first All-Star Game, Embiid scored 27 points in 35 minutes during Sunday's loss at Oklahoma City. He is averaging 23.6 points and 10.9 rebounds per game. Bucks: G Malcolm Brogdon returned to the starting lineup after a two-game absence with right calf soreness. He scored four points in 21 minutes. ... G Eric Bledsoe did not return after playing the first three minutes. The Bucks said he was available, but had been dealing with a sore left ankle. ""The bottom line is we gave it a go, the effort was there in terms of trying to go out and play, and obviously he couldn't go,"" Prunty said. DELLY, DELLY The Bucks were 11 for 28 from 3-point territory, getting key long-range buckets off the bench from Tony Snell (11 points), Sterling Brown (10 points) and Dellavedova. His reverse layup with 4:15 left capped a 12-4 run to give Milwaukee a 15-point lead. Dellavedova also had a personal five-point run beginning with a 3 from the corner with 6:51 left and ending with two free throws after getting fouled on the break following a steal. ""He does so many little things out there for you. It's not only getting you into the offense, it's knowing the offense and where guys can be successful or setting screens,"" Prunty said.

"DALLAS -- Hassan Whiteside had an impressive response after a long conversation with Eric Spoelstra, and the Miami Heat completed another season sweep of the Dallas Mavericks. Whiteside scored 25 points with 14 rebounds in the Heat's 95-88 victory Monday night, a day after the center and his coach spoke for about an hour. ""I sat on it, I slept on it, and I thought about it a whole lot,"" Whiteside said. Asked the gist of the conversation, Whiteside responded: ""Just different things and different challenges he had for me, both from what we've seen out there."" The Heat never trailed after Goran Dragic made a steal that led to Tyler Johnson's tiebreaking 3-pointer to make it 38-35 with just under 4 1/2 minutes left in the first half. Their lead went to double digits again after Whiteside had consecutive baskets midway through the third quarter. ""He had some great games like this where he's really put his fingerprints on the competition to impact winning,"" Spoelstra said. ""You felt his presence from the very get-go, and it's all now about the consistency night in and night out."" This is the 14th time in their 30 seasons that the Heat, who beat Dallas 113-101 at home on Dec. 22, have swept the regular-season series. These teams met twice in the NBA Finals, with Miami getting its first championship in 2006 and the Mavs winning their only title in 2011. Harrison Barnes had 20 points and Wesley Matthews 19 for the Mavericks (16-35), who have dropped four games in a row and seven of eight overall. Miami (29-21) led 51-41 when Josh Richardson hit a 3-pointer with 41 seconds left in the first half. But the Mavs trimmed that in half when rookie Dennis Smith Jr. made a defended buzzer-beating 3-pointer from about 27 feet to make it 51-46. James Johnson had a hand up in front of Smiths' face with Whiteside coming from the side. Richardson had 14 points for the Heat, while Dragic had 13 and Kelly Olynyk 12. Smith scored 14 for Dallas, and Dirk Nowitzki 10. TIP-INS Heat: Whiteside had his 18th double-double this season. ... For the second game in a row, Miami won to complete a season sweep. The Heat beat Charlotte on Saturday night to wrap up a four-game series sweep. ... The only team the Heat have swept more in the regular season is Sacramento at 15 times. Miami lost to the Kings already this season. Mavericks: Nowitzki has played 49,941 career minutes, 59 shy of becoming the sixth player in NBA history with 50,000. Elvin Hayes played exactly 50,000 minutes, and former Mavericks guard Jason Kidd is fourth on the list at 50,111. ""It's a very staggering accomplishment and done with such grace and such little hype that it's probably very much taken for granted,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ... G J.J. Barea missed his second straight game because of a left oblique strain. ... Devin Harris was back after missing four games because of a concussion and personal reasons. He was 1-of-7 shooting in 16 1/2 minutes. DOWN THE STRETCH The Mavericks got within three in the final minute after being down 17 with six minutes to go. ""We have to play like that the whole game,"" Carlisle said. ""I am pretty upbeat about a lot of things, but I don't think you make a living in this league with moral victories, about, `Hey, we did some good things down the stretch.' It's not going to get you there."" As Barnes said, ""Look at the other 44 minutes, that's the biggest thing for us right now. ... We're showing that we can have these comebacks. But that's not the issue. It's what we're doing before that to put ourselves in that position."" IN FRONT OF THE FOLKS Richardson's parents drove down from Oklahoma City to see the Heat and their son play. ""It's always dope to see them in the crowd, see your parents sitting there and cheering you on because it doesn't really happen as much in the NBA,"" Richardson said.","400975488"
"DENVER --  At last, the Boston Celtics found a way to get a win in the closing moments. Wasn't easy. Kyrie Irving scored 10 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter, Jaylen Brown hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 34 seconds remaining and the struggling Celtics edged the Denver Nuggets 111-110 on Monday night despite blowing a big lead. It was only Boston's second victory in seven games. ""I thought we were gassed at the end of the game,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""We missed some defensive assignments, and I thought we missed some good opportunities on offense, but they found a way."" The Celtics had struggled in tight games over the last two weeks, with three losses in games decided by four points or fewer, including most recently a 109-105 loss to Golden State on Saturday. Denver nearly added to their misery. After Irving's miss with seven seconds to go, the Nuggets -- not using a timeout -- raced up the court and got a look at the buzzer, but Torrey Craig's tip-in of Will Barton's long attempt from 3-point range was too late. Afterward, Denver coach Michael Malone defended his decision not to use a timeout to set something up. ""(We) got a stop, didn't want them to set their defense,"" Malone said. ""Will Barton has made plays like that before for us and I stand by that decision."" Irving finished 11 of 17 from the field to lead the Celtics. Jayson Tatum added 20 points and Marcus Morris had 14 off the bench. Boston blew a 20-point lead and trailed heading into the final period. Then the Celtics couldn't hold onto a six-point advantage in the final two minutes as the Nuggets tied the game at 108 with 43 seconds to go. Moments later, though, Al Horford fed Brown for the decisive 3. The second-year small forward had missed his first four 3-point attempts. ""I was like, no way I'm missing this one,"" Brown said. ""I was open. Everything that happened before didn't matter. I had to make the shot."" Nikola Jokic had a double-double by the first minute of the second half for Denver, finishing with 24 points and 11 rebounds. Barton scored 19, Gary Harris 15 and Jamal Murray 14. Mason Plumlee had 16 points and eight rebounds before leaving with a strained right calf in the fourth. ""We could have beat a really good and tough team, but we didn't,"" Jokic said. ""We had a chance, but we didn't take it."" The Celtics beat Denver for the second time this season, also prevailing 124-118 on Dec. 13. In this one, Boston made 10 of its first 16 shots from beyond the arc to go up 51-31 in the second quarter and led 56-45 at halftime. Irving paved the way with 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting. The Nuggets climbed back on the strength of a 14-5 run to end the half and outscored Boston 37-24 in the third to go up 82-80. TIP-INS Celtics: G Terry Rozier played despite spraining his right ankle at Golden State and scored eight points off the bench. The backup guard has played in every game this season. ... Daniel Theis had 11 points and Horford scored 10. Nuggets: Jokic has recorded a double-double in 20 of his past 40 games. ... F Wilson Chandler sat out with an illness. He'd been dealing with migraine symptoms since leaving in the first half of Saturday's win over Dallas. ... F Kenneth Faried played for the first time in four games and had zero points and five rebounds in five minutes. PLUMLEE HURT Denver's starting center left the locker room on crutches and is not expected to play Tuesday at San Antonio. ""It's going to be really hard,"" Jokic said. ""He is a big part of our team, just because he is a big man who is light, strong, who can defend everybody, who can rebound for us. So it's going to be tough, but we need to go without him."" NICE VIEW Irving had the hot hand for most of the night, but the big shot went to Brown. Irving was confident in his teammate. ""I'm glad it fell in (Brown's) hands tonight and he was able to knock it in,"" Irving said. ""I'm just proud of the guy."" Brown finished with nine points.","400975489"
"WASHINGTON --  This time, even without John Wall, the Washington Wizards managed to slow down Russell Westbrook, holding him to 13 points and ending his Oklahoma City Thunder's eight-game winning streak. Knowing they are heading into what could be a significant stretch without their own All-Star point guard, the Wizards got 25 points from Otto Porter Jr., frustrated Westbrook all evening and beat the Thunder 102-96 on Tuesday. Less than a week ago, Westbrook scored a season-high 46 points in a victory over Washington. ""He's a playmaker. We wanted to make sure he saw a crowd,"" said Wizards coach Scott Brooks, who used to coach Westbrook with OKC. ""Not a lot of gaps, not a lot of openings."" Washington forward Markieff Morris gave his team a little less credit for Westbrook's woes on this night, saying: ""He missed a lot of shots. A whole lot of shots."" That is certainly true. Westbrook hit only 5 of 18 attempts and wound up with 10 assists, six rebounds and seven turnovers, then said he would ""take ownership"" for his team's loss. He also was whistled for a technical foul in the second quarter and a flagrant foul in the third, when he went for a block and instead sent an arm to the chin of Marcin Gortat. Someone else who played a key role was Wall's fill-in as the starting point guard, Tomas Satoransky. He finished with four points and six assists, including alley-oop feeds to Bradley Beal in the first half and Morris in the second. Satoransky also blocked a shot by Westbrook in the third quarter, something Beal managed to do in the fourth. Then, with 39.4 seconds remaining, Satoransky broke a 96-all tie with a pair of free throws after he was fouled by Josh Huestis, who had turned the ball over. On Oklahoma City's next possession, Carmelo Anthony shot an air ball, and Porter's two foul shots made it a four-point lead for the Wizards. Satoransky's defense on Westbrook was ""unbelievable,"" according to Porter. ""That was his assignment for tonight,"" Porter said. ""To make it hard on Russ."" Beal had 21 points and nine assists for Washington, which announced about 7 1/2 hours before tipoff that Wall will have arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Wednesday. Paul George had 20 points at halftime and finished with 28 for Oklahoma City, taking zero shots in the fourth quarter, something Westbrook defined this way: ""That's my bad."" Anthony scored 19, but he missed three shots in the final 30 seconds. Neither team shot particularly well: The Wizards wound up making 38.2 percent of their field-goal attempts -- they missed 13 consecutive 3-point tries in one stretch -- and the Thunder were at 37.5 percent. ""We just didn't have good enough quality possessions,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said, ""all the way around."" TIP-INS Thunder: Donovan and C Steven Adams also were assessed techs. ... OKC leads the NBA in opponent turnovers at 16.5 per game. The Wizards had 12. ... Anthony went 2 for 12 on 3s. Wizards: Now 7-6 without Wall this season. ... Satoransky shot 0 for 4. DONOVAN ON BEAL Donovan had this to say about Beal, who played for him in college at Florida: ""I always say this about Brad: He's got the `it' factor. He's had it (since) a young age. I only had him for one year. I think winning is a high priority for him. It's really important for him.""","400975490"
"NEW YORK --  Enes Kanter thought it might be the nice new uniforms. Kristaps Porzingis thought it might have been Kanter's ugly lip. In reality, it didn't matter what the Knicks looked like when they played Brooklyn this season. Porzingis scored 28 points, Kanter had 20 points, 20 rebounds and five assists, and the Knicks completed a New York City sweep of the Nets with a 111-95 victory Tuesday night. The Knicks returned home from their longest road trip of the season in new uniforms but their same old dominance of the Nets, with their fourth victory in four tries this season. They dominated the interior again and swept the series for the first time since 2010-11 -- before the rivals shared the same city. Kanter said he knew he and Porzingis had a chance to overwhelm the Nets' smaller front line again. ""Especially KP, because we know they cannot guard KP 1-on-1 ... so we know that they were going to send double-teams at me and KP, so we just made extra passes and won the game,"" Kanter said. Kanter was 8 of 10 from the field, a day after needing stitches when he was cut by teammate Doug McDermott in practice. ""Enes was a monster today, just bulldozer,"" Porzingis said. ""He did what he does and just great game for him, 20-20. Maybe he was mad from yesterday that he got hit in the mouth."" Tim Hardaway Jr. added 15 points for the Knicks, who went 3-4 on their trip, which started with a victory in Brooklyn on Jan. 15. Michael Beasley finished with 12 points and 13 rebounds. They kept up their strong offensive play since then after averaging 111.3 points on the trip, fourth-best in the NBA during that span. DeMarre Carroll scored 13 points for the Nets, who lost their fourth straight game. They played their second in a row without starting forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (strained right groin) and reserve guard Caris LeVert (sore left groin). ""They're better than us right now,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It's great motivation for us. When we look at the scores for the season, they're just better than us right now. We got a lot of catching up to do."" Brooklyn fell behind by 18 in the second quarter but cut it to 10 midway through the period before the Knicks opened it up again, building a 61-41 advantage at halftime. The Knicks opened a 25-point lead that Nets trimmed it to 10 again, but Porzingis nailed a 3-pointer with 7  1/2 minutes remaining to halt their push. TIP-INS Nets: Atkinson said the Nets would determine Wednesday whether guard D'Angelo Russell, recently back from knee surgery, is able to play on the second night of a back-to-back. If not, and if LeVert remains out, he said Nik Stauskas and Isaiah Whitehead could be ballhandling options. Knicks: The Knicks debuted their City Edition uniforms, which pay homage to New York's firefighters and were designed in part by the Uniformed Firefighters Association. They're a darker blue than the Knicks' usual uniforms, a nod to the firefighters' dress uniforms. ... Guard Ron Baker left in the first quarter with a right shoulder injury. He appeared to be kicked by Carroll as the Nets forward jumped to take a shot. X-rays were negative but Baker won't travel to Boston on Wednesday. NO NOAH Joakim Noah remained out and won't play Wednesday in Boston, coach Jeff Hornacek said. The backup center left the team near the end of the trip after getting frustrated with Hornacek. MORE OKAFOR? Though he had just five points with his 13 rebounds Tuesday, Jahlil Okafor may have earned himself a larger rotation role with his season-high 21 points in a season-best 24 minutes Saturday in a loss at Minnesota. He plays Wednesday for the first time against Philadelphia, the team that took him with the No. 3 pick in 2015 but banished him to the bench before trading him to Brooklyn in December. ""We told him when he came here you've got to earn it. There's nothing given and that was a good showing in Minnesota,"" Atkinson said. ""I thought he's getting in better shape, he's understanding better what we're trying to do. So yeah, he's starting to earn more minutes.""","400975491"
"TORONTO --  The Toronto Raptors stiffened up after a sloppy first half to extend their streak of home dominance over the Minnesota Timberwolves DeMar DeRozan scored 23 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 18 points and 11 rebounds and the Raptors rallied from a 13-point deficit in to beat the Timberwolves 109-104 on Tuesday night. Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka each scored 15 points and Jakob Poeltl had six of his 12 points in the fourth quarter as the Raptors won their 14th straight home meeting with Minnesota, building on the longest home winning streak against a single opponent in team history. Toronto outscored Minnesota 58-47 in the second half, holding the Timberwolves to 18 for 44 shooting after Minnesota shot 24 for 41 in the first and second quarters. ""We were more physical,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""In the first half we were soft as tissue."" DeRozan scored 19 points after halftime, including eight in the final quarter. ""We picked it up,"" he said. ""We were a lot more aggressive, especially defensively."" Toronto is 19-4 at home this season, the second-best record in the NBA behind San Antonio (21-4). Jimmy Butler scored 25 points, Wiggins had 15 and Jeff Teague and Gorgiu Dieng each finished with 14 but the Timberwolves lost for the fourth time in five games. Taj Gibson scored 12 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 11 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota. The Timberwolves went 1-8 on the road in January. An 8-0 mark at home gave them a 9-8 record overall in their NBA-leading 17 games this month. Wiggins said he's glad the busy month is coming to an end. ""Definitely,"" he said. ""Looking forward to a new month."" Towns said changing the calendar won't be enough to change Minnesota's fortunes. ""It doesn't matter what month it is, what day it is, what year it is,"" Towns said. ""When we step on the court as the Minnesota Timberwolves, we've got to find ways to win. We didn't do that tonight."" Trailing 80-78 to begin the fourth, Toronto tied it on a fast break dunk by Norman Powell. Wiggins replied with a layup, but Poeltl's layup sparked a 12-2 Raptors run over the next three minutes, putting Toronto up 92-84 with 7:46 remaining. Wiggins made his first 3 with 1:01 left, capping a 7-0 Minnesota spurt that cut the gap to two, 103-101. Following a Toronto timeout, DeRozan's short jumper pushed the lead back to four points. Wiggins missed a 3 with 21 seconds left and DeRozan was fouled after grabbing the rebound. He and Valanciunas each made a pair of free throws in the final seconds. Making his lone appearance of the season in his home city, Wiggins missed his first six shots and finished 7 for 22, going 1 for 6 from 3-point range and coming up empty on a dunk in the fourth. ""If I'm in a shooting slump, I just keep shooting,"" he said. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Dieng made his first six shots before missing. ... Butler has scored 20 or more in six straight games. .... Towns recorded his NBA-leading 45th double-double. Raptors: F C.J. Miles (right knee) was not available. ... Toronto has 18 assists on 19 first-half baskets. ... Lowry led the Raptors with nine assists. BEEN A WHILE Minnesota has not won in Toronto since Jan. 21, 2004, when current Timberwolves star Andrew Wiggins was eight years old. NEW DAD DELIVERS Raptors G Fred VanVleet flew home to Rockford, Illinois, following Sunday's home win over the Lakers to attend the birth of his first child, a girl. VanVleet was excused from practice Monday and rejoined the team about an hour before game time Tuesday. He finished with 10 points. ""Going from Daddy mode to playing a game, I thought he played a heck of a game,"" Casey said.","400975492"
"DETROIT --  A loss to short-handed Detroit was hardly the biggest concern for LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Cleveland's recent rough stretch went from bad to worse Tuesday night when Kevin Love exited with a broken left hand in a 125-114 loss to the Pistons. The Cavaliers said he had a non-displaced fracture in his fifth metacarpal and his status would be updated after additional examination Wednesday in Cleveland. ""It's just unfortunate for our team,"" James said. ""Obviously with everything (that's) been going on as of late with our ballclub, just trying to figure out how we're going to play every night, different lineups, and getting everybody into the flow, we don't need to have Kev go out like that. He's going to be out for quite a while -- maybe two months -- so it's just tough."" The Cavs have lost 11 of 16, and the injury will likely affect the defending Eastern Conference champions' plans as the Feb. 8 trading deadline approaches. They may have to make a significant move to replace Love. ""When it rains, it pours,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. Andre Drummond had 21 points and 22 rebounds for the Pistons, who snapped an eight-game losing streak despite a lineup that was depleted by their blockbuster trade for Blake Griffin. Detroit dealt three players to the Los Angeles Clippers to get Griffin, and neither he nor the other two players the Pistons received in return were available against Cleveland. Drummond -- whose own status was in question because of an illness -- had a huge game, and Stanley Johnson added a career-high 26 points. Reggie Bullock added 22 points for the Pistons, and Anthony Tolliver scored 20. ""I needed that, and everyone in the room needed that,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""When you've lost eight in a row, all you care about is getting to the end of a game with more points than the other team. It doesn't matter how."" James scored 21 points for the Cavs, but Cleveland was listless early and outplayed late -- and the result felt secondary to Love's health. Love played only 4:41 and went scoreless. SUPPORTING CAST The Pistons had to give up Tobias Harris and Avery Bradley -- two starters -- to acquire Griffin, so players like Johnson, Bullock and Luke Kennard will have a chance to play bigger roles. Bullock scored 16 points in the first half Tuesday, and Johnson was impressive throughout, pushing the ball up the court and attacking the rim. ""I told (Johnson) after the game that I think that's the best game I've ever seen him play,"" Van Gundy said. ""He was aggressive on both ends, and while no one stops LeBron, he did a very good job against him."" MILESTONE Wade scored 18 points after missing two games because of the death of his longtime agent Henry Thomas. Wade (21,800) moved past Larry Bird (21,791) for 32nd place on the NBA's career scoring list. ALL-STAR Drummond was added to the NBA All-Star Game on Tuesday, replacing injured Washington guard John Wall. After he was initially left out of the All-Star Game, Drummond apparently felt snubbed, posting last week to his Twitter account: ""Guess I gotta start doing back flips after every point I score to get attention around here!"" The Pistons are hopeful Griffin and Drummond will develop good chemistry together, the way Griffin did with DeAndre Jordan while with the Clippers. ""Maybe, but I've got a lot more to my offensive game than DeAndre, so we're going to be able to do a lot of things beyond lobs,"" Drummond said. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Isaiah Thomas scored 19 points and Kyle Korver added 10. Pistons: Detroit had 44 points in the paint in the first half and 68 for the game. ... Johnson's previous career high was 22 points against New York on Feb. 4, 2016.","400975493"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden knew he'd have to do a little more on Tuesday night with the Houston Rockets missing key players. Even he couldn't have imagined he'd do this much. Harden became the first player in NBA history to score 60 points as part of a triple-double and the short-handed Rockets beat the Orlando Magic 114-107. ""I just gave it all I had tonight,"" Harden said. ""We all did. We all fought for 48 minutes, we got key stops when we needed to and we made big shots."" Harden scored 18 points in the fourth quarter to eclipse the 57 points Calvin Murphy scored in 1978 to break Houston's single-game scoring record. After Harden broke the record, cameras in the arena showed a shot of Murphy, who works on the television broadcast team, smiling and clapping for the Beard, who also had 10 rebounds and 11 assists. The game was tied at 107 after a basket by Marreese Speights with just under four minutes to play. Neither team scored for more than two minutes after that before Harden took over, scoring the next six points to make it 113-107 with 45 seconds left. He set the scoring mark when he stepped back and made a 3-pointer before crashing to the court after being fouled by Mario Hezonja. He then made the free throw to give him 60 points and bringing the crowd to its feet. ""Amazing (and) topped it off with a four-point play at the end,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""But we had to have every minute from him."" Harden, who also had four steals and a block, grabbed his 10th rebound a few seconds later to give him his third triple double this season. He made 17 of 18 free throws and was 19 of 30 from the floor with five 3 pointers. He said he didn't realize he was the first player with 60 points in a triple-double. ""It's a good feeling, I guess,"" he said. ""Just try to go out there and make an impact every single night on the game, however I can. Whether it's scoring, rebounding, assists, steals, whatever it is. And tonight I guess I was doing everything."" Hezonja and Speights scored 17 points each for the Magic, who dropped their third straight. The Rockets started the game without Chris Paul, who has a sore groin, and Trevor Ariza, who is dealing with a strained hamstring. They lost another player when Eric Gordon, who is second on the team in scoring with 19.5 points a game, left early in the second quarter with lower back stiffness. ""I looked at coach and said: `Eric can't go,"" Harden said ""He said go get `em and after that I didn't come out of the game."" Harden's big night came as he played 46 minutes and 26 seconds, which was a career-high for a regulation game, with Houston missing so many players. ""I was shocked to see that,"" Speights said of Harden not getting worn out by playing so many minutes. ""He didn't really get subbed out and that shows the growth in his game and the maturity in his game."" It was his fourth 50-point game this season and Tuesday's performance bested his previous career-high of 56 points set in November against Utah. ""I have never seen a performance like that,"" teammate Gerald Green said. ""I caught myself just being a true fan throughout the whole game ... what he did today was remarkable."" Orlando led by two points with about 9 1/2 minutes left before the Rockets used a 10-4 run to make it 101-97 with about seven minutes to go. Harden made two 3-pointers in that stretch, and wowed the crowd on the second one that he came as the shot clock was about to expire and with Shelvin Mack right in his face. Houston didn't lead for long though, as Speights was fouled while making a 3-pointer and added the free throw to tie it seconds later. The Magic had a 2-point lead with about 5 1/2 minutes left before Houston used a 6-2 run, with all its points from Harden, to take a 107-105 lead with about four minutes left. Harden piled up 16 points in the first quarter and had 24 by halftime despite his early 3-point shooting woes. Orlando led 55-54 at halftime. TIP-INS Magic: Aaron Gordon missed the game with an injury to his left hip that he suffered on Saturday night. He will likely sit out Wednesday as well.  ... Simmons and Mack added 15 points each. Rockets: Ariza injured his left hamstring on Sunday. ... Coach Mike D'Antoni said he doesn't expect Paul to miss much time with his injury. ... Clint Capela finished with 12 points and 13 rebounds. THEY SAID IT Magic coach Frank Vogel on Harden's performance: ""That was a heck of a performance when your second, third and fourth options are out. He's likely the MVP of this year's season. He did what he had to do to get a win. LOVE FROM LEBRON Cleveland star LeBron James gave Harden some love on Twitter after the game , tweeting in part: ""That's insane G! 60 point Triple Dub. Sheesh!!!"" The four-time MVP added five fire emojis after his comment to show how impressed he was with Harden's game.","400975494"
"Zach Randolph goes for a double-double and De'Aaron Fox surges the offense as the Kings take down the Pelicans 114-103. (0:55) NEW ORLEANS --  Zach Randolph and the Sacramento Kings are going home happy after closing out a six-game road trip by winning three of their last four. Randolph scored 26 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, and the Kings beat the New Orleans Pelicans 114-103 on Tuesday night. ""We are playing better,"" Randolph said, crediting contributions of teammates who've had to play more because of injuries to big men Willie Cauley-Stein and Skal Labissiere, as well as guard Frank Mason. ""Everyone is getting an opportunity and we're taking advantage of it. We are just playing hard and that is all we can do."" Kosta Koufos had 17 points and a career-high 17 rebounds for the Kings, who were able to exploit Cousins' absence by getting double-doubles from both of their starting big men.  Koufous accounted for half of Sacramento's 14 offensive rebounds, which the Kings converted into a 26-0 advantage in second-chance points. ""Whether it's 17 rebounds or two rebounds, we won tonight, so it feels good to win, especially on this long plane back,"" Koufos said. ""We've been on the road for two weeks almost and for us to end this road trip on a W with that momentum going into Sacramento, it feels really good."" The Pelicans continue to struggle, having gone winless since losing All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins to a season-ending injury. Anthony Davis had 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Pelicans, while Jrue Holiday scored 21 points and Ian Clark a season-high 20, hitting nine of 10 shots. But New Orleans has lost both of its games without Cousins, who went out for the season with a ruptured left Achilles at the end of a victory over Houston last Friday night. The Pelicans won seven of the last eight games Cousins played. They've lost two straight -- at home to teams that came in at .500 or worse -- without him. ""Any time you lose a piece like DeMarcus, there's going to be residue from it,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""Some kind of way, we've got to get over that. It may take a few games. ""I still think we're a good team,"" added Gentry, whose team is 27-24 and remains in the Western Conference playoff picture. ""I still think we're going to be OK."" Rookie De'Aaron Fox and reserve guard Garrett Temple, a former LSU player, each scored 15 points for the Kings, who took the lead for good in the first minute of the second half. The Pelicans trailed by five points after Davis' free throws with 4:13 to go, but Sacramento reserve George Hill, who had 14 points, responded with a 3 with 3:24 left. Koufos then converted inside to make it a 10-point game with 2:44 left and New Orleans never got closer than six after that. TIP INS Kings: The victory was the first with assistant coach Elston Turner temporarily in charge because of head coach Dave Joerger's recent absence. Joerger returned to Sacramento for a medical check-up after light-headedness caused him to leave a game at San Antonio on Sunday. Joerger has been deemed fit to return to coaching. ... Randolph shot 11 of 23 overall and 3 of 6 from 3-point range. ... Reserve G Buddy Hield, drafted sixth overall by New Orleans in 2016 and sent to Sacramento as part of the trade that brought Cousins to the Pelicans, scored eight points on 4-of-9 shooting, but missed all four of his 3-point attempts. ... The Kings improved to 9-20 on the road, with two of those victories coming in New Orleans. Pelicans: Shot 9 of 25 (36 percent) from 3-point, including 3 of 15 in the second half. ... Reserve F Cheik Diallo played for the first time since Jan. 10. He was in the game for six minutes and had two points and a rebound. ... G Tony Allen was in uniform and active after missing 22 games with a fractured left fibula, but did not play. ... F Dante Cunningham, who has started forward in both games since Cousins' injury, left late in the first half with back spasms. ... C Omer Asik played a season-high 24 minutes. He had four rebounds, a block, a steal and one point on 1-fo-4 free throw shooting. THIRD-QUARTER QUANDRY Gentry expressed frustration with the Pelicans' repeated struggles in third quarters this season, which continued against Sacramento. ""We've got to find a solution to that,"" Gentry said. ""We've gone out and changed some of the things that we're doing. We've tried to get ball movement. We go back and look at the tape. I can't get it figured out.""","400975495"
"SAN ANTONIO --  After their recent struggles offensively, the Spurs welcomed the chance to match baskets with the Denver Nuggets and play at a fast pace. Even if it led to a few anxious seconds. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 30 points and San Antonio escaped with a 106-104 victory over Denver on Tuesday night. ""That young team has come leaps and bounds,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Mike (Malone, Nuggets coach) does a great job with them. So, it's a good win for us."" San Antonio matched a season high with 33 assists while shooting 50 percent from the field. It was a welcome change for San Antonio, which was in an offensive rut in its two previous games of a five-game homestand. The Spurs scored 60 points in the first half against the Nuggets after averaging just 40 against Philadelphia and Sacramento, including a season-low 31 against the 76ers on Friday. ""That's definitely the Spurs way,"" San Antonio point guard Dejounte Murray said. ""Sharing the ball, playing defense and just playing together. That's what we did and we came out with a good win."" San Antonio had four players in double figures, including 18 points each from Kyle Anderson and Pau Gasol. Anderson set a career scoring high while shooting 9 for 12 from the field. The Nuggets were able to match the Spurs' production despite playing the second night of a back-to-back after losing at home to Boston 111-110. Every Denver starter scored in double figures with Jamal Murray leading the way with 18 points and Gary Harris adding 17. San Antonio had to battle to win its 11th straight at home over Denver. There were 18 lead changes and the Nuggets came within inches of a game-winning 19th. Jamal Murray's 3-pointer with 31.6 seconds remaining pulled Denver within 106-104. After San Antonio guard Danny Green missed a 3-pointer, the Nuggets raced down the floor and furiously passed the ball three times to set up Will Barton for a 25-foot 3-pointer that rattled in and out of the rim. ""I just couldn't believe that the opportunities they penetrated, they didn't even look at the 2,"" Gasol said. ""They were trying to set up someone for the 3. They had a great look."" The Nuggets wanted the win. ""It was great ball movement,"" Denver forward Darrell Arthur said. ""We used the clock and we got the shot we wanted to get. It just didn't fall."" The Nuggets finished 10 for 23 on 3-pointers while shooting 47 percent from the field while San Antonio shot 50 percent. Denver made their first five three-pointers in taking a 17-12 lead, but the Spurs responded by making their first three 3s. It set the tone for a back-and-forth, high-scoring duel. ""Well, I was watching them last night and figured they'd be a little tired tonight, but they came out hitting,"" Anderson said. ""So, hats off to them. They were able to come in and make shots, but we knew them. We know they're a good team, so we just had to buckle down and get the win somehow."" TIP-INS Nuggets: Mason Plumlee did not play after straining his right calf against Boston on Monday night. Plumlee remained in Denver for an MRI while the team flew to San Antonio. Malone said Plumlee is ""going to be out for a little while."" . Wilson Chandler was available to play but did not enter the game after being listed as probable with an illness. Spurs: Aldridge has scored 20-plus points in 33 of 50 games this season. His previous best for 20-point games was 31 in 74 games during his inaugural season with the Spurs in 2016. . Aldridge was assessed his third technical foul this season with 4:30 remaining in the third quarter after arguing about a non-call against Denver's defense. Aldridge has 18 career technical fouls but only one ejection. . Anderson established a career high with 363 points. His previous season's best was 350 points in 2016. OLDER GETTING BETTER Manu Ginobili joined Sacramento's Vince Carter as the only 40-and-older players with 40 3-pointers in a season. Ginobili finished 3 for 6 on 3s while scoring 14 points, including six in 31 seconds in the first quarter. After sinking a free throw after being fouled on a reverse layup, he drained the first of his three 3-pointers. Ginobili would later stretch for a low pass and then throw it behind his back to Davis Bertans, who would score on a runner. FIRST START Arthur found out Tuesday morning that he would make his first start of the season. The veteran forward appeared in only seven games this season entering Tuesday, playing a total of 50 minutes. He played 19 minutes against the Spurs, establishing a season high with seven points in the first half and finished with 10 points. ""I'm surprised I didn't get as tired as I thought I was going to be today,"" Arthur said.","400975496"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr was disgusted by his team's effort in a 30-point blowout on Tuesday night. For the Utah Jazz, it was the best win of a disappointing season. Ricky Rubio scored 23 points and handed out 11 assists as the Utah Jazz stunned the Golden State Warriors 129-99. ""I saw one team get their (tail) kicked,"" Kerr said. ""Our hearts weren't in it. At this level, if your heart's not in it, I don't care how much talent you have. You're going to lose. ... It happens. It's the NBA. It's a long season. ""Our guys will tell you, that was a pathetic effort out there. That was disgusting basketball."" The loss ended a three-game winning streak for the Warriors, who had won seven of eight before facing the Jazz. It was their largest loss of the season. Utah now has a three-game win streak for just the third time this season. ""When you play against the champs, you always get that extra energy,"" Rubio said. ""But we got to bring it every night. It was a great night to see where our level can be and we got to bring it every night."" Joe Ingles led a 3-point barrage by the Jazz that gave the team a 13-point lead at halftime that was extended to 18 at the end of the third quarter. The Aussie knocked down a career-high six triples, finished with 20 points and the Jazz shot 50.0 percent from behind the arc. Rubio continued his recent run of strong play and tied his season-high assists. Derrick Favors added 18 points and 10 rebounds while rookie Donovan Mitchell scored 20 The Jazz hit a season-high 58.2 percent of their shots from the field, the highest the Warriors have allowed under Kerr. ""Shooting is an equalizer,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""I thought when we came out, Joe Ingles set the tone with the confidence with which he shot the ball. ""You aren't able to beat those guys if you don't shoot it well and we haven't been able to beat them and it's because they're that good."" Rudy Gobert anchored a defense that cut off a lot of Golden State drives to the basket and the Warriors never put together one of those offensive runs that typically buries their opponents. Kerr seemed to wave the white flag with more than six minutes left in the game, pulling his starters. He lamented the lack of energy from his squad. Klay Thompson led Golden State with 27 points and six rebounds while Kevin Durant finished with 17. Durant and Stephen Curry were a combined 1 for 12 from 3-point range. ""The issue tonight was just defense,"" Curry said. ""I asked Draymond (Green) on the bench in the fourth quarter if he could remember that bad of a performance that we've had in recent memory? Really can't. ... Can't just show up, especially on the road, and expect to win. That's kind of cheating the game."" TIP-INS: Warriors: Kevon Looney did not play due to the flu. Jazz: Rodney Hood missed his fifth straight game due to a lower leg contusion. LOYALTY AND SACRIFICE The Los Angeles Clippers traded Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons on Monday despite having signed a $171-million free agent deal to stay with the Clippers in July. Curry said players never know how the future is going to work out. ""It is another example of players being kind of pigeonholed into this idea of loyalty and sacrifice and all that kind of stuff when it comes to signing deals and where they want to play and free agency,"" Curry said. ""It's not reciprocated on the other end consistently. There are examples that it is and there are healthy relationships around the league, for sure. Not to sound too negative, but I think there is kind of a consensus that you have to make decisions as you see fit as an individual. ""What's best for you, your family and understand that a part of the league is unforeseen events like yesterday. It's something that will always be part of the league."" CITY EDITION The Jazz debuted their new ""City Edition"" uniforms with a corresponding court layout. The jerseys gradually fade from a bright gold around the shoulders, to orange around the midsection to a deep burgundy at the bottom of the shorts that represents the red rocks and canyons in southern Utah. The court also featured the color pattern around the edges and in the ""Utah"" logo at center court. The floor also featured an image of the Delicate Arch from the Arches National Park.","400975497"
"LOS ANGELES --  Damian Lillard knew better than to underestimate the Los Angeles Clippers without newly traded star Blake Griffin. Sure enough, the Clippers made a run in the fourth quarter but the Portland Trail Blazers won 104-96 on Tuesday night. ""Your mind could be trapped into thinking you don't think they have it,"" said Lillard, who scored 28 points. CJ McCollum added 16 points and Jusuf Nurkic had 14 points and 18 rebounds for the Blazers, who ended a seven-game skid against the Clippers while winning their third in a row. Portland shot just 37 percent from the floor, but rode a big third quarter to its third straight win. ""The third quarter was great,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""At both ends of the floor we moved the ball. The offense was efficient. Defensively we were on point. The third quarter was the best part of the game."" The Blazers shot 47 percent in the third, when they outscored the Clippers 30-16 led by Lillard's 10 points. Griffin was dealt to Detroit in a stunning move on Monday, leaving Los Angeles where he had played his entire career. ""It was definitely tough to see him go,"" said DeAndre Jordan, who had 18 rebounds for the Clippers. Lou Williams scored 20 points off the bench for the Clippers, who made a run in the fourth after they trailed by 20. Montrezl Harrell scored 11 of his 15 points early in the period and then Los Angeles scored 10 straight points to get to 100-94. But the Clippers were limited to one field goal in the final 2 minutes. OFFENSIVE BOARDS The Blazers outrebounded the Clippers 59-50, including an 18-9 edge on the offensive glass. ""When they win the offensive rebounds, they win the game,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said.

"INDIANAPOLIS --  Myles Turner returned to the Pacers' starting lineup merely hoping to put together a performance he could build on. But with 34 seconds left in the game, Turner found himself at the foul line putting an exclamation point on his best game of the season. ""I'm not missing,"" Turner said he thought to himself. The third-year big man made both free throws, giving Indiana the lead Wednesday night in a 105-101 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. Turner had his fourth double-double of the season with 15 points and 11 rebounds. He also blocked three shots against a Memphis team that only had nine players available. The win was Indiana's third straight and fifth in six games. ""You've got to commend the Grizzlies with the way they played,"" Turner said. ""But at the same time, we've got to be able to put our foot down, put our foot on the gas, get going from the jump on a team like that. You've got to jump out on teams. It's good to get this win, but you want to build off this one and learn from this one as well."" Turner has missed 16 games due to injury this season, including nine straight in January. Once he got healthy, he came off the bench for two games before returning to the starting lineup against the Grizzlies. He jumped out aggressively from the start, scoring seven points in the first quarter and pulling down six rebounds. All five Pacers starters ended up scoring in double digits. Bojan Bogdanovic and Darren Collison each had 21 points, Victor Oladipo added 13 and Thaddeus Young had 10. The teams traded the lead nine times in the first half, with Indiana taking a 55-53 lead into halftime. The Pacers opened the second half with a 9-3 run, but Memphis wouldn't go away. Trailing 100-95, the Grizzlies went on a 6-0 spurt to regain the lead with 1:57 to play. After Turner's late free throws gave the Pacers a 102-101 lead, Memphis had multiple opportunities to answer back. Marc Gasol's 11-foot jumper with 15 seconds left was rebounded by Grizzlies teammate Wayne Selden. With less than three seconds remaining, Selden drove the lane and attempted a floater in heavy traffic. More than two Pacers were there when Selden went up for the shot, but it was partially blocked by Cory Joseph and the Pacers grabbed the rebound and sealed the game at the foul line. Gasol finished with 23 points and nine rebounds. Selden led the Grizzlies with 24 points but was ejected with 0.7 seconds remaining after arguing he was fouled on his missed shot. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff came onto the floor to join Selden in his altercation with officials. ""It's frustrating. (I was) looking for some consistency,"" Bickerstaff said. ""He attacks the basket, puts himself in a position to be fouled, goes strong to the basket, didn't get the whistle."" Still, Bickerstaff was pleased with his team. ""You can't take anything away from their effort,"" he said. ""This was just another example of the fight that's in that group.""

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Magic's shots went in and the Lakers' starters went out in the third quarter Wednesday night. Los Angeles never recovered. Marreese Speights scored 21 points, Evan Fournier added 19 and Orlando ran away from the Lakers for a 127-105 victory. Winning for only the fourth time in 24 games, the Magic hit a franchise-record nine 3s in a 43-point third period. ""The 3-pointer is a momentum shot,"" Speights said after making his second start of the season. ""You come out and hit a couple like that and you can beat a team easily. You saw that happen in the third quarter."" Orlando (15-35) was 9 for 13 from behind the arc in its highest-scoring quarter of the season. The Magic shot 18 for 32 (56 percent) from 3-point territory overall. ""It seemed like we were going to make every single shot,"" said Mario Hezonja, who hit two of his four 3-pointers in the third. ""When that happens, you can take a breath and say, OK, we don't have to go crazy tonight and try to protect anything. We can control the pace of the game. And we did that."" Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson scored 20 points apiece for the Lakers, who never led after the first quarter. When Elfrid Payton's three-point play gave the Magic a 66-53 lead 93 seconds into the third, Lakers coach Luke Walton yanked all five of his starters out of the game. ""I just thought we came out with no energy. (Speights) got a quick 3 and it didn't feel like our guys were ready to play,"" Walton explained. ""The message was, look, if you're not ready to play or you don't want to play, you're not going to play. So we went to the second unit. It was a teaching moment."" The Lakers (19-31) never again got the margin under 11. Hezonja hit a 3-pointer, Fournier followed with two more and Jonathon Simmons added two more 3s to help the Magic finish the period on a 22-13 run for a 20-point lead. They led by 29 early in the fourth. The Lakers were down by 12 when three straight baskets by Clarkson got them back in the game midway through the second quarter. Speights scored Orlando's final 10 points of the half, including a couple of 3s. It was a dispiriting loss for the Lakers, who had won eight of 11. ""We lost by 30 (actually 22) to the team that has the worst record in the league,"" Kyle Kuzma said. ""That's kind of deflating, but give credit to them. They beat us.""

"ATLANTA --  Dwight Howard's strong start helped Charlotte build a lead. Kemba Walker's historic shooting kept the Hornets ahead. Walker set franchise and career highs with nine 3-pointers and scored 38 points, Howard added 20 points, and Charlotte dominated the Atlanta Hawks 123-110 on Wednesday night. Walker had 18 points in the third quarter. ""The ball was just falling,"" Walker said. ""I got great looks and I was able to just knock them down."" Charlotte never trailed while building double-digit leads in each half. Howard scored the game's first two baskets in his first return to Atlanta after one season with his hometown Hawks. ""We got out to a good lead ... and they were never able to fully recover from that,"" Howard said. It was Howard's second double-double in less than a week against the Hawks. He had 18 points and 15 rebounds in Charlotte's 121-110 win over the Hawks on Friday. Nicolas Batum had 10 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for Charlotte. The Hawks couldn't slow Walker's scoring. ""I think he just got them every way,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Charlotte made 17 of 32 3s, including 9 of 13 by Walker. ""When the game got going up and down, he was unbelievable,"" Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. Charlotte's biggest lead in the first half was 15 points, last held at 62-47. Kent Bazemore had 12 of his 25 points in the third quarter to help Atlanta cut into the deficit. Dennis Schroder's jumper shrunk the Hornets' lead to 77-76. Walker answered with a 3-pointer that started his scoring streak that carried through the end of the third period. The Hornets' lead was back to 13 points entering the fourth. The win was already decided when Howard added powerful jams over Ersan Ilyasova and Mike Muscala in the fourth. TIP-INS Hornets: F Marvin Williams (left ankle sprain) was held out. X-rays were negative after he left the fourth quarter of Monday night's loss to Indiana. Frank Kaminsky started for Williams, who may miss another game. ... The Hornets wore their black ""Buzz City"" alternate uniforms. ... Charlotte has won the first three games of the four-game season series. Hawks: Marco Belinelli, who had 22 points, made his first four 3-pointers before three misses. ... Budenholzer said F DeAndre Bembry (left abductor strain) was making progress but there was no change in his status. ... Muscala started the second half instead of Miles Plumlee and hit a 3-pointer on the team's first possession following the break. HOWARD'S HOMECOMING During the first timeout, fans had a mixed reaction to a tribute to Howard. There were boos and some cheers when the Hawks posted an image of Howard on the video board with the message ""Thanks for being true to Atlanta."" There was another mixed reaction when the PA announcer urged fans to ""give it up for Dwight Howard."" There were a few boos during Howard's pregame introduction. SORE SHOULDER FOR SCHRODER Schroder had his right shoulder wrapped as he sat on the bench at the end of the third quarter, but he returned about four minutes into the final period and had 13 points and nine assists. There was continued discomfort following the game. He apparently hurt the shoulder in the first half. ""I don't know how it happened,"" Schroder said. ""I'm going to check it with the trainers and see what's going on."" DELAYED T Official Eric Lewis called an unusual technical foul on Budenholzer in the second quarter. Budenholzer complained when no foul was called as Bazemore had his shot denied. Budenholzer had no more to say when the action moved to the other end of the floor, where Batum scored. Lewis then called the technical foul on Budenholzer, who reacted with shock, and another technical foul on Bazemore.","400975501"
"NEW YORK --  Feeling good after his best performance since knee surgery, D'Angelo Russell was just happy his struggling team won. Especially because of what it meant to Jahlil Okafor. Russell scored 22 points, Okafor capped the decisive spurt of the game with a basket against his former team, and the Brooklyn Nets beat the Philadelphia 76ers 116-108 on Wednesday night to snap a four-game skid. ""You get traded you want to put up numbers and get the win at the end of the day,"" Russell said, ""and we got that win for him."" Spencer Dinwiddie scored 27 points, while rookie center Jarrett Allen, making his first start at home, had 16 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets, who took charge of a close game with an 11-0 run early in the fourth quarter. Dinwiddie had six points during the surge, which started with a 3-pointer by Nik Stauskas and ended on a bucket by Okafor in the first meeting since the 76ers sent both of them to Brooklyn in December. ""If I were to say that that win didn't feel great, I would be lying,"" Okafor said. ""So it felt awesome to be able to pull it out, and for me and Nik to be able to go out there and help win was great."" Joel Embiid had 29 points and 14 rebounds for the 76ers, who dropped their third straight and fell back to .500 at 24-24. Ben Simmons scored 24 points and J.J. Redick added 20 in his return from a seven-game absence with a leg injury. ""That's a .500 team. That's what a team like that does. You go up and down, up and down, up and down,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""This team can beat anybody and it can lose to anybody. That's part of the wild ride we're on with a bunch of 20-year-olds figuring stuff up."" Simmons was 9 of 10 for 18 points in his first 14 minutes but the Sixers couldn't build much of a lead in part because of Russell, who recently returned from a two-month absence and felt good enough to play on both nights of a back-to-back. He hadn't scored 20 since mid-November, before the surgery. ""They got some talent over there and for us to get any win in this league is definitely a start, so hopefully we can capitalize on it and keep building,"" Russell said. Neither team led by double digits through three quarters and the 76ers were ahead 92-91 in the opening minute of the fourth before Stauskas made a 3-pointer. Dinwiddie followed with three free throws and another 3, and Okafor scored inside to cap the run and make it 102-92 with 7:09 to play. ""We forgot how to play defense,"" Embiid said. Embiid tried to bring the Sixers back, bulling his way for consecutive baskets that cut it to 111-107. But soon after he fouled Allen and DeMarre Carroll, who made all four free throws to keep Brooklyn safely ahead. TIP-INS 76ers: Brown said he expects No. 1 draft pick Markelle Fultz, who appeared in just four games before a right shoulder injury, to play again this season. Brown just can't predict when. ""It's just an answer that I can't give anybody, we can't give anybody, nor can he,"" Brown said. ""I mean at the end of the day it's going to be when he feels good about himself and feels good about his shoulder, and that's almost the bottom line. We'll help him, but really he's got to feel comfortable that he can go be himself and none of us should begrudge him for that."" Nets: Coach Kenny Atkinson said the Nets hope reserve guard Caris LeVert (left groin) could return Friday, but starting forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (right groin) will be out a couple more games. NUMBERS GAME Brown said the only reason Okafor wasn't playing in Philadelphia was because of the big men ahead of him in a crowded frontcourt the last couple of seasons. ""What everybody should really hear is, he's just so young. He was drafted third for a reason,"" Brown said. ""He's a hell of a player and for us in the time and the moment that we're in and with Joel, etc., the court time just wasn't available."" SUPPORT FOR SAM Atkinson on former 76ers executive Sam Hinkie, whose strategy of building through the draft was heavily debated. ""I think of Sam Hinkie, there should be a management award for him, or a management study on what he did,"" Atkinson said. ""We can argue you like it, you don't like it, but I was around him. I really like him as a person and I just think he did a phenomenal job and thinking long term like that, to have that vision that most of us don't have, let's be honest, I don't think he gets enough credit.""","400975502"
"CLEVELAND --  A dramatic, disturbing month for the Cavaliers ended with a defensive stop. Go figure. LeBron James scored 24 points and turned away Miami's James Johnson before he could get off a shot in the final seconds as Cleveland began a long stretch without injured All-Star Kevin Love by holding off the Heat 91-89 on Wednesday night. ""I was going downhill against him. I liked what I was doing. The only thing is, he's LeBron,"" Johnson said. With the Cavs clinging to a two-point lead after Kyle Korver made one of two free throws, the 6-foot-8, 240-pound Johnson drove the right side for a potential game-tying shot, but was stopped in his tracks by James on the baseline. Johnson then fumbled the ball away as the horn sounded. ""I don't know if there's anybody else back there that would have stopped J.J. from getting to the rim,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We've seen it before. LeBron met him and was able to stop him basically in the paint. I don't think there's anybody else in the league who could do that."" Jae Crowder made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:21 left for the Cavs, who came in as the NBA's worst defensive team. Cleveland, though, buckled down in big spots and held the Heat to 3-of-28 shooting on 3-pointers. ""To win a game on the defensive side with the struggles we've had, that's pretty impressive,"" James said. ""And versus this team, who's had one of the best records in the NBA in January. It was a big win for us."" The Cavs rebounded from a troubling loss Tuesday at Detroit -- the undermanned Pistons scored 125 points -- and prevented the Heat from overtaking them for third place in the Eastern Conference standings. It was Cleveland's first game since Love broke his left hand. The five-time All-Star is consulting with surgeons in New York, and it's possible he'll undergo an operation as early as Thursday. Love, who could miss two months, already has screws in the hand from a previous procedure after he broke it in 2009 with Minnesota. While he's out, the Cavs have to hold themselves together. Cleveland shot just 35 percent and got outrebounded, but for the first time in a long time, the defense was solid. The Cavs hadn't held a team under 90 points since Nov. 20. ""The way we've been playing defense lately, we probably would have lost by 30, but we just stayed in the moment,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""I thought guys stayed in tune."" Goran Dragic scored 18 and Josh Richardson had 15 to lead the Heat. FINALLY FEBRUARY The Cavs are happy to see the calendar turn after going 6-8 to start 2018. ""I'm happy January is over,"" Dwyane Wade said. ""Move on to February, which hopefully is a better month. In this league, you have to have a short memory."" DRAMA KINGS The Cavs have been enveloped in theatrics all season. There have been injuries, blowout losses, persistent trade rumors and more story lines than a day-time soap opera. ""As The Land Turns,"" Lue said with a sigh following his pregame media availability. TROUBLED THOMAS Playing his first back-to-back games this season, Cavs guard Isaiah Thomas went 2 of 15 from the floor. He was 0 for 6 on 3-pointers but made all nine free throws. He's still struggling because of a serious hip injury, but felt good about finishing January on the floor. ""My body felt good,"" he said. ""My legs (are) not there and it's obvious. But my body is good, my hip felt good and those are positive steps for me mentally to be able to practice back-to-back days and then play in back-to-back games, so it has been a positive month in that aspect."" MIAMI MISSES The Heat were ice cold, and nearly won anyway. ""That's why we really wanted to get this game,"" Spoelstra said. ""This would have been such a great game to win when we played horribly offensively. To be there at the end, shooting what we did from the 3-point line, free throw line and turnovers on top of that, these are the real gratifying wins if you can find a way -- but we didn't."" TIP-INS Heat: The tragic death of former NBA player Rasual Butler devastated Spoelstra and forward Udonis Haslem. Butler was drafted by Miami and played three seasons there. ""It's horrible, horrible news for all of us,"" said Spoelstra, who got emotional talking about Butler, who was killed along with his wife in a single-vehicle rollover in Los Angeles.

"BOSTON -- Terry Rozier put together a pretty nice impression of Kyrie Irving on Wednesday night. With Irving sidelined by a quad injury, Rozier logged his first career triple-double in his first NBA start to help the Boston Celtics to a 103-73 victory over the New York Knicks. Rozier collected 17 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to become just the second player in NBA history with a triple-double in his first start, joining Tony Wroten for Philadelphia on Nov. 13, 2013, according to Elias Sports Bureau. ""It just worked out perfect for me,"" Rozier said. ""I got to knock down some shots in the beginning of the game, hit the open man, I'm always going to get in there and rebound. Just a great night."" Irving got hurt during Monday's win in Denver, which gave the Celtics a split of a four-game road trip that included a 109-105 loss to Golden State. ""I thought we got ourselves a little bit more re-centered. We played a lot better out west,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""So, I was really interested to see how tonight would go without Kyrie."" Marcus Morris scored 20 points for Boston, and Jayson Tatum had 15. Al Horford and Jaylen Brown scored 14 points apiece. New York was trying for a third straight win. Enes Kanter had 17 points and 17 rebounds for the Knicks, and Kristaps Porzingis scored 16 points. The Knicks shot just 32.2 percent (28 of 87). They were outscored 53-28 in the second half, including 22-8 in the fourth quarter. ""There's going to be nights that you're not going to (be) good offensively, but I think for us to get to the next level, for us to be an elite team, just go out there and play defense,"" Kanter said. ""We cannot just say `Oh, we're not shooting the ball well' and just give up on defense."" Morris left in the final minute of the third quarter when he landed hard on his backside after a dunk. He was officially diagnosed with a bruised left hip. ""It was my (butt), it wasn't really my hip,"" Morris said. ""(I'm) sore, but I'm going to go home and ice (it) and see how I feel tomorrow."" Kanter also exited the game in the third after re-aggravating a lip laceration he suffered during practice. He returned shortly after his lip was re-stitched. Boston carried a 50-45 lead into halftime and grabbed control by outscoring New York 31-20 in the third quarter. The Knicks trailed by as many as 33 in the closing period. KNICKED UP Boston's 30-point win represented its largest margin of victory this season, and the Knicks' 73 points were the fewest allowed by the Celtics since Dec. 8, 2013, also against New York. ""I have no explanation for it,"" New York coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""They played better and played harder and they're a little bigger than us."" POSTERIZING PORZINGIS Brown threw down a one-handed slam over Porzingis with 7:22 to play in the second quarter, sending fans into a frenzy. ""(On a scale of) one to 10? On my scale? That's about a five,"" a laughing Brown said about his dunk. TIP-INS Knicks: Porzingis recorded a block for the 20th straight game. ...

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  CJ McCollum had inspiration for his 50-point game: His 92-year-old great aunt was visiting Portland for the first time. He gave her quite a show. McCollum scored a franchise-record 28 points in the first quarter before finishing with a career-high 50 through three, and the Portland Trail Blazers took advantage of the short-handed Chicago Bulls for a 124-108 victory Wednesday night. ""During the game I was thinking, she probably thinks this is a really good game to come to,"" he said, laughing. McCollum's 28 points in the opening quarter were the most by an NBA player this season. His final tally was nine points shy of the team record set by Damian Lillard last season. ""I'm not into chasing records, man. I just want to win,"" McCollum said. ""Even throughout the game, I looked up and I was like, I can get 40. And then Ed (Davis) was like, `No, you need 50.' And Dame was like, `Get 50.' So I was like, `OK, I'll get 50 if you guys want me to."" Lillard also sat out the final period after adding 13 points and seven assists for the Blazers, who led by as many as 29. It was Portland's fourth straight win overall, a season high, and the club's eighth in a row at home. Zach LaVine had a season-best 23 points in Chicago's fifth consecutive loss. Lauri Markkanen was not with the Bulls because he was attending to a personal issue, the team said. The rookie is averaging 15.3 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. Paul Zipser started in his place. Kris Dunn, averaging 13.7 points and 6.4 assists, missed his sixth straight game after a concussion. The Bulls decided to sit forward Nikola Mirotic while he reportedly seeks a trade. Coach Fred Hoiberg said before the game that the 6-foot-10 forward remained back at the team hotel. Meanwhile, rumors swirled that the Bulls had a deal with the Pelicans but it fell apart. Portland shot 74 percent in the first quarter paced by McCollum, who made four 3-pointers in the period and finished with six for the game. ""I don't know what the right word is, but a very impressive outing for CJ,"" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""What he did in the first quarter was amazing. It was fun to sit back and watch that."" Pat Connaughton's 3-pointer put the Blazers up 54-28. McCollum punctuated the first half with a dunk, and the Blazers went into the break with a 67-44 lead. McCollum finished the half with 32 points, one shy of Lillard's franchise record. ""I thought we had some good looks early, we didn't make them, and then you have to guard. That's kind of been the story of these slow starts, letting teams get comfortable and in a rhythm,"" Hoiberg said. ""Our game plan was to come out, try to blitz him (McCollum). He was splitting our double teams and obviously made tough shots. Give him credit for coming out of the game and setting the tone."" After he sat down in the third quarter, McCollum smiled when the crowd chanted ""We want CJ!"" ""I was thinking, I hope I don't have to go back in,"" McCollum said. ""That means we're not playing the way we should be playing. There was a lot of love tonight, and I appreciate it."" The Blazers did lose center Jusuf Nurkic in the fourth quarter to injury. Afterward, they said it was a bruised left quad. Lillard went into the game needing 25 points to reach 10,000. He'll be the seventh Blazers player to reach the mark, joining Clyde Drexler, LaMarcus Aldridge, Terry Porter, Cliff Robinson, Jerome Kersey and Jim Paxson. Portland was coming off a 104-96 victory over the Clippers at Staples Center the night before. TIP-INS Bulls: Markkanen could rejoin the team on the road trip. ... Robin Lopez was greeted by warm applause at the Moda Center. Lopez was a fan favorite during his time with the Blazers from 2013-15. ... The Bulls were coming off a 110-96 loss at home to Milwaukee on Sunday. Trail Blazers: Wore their black ""City"" uniforms for the first time. The uniforms feature a plaid pattern in a nod to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who coached the 1977 NBA championship team and had a penchant for plaid. ... McCollum's huge quarter surpassed the previous team record of 26 points set by Lillard. ELITE COMPANY McCollum joined this group of 50-point Blazers: Lillard, Damon Stoudamire, Brandon Roy, Andre Miller, Clyde Drexler and Geoff Petrie. McCollum also joined Houston star James Harden as the only players with 50 points in three quarters this season. LEAVE HIM IN? Stotts said he didn't really consider playing McCollum in the fourth with a sizable lead. ""Too risky,"" he said. ""We were up 25 and I would have left him in to get 50, but 50 is a good number.""","400975505"
"PHOENIX --  The end of the Phoenix Suns' five-game losing streak came with a sobering sidebar, a gruesome injury to backup point guard Isaiah Canaan. Rookie forward Josh Jackson matched his career best with 21 points and T.J. Warren added 20 as the Suns handed the Dallas Mavericks their fifth loss in a row, 102-88 on Wednesday night. But anyone who saw Canaan break his left ankle probably wished they hadn't. Driving to the basket in the final seconds of the first quarter, Canaan was fouled by Wesley Matthews and landed awkwardly. His left foot twisted almost 180 degrees in the wrong direction. As trainers rushed to Canaan, the crowd groaned and some of his shocked teammates covered their eyes or looked away. Phoenix guard Devin Booker pulled his jersey over his face. Team doctor Tom Carter rotated the foot and ankle back into their proper positions and said afterward that Canaan never uttered a word of pain. He was loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled off the court. ""It's hard for fans and everyone sitting right there, and teammates especially, a guy they battle with every day. It's their friend on and off the court,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said. ""I used the timeout to let us say a quick prayer and get us refocused again to keep playing."" Marquese Chriss had 15 points and 12 rebounds for the Suns, who beat Dallas for the fourth time in a row dating to last season. After missing Monday night's game in Memphis with bruised ribs, Booker was back at point guard for Phoenix. He played 32 minutes and scored 15 points. ""I think we were just playing with high energy,"" Booker said. ""A lot of our points were in transition. Josh and T.J. ran the lanes and it started at the defensive end."" Dennis Smith Jr. scored 17, Harrison Barnes 15 and Dirk Nowitzki 14 for the Mavericks, who shot just 36 percent. Booker opened the game with a 3-pointer and Phoenix never relinquished the lead. Danuel House made two 3s and Canaan and Jared Dudley one apiece in a 12-2 run that put the Suns up 35-14 with 23 seconds left in the first quarter. Phoenix led 36-17 after one. ""Bad first quarter put us in a huge hole,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. ""The rest of the game was somewhat manageable but the first quarter, down by 19 points, is just too big a hole on the road."" The Mavericks cut it to single digits twice in the second quarter and were down 57-46 at halftime. Phoenix dominated the third period, leading 81-58 after a 3 by Troy Daniels with 2:20 left. The Mavericks cut it to 91-84 on Smith's 3-pointer with 3:17 to go, but Booker responded with a three-point play to put Phoenix up 94-84. Dallas never got it to single digits again. THINKING OF ISAIAH Canaan, in his fifth NBA season, was signed Dec. 13 after being waived by Houston in October. He was scheduled to have surgery on Thursday, Triano said. ""A guy who comes in here and battles every day,"" Booker said, ""earned a spot on an NBA team after being in and out of the league. Tough break for him. Prayer out to him and his family.""

"DETROIT --  Blake Griffin was Detroit's best player in his debut with the Pistons. Griffin had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and although his new team is still very much a work in progress, the Pistons edged the Memphis Grizzlies 104-102 on Thursday night. Detroit traded for Griffin earlier in the week. The Pistons haven't had much time to work with him, but they were clearly a better team when he played against the Grizzlies. ""We were plus-23 with him on the floor in 35 minutes, so we were fairly dominant in that time,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""I don't know why we haven't gotten to all this in the hour and 15 minutes we've had together, but we've really got to get our spacing down and understand where we want people to be."" Griffin's teammates looked uncertain at times, but Detroit was able to outlast a Memphis team that is without Tyreke Evans and Mike Conley. ""I wanted to just come out and play hard, being very limited in my knowledge of our offense,"" Griffin said. ""I thought coach Van Gundy did a great job of just putting in five things that we could go to, and we ran them to death, but they worked and everybody just played hard."" Anthony Tolliver's 3-pointer with 1:49 remaining gave Detroit a 101-100 lead, and the score stayed that way until the final seconds. Marc Gasol attempted to drive on Griffin but missed his shot, and a wild scramble led to a jump ball between Tolliver and Dillon Brooks with 10.4 seconds left. The Pistons controlled that tip, with Reggie Bullock running the ball down in the corner. Tolliver gave Detroit a three-point lead with a pair of free throws, and then purposely fouled Wayne Selden with 2.6 seconds remaining. Selden made the first free throw and the second went in even though he was trying to miss and give his team a chance at an offensive rebound. Bullock made it 104-102 when he made the second of two free throws with 2 seconds left. The Grizzlies were out of timeouts, and after Gasol caught the ensuing inbound pass near midcourt, his long attempt at the buzzer wasn't close. ""We can't say that our goal is to give ourselves a chance to win, the goal has to be to win,"" Gasol said. ""We have to go out and grab these games when we have the chance."" Griffin was the first Detroit starter announced before the game and received a big hand from the crowd. The arena still didn't appear full -- the Pistons have struggled with attendance for several years -- but the atmosphere was lively, especially during the tight finish. Griffin's first points came when he powered to the basket and made a shot off the glass. He lobbed a nice alley-oop to All-Star Andre Drummond in the second quarter, although that duo didn't look totally in rhythm together. Drummond had 14 points and 15 rebounds but sat out some of the crucial possessions late. DISPARITY Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff received a technical foul early in the fourth quarter and wasn't thrilled about the difference in free throws. Memphis went 14 of 14, but Detroit was 27 of 37. ""The free throws are the bottom line -- 37-14. No one can overcome that,"" Bickerstaff said. ""Our guys compete too hard to be put in this situation every night. We've asked the league for help. Maybe someone can sit down with us and tell us what we're doing wrong."" SMALLER STAFF Van Gundy said before the game that only two of his seven assistant coaches would be on the bench with him. Tim Hardaway had a funeral to attend, and four others were sick. ""If anybody wants to sit on the bench with me tonight, we have plenty of room,"" Van Gundy said. ""That flu is no joke."" ANOTHER DEBUT Detroit received two other players in the trade with the Clippers. Brice Johnson did not play Thursday, but Willie Reed did, picking up three fouls in just 5:22. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Evans was not with the team and missed a second straight game amid trade speculation about his future. Conley has a left heel injury. ... Gasol had 19 points and 14 rebounds. ... Memphis dropped to 3-8 on the second night of back-to-backs. Pistons: Griffin was the first player with at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a debut with the Pistons since Grant Hill (25 points, 10 rebounds and five assists) in 1994.","400975507"
"WASHINGTON --  Washington's Bradley Beal says he's playing with less stress since making his first NBA All-Star Game. The way he shook off his miserable start on Thursday, he might be onto something. Beal scored 25 of his 27 points in the second half, helping the Wizards to a 122-119 victory over the Toronto Raptors. ""It lifted a little bit of a burden off my shoulders,"" said Beal, who overcame the first half of his NBA career without a made field goal. ""That's something I don't have to think about or try to prove. I can just play freely, enjoy the process, enjoy the moment."" The Wizards had eight players score in double figures in their third straight win without All-Star point guard John Wall, who had surgery on his left knee on Wednesday. Otto Porter Jr. had 16 points and 11 rebounds in his first double-double since early December, and Markieff Morris scored 15 points -- including five straight in a stretch that gave Washington the lead for good in a dogged battle against the second-place team in the Eastern Conference. ""It's basically a simulation of the playoffs,"" Morris said. ""Bodies flying everywhere and you just got to play through it. The toughest team is going to win like it did tonight."" Kyle Lowry scored 17 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter for Toronto, but missed two late free throws. All-Star DeMar DeRozan added 23 points and Serge Ibaka had 16 after a potential tying 3-pointer rimmed out late. ""I'll live with Serge's shot any day,"" DeRozan said. ""I'll live with Kyle going to the free-throw line any day. It just didn't go in."" Morris capped a 9-0 run by hitting a pair of free throws and then a baseline 3-pointer off Porter's feed to put Washington up 115-110. From there, the Wizards hit seven of their last eight foul shots to seal the game. Lowry hit a spinning runner to cut it to 118-116 with 11.6 seconds left, but couldn't convert the three-point play. Then with 3 seconds left and Toronto down 120-118, Lowry reached a loose ball off Washington's inbounds and got fouled, but missed the first of two foul shots. ""I wasn't clutch enough,"" Lowry said. ""But trust me, I will be next time."" TIP-INS Raptors: F/G C.J. Miles (sore right knee) missed his second straight game. ... G Fred VanFleet did not play due to personal reasons. ... C Jonas Valanciunas is 5 for 6 from 3-point range over his last four games. He went 2 for 2 twice in the first two games with multiple 3s in his career. Wizards: G Jodie Meeks scored each of his 10 points in the fourth quarter, posting double digits for the first time since Dec. 29. ... Tomas Satoransky started his third straight game at point guard in Wall's absence, a stretch that equaled his previous career starts total. ... Coach Scott Brooks received a technical foul moments after the halftime buzzer. SHARED LOSS Former Washington and Toronto G Rasual Butler was honored with a pregame moment of silence. Butler and his wife died in a single-automobile accident in Los Angeles on Wednesday morning. He was 38. DEMAR STAR DeRozan was named the NBA's Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January after averaging 25.3 points and 5.9 assists. GOING DEEP DeRozan's full-court inbounds pass to end the game was intercepted. But he completed a similar heave that nearly led to points at the first-quarter buzzer, and said afterward it's a skill he's always had. ""I've been a black Tom Brady for a while now,"" DeRozan deadpanned.","400975508"

Jimmy Butler scored 28 points, Karl-Anthony Towns had 24 points and 11 rebounds for his NBA-best 46th double-double, and the Timberwolves beat the Milwaukee Bucks 108-89 on Thursday night. ""That's a lot on us for being disciplined and having that resiliency as a team, and having that pride, especially here at home,"" Towns said. ""We've done a great job all year of making sure we stop the bleeding early. Now we just have to focus on making sure we don't win one, lose two, win one. That's not a good recipe."" Jeff Teague added nine points and eight assists for Minnesota, which was coming off consecutive losses at Atlanta and Toronto. The Timberwolves have lost six of their last seven road games and have returned home with back-to-back losses from their last three road trips. Each time, Minnesota has responded at home with a victory, winning by an average of 14.25 points. The Timberwolves' 21-6 home record represents the second-most home wins in the NBA behind San Antonio's 22. ""We want to make it hard to play here, hard to win here,"" Butler said. ""I think we've been doing a great job of that as of late. It's one win. We've got another one coming up on Saturday and we need that one too."" Khris Middleton scored 21 points for Milwaukee, which had won four in a row. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 17 points and 15 rebounds, but the Bucks shot 37.6 percent from the field and committed 15 turnovers. ""They just didn't let up,"" Middleton said.

HURTING BUCKS Malcolm Brogdon, who started in place of Bledsoe, left in the second quarter with a left quad tendon strain. Brogdon went down after a dunk and had to be helped off the floor. Prunty didn't have an update on Brogdon after the game. Antetokounmpo told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that he twisted his left ankle in the fourth quarter and was having trouble putting weight on it, but he didn't address the injury with a small group of reporters after the game. BELICHICK SPOTTED New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick was in attendance, taking a bit of leisure time as he prepares for Sunday's Super Bowl across town against the Philadelphia Eagles. Belichick and Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau are friends dating to Thibodeau's time as an assistant coach with the Boston Celtics. Thibodeau, who grew up in Connecticut, is a Patriots fan.

""It's really good for us, especially that we did it the right way,"" Rockets center Clint Capela said. ""This second game, we did it the right (way) by being present defensively all game long, keep them under control, it's going to be a good confidence to everybody on the team.""

The Rockets led by as many as 19 points in the first matchup between the Texas rivals since the Spurs' 124-109 blowout loss on Dec. 15 in Houston. The Spurs' only lead came in the opening minutes. They trailed by double digits for much of the night. ""It's a great step,"" Harden said. ""All night defensively we were locked in. We just got stops. We knew at some point they were going to make a run, especially in that second half. We held our composure."" San Antonio scored the first points of the fourth quarter to close to 82-76 with 10 minutes remaining. But Chris Paul responded for Houston. The veteran point guard, who is nursing a sore right groin, apologized to coach Mike D'Antoni for being too cautious and allowing the Spurs to get back into the game. ""I was like, alright, we tripping,"" Paul said. ""Let me go ahead."" Paul hit three jumpers to rebuild Houston's lead to 88-76.

"DENVER --  Gary Harris had just enough time to catch the ball and shoot -- and his aim was true. Harris made the winning 3-pointer at the buzzer and finished with 25 points to lift the Denver Nuggets to a 127-124 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday night. Nikola Jokic added his third triple-double of the season with 29 points, 13 rebounds and 14 assists, including the inbounds pass to Harris with 1.4 seconds remaining. Harris grabbed the ball and put it up for the win before running off the court, his hand held high in celebration. ""Joker threw a helluva pass and I was able to get off a good look,"" said Harris, who made the shot as Russell Westbrook ran at him with a hand in his face. ""It felt good. I knew it was going in."" Jamal Murray had 33 points to lead the Nuggets, who had lost their previous two games by a total of three points when they missed last-second shots.

""What we've been through the last couple nights -- close games, come up short -- to get that win tonight ... I'm just so happy for our players."" Paul George had a season-high 43 points to lead the Thunder. Westbrook had 21 assists, one shy of his career high, to go with 20 points and nine rebounds.

They held a 104-89 lead into the fourth quarter. The Thunder narrowed the deficit to six on a driving layup by George with 4:40 remaining. Moments later, Westbrook hit a 3-pointer to pull Oklahoma City within four at 118-114 with 1:44 remaining. Murray responded with a layup before Westbrook hit another 3-pointer to make it a three-point game. His driving layup with 28.9 seconds pulled the Thunder to within a point.

Security guards quickly moved in and hustled the fan away, but Westbrook said the perimeter of the basketball court should be better policed.

"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Kemba Walker scored 41 points on 11-for-22 shooting and the Charlotte Hornets beat the Indiana Pacers 133-126 with the help of a record-setting first quarter Friday night. Buoyed by 16 points from Nicolas Batum, the Hornets scored 49 points in the first, a franchise-best for a quarter. Charlotte connected on 7 of 11 from 3-point range and hit 19 of 23 from the field in that stretch. It marked the highest point total for an NBA team in any quarter this season. Four other Hornets players scored in double-digits, led by Batum's 31 points and Dwight Howard's 12 points and 11 rebounds. Charlotte won its second game in a row. Victor Oladipo had 35 points for the Pacers, who halted a three-game winning streak. Myles Turner added 19 points and 11 rebounds for Indiana. Charlotte led 49-37 after the first, as the Pacers came within a point of matching the most first-quarter points by a Hornets opponent this season. The Pacers outscored the Hornets 34-25 in the third quarter, led by 13 points from Oladipo, to narrow Charlotte's advantage to 96-91. Cory Joseph's free throws cut Indiana's deficit to 128-124 with 40 seconds left, but Charlotte hit five free throws after that to ice it. TIP-INS: Pacers: Indiana coach Nate McMillan missed the game for personal reasons. Longtime assistant Dan Burke served as acting head coach. ... Center Al Jefferson, who played for Charlotte 2013-16, received a loud ovation when he entered the game at the end of the second quarter.

"BOSTON --  Terry Rozier's second act as an NBA starter was just as impressive as his first. Rozier had a career-high 31 points and seven rebounds in his second career start, Jayson Tatum added a career-high 27 points and the short-handed Boston Celtics beat the Atlanta Hawks 119-110 on Friday night. Rozier started in place of the injured Kyrie Irving. The third-year guard became the second player in league history with a triple-double in his first start, totaling 17 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in Wednesday's blowout of the Knicks. ""Both (starts had) just the same feeling,"" Rozier said. ""Just wanting to come out aggressive, do what I can on the offensive and defensive end. My teammates made it so easy for me because they play so hard. We just play hard collectively as a group."" Irving missed his second straight game with a right quad contusion that he suffered in Monday's win at Denver and was one of four Boston players who sat with injuries on Friday. Rozier will soon have to yield his starting backcourt spot to Irving -- and he's fine with that. ""Kyrie's probably one of my biggest supporters, outside of my family, through this little process,"" Rozier said. ""I know he's happy for me, and when he comes back we're just going to pick it up."" Jaylen Brown scored 19 points and Al Horford had 17 with seven assists to help lead Boston to its fourth win in five tries. Taruean Prince had a career-high 31 points and eight rebounds to lead the Hawks, who have lost five of six. Dennis Schroder added 25 points and Marco Belinelli had 15. Trailing 55-53 at halftime, Boston opened a 19-point lead heading into the fourth quarter after outscoring Atlanta 41-20 in the third. ""They got off to a quick start (in the third),"" Prince said. ""We kind of lagged defensively. I can blame myself for that one. ... They were hitting a lot of good shots, too."" Rozier passed his previous career best of 23 points on a pair of free throws with 1:10 remaining in the third. He eclipsed 30 points with a 3-pointer at 6:10 of the final period. Irving is the only other Celtics player with a 30-point game this season. Schroder's jumper with 7:19 left brought the Hawks within 10 at 103-93, but Atlanta wouldn't come any closer until the final minute with the game out of reach. Atlanta led 32-26 after one quarter. ""Pretty good (first) half of basketball,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It felt like we could have had more of a cushion. Six- to eight-point lead, and it's two at the half. Just a huge third quarter for them."" BLEEDING GREEN Only 10 players suited up for Boston as Irving, F Marcus Morris (bruised left hip), Gs Shane Larkin (right knee soreness) and Marcus Smart (right hand laceration) were sidelined with injuries. ""It speaks a lot (about) the guys here,"" Horford said. PRINCE ASCENDS Prince was named as an injury replacement for Milwaukee's Malcolm Brogdon in the Rising Stars game during All-Star Weekend. Prince will join Hawks rookie forward John Collins on the U.S. team roster. ""Kind of excited, kind of relieved because I felt like I did enough work this summer to be able to be in the game from the jump, but God has his own route,"" said Prince, who is Atlanta's third-leading scorer, averaging 12.3 points per game. ""That's the reason I had a little fire to me tonight."" GREG WHO? The Celtics have not announced their reported signing of recently bought-out C Greg Monroe, but that didn't stop Morris from weighing in on the potential addition. ""I think that's a great pick-up for us,"" Morris said. ""Veteran player, knows how to play the game, been around the league for a while, so I think he'd be an add to our size down low, (our) scoring ability."" TIP-INS Hawks: Schroder played after being listed as questionable with a right shoulder strain. ... F DeAndre' Bembry (left adductor strain) missed his 20th straight game. Celtics: All five Boston starters scored in double figures for the first time Dec. 23. ... Coach Brad Stevens said Irving is feeling ""a little bit better"" and is considered day-to-day. ...

"NEW YORK --  Brook Lopez smiled through a tribute video that showed his highlights stretching back to when he played in New Jersey in red, white and blue uniforms. Then he went out and added a few more -- this time at the Nets' expense. Lopez scored 19 points in his return to Brooklyn, making the Lakers' final basket with 1:28 left to help Los Angeles hold on for a 102-99 victory on Friday night. The Nets' career leader in scoring and blocked shots also had a big block down the stretch as the Lakers did just enough to avoid a third straight loss. ""Brook was great tonight,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""He did a good job. We don't win that game without him obviously."" Julius Randle had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and Brandon Ingram added 16 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds for the Lakers. Josh Hart finished with 15 points and 14 rebounds, helping Los Angeles to a 56-38 advantage on the boards. Spencer Dinwiddie had 23 points, nine assists and seven rebounds for the Nets. Rookie Jarrett Allen, playing the center spot Lopez occupied for nine seasons in New Jersey and later Brooklyn before getting dealt to Los Angeles in the trade that brought D'Angelo Russell to Brooklyn, had a season-best 20 points. ""He was the face of the franchise here and now I am here trying to become the face, too,"" Allen said of facing Lopez. ""Just going back and forth. I mean, it's a good challenge."" Lopez came out on the winning end of it, blocking Allen's shot with 1:41 left to preserve a two-point lead, then scoring on a short running hook. The No. 10 pick in the 2008 draft by the Nets, Lopez has had to navigate a new role in Los Angeles, where the Lakers like to play small and fast. But they needed his big presence in a low-scoring fourth quarter. ""It's just been different all season but I just try to stay ready,"" Lopez said. Allen was 6 for 6 for 16 points in the first half, but Lopez answered with 12 points in the third quarter, going 5 for 5 from the field with a pair of 3-pointers to send the teams to the fourth tied at 85. The Lakers shut the Nets out for more than five minutes while scoring 11 straight to open a 96-87 lead. TIP-INS Lakers: The Nets played a video tribute for Lopez between the first and second quarters that included him dunking over his twin brother, Robin. ""I definitely caught that,"" Lopez said. ""They could have like three or four more of those obviously, it happened so often."" ... Kyle Kuzma was drafted with the No. 27 pick, which the Lakers acquired from the Nets in the Lopez-Russell trade. ... The Lakers attended the musical ""Hamilton"" on Broadway on Thursday night. Nets: James Webb III made a 3-pointer in the first half for his first NBA points. The Nets said he was the first Boise State alum to score in the NBA since Coby Karl in 2007-08. ... Russell finished with 15 points off the bench. DUNKING LIKE DAD With Larry Nance Jr. chosen Thursday for the Slam Dunk Contest during All-Star weekend, he'll have a chance to follow in his father's footsteps -- or flight path. Larry Nance was an NBA high flyer who won the inaugural event in 1984 in Phoenix. ""His dad was obviously one of the all-time best and now he's got a chance to go and show what he can do,"" Walton said. Walton also followed his father, Hall of Famer Bill Walton, to the NBA. ""Larry's obviously living his own career, he's doing his own thing, but there's something special when you get to do what your father did,"" Walton added. LIN'S INJURY Jeremy Lin has been rehabbing in Vancouver after rupturing his right patellar tendon in the Nets' season opener. He declined to offer much specific about his treatment, but is working to not only heal the knee but also build up other parts of his body so he can come back quicker and stronger. ""To have a year off is really, how can I best maximize this time and also to put myself in a position where I'm not in this position again,"" Lin said. ""I mean this is sports so nothing's guaranteed, but just addressing a lot of muscle and balances, movement, deficiencies, all these different things.""","400975514"
"TORONTO --  DeMar DeRozan's big night from beyond the arc spoiled Damian Lillard's milestone moment. DeRozan scored 35 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 18 and the Toronto Raptors beat Portland 130-105 on Friday night, their sixth straight win over the Trail Blazers. Fred VanVleet scored 16 points, Kyle Lowry had 15 and Pascal Siakam 13 as the Raptors improved their home record to 20-4, best in the NBA. DeRozan made 11 of 22 shots and matched his career-high by making six 3-pointers. He finished 6 for 10 from long range. ""We didn't really force much and we got shots that we wanted,"" DeRozan said. Lillard scored 32 points, becoming the fastest player in franchise history to reach 10,000 for his career, but Portland's four-game winning streak was snapped. The Blazers have lost five of their past seven on the road. ""It's something I'm really happy about,"" Lillard said of 10,000 points. ""Now I've just got to keep on moving up."" The Raptors made a season high 19 3-pointers. Toronto shot 19 for 40 from behind the arc, with nine players making at least one 3-pointer. ""The 3-point line was a huge factor tonight,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. CJ McCollum scored 21 points and Jusuf Nurkic had 20, but no other Portland player had more than five through the first three quarters. After winning an NBA-high 11 games in January, the Blazers opened their February schedule on a losing note. ""I thought the Raptors played very well and we didn't have many answers for them,"" Stotts said. Lillard came in 12 points away from 10,000. He reached the milestone on a driving layup with 45 seconds left in the first quarter, then passed it with a 3 at 9:06 of the second. DeRozan scored 16 points and Valanciunas had 11 as the Raptors led 37-18 after one. Lillard was the only Portland player to deliver offensively in the opening quarter, scoring 12 points and making 4 of 5 shots. The rest of the Blazers combined to shoot 2 for 13. ""We dug ourselves a hole early,"" Lillard said. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard scored Portland's first nine points. ... McCollum, who scored 28 points in the first quarter of his 50-point performance Wednesday, did not score in the opening quarter against Toronto, missing all three of his shots. ... Lillard led the Blazers with 10 assists. ... Portland has scored 100 or more points in 17 straight games. Raptors: F C.J. Miles (right knee) missed his third straight game. ... DeRozan's 26-points first half matched his highest-scoring half of the season. ... Toronto outscored Portland 26-7 in second-chance points. ... The Raptors have scored 120 or more points 16 times this season, second only to Golden State (23). GOOD COMPANY Lillard is the eighth player to get 10,000 points and 2,500 assists in his first six seasons. The others are Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Larry Bird, Nate Archibald, Pete Maravich, Dave Bing and Oscar Robertson. ""It's a quite a list,"" Stotts said. ""All Hall of Famers except for LeBron, and I think he has a chance to get in, too."" SHARP SHOOTING Lillard said DeRozan's newfound ability from long range makes him even more difficult to defend. ""He was already a handful with his size and athleticism and how crafty he is,"" Lillard said. ""Now you're chasing him over the top of screens and he's pulling up from 3 off the dribble, raising up and shooting it like that's always been his shot."" PACKED SIX Lillard is one of four active players to reach 10,000 points in his first six seasons. The others are Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, and James.","400975515"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Joel Embiid is set to crash Philly's Super Bowl bash. Embiid and a couple of Sixers teammates are headed to Minnesota to root for the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl. ""I've heard that's the biggest event in American sports,"" said Embiid, a native of Cameroon. Oh yes, Embiid heard correct. Here's another piece of intel that may be harder to believe: Embiid's weekend pregame show starts with a double dip of NBA action. Embiid opened the first set of back-to-back games in his career with 17 points and 11 rebounds to help lead the 76ers to a 103-97 win over the Miami Heat on Friday night. All the dunks, blocks and 3-pointers at times seemed like background music at what turned into Philly's largest Super Bowl tailgate party. The Sixers cloaked the Wells Fargo Center in green -- from the giveaway ""Brotherly Love"" T-shirts imprinted with the Sixers and Eagles logos to the balloons, signage, and even the table runners on press row. The packed house erupted in unison to belt out the ""Fly, Eagles, Fly"" fight song that's as ubiquitous at Philly sporting events as ""Rocky"" movie clips. They broke out enough ""E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles!"" chants to make the arena sound like the Linc right before kickoff. The day kicked off at the same arena with Wing Bowl, Philly's own competitive eating competition. Molly Schuyler gnawed her way through a record 501 chicken wings in 30 minutes to win her third Wing Bowl. And they say Philly doesn't crown champions. The city could get another taste should the Eagles win their first Super Bowl. ""I want to feel that experience,"" Embiid said. ""I want to mix it up. Go in the suite. Then sit in the stands. I want to feel like a regular person to do that."" The Heat nearly harshed Philly's mellow when they turned a 28-point hole into a four-point game on Wayne Ellington's 3-pointer with 25 seconds left. But the biggest win for the Sixers may be this: Embiid is set to play games on consecutive nights for the first time since he was picked No. 3 overall in the 2014 draft. ""I feel like I've been ready,"" Embiid said. ""Now, I'm going to feel like an NBA player. Taking days off in the NBA is not that easy."" Embiid, selected to his first All-Star team, missed his first two seasons with injuries and the Sixers have been leery of pushing their 7-foot-2 center into major minutes over the last two seasons. Embiid should be in the starting lineup Saturday at Indiana. ""We're in a rhythm now. It's tough when he comes out and we've got to back into another rhythm,"" Sixers rookie Ben Simmons said. The Sixers are eighth in the Eastern Conference playoff standings and clearly need a healthy Embiid down the stretch to crack the postseason for the first time since 2012. Coach Brett Brown said Embiid will play in back-to-backs because he's been cleared to go -- not to avoid the lousy optics in two weeks of playing in the Rising Stars Challenge, the Skills Challenge and the All-Star game all packed into 48 hours. ""Joel's availability has got nothing to do with desperation or crunch time. It's all about his health,"" Brown said. Fueled by the Super Bowl frenzy, Philadelphia hit 'em low (30 points in the paint), hit 'em high (three 3s) and watched that scoreboard fly all the way to a 51-41 lead at halftime. Dario Saric made his first five buckets, growled like a dog (Eagles fans have worn dog masks in the playoffs) and had 17 points and 10 rebounds. TIP-INS Heat: The Heat outscored the 76ers 37-17 in the fourth quarter. Kelly Olynyk scored 19 points. ""We should have no regrets in this game. We laid it out there,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. 76ers: Brown gave the Sixers permission to attend the Super Bowl. ""We're in Indiana. It's not like it's a ridiculous journey,"" Brown said. Brown said the Sixers will not have Monday off from practice. ... Brown said as of yet no one from the Sixers has talked to anyone involved with All-Star weekend about limiting Embiid's minutes. SIMMONS SNUB Simmons, the star guard who felt snubbed from the All-Star game, scored 20 points. ""I mean, if I was an All-Star, I'd be on the All-Star team,"" Simmons said. ""It's a little frustrating but if you look back at how many rookies have made it, it's not one of those things that makes or breaks your career."" FEELING SICK Heat C Hassan Whiteside left the game in the fourth quarter with an undisclosed illness.","400975516"
"MILWAUKEE --  Jabari Parker waited nearly a year to get back on the court with the Milwaukee Bucks. He made an immediate impact with 12 points, including seven in the first quarter, and Giannis Antetokounmpo took it from there. Antetokounmpo made a driving layup with 1.9 seconds remaining to lift the Bucks over the New York Knicks 92-90 on Friday night in Parker's return. ""I was just trying to stay composed, not trying to get carried away,"" said Parker, who entered the game to a boisterous ovation. ""I was pretty much distracted because I heard the crowd, but had to calm down. Still got to show the people why I've been working so hard."" The Bucks got their fifth win in six games. Antetokounmpo, who sprained his left ankle late in Thursday night's loss to Minnesota, showed no ill effects and led all scorers with 29 points. He hit the winner by spinning around a defender in the lane and going up with his left hand over Enes Kanter and Kristaps Porzingis. He jogged back down the court with his tongue hanging from his mouth while the home crowd roared. ""I was able to find the lane,"" Antetokounmpo said. Parker hadn't played since tearing his left ACL on Feb. 8, 2017, in a game against Miami. He made 4 of 7 shots over nearly 15 minutes as a reserve. Kanter had 17 points and 18 rebounds to lead the Knicks, who were coming off a 103-73 loss to Boston on Wednesday night. Porzingis also had 17 points. Entering the fourth quarter tied at 74, the Bucks and Knicks continued their seesaw battle with neither team able to pull away. A layup by Antetokounmpo tied it at 90 with about two minutes remaining. After Tim Hardaway Jr. missed a pair of free throws for New York, Antetokounmpo failed to connect on a step-back jumper with 41.8 seconds left. After Kanter missed a layup, Antetokounmpo hit his decisive layup. Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said he thought his team made a strong effort against Antetokounmpo on the play. ""Enes made him spin and (Porzingis) came from the weak side. I thought he was going block it,"" Hornacek said. ""He's just so long he was able to get it off."" After a Knicks timeout, Hardaway Jr. -- who made just 1 of 14 shots -- missed a deep, off-balance jumper at the horn. The teams were tied at 55 at the half. Milwaukee got 13 points from Antetokounmpo and 12 from Parker, who played nearly 10 minutes in the first half. Kanter had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Milwaukee got a much-needed spark from Parker in the first quarter. He scored seven points in just more than five minutes of action to help pull the Bucks within one point at the end of the quarter. PLENTY OF PARKER Parker's return comes at a critical juncture of the season, with the trade deadline looming next week and Milwaukee in the middle of the Eastern Conference playoff race. He entered the game with 5:25 remaining in the first quarter, replacing Antetokounmpo. He scored his first basket on a jumper from the right baseline a little more than one minute later. The second overall pick of the 2014 draft out of Duke averaged career highs of 20.1 points and 6.2 rebounds in 51 games last year before the injury. ""The only way to go here is up,"" Parker said. ""Can't be lower than at any point than I've been in any stages of these few months."" Parker tore the same ACL in December 2014, halting his rookie campaign after 25 games. IN PAIN Kanter, who suffered a lacerated lip in practice Monday that required several stitches, said doctors told him the wound could re-open with any contact to his mouth. ""Right now, I don't really care about the stitches. My thing is to just sacrifice everything I have,"" he said. TIP-INS Knicks: Referees halted the game briefly in the first quarter so that Porzingis could be treated for a cut to his lip. ... New York made 2 of 13 from deep in the first half. Porzingis and Hardaway Jr. were a combined 1 for 8. Hardaway Jr. finished the game 0 for 9 from long range. Bucks: G Malcolm Brogdon is expected to miss six to eight weeks after being diagnosed with a partially torn left quadriceps tendon. ... G Eric Bledsoe, who missed Thursday's game and played just three minutes Monday due to left ankle soreness, returned to action.","400975517"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Anthony Davis set the New Orleans Pelicans' career scoring record in style. The versatile 6-foot-10 big man scored 43 points to help the Pelicans beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 114-100 on Friday night. At 24 years old, he passed David West on the franchise's scoring list and has 8,702 career points. ""It's huge,"" Davis said. ""Big time for me, but it's a team effort. Guys put me in the position to score and be successful. Everybody from guys in my rookie year to guys now. Everybody played their part and allowed me to get this accomplishment."" Davis earned his points against Oklahoma City's Steven Adams, one of the league's most rugged interior defenders. He scored 16 points in the fourth quarter to help the Pelicans pull away. ""I thought he played great,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""I don't like the fact that he has to battle a guy like Steven Adams and play those 37 minutes. Those 37 minutes become like 50 when you have a guy like that defending you."" Davis passed West to become the franchise's rebounding leader on Jan. 28, and he added 10 more boards to his total on Friday. E'Twaun Moore added 26 points for the Pelicans. New Orleans had lost two straight since All-Star DeMarcus Cousins was lost for the season with a left Achilles tendon rupture. They righted the ship by shooting 51 percent from the field against the Thunder. ""Everybody just competed,"" Davis said. ""We stayed poised. We just kept at them and kept fighting. Guys made plays. It was a team effort."" Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook had 16 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds for his 16th triple-double of the season. Adams had 23 points and 12 rebounds for the Thunder, who lost their third straight after an eight-game winning streak. Oklahoma City's stars couldn't find their shooting rhythm. Westbrook shot 7 for 21, Paul George 4 for 16 and Carmelo Anthony 6 for 17. The Thunder played in Denver the night before and lacked energy late in the game. ""It was a hard turnaround, I'm not going to dispute that,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""But I think every NBA team has to deal with it."" Westbrook approached a triple-double in the first half with nine points, nine assists and seven rebounds to help the Thunder take a 58-54 lead at the break. The Pelicans seized momentum early in the third quarter. New Orleans led 97-89 in the fourth when Westbrook checked back in after a rest. Westbrook made a 3-pointer with just under two minutes remaining to cut New Orleans' lead to seven, but Davis hit a 3-pointer at the other end, then made another shortly after that to put the game out of reach. TIP-INS Pelicans: Gentry was called for a technical foul in the second quarter. ... Gentry said during his pregame media session that Cousins had been putting up MVP-type numbers. Cousins averaged 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game before his injury. Thunder: Adams scored 13 points on 6-for-9 shooting in the first half. ... Adams reached 3,000 career points. He joined Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka as the only Thunder players with at least 3,000 career points and 350 career blocks. ... G Raymond Felton was called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter. ... G Terrance Ferguson was ill and played just 11 minutes. STAT LINES Westbrook nearly added another double-figure statistic to his line -- he had nine turnovers. The Thunder had 16 turnovers as a team. QUOTABLE Gentry, on Davis setting the record: ""I don't think that is much of a surprise to anyone. It was just a matter of time."" MISSING ANDRE The Thunder have struggled to stop opponents since Andre Roberson, a second-team All-Defense selection last season, suffered a season-ending left patellar tendon injury. They won their first game without him against Philadelphia but followed that with three rough outings. Oklahoma City lost to Washington, which was playing without All-Star John Wall, then gave up 127 points in a loss to Denver before losing to the Pelicans.","400975518"
"PHOENIX --  A dozen teams passed on Donovan Mitchell in last year's draft before Denver finally picked him and promptly traded him to Utah. The Jazz must be so grateful the way it all turned out. The former Louisville star scored 40 points, one shy of his career high, and the Jazz won their fourth in a row with a 129-97 rout of the Phoenix Suns on Friday night. ""I didn't know I had 40 to be honest with you,"" Mitchell said. ""I didn't know until Joe (Ingles) told me. I think the biggest thing was we were clicking. Everybody was clicking, that was the best part of it."" The blowout followed a 30-point win over Golden State in Salt Lake City on Tuesday night, only the third time in Jazz history that the team has had consecutive 30-point wins. Mitchell made 14 of 19 shots and a career-best seven 3s in nine attempts. It was the sixth game of at least 30 points in his young NBA career. ""He's just making progress,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""We've been saying that for a while, he learns quickly. If there's nights when it's not a good, not as fluid, there's usually some reason why, people guarding him different ways. But he adapts very quickly. I thought his reads were really good."" Ricky Rubio had 14 points, nine assists and six rebounds for the Jazz. Ingles added 16 points, including 4-of-6 3s, and Derrick Favors had 12 points and 10 rebounds. Josh Jackson led the Suns with 20 points. Devin Booker, still bothered by bruised ribs, scored 18 points for Phoenix but on 7-of-24 shooting. He missed all seven of his 3s. Dragan Bender added 16 points and nine rebounds. The Jazz, who hadn't played since beating Golden State, opened a four-game trip in dominant fashion. The Suns' only lead was 2-0. Utah scored 14 straight points to go up 24-8 before Bender came off the bench for eight first-quarter points and Phoenix finished the first quarter with a 12-2 run to cut the lead to 28-23. The Suns never got any closer. Mitchell sank a 3-pointer, was fouled by Booker, and made the free throw for a four-point play, igniting a 12-0 run that put Utah up 53-33 on Rubio's 3. The Jazz led 62-40 at the half. They were up by 36 during the third quarter and 41 in the fourth. It was the most one-sided loss for Phoenix since Jay Triano took over as interim coach three games into the season. He lamented the inconsistency of his team, which was coming off a home win over Dallas. ""It's probably the sign of a young basketball team, but it's disappointing to me,"" Triano said. ""I'd like to think we make steps and we start moving in the right direction and then we take a step back."" MIGHTY MITCHELL Mitchell is the seventh active player to score 40 as a rookie, and now he's done it twice. He scored 41 in a win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Dec. 1. The other six are LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Eric Gordon, Steph Curry and Blake Griffin. Mitchell said this was better than his 41-point game because the team played better. ""My biggest thing is I was just relaxed and settled down,"" he said. ""When I come into games relaxed and kind of calm, that's when I start to figure out things."" TIP-IN Jazz: Mitchell will participate in the Rising Stars Challenge and the Skills Challenge on All-Star weekend. ... Rubio has five career triple-doubles, none with Utah. ... Utah's largest margin of victory this season was 47 points against Washington on Dec. 4. Suns: Booker was 2 for 2 at the foul line to break the franchise record for consecutive free throws made in a season at 58. Kevin Johnson (1989-90) and Mike Bratz (1980) shared the previous record of 57. ... T.J. Warren matched his season low with four points. ... Suns signed guard Josh Gray to a 10-day contract. Gray had been with the Northern Arizona Suns of the G-League. He scored seven points, all in the fourth quarter, in his NBA debut. ... Center Alex Len (right ankle soreness) did not play for the second straight game and has missed five of the last six.","400975519"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Stephen Curry said it's understandable that the Golden State Warriors are easing up a bit as the All-Star break approaches. The two-time NBA MVP also realizes it's critical that the defending champs push through the tough times. Kevin Durant scored 13 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter and matched his season-high with six 3-pointers, and the Warriors held on to beat the Sacramento Kings 119-104 on Friday night. ""You can see the light at the end of the tunnel for a little refresher but at the end of day we've got work to do to get to that break so we have to find a way,"" Curry said. ""If we don't build the right habits and have the right spirit around our team going into the break, that could carry over and you don't want to have that kind of negative energy around the team."" Three nights after getting blown out in Utah while suffering their worst loss of the season, the Warriors looked a little sluggish early before pulling away to even the season series with Sacramento and give coach Steve Kerr his 248th career victory. Golden State also improved to 11-0 in games following losses while spoiling Sacramento coach Dave Joeger's return to the bench. ""When we lose our guys get a little angry and then their talent takes over,"" Kerr said. ""Nothing magical about it."" It wasn't easy keeping that streak going. Sacramento trailed by 14 before pulling to 89-88 with 7:55 remaining following three consecutive baskets by Buddy Hield. Omri Casspi stopped the slide for the Warriors with a driving layup, Draymond Green added a three-point play and Nick Young made a 3-pointer. Durant then scored the next 10 points for Golden State, including back-to-back 3s. The Warriors committed 25 turnovers but the Kings rarely took advantage and finished with 19 points off the miscues. ""It's a lot of stuff that we can correct,"" Durant said. ""Stick to our fundamentals and we'll cut those turnovers down. But for the most part I like where our defense was."" Curry added 23 points and six assists, Klay Thompson scored 20 points and Green had 13 points, nine rebounds and six assists for Golden State. Both teams were playing the front end of back-to-back games. Durant, who missed an easy uncontested layup on a drive from the baseline, fueled the win despite sitting out much of the first half following Golden State's slow start. He scored 15 points in the second quarter on 6-for-7 shooting, had a key three-point play early in the fourth and then helped the Warriors close out the win late. Zach Randolph had 18 points and seven rebounds, Justin Jackson scored 17 and De'Aaron Fox added 16 point and six assists for Sacramento. Joerger, who was called for a technical in the fourth quarter, returned after briefly dropping to his knees during Sunday's game in San Antonio. Joerger missed the remainder of that game and did not coach in New Orleans on Thursday. ""It was a good game,"" Joerger said. ""I was propping up my beverage over there to keep me hydrated."" DEEP AND DEEPER The Warriors won another lopsided game despite being without Shaun Livingston (personal reasons), Jordan Bell (left ankle), Andre Igoudala (rest) and David West (rest). ""That's just the beauty of having a deep team,"" Durant said. ""We could give guys like (Kevon) Looney and Omri (Caspi) and Patty (McCaw) those minutes. It's an opportunity for the young guys to step up. It's only going to make us better as a group."" TIP-INS Warriors: It wasn't the crispest of games but it was a much better effort than Golden State had in their 129-99 loss to Utah. Most encouraging for Kerr's team was that they rallied after falling behind by double digits early in the first, with the comeback coming while four of the starters were on the bench. That depth continues to be the Warriors best weapon. Kings: Sacramento had a chance to take control early in the game but couldn't sustain the early momentum. The defense, which helped start the comeback in the fourth, fell apart late and allowed the Warriors to shoot 55 percent for the game.","400975520"
"LOS ANGELES -- There had been only one real practice, one small attempt at learning a couple plays with new teammates. But when the game began Saturday, the new and the old melded like they'd been at it for some time, newcomer Tobias Harris blending with holdover Danilo Gallinari to lead the Clippers to a 113-103 victory over the struggling Chicago Bulls. Harris and Gallinari each scored 24 points in their first game together, and the Clippers stayed with a simple motion offense that led to a season-high 33 fast-break points. ""Tobias and Danilo were phenomenal tonight,"" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. ""I'm just trying to figure out what we have with those two. ""We literally stayed with an open floor, motion offense and it was far better than anything we tried to run."" Harris, Avery Bradley and Boban Marjanovic came to the Clippers on Monday in the trade that sent Blake Griffin to Detroit. Griffin also scored 24 in his debut for the Pistons. It was the sixth consecutive loss for the Bulls, who also made a trade on Tuesday. Their three new players, however, had yet to take their physicals and did not play Saturday. The Bulls also played without starters Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen. Zach LaVine had 21 points and nine rebounds and led six Bulls players scoring in double figures. ""Call it what it is, but we've got to go out there and fight,"" LaVine said. ""We've got to do better, all of us. We're going to get those guys back, we're going to be a full team."" The Clippers led the entire game but were never able to put away the Bulls, who started the game by missing their first seven field goals and finished shooting 36 percent. Harris was 10 for 19 from the field, beginning his Clippers career by hitting a 3-pointer for the first points of the game. He played 34 minutes in his debut. ""It felt great,"" Harris said. ""I'm obviously happy and was excited just to get out there with my new teammates."" TIP-INS Bulls: Coach Fred Hoiberg said newly acquired Omer Asik, Jameer Nelson and Tony Allen did not suit up because they had yet to take their physicals. ... Sent an assistant trainer to Chicago to check on the progress of G Dunn (concussion). Said Hoiberg: ""He's still on the concussion protocol. As he continues to feel better, hopefully he can cross off the steps to get out of it. Then he'll need a couple of practices before he's cleared."" ... Markkanen remained home for the birth of his first child but Hoiberg said he may rejoin the team for their next game in Sacramento. Clippers: Doc Rivers said G Austin Rivers (right ankle) should return when the team starts to play seven consecutive road games on Feb. 9. He's missed 17 games with what was originally called a strained Achilles tendon. SCORING FRONTLINE Since their new players only knew a couple of basic sets, the Clippers went to a slashing, running style of play that proved effective. ""We played with a new team today,"" Gallinari said. ""The style is going to be what you saw today. We just have to keep it up and keep improving. It can get better. ""I think that's the way everyone would like to play. That way everyone is happy and on the same page. By playing like that you make every single player happy."" Bradley also started, finishing with eight points, five rebounds and five assists.","400975521"
"DETROIT --  Blake Griffin's first few days with the Detroit Pistons were a bit of a whirlwind. Detroit was able to win two close games with him, but coach Stan Van Gundy sees a lot of room for improvement. ""I've got to get it figured out offensively,"" Van Gundy said. ""I'm not helping him or us a lot. You could actually see today in the early fourth quarter, we were actually a lot smoother when he was out because we were just playing. ""I've got this great player now, and so we're just sort of playing to him all the time, and the defense is all loaded up."" Andre Drummond had 23 points and 20 rebounds, and Griffin made a key 3-pointer in the final minute to lift the Pistons to a 111-107 victory over the Miami Heat on Saturday night. Whatever Van Gundy's issues were with the offense, they didn't prevent Detroit from scoring 35 points in the final quarter. Ish Smith added 25 points for the Pistons, including a late 3-pointer of his own. Detroit has won three in a row, the last two with Griffin in the lineup after acquiring him in a trade . Griffin's 3-pointer with 44 seconds to play put the Pistons ahead 108-101, but Goran Dragic responded with a four-point play, making a 3-pointer while being fouled with 32 seconds left. Detroit ran the clock down on the next possession, and Smith sank his only 3-point attempt of the game, from the right corner with 14 seconds to play. ""We played that the way we wanted, but Griffin made the pass and Smith stepped up and hit the 3,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""It doesn't matter if he's not known as a 3-point shooter, he made that one when they really needed it."" Dragic scored 33 points for the Heat, who have lost three in a row. Miami was without center Hassan Whiteside, who was out with an illness. Smith, who has struggled at times while trying to replace injured point guard Reggie Jackson, went 11 of 14 from the field and finished three points shy of his career high. His previous season high was 19 points. Griffin had 16 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. ""Just a little more tired today -- the adrenaline wore off a little bit, just the toll of the week,"" Griffin said. ""It's amazing to see all these guys step up and play so well."" TIP-INS Heat: Olynyk and Josh Richardson scored 19 points for the Heat, and James Johnson added 18. Pistons: Langston Galloway scored 13 points, surpassing 2,000 for his career. ... Detroit was without G Luke Kennard (foot) and G Dwight Buycks (illness). BIG NIGHT Drummond had at least 20 points and 20 rebounds for the sixth time this season. He has 19 20-20 games since 2012-13. He also had four steals, four blocks and six turnovers. He was the first player with at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, four steals and four blocks since Hakeem Olajuwon on Dec. 22, 1989. IMPORTANT EDGE Drummond and Griffin had nearly as many rebounds as the entire Miami team, and the Pistons finished with a 49-33 advantage in that category. ""They are really tough, because they've got two of the best rebounders in the league, especially Drummond,"" Olynyk said. ""You have to stop him, and then you've got to stop Griffin, who has all that strength and that vertical leap. You have to find a way, but it isn't easy.""","400975522"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Of the Indiana Pacers' many strengths, playing with a bad memory might be their strongest. One night after allowing a franchise-record 49 points in the first quarter in a loss to the Hornets, Indiana played like a team coming off of a win. Victor Oladipo and Bojan Bogdanovic each scored 19 points and the Pacers relied on a strong second half to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 100-92 on Saturday night. ""I think we just did a good job in the second half of containing their shooters and making sure they didn't get downhill,"" Oladipo said. Oladipo added nine rebounds and four assists. Domantas Sabonis scored 10 points. The Pacers jumped out to a 40-27 in the second quarter but the 76ers pushed back, outscoring Indiana 24-10 over a seven-minute span for a 51-50 lead. The Pacers managed to put together a 12-6 scoring run to end the second quarter and take a 62-57 lead into the locker rooms. Indiana led 76-75 at the start of the fourth quarter, extended its advantage with an 7-2 run and held on with both teams were playing on the second night of a back-to-back. Joel Embiid played on both nights of the back-to-back for the first time in his career and finished with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Ben Simmons scored 10 points and added 11 rebounds for Philadelphia. Lance Stephenson had a lot to do with the Pacers' surge in the fourth quarter. Stephenson finished with 14 points and nine rebounds off the bench. ""When Lance plays like that and is effective like that, it takes a lot of pressure off of everybody. He did a great job on both ends (of the floor), especially on the defensive end and slowing them down a little bit,"" Oladipo said. The 76ers made six straight 3-point attempts in the second quarter but made just one of their 14 shots from beyond the arc during the second half. After the 76ers did not commit a turnover in the first quarter, they finished with 18 total turnovers, including seven in the fourth quarter alone. ""It has been an up-and-down season for us. We're just trying to find balance and be consistent,"" Embiid said. ""We're still learning a lot, but being young should never be an excuse, so (we've) got to keep on working."" TIP-INS 76ers: Four of Philadelphia's five starters scored in double figures. Philadelphia's entire starting unit has scored in double figures 17 times this season. . Simmons has scored at least 10 points in 40 of the 76ers' 49 games this season. . The 76ers have now lost four straight road games. Pacers: Nate McMillan returned to the Pacers bench after missing Friday's game in Charlotte due to personal reasons. . Indiana has now won six straight at home. TOUGH NIGHT After recording a double-double in a win against Memphis on Wednesday (15 points, 11 rebounds) and a double-double in a loss to Charlotte on Friday (19 points, 11 rebounds), Myles Turner found himself in foul trouble early against Philadelphia and missed much of the first half. Turner finished the game with no points, three rebounds and two assists. DOUBLE TROUBLE Embiid recorded his fifth consecutive double-double. Despite the organization's concerns regarding Embiid and back-to-back contests, Philadelphia's All-Star center was glad to be on the floor for both games. ""I'm happy that I finally got to play in a back-to-back, but I wish we'd gotten the win. Overall, though, I felt great. I wasn't tired, my legs were fine, my body was fine,"" Embiid said.","400975523"
"ORLANDO, Fla. -- If the Washington Wizards are missing All-Star point guard John Wall, they certainly aren't showing it. Washington won its fourth straight game while Wall is sidelined because of a knee injury, pounding the Orlando Magic 115-98 on Saturday night. Tomas Satoransky, who replaced Wall in the starting lineup, had a career-high 19 points, six assists and wasn't needed in the fourth quarter after helping the Wizards blow open the game in the third. Otto Porter Jr. led Washington with 20 points. Bradley Beal, who also sat out the final period, had 18 points, eight assists and eight rebounds. Marcin Gortat contributed 10 points and 11 rebounds, and Markieff Morris had 16 points as all five starters hit double figures. ""With John being out, it's even more of a challenge for us, but we accept it head on,"" Beal said. ""We weren't playing our style of basketball early in the season and over the course of the last four games, we've figured it out. We're moving the ball and playing really well."" Washington had 35 assists in the game, while shooting 54.1 percent from the field. The Wizards used a 10-0 run the final four minutes of the first half and an 18-5 run in the middle of the third quarter to open a 23-point lead. Many of Washington's baskets were layups after thread-the-needle passes in traffic or wide open 3-pointers when Orlando's defense collapsed inside. ""Maybe teams are underestimating us,"" Gortat said. ""Maybe they think because we don't have John, we're going to come in and lay down, but we're not. We're fighting. We have smart guys, who are playing hard for each other and it's working."" Orlando was coming off one of its best performances of the season, a 127-105 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers. The Magic haven't won two straight since Nov. 10 and didn't look all that interested in changing that against the Wizards. After Washington's third-quarter burst put Orlando in a 23-point hole, the Magic couldn't get the lead under 17 the rest of the game. Jonathon Simmons and Mario Hezonja led Orlando with 15 points apiece. The Magic had seven players in double figures, including 14 from Elfrid Payton, but never seriously challenged the Wizards in the second half. ""We just got our butts kicked for four quarters,"" Magic coach Frank Vogel said. ""We had a poor defensive effort throughout. First unit, second unit, we just didn't have the necessary energy to compete and get a win."" TIP INS Wizards: The Wizards are 14-5 when Beal has five or more assists. ... Washington is shooting 89.3 percent (92 of 103) from the free throw line in the last five games. ... The Wizards closed out the first half with a 10-0 run that gave them a 56-47 lead. Magic: PF Aaron Gordon, team's leading scorer, thought he would return from a strained hip flexor, but couldn't make it through Friday's practice and missed his third straight game. . Marreese Speights replaced Gordon in the starting lineup and had 10 points and two rebounds. . Hezonja is 10 of 14 (71.4 percent) on 3-pointers in his last three games.","400975524"
"CLEVELAND --  Ashamed to show his face any longer, LeBron James stared at the floor as he headed toward the locker room before the final horn sounded. An inglorious exit. The Cavaliers have become an embarrassment. ""I'm lost for words,"" James said after Cleveland was humiliated by the Houston Rockets, who rained down 19 3-pointers on the disconnected Cavaliers in a 120-88 blowout on Saturday night. Chris Paul scored 22 points with 11 assists, Ryan Anderson added 21 points and the long-range Rockets became the latest team to manhandle the Cavaliers on national TV. ""They should take us off every nationally televised game for the rest of the season,"" said James, who spoke softly with a baseball cap pulled over his eyes. ""We haven't played good at all and we get our butts kicked every time we play on national television, so I'm at a loss for words."" James Harden only scored 16 -- 15 below his league-leading average -- but Houston rolled to its fourth straight win and improved to 11-2 since Jan. 8. Meanwhile, the Cavs' downward spiral accelerated. Since losing at Golden State on Christmas, James and his teammates are 0-8 in network broadcasts and have been embarrassed in several matchups against quality teams. They lost by 28 at Minnesota, 34 in Toronto, 24 at home to Oklahoma City and 32 to the Rockets, who toyed with the defending Eastern Conference champs. Following the game, Cavs coach Tyronn Lue was asked if his team tried. ""Don't look like it,"" Lue said. ""We didn't have no fight. I thought they took the game to us on both ends."" James finished with just 11 points and didn't play in the fourth quarter as the Rockets were too far ahead. Isaiah Thomas scored 12 for Cleveland. Somber wouldn't even describe the mood in the Cavaliers' locker room, where players dressed quietly without any conversation. ""Another embarrassing loss,"" Thomas said. ""Something gotta change. I don't know. It was bad from the jump. I don't want to comment too much on it. I need to watch film to see what really went down. It wasn't a good one for us on both ends."" The Cavs played their second game without injured All-Star forward Kevin Love, who could be out two months with a broken left hand suffered earlier this week. Love's injury hurts, obviously, but there are far bigger issues with a Cleveland team that has lost 12 of 18 and appears to be tearing apart at the seams. With the Rockets up 35 in the third quarter, the Cavs didn't even bother to huddle during a timeout. Thomas and J.R. Smith sat at the middle of the scorer's table while James and other players wandered near the bench area as Lue and his staff tried to figure what to do next. James doesn't have any answers. The three-time champion said the situation is reminiscent of his first season with Miami. The Heat started 9-8 but finally found their groove. James isn't so sure the Cavs can do the same. ""When you have an opportunity, you do your job and you do it to the highest of your ability and you live with those results. We don't do that every day."" One of James' closest friends, Paul isn't writing the Cavs off just yet. ""You got LeBron James over there in that locker room,"" he said. ""What else does the man need to do?  I'm a little biased, but what else does he need to do? If you all don't believe in him, you're all trippin'."" The Cavs actually did a decent job on Harden, who recorded the first 60-point triple-double earlier in the week against Orlando. Harden went just 5 of 14 from the field. Down 26 at halftime, James and the Cavs walked off the floor hearing boos from Cleveland fans who have grown tired of their lack of defense, chemistry and commitment. With the trade deadline on Thursday, Cleveland might need to make a major move to have any chance of getting back to its fourth straight Finals. This group isn't getting it done. ""Our mindset has to change -- what we're really playing for,"" Lue said. ""Are we playing to win or are we playing to look good? We have to be tougher. When things get tough we have to be tougher."" TIP-INS Rockets: Harden, who went 1 for 11 on 3s, tweaked his ankle in the third quarter, but stayed in. ... Paul passed Andre Miller (8,624) for ninth place on the career assists list. ... G Eric Gordon (lower back stiffness) missed his second consecutive game, but coach Mike D'Antoni expects the team's second-leading scorer to play Tuesday in Brooklyn. Cavaliers: Love met with reporters before the game and acknowledged he's ""still down"" after suffering his third broken hand in 10 seasons. He said the previous two times he recovered more quickly than expected. ... Dwyane Wade passed Payton (21,813) points and moved into 32nd place on the career list. ROCKET LAUNCHERS D'Antoni felt his team gained confidence after hitting several early 3-pointers. ""It makes it easier,"" he said.

"MINNEAPOLIS --  The Super Bowl still a day away, the Minnesota Timberwolves were the hot ticket in town -- and not because there wasn't anything else to do on a frigid Saturday night. While Wolves teams of previous seasons didn't give the home crowd much to cheer about, this season's squad gave the celebrities in town for Sunday's football game a taste of what has the local fans excited. Jimmy Butler scored 30 points, Karl-Anthony Towns had 22 points and 16 rebounds for his league-leading 47th double-double, and Minnesota beat the New Orleans Pelicans 118-107. With the likes of Floyd Mayweather, Sting, Guy Fieri and others in the crowd, the Wolves jumped to an early 16-point lead and had an answer for every New Orleans run en route to their 12th straight home win, and a four-game season sweep of the Pelicans. ""Obviously we didn't want to disappoint any celebrities coming in,"" Towns said. They didn't disappoint the regular fans either. The home winning streak is Minnesota's longest in a single season since a 14-game streak in 2003-04. ""I just think that we want to make it tough to win here,"" Butler said. ""We make shots here, that's for sure, but we actually guard a lot better more on our home floor. And you know when you guard, you get a lot of easy points in transition and the result of that is wins."" Anthony Davis led New Orleans with 38 points and managed to keep the Pelicans from getting completely blown out in the first quarter, when the Wolves opened a 22-6 lead. Davis scored 19 first-quarter points to help the Pelicans pull within single digits at times, but Minnesota shot 50.5 percent on the night to steadily maintain its lead. ""You can't play uphill the entire game,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. Nikola Mirotic scored 18 points on 6-of-13 shooting in his first game for New Orleans since being traded from Chicago on Thursday for Omer Asik, Tony Allen and Jameer Nelson. Mirotic hit back-to-back 3-pointers in the third to pull the Pelicans to 90-79 before Towns closed the quarter with a three-point play and a dunk. Tyus Jones had 15 points off the bench for the Wolves. Andrew Wiggins had 15 points for Minnesota and Taj Gibson added 12. ""The game was fairly close, for the most part, after that first quarter,"" Davis said. ""We just got off to a slow start and gave those guys whatever they wanted in those first couple minutes."" TIP-INS Pelicans: The team gave Emeka Okafor another shot at the NBA by signing the veteran forward to a 10-day contract. Okafor last played in the NBA in 2013 before being sidelined by a neck injury. He's played 26 games in the G League this year, averaging 6.8 points and eight rebounds per game. ""Obviously it's a never-give-up attitude to get your way back to where he is right now, and so it's just a matter of him being able to perform and stay at this level,"" Gentry said. Okafor was available but didn't play. Timberwolves: Coach Tom Thibodeau had no comment on recent ESPN reports that Shabazz Muhammad has requested a trade. ""I didn't see it,"" said Thibodeau, who is also the team's president of basketball operations. STARRY NIGHT The crowd enjoyed a Wolves mascot interaction with Mayweather on the scoreboard. Some of the other faces spotted in the crowd included Shaggy, Antonio Brown and Tony Gonzalez. It was the second game in a week that the crowd included famous faces. ""It's very different,"" Towns said. ""It's amazing what the Super Bowl brings to Minnesota."" READY OR NOT Mirotic didn't get much time to prep for his first game with his new teammates, who played the second night of a back-to-back. He said he met with coaches and watched film in the morning, and the team didn't hold its typical shootaround. ""It was helpful and those guys make it very simple for me tonight,"" Mirotic said.","400975526"
"SAN ANTONIO --  After being run ragged by the Spurs' ball movement for years, Ricky Rubio continues to get some payback in his first season with Utah. Rubio scored a season-high 34 points and added nine assists, and the Jazz upended San Antonio 120-111 on Saturday night for their fifth straight victory. Utah shot 57 percent from the field and had 26 assists in its second win over San Antonio this season. ""We did the extra pass,"" Rubio said. ""We're trying to play like (the Spurs) actually. We were trying to move the ball and do the extra pass until one guy is open. Sometimes one guy open is not enough and we just take it to the next step where it's a wide open."" LaMarcus Aldridge had 31 points for the Spurs in the final home game before embarking on their annual monthlong rodeo road trip. It was Aldridge's 10th game with 30 points this season after doing so just five times in his previous two seasons with the Spurs. He was one of the few bright spots for San Antonio, which lost three times during the five-game homestand after losing just three home games prior. Despite arriving in San Antonio late after playing Friday night in Phoenix, the Jazz rolled over the Spurs. ""They were inspired, we were poor,"" said Manu Ginobili, who had 13 points. ""Always late and they got everything they wanted. They got 3s, free throws, mid-range and layups. We were behind the whole game."" The Jazz were without star rookie Donovan Mitchell, who missed the game due to an illness. Rubio made sure they had no trouble replacing the production of their leading scorer. ""He knew the situation tonight with Donovan out,"" Utah coach Quinn Snyder said. ""I thought he was efficient. He was taking really good shots and then the second half he started passing and finding other people. That's the sign of a guy that really understands the game."" Utah was 5 for 8 on 3-pointers in the first quarter, including two from Rubio over second-year player Dejounte Murray. ""He's just being more aggressive,"" Jazz center Rudy Gobert said. ""He's attacking the rim and finding his teammates. We just got to be in the right spot. He's a very good passer. He's doing a great job with that."" Jazz forward Royce O'Neale added 18 points, making all four of his 3-pointers in scoring a career high. San Antonio struggled offensively in the first quarter as it did throughout the homestand. ""I can't figure it out,"" Aldridge said. ""We've just got to come out with the intensity that we have in the second half in the first half. We've just got to find ways to get ourselves going early."" TIP-INS Jazz: Alec Burks made his first start of the season. He finished with eight points and eight rebounds in 25 minutes. . Rodney Hood played 16 minutes after being listed as probable with a bruised lower leg. ... G Joe Johnson sat the game out to rest. ... The Jazz beat the Spurs 100-89 in Salt Lake City on Dec. 21. Spurs: Murray became the first player since Kawhi Leonard with 500 points and 300 rebounds in his first 100 games with the Spurs. ... Brandon Paul did not play after being downgraded from questionable with back spasms. ... The Spurs' next home game is Feb. 28 against New Orleans. ON THE ROAD AGAIN The Spurs hit the road again for their annual sojourn in February, but they enter it under unusual circumstances. San Antonio has struggled for much of the season, battling injuries to key players like Leonard, Tony Parker and Rudy Gay and trying to adapt to rotation changes. ""It feels like we have played 10 games not 60 or whatever we played,"" Ginobili said. ""We've got a feeling that we're still building, trying to find our identity, trying to get players back, rotations and who's in and who's out. It's a very unusual situation. I don't remember being in anything like this in (his) 16 seasons, and the crazy thing is we're still third (in the West)."" JUST BETTER The Jazz have the longest active winning streak in the NBA, which Gobert attributes to one thing. ""I think we're just better defensively,"" Gobert said. ""It makes the offense better. We move the ball, we share the ball. Ricky's making shots. Just having fun.","400975527"
"DENVER --  The Nikola Jokic and Gary Harris combination worked so well that Denver went back to it two days later. It wasn't scripted, but it paid off anyway. Jokic hit a go-ahead 3-pointer off a missed dunk by Harris, and the Nuggets rallied to beat the Golden State Warriors 115-108 on Saturday night. Jokic finished with 19 points and nine rebounds, Will Barton had 25 points and Harris 16 for the Nuggets, who split the four games with Golden State this season. Denver rallied from 12 down in the second half to hand the Warriors their second loss in three games. Kevin Durant scored 31 points and Stephen Curry had 24 for Golden State. ""It was huge, especially coming off an emotional win over (Oklahoma City),"" Harris said. ""For us to come and get the defending world champs was huge."" Harris hit the game winner against the Thunder on Thursday when Jokic found him with an inbounds pass with 1.4 seconds left and he drained a 3-pointer at the buzzer. This time Harris drove the baseline and went up to dunk, but Durant got a hand on it. The ball went out to Jokic in the corner, and he calmly drained a 3-pointer with 2:10 left to give the Nuggets a 107-104 lead. ""Missed, dunk, layup, pass, assist. That was huge,"" Jokic said. ""I thought I heard the whistle because everybody stopped. I'm just going to shoot it. I'm glad I made it because I didn't think about it."" After Curry missed a 26-footer, Jokic hit two free throws to make it 109-104 and Denver closed it out. ""It was a tie ballgame, things had gone our way to the point where Gary Harris goes up for a dunk,"" Curry said. ""It was just one of those lucky kind of bounces, right to Jokic and he knocks down a 3 and he gets the crowd into it."" Harris joked he deserved an assist on the play but wasn't credited with one. ""It was definitely a pass and I'm sticking with it,"" he said. Durant, who didn't attempt a shot in the first quarter, was 12 of 16 from the field the rest of the game. He had nine points in the fourth when Golden State appeared to take control, but Denver rallied to take a 102-99 lead on Barton's 3-pointer. The Warriors still had a chance down 109-105 but Nick Young missed everything on a 3-point attempt. He and Durant were then hit with technicals and Jamal Murray hit the free throws with 28 seconds left. ""They hit some shots tonight,"" Durant said. ""We made plays but down the stretch we couldn't get it done."" TIP-INS Warriors: F David West (personal reasons) and Jordan Bell (left ankle) were out of the lineup. ... G Shaun Livingston returned after missing Friday's game for personal reasons. ... C JaVale McGee had five fouls in 6:15 but also finished with a game-high four blocks. Nuggets: Trey Lyles had 15 points and 10 rebounds. ... F Mason Plumlee missed his third straight game with a right calf strain. ... F Wilson Chandler did not take part in the morning shootaround due to illness but was in the starting lineup and had five points in 23 minutes. ... The announced crowd of 20,103 is the largest for a Nuggets game in Pepsi Center history. ONE-LEGGED MAN Denver got a scare when Murray left the game with a right leg injury after he collided with Draymond Green on a drive into the lane less than a minute in. He went to the locker room and came back to the bench with his right thigh heavily wrapped. Murray played 28 minutes and had 12 of his 15 points after halftime. After the game he got some treatment, and his teammates praised his effort. ""I was worried but then I remembered it was Jamal and he was going to figure a way to get back on the court,"" Harris said. ""He's a tough kid. The bruise is going to be ugly in the morning but he's a competitor. He'll go out there and play on one leg. That's just the type of guy he is.""","400975528"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  On a night when Dirk Nowitzki inched closer to another NBA milestone, his Dallas teammates also took a collective step forward in what has been a mostly disappointing season. Baby steps, for certain, but a definite move in the right direction for a team that went into the game with the worst record in the West. Yogi Ferrell made consecutive 3-pointers to spark a big run at the start of the fourth quarter and the Mavericks beat the Sacramento Kings 106-99 on Saturday night to snap a five-game losing streak. Nowitzki had 15 points and seven rebounds, Harrison Barnes scored 18 points and Dwight Powell added 17 points and nine rebounds to help Dallas win in Sacramento for the first time in nearly three years. ""We did a great job keeping our composure, battling,"" Barnes said. ""A lot of times we have lost our poise but tonight we did a great job of really bearing down, keeping our composure, not getting rattled and playing through calls."" Nowitzki played 26 minutes and needs six more to become sixth player in NBA history to reach 50,000 for his career, joining a list that includes Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kevin Garnett, Jason Kidd and Elvin Hayes. ""We've been pretty good if we hold opponents under 100 points and they were well on their way to score way over,"" Nowitzki said. ""It was a little too easy there at times. They had it going and finally in the fourth we picked it up a little bit."" The Mavericks trailed by as much as 10 in the second half and were down 85-81 heading into the fourth before opening the final period on a 16-0 run. Devin Harris followed Ferrell's back-to-back 3s with a pair of layups, including one off a midcourt steal. After Nowitzki connected from deep, Harris made a 3-pointer to put Dallas up 97-85. Sacramento closed to 100-94 on a free throw by De'Aaron Fox with 2:45 remaining but Barnes made a driving one-handed dunk and a more traditional two-handed jam to help the Mavericks hold on. ""We were two steps slow most of the night,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""Too many turnovers. We could create our own shots, but not at the rim. We just didn't knock some of them down. It's not enjoyable but we're trying."" Dallas won for the second time in 10 games. ""This game was similar to the last game we played these guys, I think they were down going into the fourth,"" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Tonight we were down and we were able to turn it around. That run really gave us a cushion and an opportunity to finish the game."" Fox and Temple had 15 points apiece for Sacramento. The Kings had not lost at home to the Mavericks since Feb. 5, 2015. Barnes and Nowitzki combined for the Mavericks' first 17 points of the game while making five 3-pointers, all of them uncontested. Dallas got a lift from Powell early in the second and Barnes added a fourth 3, but Buddy Hield hit a 13-foot runner to beat the shot clock buzzer with 6.9 seconds left and pull the Kings within 56-54 at halftime. TIP-INS Mavericks: Barnes' first 12 points came on 3-pointers. . Dallas is 13-10 when holding opponents under 100 points. . Powell had three dunks in the third quarter, including on back-to-back possessions. Kings: Sacramento missed its first 10 shots in the fourth quarter. ... Kosta Koufos started the third quarter in place of Randolph. Koufos finished with eight points and seven rebounds. ... Jason Williams, who was a wildly popular player in Sacramento from 1998-2001, sat courtside next to owner Vivek Ranadive. BAREA'S BACK JJ Barea scored five points on 2-of-12 shooting but had 11 assists in 24 minutes in his return after missing the previous three games with a left oblique strain. ""He's got to be one of the smartest pick-and-roll players this league has,"" Nowitzki said. ""If you go under he usually shoots. If you go over, he kind of puts his defender in jail and plays cat-and-mouse with the big.""","400975529"
"BOSTON --  Al Horford captured the attention of Boston sports fans even on Super Bowl Sunday. Horford made a 15-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer and the Celtics finished off the Portland Trail Blazers 97-96 Sunday, giving New England fans a few hours to get home before the Patriots played for the NFL championship. ""Wanted to end the game so we could go watch the Super Bowl,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Stevens spoke while wearing a Patriots hat. He was joined by Eagles fan and Celtics player Marcus Morris, who sported an Eagles jersey. ""I called game when Al hit the turnaround, just so you know,"" Morris said. Stevens smiled, adding: ""Al feels a lot like Tom Brady today, right?"" Several jerseys for Brady and fellow Patriots star Rob Gronkowski were in the crowd at TD Garden. An Eagles fan shown on the Jumbotron repeatedly got booed. Horford wound up with 22 points and 10 rebounds, helping Boston win its fourth in a row. ""He (Stevens) had called a play for Jaylen (Brown) but they were ready for it so he kept yelling keep the ball, keep the ball,"" Horford said. ""It's a shot I work on a lot and it felt good when it left my hands."" Horford hit a game-winning shot with 3.7 seconds left against Houston earlier this season and also hit a buzzer-beater for Atlanta to beat Washington during the 2013-14 season Damian Lillard shot just 6 for 19, but scored Portland's final eight points, including a 3-point play with 7.2 seconds remaining to give the Blazers a 96-95 lead. C.J. McCollum led the Blazers with 22 points and Lillard added 21. ""They executed well down the stretch, made some tough shots,"" McCollum said. ""Credit them for battling back and then down the stretch they seemed to match every basket."" Boston trailed 85-79 with 5:37 to go before going on an 11-0 run, sparked by consecutive 3-pointers from Semi Ojeleye, Jayson Tatum and Horford. Tatum had 17 points and Brown scored 16 for the Celtics. ""That shot epitomizes the work he puts in,"" Brown said. ""He embraces those opportunities and steps up to the challenge.""

"NEW YORK --  Giannis Antetokounmpo was planning to come back in, though his coach seemed to have other ideas. Eric Bledsoe and the Bucks made it a moot point. Bledsoe scored 28 points, John Henson had season highs with 19 points and 18 rebounds, and Milwaukee easily extended its winning streak over the Brooklyn Nets to 10 games with a 109-94 victory Sunday. Antetokounmpo twisted his right ankle with about 7  1/2 minutes remaining, not long after the Nets had cut what had been a 28-point deficit to seven. But the Bucks got the next two baskets after his departure to finish an 8-0 run and push the lead back to 15. ""Giannis is a big piece of our team but we got other guys that can step up, especially down the stretch, and took on that role,"" Bledsoe said. ""We just stayed together and hopefully he's all right."" Antetokounmpo, who said he stepped on a Nets player's foot, was standing along the baseline near the bench after coming out, trying to get loose in case he was called on to return. ""I knew that if the game was close I would definitely be back in,"" the All-Star forward said. Well, maybe not. ""We had talked and we were pretty sure he wasn't going to be coming back,"" coach Joe Prunty said of his discussion with medical staff. ""At the end of the day, it was the trainer lets me know and we make a decision from there. But as the lead gets (bigger), yeah, there was no reason to."" Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton each had 16 points for the Bucks, who improved to 6-1 since firing Jason Kidd and moved a season-best six games over .500 at 29-23. DeMarre Carroll and Caris LeVert each scored 15 for the Nets, who lost for the sixth time in seven games. The Bucks scored six straight points in the first 81 seconds to prompt a Nets timeout, pushed the lead into double digits later in the first quarter and led 36-22 at the end of the period. ""Somehow, some reason, not ready. We weren't ready,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""I don't understand. I don't understand how that happens. A little upset with our group that we weren't ready mentally, physically."" Milwaukee led 62-41 at the break. The Bucks opened the second half with seven straight points as the lead peaked at 69-41 on Antetokounmpo's dunk. With their length and athleticism, the Bucks looked like high schoolers playing against middle schoolers. They had seven blocked shots, including one by Antetokounmpo on Jarrett Allen to trigger a fast break in the third quarter, which ended with an alley-oop from Middleton to Henson. The Nets finished the period with a flurry and trailed only 83-72 heading to the fourth. TIP-INS Bucks: Jabari Parker had 11 points in 17 minutes off the bench in his second game since returning from ACL surgery. ... Milwaukee opened a four-game road trip and hangs around New York for a couple days before visiting the Knicks on Tuesday. Prunty was an assistant to Kidd in Brooklyn during the 2013-14 season Nets: Allen, who averaged 16 points on 82.6 percent shooting in first three starts, scored 14 on 7-of-11 shooting. ... D'Angelo Russell fouled out with nearly 11 minutes to play and finished with three points off the bench. ANKLE PAINS Prunty said backup G Matthew Dellavedova also hurt his ankle and both he and Antetokounmpo would be re-evaluated. ""I've twisted it twice in the last five games, but I've just got to play through it,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""We've got a great medical staff that's going to take care of me and Delly and hopefully I can be ready to go on Tuesday against the Knicks.""

"NEW YORK --  It was a bull's-eye for Kent Bazemore. Bazemore hit a 3-pointer with 6.7 seconds left that put the Atlanta Hawks ahead Sunday in a 99-96 win over the New York Knicks. ""It's just a catch-and-shoot situation,"" Bazemore said. ""We work on plays all the time in practice where we have a guy who drives and kicks it out to somebody in the corner. It's just a synergy and rhythm thing."" ""I read a book called the `Zen in the Art of Archery.' It talks about just let it go. Let it go and let the energy of the world take care of the rest,"" he said. The Hawks rallied from a 93-87 deficit in the final 2:16. Bazemore was wide open in the left corner and hit for a 98-96 lead. Tim Hardaway Jr. then stepped on the line trying to inbound, giving the ball back to Atlanta. After Dewayne Dedmon made one of two foul shots, Hardaway missed a potential tying 3-pointer. ""We don't know how to finish games. We don't know how to win games at the end,"" Knicks star Kristaps Porzingis said. ""We didn't close out the game strong again and another loss."" Bazemore led the Hawks with 19 points. Mike Muscala scored 15 and Taurean Prince had 13. Dedmon finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds, while Dennis Schroeder added 10 points for Atlanta. Porzingis scored 22 for the Knicks. Trey Burke added 14, Jarrett Jack and Kyle O'Quinn each scored 11, and Enes Kanter finished with 10 points and 12 rebounds. Muscala hit a 3-pointer with 46 seconds left to pull the Hawks within one. O'Quinn missed a shot on the Knicks' next possession and Bazemore followed with his go-ahead basket. ""A great win on the road,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""We got the stops late. We always talk about it being 48 minutes. Today it took all 48."" TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta has nine players on the 17-man roster with one year or less of NBA experience. Only Marco Belinelli (10), Ersan Ilyasova (9) and Luke Babbitt (7) have played more than five years in the league. Knicks: New York was attempting to win its 100th home game in its all-time series vs. the Hawks. They are now 99-68 at home, but trail the all-time series 195-175. ... Porzingis has recorded a block in a career-high 22 straight games, which is the longest current streak in the NBA. STRANGE SEQUENCE Bazemore was awarded three free throws with 2:49 left in game. When he missed the second one, the Knicks rebounded and play continued. Hardaway got a dunk and was fouled, but the refs realized they hadn't given Bazemore his third shot. The officials went back in time, nullified the basket and gave Bazemore another free throw, which he made. The Knicks subsequently scored on their next possession. NOT SO SUPER SUNDAY Despite the loss, the Knicks have fared well playing on Super Bowl Sunday, having won eight of their last 12 and going 11-7 overall on the NFL's biggest day. NO-FOUL ZONE The Hawks did not commit a personal foul in the first quarter, though they still trailed 22-21 after the first 12 minutes. Malcolm Delaney was the first Atlanta player to be called for a foul. That happened with 8:43 left in the second quarter. HANGING TOUGH Only two players on each team have played in every game this season. Courtney Lee and Doug McDermott have seen action in all 54 games for the Knicks, while only Bazemore and Prince have played in all 53 for the Hawks.","400975532"

Delon Wright scored 15 points, DeMar DeRozan and Fred VanVleet each had 13 and the Raptors pulled away in the fourth to beat Memphis 101-86 on Sunday, their fifth straight home win over the slumping Grizzlies. Toronto outscored Memphis 52-19 in bench points. ""Our young guys, they brought the energy,"" Casey said. ""They did what they were supposed to do."" DeRozan said he was grateful for the effort from the bench, especially because of the rare noon tip-off time. ""I made a joke saying the old guys can't get up this early in the morning for the game,"" DeRozan said. ""They came up with a lot of energy."" Jonas Valanciunas scored 12 points, Kyle Lowry had 11 and Pascal Siakam 10 as the Raptors improved to 21-4 at home, the best record in the NBA.

Oklahoma City dropped its fourth straight game Sunday when Brook Lopez scored 20 points and Julius Randle added 19, leading the Los Angeles Lakers to a 108-104 victory. Thunder guard Russell Westbrook said the team won't panic. ""Me personally, I love adversity,"" he said. ""It gives you an opportunity to bring your teammates together and bring everybody together. Looking forward to positive things. Throughout this season there is going to be a lot of ups and downs, but we never flinch. That's one thing about this organization and about our team -- we never flinch. We are always going to stay together."" Westbrook scored 36 points and Paul George had 26, but Oklahoma City struggled on defense again. The Thunder have dropped four of five since losing defensive stopper Andre Roberson to a season-ending left patellar tendon injury. Of particular concern, the Lakers made 13 3-pointers. ""That's where Andre Roberson is great, maybe the best I've ever seen, of being able to close down on top of shooters and get them to bounce it and then also guard it,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""But we've got to be able to do a better job."" Jordan Clarkson scored 18 points and Brandon Ingram added 16 for the Lakers, who have won six of eight. The Lakers had lost 11 straight in Oklahoma City. ""I was most proud of the way that we engaged ourselves in the fight this time,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""Again, we went off to a good start where we were competing back and forth and this time, we sustained it for much longer."" The Lakers carried an 82-79 lead into the fourth quarter. Westbrook checked back in with the Lakers leading 87-84 and just over eight minutes remaining. The Lakers went up 98-90 on a fast-break layup by Josh Hart.

Ingram and Clarkson each made a free throw to give Los Angeles a 10-point lead. A 3-pointer by George trimmed the Lakers' lead to 107-104 with 24.7 seconds to play. Randle was fouled with 17.9 seconds left, and he made the first of two free throws. Westbrook missed a long 3-pointer, and the Lakers pulled down the rebound to escape. ""Don't give into the fact this is a long road trip and we are playing against a really good team,"" Walton said. ""Enjoy it. Enjoy the challenge. Our guys did a really good job of sticking together and really fighting that one out."" TIP-INS Lakers: G Lonzo Ball missed his 10th straight game with a sore left knee. ...

Charlotte's reserves outscored their Phoenix counterparts 45-27. ""We got some obvious phenomenal bench points,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""Phenomenal."" Over a 13-minute stretch in their comeback, Charlotte outscored the Suns 48-18. ""I think we just bore down on defense,"" Howard said. ""The effort was a lot better."" Rookie Josh Jackson scored a career-high 23 and T.J. Warren added 21 for the Suns, who led 78-57 with 7:53 left in the third quarter. Devin Booker and Dragan Bender added 18 apiece. Booker, already playing with bruised ribs, left the game with a left hip pointer with 6:53 to play. Phoenix played without forward Marquese Chriss due to a team rules violation. The Hornets, opening a four-game trip through the West, outscored the Suns 20-2 to start the fourth quarter. Booker was hurt fouling Cody Zeller on a layup, and that three-point play capped the outburst and gave Charlotte a 106-96 lead. Bender's driving dunk cut it to 112-107 with 1:31 left before Graham sealed the win with a 3-pointer with 34.8 seconds to play.

The Suns turned the ball over the first three times they had it in the fourth quarter. ""We can't do that.

""Seven turnovers in the fourth quarter when it's clutch time, good teams are going to ramp up their defense and you have to be prepared for it."" Charlotte made of 25 of 29 free throws, Phoenix 13-of-13. ""We just let the game get away from us, complaining about a lot of calls,"" Booker said. ""They were getting to the free throw line, we weren't. I think we all shot the ball pretty well, but the biggest difference was they were the aggressors and getting those calls.""

"DETROIT --  Stan Van Gundy worried over the weekend that the Detroit Pistons were becoming too reliant on Blake Griffin. That wasn't a problem Monday night. Andre Drummond had 17 points and 17 rebounds, and the Pistons beat the Portland Trail Blazers 111-91 for their fourth straight victory. Detroit had 36 assists on 44 field goals and had six players with at least 12 points. ""I didn't really think we moved the ball that much at the start of the game, but then we really got it going,"" said Van Gundy, Detroit's coach. ""The best part is that you look how many guys got involved -- it wasn't just one or two guys with a bunch. Once you start moving the ball, it gets contagious."" Detroit has won three in a row with Griffin in the lineup after acquiring him in a trade last week. Following a win over Miami on Saturday, Van Gundy said the Pistons might be playing through Griffin too much. He still led Detroit in scoring Monday, but the Pistons had plenty of threats. ""They had one action -- dribble handoff out of the corner -- and they kept getting down to the center of our defense,"" Portland's Damian Lillard said. ""Once guys get confident and get to making shots, it's hard to stop."" The victory pulled the Pistons back to .500 and even with Philadelphia for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Griffin had 21 points, nine rebounds and six assists, and did a good bit of his offensive damage from the perimeter, making three 3-pointers. Anthony Tolliver added 15 points for Detroit, and Reggie Bullock and Langston Galloway contributed 13 apiece. Lillard scored 20 points and C.J. McCollum added 14 for the Blazers, who lost again after falling at the buzzer at Boston on Sunday. Portland was without Evan Turner on Monday because of a left calf injury. Detroit led by 13 in the second quarter and was up 49-43 at halftime. The Pistons pushed the lead to double digits again in the third. A 9-0 run capped by Luke Kennard's 3-pointer made it 75-57. Detroit was never seriously threatened in the fourth, and the game ended with several seldom-used reserves on the court. TIP-INS Trail Blazers: Lillard is six points shy of Jerome Kersey for fifth place on the franchise's career scoring list. Pistons: Dwight Buycks (illness) missed the game. ... Detroit has won five in a row against Portland. The teams meet again March 17 at Portland. PULLING EVEN Drummond now has 266 double-doubles since entering the NBA in 2012-13. He's tied with DeMarcus Cousins for the most in that span. GETTING COMFORTABLE Drummond and Griffin seem to be developing some chemistry together, and they combined for 11 assists. ""It can only get better from here,"" Drummond said. ""He's going a great job of adjusting right now. We didn't really understand what was going to happen when we first got him. We didn't know how long it was going to take for him to adjust, but him being the professional that he is, he adjusted very quickly."" TOUGH STRETCH The Blazers went 0-3 in a four-day stretch that included road games against Toronto, Boston and Detroit. ""That's part of the NBA schedule. You play back-to-backs, you play three in four nights,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""I don't think anybody uses that as an excuse.""","400975536"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Suddenly, the Washington Wizards look unbeatable. Their early season shooting woes are gone, they're sharing the ball more and they're playing like a contender. And they've done it all with All-Star guard John Wall on the mend. They did it again Monday as Bradley Beal, their other All-Star, scored 21 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. added 15 to lead the Wizards past the Indiana Pacers, 111-102 for a season-best fifth straight win. ""John is such a key and valuable piece to our team. He draws so much attention at what he brings to both ends of the floor, that's kind of irreplaceable,"" Beal said. ""It's definitely a huge hit to us having him out, but we've been having some success. We've figured it out a little bit."" Actually, they're thriving. Since Wall went down with an injured left knee, Washington hasn't lost. The latest victory gave the Wizards their fourth in a row over the Pacers, something that hadn't happened since a nine-game winning streak in the series ended in 1983-84. The difference appears to be more balance. On Monday, eight players scored in double figures and three had at least seven rebounds. Thomas Satoransky and Tim Frazier each finished with six assists and Beal was the only Washington player with more than two turnovers. The Wizards outscored Indiana 30-11 in transition and had a 43-35 rebounding edge, too. ""I thought everybody chipped in and played well,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. But the Pacers weren't themselves. With All-Star guard Victor Oladipo out with an illness and point guard Darren Collison out with a bad left knee, the Pacers were out of sync and out of contention for most of the game. The Wizards took advantage. Indiana missed its first six shots, which allowed Washington to jump out to a 17-8 lead. The Wizards took complete control with a 13-0 run that made it 55-39 with 3:13 to go in the first half. The Pacers never got closer than seven again. Bojan Bogdanovic scored a season-high 29 points for the Pacers as he tried to spur a fourth-quarter rally. Joe Young added 17 as Indiana's six-game home winning streak ended. ""Vic is our go-to-guy. We knew it was going to be tough without both,"" Bogdanovic said. ""They play heavy minutes. We got two less players in the rotation. I think (Washington) didn't win this game. We lost this game with too many turnovers and (giving up) too many easy points."" TIP-INS Wizards: Markieff Morris had 11 points and 10 rebounds while Otto Porter Jr. scored 13 points. ... Ian Mahinmi finished with 12 points and seven rebounds against his former team. ... Washington shot 55.6 percent from the field. ... The Wizards have won four of the last six played in Indianapolis. ...  Washington has had at least 25 assists in six consecutive games. ...  Beal was 1 of 4 on 3-pointers, giving him 2,002 attempts in his career. Pacers: Domantas Sabonis finished with 15 points and seven rebounds. ... Young made a career-best five 3s. ...  Lance Stephenson had 13 points, nine rebounds, six assists and six turnovers. Joseph had seven points and four assists. ... Indiana was 12 of 29 on 3s but shot 46.2 percent overall, ending its four-game run of topping 50 percent. ... The Pacers also were 16 of 25 from the free-throw line. INJURY REPORT Before the game, the Pacers announced Collison would miss two to three weeks after having arthroscopic surgery on his knee. Pacers coach Nate McMillan said Collison was injured during Saturday night's win over Philadelphia. He's hoping Collison, who was averaging 12.8 points and 5.3 assists, can return shortly after the All-Star break. McMillan plugged Cory Joseph and Stephenson but may change it up until Collison returns. ""I like Cory and Lance coming off the bench, so once Vic is back we'll look at each game we're playing and make a decision,"" McMillan said.","400975537"
"MIAMI --  The Orlando Magic found the right setting for a rare road win. Mario Hezonja scored 20 points and Jonathan Simmons made the tiebreaking dunk with 1:31 remaining as the Magic beat the Miami Heat 111-109 on Monday night. Starting for the injured Aaron Gordon, Hezonja shot 7 of 14 from the field and 4 of 9 on 3-pointers as the Magic won their third road game in the last 24. They dropped Miami to just 13-11 at home. ""I'm not paying attention too much to my game because I know my game, I know what I can do, but as long as we are winning I am happy that I am helping my teammates,"" Hezonja said. The Heat appeared to tie the game after Tyler Johnson was credited with a basket when Orlando's Bismack Biyombo was called for goaltending with 2.8 seconds remaining. A video review overturned the call. ""I think they can't review it unless the whistle blows so I think they're told if it's close, blow the whistle and we'll look at it,"" Orlando coach Frank Vogel said. ""I didn't think it was really close. I would have been shocked if they called it a goaltend."" Marreese Speights' consecutive 3-pointers capped a 12-2 surge and his second one extended Orlando's lead to 99-89 with 11 minutes remaining. Speights finished with 12 points. The Magic withstood a 16-2 Miami run late in the fourth quarter. Josh Richardson's layup with 2:53 remaining tied it at 109 before Simmons' dunk put Orlando ahead for good. ""It's a game of runs and we just were able to sustain their run long enough to win the game,"" Simmons said. ""I just made plays down the stretch. My teammates and coach trusted me with the ball and I just made a play."" Richardson scored 20 points for Miami, which lost its fourth straight. Hassan Whiteside added 19 points and 14 rebounds, and Justise Winslow finished with 16 points. The Heat have now started their last two homestands with losses against the last-place teams in the Eastern and Western Conferences in Orlando and Sacramento. ""We can't change our offense and be too drastic,"" Richardson said. ""We just have to approach like any other day and be ready to work and fix what we do wrong."" Simmons and D.J. Augustin scored 16 points apiece for Orlando. Evan Fournier finished with 13 points. The Heat missed all 12 3-point attempts in the first half. But 16 points in the paint helped Miami build a 29-17 lead in the first quarter. Consecutive 3-pointers from Simmons keyed a 10-2 run the final 1:13 of the second quarter that got the Magic within 60-59 at halftime. Orlando then scored 34 points in the third. ""It's hard to explain what happened in that third quarter,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""The first quarter and obviously the fourth quarter you love the way your team is competing and just laying it all out there to the end. I just don't have an explanation for the third quarter -- very uninspiring."" TIP-INS Magic: Leading scorer Gordon missed his fourth consecutive game because of a strained left hip flexor. The injury also forced Gordon to withdraw from the Slam Dunk contest during All-Star weekend. Gordon participated in the previous two Slam Dunk contests. Utah rookie Donovan Mitchell will replace Gordon. Heat: Kelly Olynyk left with a left shoulder strain midway through the first quarter and didn't return. Olynyk fell hard to the floor after positioning for a charging foul on Biyombo. . Olynyk was scoreless, ending a streak of 11 consecutive games in double figures. . Miami made 20 free throws in the first two periods, a season high for a half. ANOTHER CLOSE CALL The Heat have lost by six points or less in their current losing streak. The two-point margin against Orlando coupled the two-point deficit that started the streak in Cleveland Jan. 31. Miami also lost by six and four points against Philadelphia and Detroit, respectively. ""Just a few small breakdowns. In the last few games they've been critical,"" Richardson said. PHILY PROUD Vogel received pregame congratulations for the Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl championship. Vogel, who grew up in Wildwood Crest, New Jersey, celebrated the Eagles' victory over the New England Patriots, while watching Sunday's game from the Magic's team hotel in Miami. ""It's been a long drought and they finally won it,"" Vogel said of the Eagles' 57-year span between championships. ""It's something my father never experienced. I never experienced. It's exciting.""","400975538"
"NEW ORLEANS --  Rodney Hood put to rest any concerns about his health when used a hesitation dribble to blow past Pelicans forward Nikola Mirotic and bolted down the lane for a soaring one-handed dunk. Hood scored 30 points in his second game back from a bruised left shin and the surging Utah Jazz extended their winning streak to six with a 133-109 victory over New Orleans on Monday night. ""Good shooting and winning cures a lot of things, so I just want to keep doing that,"" said Hood, who was supposed to remain on minute restrictions after playing only 16 minutes in his return Saturday from a six-game absence. Instead, coach Quin Snyder left Hood on the court for more than 27 minutes, and he made 12 of 14 shots, which delighted a strong contingent of Hood's family and friends who'd made the drive from his native Meridian, Mississippi. ""I told (Snyder) I'd let him know if my leg started to hurt,"" Hood said. ""It gave me a little bit of problems, but for the most part I was fine."" ""The ball just found me,"" Hood added. ""I started feeling it."" Ricky Rubio had 20 points and 11 assists, and Rudy Gobert added 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Jazz, who made 14 of 21 3-point attempts and shot 58.4 percent (52 of 89) overall in their highest-scoring game this season. ""We're just playing good basketball. There's no secret to it,"" Snyder said. ""We haven't sit here and beat our chests like we've done anything. We haven't. We've just won a couple games."" Jrue Holiday scored 28 points, and Anthony Davis had 15 points and 11 rebounds for New Orleans, which has lost four of five since losing All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins to a season-ending left Achilles tear on Jan. 26. Afterward, Davis declined to criticize his team's defensive effort and sounded resigned to the fact that the Jazz are on a roll and shooting well. ""We were in our coverages, what the coaches told us to be in and they shot the hell out of the ball,"" Davis said. ""There was nothing you could really do about it. All those guys were making 3s. ... If they beat you doing that, then so be it."" The Jazz led by double digits most of the way and led by as many as 20 when Rubio's driving layup made it 116-96 in the middle of the fourth quarter. ""Rubio is playing at a real, real high level right now,"" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""Because of that, they're a really difficult team to guard."" Utah had six players score more than 10, including Derrick Favors with 19, Joe Ingles 18 and Royce O'Neale with 13. TIP-INS Jazz: G Donovan Mitchell, who was listed as questionable with an illness, started just hours after being named a replacement for Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon in this month's All-Star dunk contest. ""He's deserving and I'm sure he'll enjoy it,"" Snyder said. Mitchell scored his only points of the game on a one-handed alley-oop dunk in the third quarter. He played 19 minutes. Pelicans: Rajon Rondo scored 18 points, all in the first half. Ian Clark and E'Twaun Moore each scored 14. ... C Emeka Okafor, signed Saturday to a 10-day contract, made his Pelicans debut and played in the NBA for the first time since 2013 when he checked in late in the first quarter. He had three points and two rebounds in nine minutes. ... Mirotic was making his home debut and first start in his second game with New Orleans since being traded by Chicago. He played 33 minutes but scored just five points. SETTING THE TONE Utah took its first double-digit lead less than four minutes into the game and was only briefly threatened after that. The Jazz led by 16 when O'Neale and Rubio hit back-to-back 3s to make it 52-36 early in the second quarter. The Jazz hit 10 of 11 3-point shots in the half, when they shot 61.4 percent overall (27 of 44). New Orleans gave up 70 first-half points, but got back into the game by halftime with a 41-point second quarter. Rondo hit seven of his first 10 shots, including four of five 3s. His fourth 3 made it 67-64, but Hood responded with a double-pump 3 as the half ended.","400975539"
"Will Barton lobs a pass up to Darrell Arthur who finishes at the rim with a sweet one-handed slam. (0:18) DENVER --  Michael Malone called Gary Harris one of the best young players in the NBA. The Denver guard then backed up his coach's praise with another strong game. Harris scored an efficient 27 points, Nikola Jokic had 15 points and 16 rebounds, and the Nuggets beat the Charlotte Hornets 121-104 on Monday night. Will Barton and Jamal Murray scored 18 apiece for Denver, which had seven players in double figures. Murray played 34 minutes and attempted a game-high 15 shots while playing with a bruised right thigh sustained Saturday against Golden State. Malone said before the game Harris was one of the most consistent players on the team at both ends of the floor. The Michigan State product has gone from a fringe player as a rookie three years ago to signing an $84 million, four-year contract that kicks in next season. ""When I got here there were questions, was Gary an NBA player?"" Malone said. ""We've rewarded him, he's a huge part of our future and a foundation, and people are starting to understand why."" Harris has always defended the opponent's best perimeter player, but this season his offense has jumped. He leads the team in scoring at 17.4 points per game. He went 5 of 7 on 3-pointers and finished 8 for 11 overall Monday but said he shot the ball better at the start of the season. ""It was feeling really good to begin the season and I'm trying to get back to that,"" he said. Harris got hot early and then the Nuggets used a big third quarter to pull away and win their third in a row. Jokic had 10 points and six rebounds in the period and Murray scored eight points in 1:03 to start a 14-6 run that gave Denver a 97-79 lead. The bench extended the advantage to 19 midway through the fourth. Kemba Walker led Charlotte with 20 points and Dwight Howard had 19 points and seven rebounds. The Hornets had won three straight and four of six. Charlotte has allowed opponents to shoot better than 50 percent in five straight games. Denver hit 56.8 percent from the field. ""In order to win in this league you have to get stops,"" Walker said. ""For us to win we have to get stops. We have to get better on that end of the floor."" Harris helped Denver get off to a quick start by shooting 5 of 6 on 3s in the first quarter. The Nuggets led by 14 early in the second, but the Hornets outscored them by 20 to take a 54-48 lead. Denver closed the first half on a 15-8 run to take a one-point lead at the break and never trailed in the second half. ""Our defensive intensity wasn't there from all of us,"" Howard said. TIP-INS Hornets: Nicolas Batum had 15 points and Jeremy Lamb scored 14 off the bench. ... F Marvin Williams missed his fourth straight game with a sprained left ankle. Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said he hopes Williams will be available Thursday night in Portland. ... Walker has scored in double figures in 17 straight games and 51 of the 53 games he has played this season. Nuggets: F Darrell Arthur (sore knee) and F Wilson Chandler (flu-like symptoms) were held out of the morning shootaround but were able to play. Chandler had two points in 21 minutes and Arthur scored 10 in 14 minutes off the bench. ... F Torrey Craig landed hard on his back after trying to block Cody Zeller's shot midway through the fourth. He stayed down for a few minutes but remained in the game. FRESH LEGS Malone has given his players more days off recently to help them recharge and they have responded. Denver tied a season high with 18 made 3-pointers and has hit at least 10 in three straight games. As Malone told reporters the players cite fewer practices for the improved shooting, veteran Richard Jefferson shouted, ""Yes, it's true!"" DUNK CITY Arthur, who has logged just 32 minutes all season, went up for a rare dunk to start the fourth quarter, bringing the Denver bench to its feet. It was rare to see the nine-year veteran from Kansas attack the rim. ""That was the Bud Light play of the game,"" Malone said. ""I asked the team in the locker room, `When was the last time anyone saw Darrell dunk in a game?' and Paul Millsap said, `When he was at Kansas.' It's been a while.""","400975540"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. --  Two days after getting heated with his players didn't work, Sacramento coach Dave Joerger tried a softer, gentler approach and got the results he wanted. If only it had been that easy for the Kings all season. Bogdan Bogdanovic made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 52 seconds remaining and Sacramento overcame a dismal start with a strong finish to beat the Chicago Bulls 104-98 on Monday night. The Kings scored just nine points in the first quarter, trailed by as many as 21 and were down by seven with 10 minutes left before rallying to complete Sacramento's first season sweep of the Bulls since 2006-07. ""I did a fair bit of screaming Saturday night trying to get us to play and I couldn't,"" Joerger said, referring to a 106-99 loss to Dallas. ""If you start doing on that on a nightly basis and they'll not hear you. So I was trying to be very positive."" After Zach LaVine's follow shot tied it at 93 with less than 4 minutes left, Sacramento's Buddy Hield and Chicago's Bobby Portis exchanged 3-pointers. Bogdanovic then hit the go-ahead bucket for the Kings on an uncontested shot beyond the arc. Willie Cauley-Stein added an emphatic dunk but was called for goaltending on a shot by LaVine that cut the Kings' lead to 101-98. George Hill added three free throws over the final 11.4 seconds. Bogdanovic had 15 points, Hill scored 14 and Garrett Temple added 12 for Sacramento. The Kings became the second team this season to win after scoring nine or fewer in the first quarter. Miami beat the Bulls on Nov. 26 after being held to seven in the opening period. ""We didn't drive into the paint as much in the second half, and we started making shots,"" Bogdanovic said. LaVine scored 27 points and Justin Holiday had 20 for Chicago. The Bulls, who lost center Robin Lopez to an ejection in the first half, have dropped seven straight. Chicago was already playing without Lauri Markkanen, who missed his third straight game due to the birth of his child, and Kris Dunn. Markkanen was scheduled to join the Bulls in Sacramento but his flight was cancelled due to weather in Chicago. ""Best start we had in a long time,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""But then they ramped up the pressure on us in the second half and really bothered us."" The Bulls led 28-9 after the first quarter while limiting the Kings to a season low for scoring in any period this season. The Kings were booed off the court after making only four shots. Sacramento turned things around after that, scoring 32 in the second, 36 in the third and 27 in the fourth. TIP-INS Bulls: Holiday had 11 points with three 3-pointers in the first quarter. . Coach Fred Hoiberg said Dunn is feeling better and is making progress from the concussion he suffered against Golden State on Jan. 17.

EJECTED, NOT DEJECTED Lopez had to be held back by teammates after being called for a second technical with 4:21 left in the second quarter. The 7-footer then reluctantly left the court and grabbed a chair in the tunnel leading to the Bulls locker room and tossed it. ""I disagreed with the call,"" Lopez said. ""I told him, `That's bad.' I'm not sure the reason behind the technical, but I supposed the officials are absolute and who am I to discredit that? I was a little bit surprised.

"LOS ANGELES --  After playing more than 50,000 minutes, Dirk Nowitzki has certainly made a name for himself. Even if it's still hard to spell sometimes. On a night when his last name was botched on the back of his jersey, the Dallas forward became the sixth player in NBA history to reach 50,000 career minutes. He finished with 12 points but the Mavericks collapsed down the stretch in a 104-101 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Nowitzki said he didn't notice until after the game that his name was misspelled on his uniform. ""I actually just saw it,"" he explained. ""I had no idea. It happens. I guess it sums up our season."" Danilo Gallinari had 28 points, including the go-ahead free throws with 24 seconds left, and the Clippers scored the last 13 points of the game to rally past a Mavs team that went scoreless over the final 4:42. Tobias Harris had 19 points for Los Angeles, and Lou Williams added 15 off the bench. ""This felt like a steal game, because we didn't play well and they shot the heck out of the ball,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""To steal a game like this, you feel like you got two games."" With the Clippers up by one after Gallinari's free throws, DeAndre Jordan won a jump ball with 4.5 seconds remaining and tipped it to Avery Bradley for a fast-break layup that made it 104-101. Yogi Ferrell had a chance to tie it with 0.4 seconds to play, but he stepped out of bounds before his shot bounced off the rim. ""When you're playing from in front, you've got to protect the ball and get good shots and we struggled to do both,"" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. Wesley Matthews led the Mavericks with 23 points and Devin Harris added 16 off the bench. Nowitzki passed Elvin Hayes (exactly 50,000 minutes) for fifth place on the career list in the regular season. Nowitzki has played an additional 5,895 minutes in the playoffs. Next among active players on the regular-season minutes list is Utah's Joe Johnson at 43,806. TIP-INS Mavericks: F Harrison Barnes was held out with a sore left ankle. . Carlisle on Nowitzki: ""I just really believe Dirk's record of high level of excellence, of longevity, durability, is one of the most remarkable I've ever seen in sport."" ... Carlisle does not expect the Mavs to be active before Thursday's trade deadline: ""I don't think we're going to make any trades. Of course, that's been my opinion every year in the 16 years I've been coaching. This time of year there's a lot of talk, and normally not a lot of activity."" Clippers: G Austin Rivers (ankle) might return to action Friday in Detroit. He has missed 18 games. ... The Clippers had a season-high 38 fast-break points in their previous game against the Bulls, the first game for Harris and Bradley with Los Angeles since they were acquired from Detroit. Doc Rivers said the up-tempo game was by design. ""We told Tobias and Avery, it doesn't matter who gets it, that's the start of the break,"" he said. ""We don't look for a point guard and then get the ball up the court. We're gone."" WELL DONE, DIRK The Clippers were in awe of Nowitzki's accomplishment. ""That's crazy,"" said Doc Rivers. ""It really is amazing. I mean, I don't know how he gets up in the morning. And he had hard minutes because he was the guy other teams were trying to attack every night."" ""Amazing,"" Gallinari said. ""I've been playing against him not just in the NBA but overseas, so it's been a lot of battles, especially with the (Italian and German) national teams, too. He's a legend, a Hall of Famer. For us growing up in Europe, he's one of the best ever.""","400975542"

""I'm here for this season right now to try and figure out a way we can still compete,"" James said after his Cleveland Cavaliers blew a 21-point lead in a 116-98 loss to the Orlando Magic. ""I owe it to my teammates to finish this season out no matter how it ends up. I would never waive my no-trade clause."" The Cavaliers fell apart in the second half and lost for the 14th time in 21 games. They have given up an average of 122.4 points in their last five losses. ""I couldn't give up on my teammates like that. I just couldn't do it,"" James said after scoring 25 points. ""We put too much into the game every single day. ""This is no time to be ashamed about our season,"" he added. ""We've got quite a few games left. If we're still serious about the season, then we've got to play some good ball at some point."" Jonathon Simmons scored 22 of his career-high 34 points in the third quarter for the Magic, who broke a nine-game home-court losing streak against Cleveland. The Cavaliers scored 43 points in the first quarter, but then went almost 6 1/2 minutes without scoring in the fourth. They played the second half without coach Tyronn Lue, who went to the locker room in the second quarter with what the team said was an illness. ""It's like right now, when we hit adversity, we go our separate ways,"" guard Isaiah Thomas said. ""And that's just how I feel and it looks like that as well."" The Magic made their first 10 shots of the second half and won consecutive games for the first time since Nov. 8-10. James did not have a rebound or an assist in a foul-plagued second half. ""I gave my teammates some opportunities to knock `em down, but they just didn't go. You can't get assists when they don't go down, but that doesn't stop me from finding my guys on the floor,"" he said. ""At this point it's not what you say, it's what you do. We've got to go out and play well as a collective group, everyone hitting at the right time on all cylinders, and right now we're not doing that."" Simmons made seven of eight shots in his 22-point quarter, finishing the period with a 3-point buzzer shot in a game in which he almost did not play because of a sprained right ankle. ""To be honest, adrenaline was just going and I didn't even realize what was going on,"" Simmons said. ""I was just trying to play hard and trying not to have another setback."" J.R. Smith made three 3-pointers in the first four minutes to help the Cavaliers (30-22) take a 15-4 lead, and they led by 21 points late in the first half. Jeff Green dunked to put the Cavaliers up 61-40 with 4:50 left in the half, but they went scoreless for almost four minutes while the Magic (17-36) sliced nine points off the lead. James opened the second half with a couple of 3-pointers to regain a 16-point lead for Cleveland, but Simmons scored 12 points during the Magic's 19-2 run that gave them their first lead of the game at 78-77 with 5:33 left in the third quarter. James was called for his fourth foul just 17 seconds later and sat for more than seven minutes. When he re-entered the game with 10:10 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Magic ran off 14 straight points to lead 108-92. Dwyane Wade banked in a 3-pointer for Cleveland's only points in the first 7:25 of the fourth quarter. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Wade missed the morning shootaround with an illness but played 22 minutes. Magic: Simmons' 22-point quarter was three points short of the franchise record set by Tracy McGrady in 2003. ...

Miles had 20 and the Toronto Raptors routed the Celtics 111-91 on Tuesday night, snapping Boston's four-game winning streak. DeMar DeRozan added 15 points, Delon Wright had 14 and Fred VanVleet 10 as Toronto won its fifth straight home meeting over Boston, closing to within a game of the conference-leading Celtics. ""We got hit tonight,"" Irving said. ""When you get hit early and they consistently hit you, they buried us, which a good team should do."" Irving started for Boston after missing the previous three games because of a bruised right quad. He scored 17 points in 22 minutes. ""I didn't feel as good as I wanted to,"" Irving said. ""Being out for a week in any profession is tough. Hopefully next game will be better."" Reserve forward Marcus Morris also returned for Boston after sitting out two games because of a bruised left hip but the Celtics suffered their second-worst defeat of the season. Boston's only bigger loss was a 23-point defeat at Chicago on Dec. 11. ""We got our butts kicked by a really good team who physically overwhelmed us,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""We need to do a better job."" Terry Rozier scored 18 points, Morris had 12 and Jaylen Brown 11 for the Celtics. Boston's Al Horford shot 1 for 5 and finished with two points in 24 minutes. Toronto won its fifth straight home game and improved to 22-4 at Air Canada Centre, the best home mark in the NBA. ""I just liked the way we came out and set tone on both ends of the court,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. All six of Lowry's field goals were 3-pointers. His career-high is eight, set against Charlotte on Nov. 29. ""He got going and he cooked us,"" Stevens said. Lowry and Miles combined for 11 of Toronto's 17 3-pointers. Lowry made his first three 3-point attempts but no other Raptor connected from long range in the first quarter. Toronto led 22-18 after one. ""We looked slow, we looked like we weren't ready to react to their speed or their physicality,"" Stevens said. ""I think that was probably the case the whole night."" Toronto's bench extended the lead in the second. VanVleet scored 10 points and Wright had nine as the Raptors connected on 13 of 19 field goal attempts in the quarter to take a 58-37 lead at halftime. Toronto had a 30-15 edge in bench scoring at halftime. ""We have literally two different teams and that's a great thing to have,"" Lowry said. TIP-INS Celtics: Irving missed the only previous meeting between the teams this season, a 95-94 Boston win on Nov. 12, because of a minor facial fracture suffered in a collision with teammate Aron Baynes. ... Boston shot just two free throws in the first half. Raptors: Toronto is 15-3 when VanVleet scores 10 or more. ... The Raptors are 31-9 when they record 20 or more assists. NEVER FORGET Irving said the Celtics should remember how it felt to suffer a heavy defeat to their division rivals, who they'll face twice more in the regular season. ""Keep it in the back of your mind,"" Irving said. ""I know I will."" MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE BENCH Before the game, Stevens praised Toronto's productive second unit. ""There's not many groups I enjoy watching more,"" he said. Afterward, Wright was asked whether he thought Stevens enjoyed watching the Raptors bench players perform during the game-changing second quarter. ""Probably not a lot,"" Wright replied.","400975544"
"ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Hawks enjoyed a rare blowout that left the Memphis Grizzlies fuming about their failure to answer the challenge. Dennis Schroder scored 22 points and Atlanta beat turnover-plagued Memphis 108-82 on Tuesday night, giving the struggling Grizzlies their fourth straight loss. The Hawks' biggest lead was 34 points, and Schroder enjoyed the rare opportunity to sit out the final period and watch the final minutes of a runaway victory. ""Of course that's great to win like that,"" Schroder said. ""I think it's tough to win in the NBA but when you've got wins like this it's even sweeter."" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff was unhappy with his team from the start. He called his first timeout about one minute into the game. ""That was a very immature effort on our part,"" Bickerstaff said, adding that his players were not prepared for the Hawks' ""speed, their athleticism, their commitment to what they're trying to do."" Grizzlies center Marc Gasol's assessment was even more biting: ""We got hit and we lay down."" Added Gasol: ""You've got to care more about the team's success than your own success. ... Worry about `me first,' that's not going to cut it."" Mario Chalmers had 13 points for Memphis, which has lost six of seven. Dillon Brooks had 12 points. Only a late scoring surge allowed Memphis to top its scoring low in an 87-78 loss at Denver on Jan. 12. The Grizzlies' season-high 27 turnovers led to 38 points for Atlanta. ""There's something about us against Western Conference teams at home,"" said Hawks rookie John Collins, who had 15 points, 10 rebounds and one of the team's 13 steals. ""We came out with the intensity, forced them to turn the ball over, and we executed on the other end."" Memphis made only 4 of 22 3-pointers. The Grizzlies and Hawks held out players who could be dealt before Thursday's trade deadline. Tyreke Evans was not with the Grizzlies and missed his fourth straight game. Hawks 3-point specialist Marco Belinelli was held out as the team discussed a possible trade. ""That's part of the business,"" Schroder said. ""The NBA, you never know what's going to happen. Marco, I've become good friends with him this season. ... He's our brother, no matter what happens."" There were three ties in the first period before the Hawks pulled away with an 8-0 run that included a jumper and two free throws from Schroder. Atlanta stretched the advantage to 51-35 at halftime and to 32 points, at 75-43, in the third quarter. TIP-INS Grizzlies: Memphis ended a winless four-game trip and fell to 5-20 away from home. ... The Grizzlies' previous high of 22 turnovers came in a 96-94 home win over Hawks on Dec. 15. ... The teams were a combined 0 for 12 on 3-pointers before Chalmers finally sank a 3 with 8 minutes remaining in the second period. ... Ivan Rabb had 10 points and 11 rebounds. Hawks: Atlanta has won seven straight home games against Western Conference teams. ... Dewayne Dedmon had 11 points and Tyler Dorsey had 10 off Atlanta's bench, which scored 56 points. SIT AND WAIT FOR EVANS Bickerstaff said his staff has been in contact with Evans. ""It's a difficult situation for him, obviously wanting to play,"" Bickerstaff said before the game. ""He didn't ask to be moved so he wanted to be a part of this group. So it is a difficult situation for him. ... We just hope it works out in the end."" RACE TO THE BOTTOM Each team is contending for the worst record in its conference. The Hawks began the night percentage points behind Orlando at the bottom of the Eastern Conference. The Grizzlies were only two games away from last place in the West.","400975545"
"NEW YORK --  That's 15,000 points for James Harden, with plenty more to come the way these Houston Rockets can run it up. Harden scored 36 points, reaching a milestone along the way, and the Rockets beat the Brooklyn Nets 123-113 on Tuesday night for their fifth straight victory. Chris Paul added 25 points for the Rockets, who kept right on rolling in their first game since their nationally televised romp in Cleveland on Saturday. ""It's all coaching out there. You saw that, right?"" Houston's Mike D'Antoni said. ""Chris Paul, James, you got those two guys, it's one or the other. It's unbelievable."" Both teams made 16 3-pointers in an entertaining shootout between D'Antoni's Rockets and the Nets of Kenny Atkinson, who assisted D'Antoni in New York and has the Nets trying to do some of the things Houston does on offense. But it's one thing to be like the Rockets and another to beat them. Houston simply went to another gear when Brooklyn took the lead late in the third quarter and never stopped scoring long enough in the fourth to let the Nets get too close. ""In the first half they were making shots. Second half, especially at the end of the third quarter, we had to lock down, get stops and push the lead ahead,"" Harden said. DeMarre Carroll scored 21 points for the Nets and Spencer Dinwiddie added 18 points and nine assists. Brooklyn has lost seven of its last eight. ""We never found a solution to stop them, obviously,"" Atkinson said. ""They made a lot of tough shots."" The Nets had an 84-80 lead when Dinwiddie hit from nearly 10 feet behind the arc with 3:38 remaining in the third. The Rockets charged back with 11 straight points, including two 3-pointers by Gerald Green, to go up 91-84. ""We just started getting stops on defense,"" Paul said. ""All game long it seemed like they were just too comfortable, and they played well. I think you got to give them a lot of credit. They moved the ball well, and then we just locked in defensively, started making some shots."" Brooklyn ended the run with a pair of free throws but Paul then was fouled behind the line and made all three. He scored the final basket of the period to make it 96-86 when Nene freed him for a layup with a devastating pick on Caris LeVert, knocking him out of the game. TIP-INS Rockets: Eric Gordon returned after missing 2 1/2 games with low back stiffness, scoring 13 points. ... D'Antoni said F Trevor Ariza (left hamstring strain) still had a little way to go before coming back, saying there was no timetable yet for his return. Nets: LeVert was being evaluated for a possible concussion. ... Brooklyn remained without starting F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson because of a right groin strain. Quincy Acy, who had been starting in his place, was sidelined with a sprained right middle finger. HELPING HANDS The Rockets' star backcourt got plenty of help from Clint Capela (18 points, 11 rebounds) and Green (16 points). Also, the Rockets outscored the Nets by 17 points during Nene's 14 1/2 minutes on the court.","400975546"
"NEW YORK --  Kristaps Porzingis' dunk wasn't spectacular, certainly nothing like Giannis Antetokounmpo jumping over Tim Hardaway Jr. for a slam. But the moment he landed, punching the court in pain , the Knicks' playoff hopes had likely crumpled right along with him. Porzingis tore the ACL in his left knee Tuesday night in the Knicks' 103-89 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Antetokounmpo scored 23 points, jumping over Hardaway for one high-flying slam after Porzingis had dunked over him earlier in the game. Porzingis crashed to the ground after his dunk with 8:46 left in the second quarter and was taken for an MRI exam that revealed his injury. ""More than a basketball player, he's my brother,"" Knicks center Enes Kanter said. ""I don't want to see anyone going down like that hurting his knee. He's about to be an All-Star. I'm just going to pray for him tonight. He is the most important part of our family."" Eric Bledsoe also had 23 points and Khris Middleton added 20 for the Bucks, who are a season-high seven games over .500 Antetokounmpo didn't appear bothered by a right ankle injury sustained Sunday, particularly when he leaped to catch a lob pass on a fast break and jumped over the 6-foot-6 Hardaway to slam it down . ""I knew (Middleton) was going to throw me the lob,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""It was a bad pass but I was able to get up and go get the ball. I didn't see Tim Hardaway under me. I just went up to get the ball."" Kanter led New York with 19 points and 16 rebounds. Milwaukee led 50-46 at halftime and opened the second half with six straight points. The Bucks increased their lead to a game-high 21 points on Marshall Plumlee's free throw with 3:43 left in the third quarter. The Knicks scored the next nine points and pulled within 12 points on a pair of occasions in the final quarter, but never got any closer. ""I thought it was a very good effort,"" said Joe Prunty, who is 7-1 since replacing the fired Jason Kidd as coach on Jan. 22. ""We defended the three again well, rotation good in terms of getting to the spots and running people off the line. I really like the things I saw and we just have to keep doing them every night."" Sean Kilpatrick (16) and Jabari Parker (10) also scored in double figures for the Bucks. Courtney Lee added 14 points for the Knicks, who have lost four straight, tying their longest skid of the season. ""I think went K.P. went down, it kind of deflated us some,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""He is a big part of the things we do. No one is going to feel sorry for you when your guys are out, so you have to step it up."" TIP-INS Bucks: Milwaukee guard Matthew Dellavedova sprained his right ankle in Sunday's win at Brooklyn. He underwent an MRI on Monday and subsequent examination by team physician Dr. William Raasch. The exam confirmed a sprained right ankle that is expected to sideline Dellavedova for up to four weeks. Knicks: New York has dropped 10 of its last 13 against the Bucks. That streak has cost them the lead in the all-time series, as they now trail 106-101. The Knicks have not taken a season series from the Bucks since going 2-1 against them during the 2013-14 season. NO KIDD-ING Just one of Prunty's seven wins since replacing Kidd has come against a team that was above .500. That was a 107-95 victory over Philadelphia. KAN-DO Kanter has recorded six consecutive double-doubles. It is the longest streak by any Knick since David Lee had seven straight from Feb. 9-26, 2010. IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS Middleton is the only Milwaukee player to start all 53 games this season. Thon Maker has also played in all 53, but has only started nine times. CITY SWEEP The Bucks have had their way with New York City's NBA teams this season. They are 2-0 against both the Knicks and Brooklyn Nets, with all four wins coming within the last 11 days.","400975547"
"PHILADELPHIA --  The still-celebrating Philadelphia sports fans gave the 76ers a big boost on Tuesday night. Joel Embiid had 27 points and 12 rebounds and Philadelphia led from start to finish in a 115-102 victory over the Washington Wizards. Dario Saric added 20 points and J.J. Redick had 18 for the 76ers, who snapped Washington's five-game winning streak while playing in front of a raucous crowd still in a tizzy over the Eagles' Super Bowl win over the New England Patriots. ""We knew it was going to be amazing, so we had to come out and play up to the competition,"" Embiid said. Bradley Beal scored 30 points for the Wizards, who lost their first game since fellow All-Star John Wall had arthroscopic surgery on his troublesome left knee. ""We had a nice run,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said of the winning streak. ""We have to try to regroup and come back on Thursday (against Boston)."" It looked like half the crowd was clad in Eagles green, and fans broke out into several loud chants of ""E-A-G-L-E-S!"" as the party continued 48 hours after Philadelphia won its first Lombardi Trophy. Fans gave a standing ovation to Eagles offensive linemen Brandon Brooks, Lane Johnson, Jason Kelce, Halapoulivaati Vaitai, Stefen Wisniewski and Jason Peters when they rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell before tipoff. The 76ers seemed to feed off the emotion. Philadelphia took control early, scoring 22 of the first 29 points, and led by as many as 22 in the opening half before settling for a 65-55 halftime lead. The 76ers pushed the advantage to 19 points on Embiid's 3-pointer that made it 78-59 with just under nine minutes left in the third. Washington again pulled within 10 points, 94-84, at the end of the period. But Embiid's outside shooting gave Philadelphia breathing room again when his 3-pointer from the top of the key made it 100-84 with 10:16 left. The Wizards managed to get within single digits in the final five minutes, but they never seriously threatened. US NEXT? Philadelphia coach Brett Brown loved the crowd's enthusiasm and hopes it's a sign of things to come for his team. ""It's fantastic, it's just fantastic,"" Brown said. ""It's always, for us, a reminder of what we hope to experience. We want to start with earning a berth to the playoffs. That's our goal."" ""And we see what this city does and how this city responds to that type of environment. They respect and applaud effort.  They've been with us through many, many down times. And we look forward to try and reward them and play in front of them in a playoff atmosphere."" The 76ers began play tied with Detroit for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. FULTZ SPEAKS Philadelphia rookie Markelle Fultz told TNT's Caron Butler during an in-game interview that he expects to be a better player upon his return from a shoulder injury that has sidelined him all season. Fultz's return has been clouded in mystery and the first-round pick's well-documented struggles reclaiming his jump shot have caused concern within and outside the organization. Brown repeatedly has said that there is no timetable for Fultz's return and, as an injured player, the club doesn't make him available to local reporters for interviews. But Fultz spoke with optimism to Butler. ""It's been a slow process,"" he said. ""It's been tough, but at the end of the day I know it's going to make me better."" TIP-INS Wizards: Washington had its streak of getting at least 25 assists snapped at six games. ... Wall is expected to miss 6-to-8 weeks. ... Washington shot 26 percent (7-for-27) from 3-point range. 76ers: Embiid and Justin Anderson attended Sunday's Super Bowl, alternately watching the game from a suite and the stands. ... In addition to the offensive linemen, Eagles cheerleaders and mascot Swoop helped rile up the crowd. ... Philadelphia will play its next four games at home and doesn't hit the road until Feb. 22 at Chicago.","400975548"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Paul George and Russell Westbrook ran Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors right off the floor from the opening tip. Westbrook had 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists to get the better of old buddy and teammate Durant, George scored 38 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder embarrassed the defending champions 125-105 on Tuesday night to snap a four-game losing streak. ""They're one of the best teams in movement, in player movement, in ball movement,"" George said. ""So we had to match the physicality as well as their pace. I thought that was the key tonight. Our motor was ready for that intensity."" Durant scored 33 points but didn't get as much help from the cold-shooting Splash Brothers of Curry and Klay Thompson, who added 21 and 12 points, respectively. They combined to go 11 of 27 from the floor and 4 for 15 on 3-pointers as the Warriors lost for the third time in four games. They lost their tempers, too -- as in five technicals total. Draymond Green was ejected with 8:13 remaining after a second technical when he argued with the officials. ""It was a rough night,"" Curry said of the officiating, while insisting that wasn't what lost the game. The sellout crowd went crazy when Durant was called for a foul with 1:35 remaining in the third and replays show that Westbrook had clearly slipped and no contact was made. Warriors owner Joe Lacob tossed his jacket in disgust. ""We were way worse than the officials were,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""We got completely outplayed."" By the 6:32 mark of the fourth quarter and the blowout still in force, fans began leaving the building. Durant said it's up to the Warriors ""to hold ourselves accountable out there."" Westbrook shot 13 for 26 and George went 11 of 23 with six 3-pointers. Carmelo Anthony sprained his right ankle early in the game, but Oklahoma City never slowed down in ending a seven-game skid at Oracle Arena with its first win on the Warriors' home floor since a 116-97 victory on April 11, 2013. Westbrook scored 21 points in the first quarter, making nine of his first 10 shots as the Thunder led 42-30. They never trailed. ""That was the game right there, the first quarter and they have 42 points,"" Durant said. ""You've got to give them credit, they came out with a lot of energy and we didn't match it."" Golden State had been 11-0 following a loss this season. The Warriors also lost for the first time in seven games when taking on an opponent that had previously beaten them this season, with the Thunder having won 108-91 at OKC on Nov. 22. This could be a win that turns momentum for Billy Donovan's Thunder, who had dropped four of five since losing defensive star Andre Roberson to a season-ending ruptured patellar tendon in his left knee. Durant scored eight straight against his old team during one first-quarter stretch. Oklahoma City, which allowed 13 3-pointers in losing at home to the Lakers on Sunday, limited the Warriors to 8 for 28 from deep. ""It didn't feel like us, that's for sure,"" Kerr said. ""We're out of whack right now. We're just not playing the way we normally do in terms of the ball movement, the pace and the spacing. And our defense has not been good either. It's been a struggle."" Green was hit with the Warriors' third technical of the night at the end of the first half and had to be held back from officials. Meanwhile, Westbrook went down beneath the Thunder basket after crashing into the stanchion. TIP-INS Thunder: OKC went 12 of 31 from 3-point range after shooting 8 for 25 on 3s in the first meeting. ... Josh Huestis earned his second start of the season after rookie Terrance Ferguson started the previous five. ... The Thunder came in forcing 16.3 turnovers per game while averaging 9.31 steals.

""When you have a lot of talent at the beginning of your coaching career, you can implement things that will work and then you can get credibility with winning and grow as a coach while you are winning and it's a much easier process that way,"" he said.

"LOS ANGELES --  By the time coach Luke Walton entered the locker room at halftime, his Lakers players were already talking about how to defend better over the next 24 minutes. The talk worked. The Lakers held the Suns to only 36 points in the second half en route to a 112-93 victory on Tuesday night. ""You could tell with the way they were talking to each other on the court and the effort they were giving that they were locked in to getting stops for that second half,"" Walton said. Brandon Ingram scored 26 points for the Lakers, while Julius Randle added 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Kyle Kuzma scored 16 points off the bench. TJ Warren scored a team-high 24 points, while Josh Jackson added 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns. The Lakers pulled away in the last eight minutes of the fourth quarter with a 15-3 run after leading 97-90. Kuzma said the team's switching scheme contributed to a strong final stretch on the defensive end. ""Just switching everything,"" Kuzma said. ""Switching pin-downs, pick-and-rolls. And rebounding, too."" The Suns shot 47 percent in the first half. The Lakers held Phoenix to just 29 percent for the remainder of the game. ""They got out and they beat us up and down the court,"" Suns coach Jay Triano said. ""That's them doing a good job of rebounding and getting it out."" Los Angeles allowed 12 offensive rebounds in the first half, but only four in the second half. Walton said he showed the team a clip at halftime where Warren outworked four Lakers players for an offensive rebound that resulted in a basket. The Lakers overcame a sluggish start to the second quarter and a 16-6 run by the Suns. Los Angeles made only two of its first 10 shots, and Phoenix took a 50-43 lead on a jump shot by Warren to cap a 22-8 run over nearly seven minutes. Los Angeles answered with a 10-2 run that included Brook Lopez making a 3-pointer after blocking Jackson's dunk attempt and Ingram making a 3 to give Los Angeles a 53-52 lead with 2:29 left in the half. The game was tied at 57 at halftime. Ingram's ferocious slam gave Los Angeles an 84-77 lead with 1:59 remaining in the third. His two free throws gave the Lakers a nine-point lead entering the fourth quarter, and Kuzma's slam dunk sent the crowd into a frenzy and the Lakers into a 95-85 lead with 9:08 remaining in the game. The Lakers held the Suns to just 14 points in the final period, and closed the final 5:27 on an 8-0 run. TIP-INS Suns: Lost their third straight game, and their 12th of their last 13. .

Outscored Phoenix 25-11 in fast-break points. . Won their seventh straight home game. . Improved to 7-4 without Ball in the lineup. BOOKER OUT Suns guard Devin Booker missed Tuesday's game with an injury to his left hip. He was hurt in Sunday's 115-110 loss to the Charlotte Hornets and left the game. He did not practice Monday. Triano said before the game that things change ""drastically"" without Booker. ""He's a guy that we've played at so many different positions,"" Triano said. ""He's handled the ball for us in a variety of situations. Scorer, playmaker and he's been a much better defender this year. We're going to miss all that."" DOUBLE-DOUBLE HART Josh Hart tallied his third consecutive double-double in as many starts. He has scored 44 and brought down 36 rebounds in that stretch. Randle said the team has started jokingly calling him Charles Barkley because he's rebounding at such a high rate at his size. ""He's great, especially from that guard position, coming in and helping the bigs get boards,"" Randle said. ""He's huge for us.""","400975550"
"DETROIT --  Blake Griffin and the Detroit Pistons are on a roll heading into their matchup with his former team. Griffin scored 11 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, and Andre Drummond added 17 points and 27 rebounds to lift the Pistons to their fifth straight victory, 115-106 over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. Detroit hasn't lost since acquiring Griffin last week in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers. The Clippers play at Detroit on Friday night. ""Obviously, I know all those guys really well. I can't say that it's just another game,"" Griffin said. ""At the end of the day, we're trying to get wins, they're trying to get wins. I'm not really the type of guy to be all buddy-buddy during the game."" Allen Crabbe had 19 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter for the Nets. They have lost four in a row and eight of nine. ""That's the Allen we want,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""Just more aggressive, more assertive, and if that means he's going to take a few bad shots a game, then we're OK with that."" Crabbe scored 16 of Brooklyn's points in a row during one fourth-quarter stretch, including a 3-pointer that cut Detroit's lead to three at 91-88. The Pistons put the ball in Griffin's hands after that, and he scored nine of their next 11. ""He took over,"" coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""He's done some good things since he's been here in the four games, but that was his best offense for us."" Drummond had 12 rebounds in the first half and added 11 more in the third quarter. He finished with a season high, just two shy of his career best. It was the third time in the last five games he reached 20 rebounds. He shot only 5 of 17 from the field, but that just meant more opportunities for offensive rebounds. He had seven of those. Despite all that, the Pistons were actually outrebounded as a team, 50-46. TIP-INS Nets: Brooklyn was without Quincy Acy, who was out because of a sprained right middle finger. ... The Nets went 17 of 51 from 3-point range. ... Jarrett Allen had nine points in the fourth quarter and Joe Harris had five. Those two and Crabbe accounted for all of Brooklyn's scoring in the final period. Pistons: Detroit had a huge advantage in turnovers, committing only seven while the Nets had 20. ... Stanley Johnson had 19 points and Ish Smith added 15.

He scored 12 points and noticed how much different Detroit is with Griffin. ""I think also, beyond Blake, we gave up too many points off turnovers,"" Dinwiddie said. ""Any time a team goes out and gets baskets, it fuels a run."" IN RESERVE Brooklyn came in averaging 44.4 points per game from its bench, but Detroit's reserves won that battle 30-15.

"James Harden and the Houston Rockets go 4-0 on their road trip following a 109-101 win over the Heat. (0:57) MIAMI --  James Harden and Chris Paul finished off the Miami Heat. ""We got two assassins out there,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. Harden scored 41 points and the Houston Rockets beat the Miami Heat 109-101 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight victory and 10th in 11 games. Paul added 24 points, seven assists, and seven rebounds for the Rockets. ""We just hooped,"" Paul said. ""Me and Coach was talking about it. I think that's what I came here for. That's what we talked about this summer. We can play off of each other and you've still got something in the tank at the end of the game.

He was 13 of 25 from the field, going 5 of 12 from 3-point, and hit 10 of 12 free frees. He also had six assists and rebounds. ""Just having the opportunity to play with another great player -- I played with some great players, some really good players, but probably nobody the caliber of James,"" Paul said. ""You try not to get caught up in watching what he's doing, but it's special. The scary thing is he can keep getting better."" Josh Richardson, who scored 30 points for the Heat, drew the assignment of guarding Harden most of the night. ""James is one of the best guards in the world and I mean he knows how to get fouled, he knows how to score, he knows how to playmake for his teammates,"" Richardson said. ""The game just seems to come very easy to him. It seems like he has the game slowed down a lot more than pretty much anybody. So just watching him play, I give him a lot of props. He's a tough guard."" Harden scored 13 points in the fourth quarter while Paul added seven and the Heat were unable to get any closer than 94-90 with five minutes left. ""James and Chris at the end found some extra juice and just finished it off,"" D'Antoni said. The Rockets wrapped up a 4-0 road trip with a win on the second night of a back-to-back with starters Trevor Ariza and Ryan Anderson, and key reserve Eric Gordon out with injuries. ""Huge win for us,"" Harden said. ""An easy game with two starters out, Eric was out, we could have easily just have chalked it up, but we haven't done that all year. So this just shows us we're getting better. We still have a long way to go obviously, but we're taking the right steps in the right direction. Goran Dragic also had 30 points for Miami. The Heat have a five-game losing streak, their longest slide of the season. ""We're not looking for moral victories at all,"" Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We feel that we're a very good basketball team and we're not as far off as people think right now. We've been in 10 straight of these (close) games, but we haven't been able to get over the hump in many of them."" Clint Capela added 13 points for the Rockets, who are 24-1 when Harden, Paul, and Capela play. Harden scored 16 points in the opening quarter to help the Rockets take a 35-24 lead. The Rockets led by as many as 17 points in the first half at 53-36, but Dragic scored Miami's final 10 points of the half to help cut it to 61-57 lead at the break. TIP-INS Rockets: SG Eric Gordon (back) was held out in the second game of a back-to-back. ... PF Ryan Anderson (right ankle sprain) also did not play. He was injured Tuesday at Brooklyn. ... The Rockets are 34-2 when leading after three quarters. Heat: PF Kelly Olynyk (left shoulder strain) and SG Wayne Ellington (right shoulder strain) each missed their first games of the season. ... Dragic was honored before the game with an All-Star jersey presented to him by Alonzo Mourning. ... Former Heat forward Amar'e Stoudemire sat courtside. FRESH LATE With Harden and Paul taking turns running the offense, it has allowed the two to be more effective late in games. ""You all see it,"" Harden said. ""You see the difference. Efficiency, we're not turning the basketball over. We're getting more shots and we obviously can score the basketball at a high level, but you give us an extra five, six, seven possessions per game, it's trouble."" HEAT COOLING OFF The Heat had climbed to fourth in the Eastern Conference before their five-game losing streak dropping them to seventh. ""There always is a sense of urgency,"" Dragic said. ""It's not like we're relaxing right now. We had a tough stretch. We still have three games left before the All-Star break. We need to continue. Nobody is going to help us. It's us, 12 guys here and the coaching staff. We have to figure out this thing. There's still a lot of games left, but like you said now they're getting closer and closer.""","400975552"
"CLEVELAND --  One second. One shot. One player. For one night, LeBron James made all of Cleveland's problems disappear. James dropped in a fade-away jumper over Jimmy Butler's outstretched hand as the buzzer sounded in overtime, giving the Cavaliers a cleansing 140-138 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night. Moments after blocking Butler's potential game-winning shot with 1.3 seconds left, James caught a long inbounds pass from Jeff Green, created some space from Butler near the foul line and sank a shot that ended Cleveland's eight-game losing streak on national television. ""Once I caught it, I just trusted everything I've done in my career,"" James said. The Quicken Loans Arena crowd erupted and James was mobbed by teammates as the struggling Cavs, who have won just seven of their last 20 games, finally had something to celebrate after weeks of tension and turmoil in a season slowly slipping away. But as he has done so many times, James delivered one of those moments that have defined him. ""The way we've been playing, we needed that,"" said Cavs coach Tyronn Lue, who was back on the bench after falling ill Tuesday night in Orlando. ""He was very special."" James finished with 37 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds in 48 minutes. The three-time NBA champion also passed Zydrunas Ilgauskas (5,904) on Cleveland's career rebounds list. Butler scored 35, and Karl-Anthony Towns had 30 for the Timberwolves, who were in position to win in OT before James came to Cleveland's rescue. With the score tied 138-all, Butler drove the left side and had a step on rookie Cedi Osman before pulling up for a short shot. However, James, who had missed a 3-pointer that would have won it in regulation, came from the weak side to reject it and set up the dramatic finish. ""I didn't see him,"" Butler said. ""That's part of the game."" The Cavs had lost their eight previous network broadcast appearances this season, prompting James to say last week following a lopsided loss to Houston that he and his teammates should be dropped from any more telecasts. Finally, they were primed for prime time. However, James wasn't ready to lift his self-imposed TV ban. ""It was a good win, but our record still stinks on national television,"" said James, who scored nine points and assisted on Cleveland's other basket in overtime. ""We've got a couple coming up, so we'll try to change that."" J.R. Smith added 20 points and Isaiah Thomas had 13 and seven assists in one of his best games in weeks. Towns made all six of his 3-point attempts and Minnesota drained a season-high 19 3-pointers, but the Timberwolves were unable to stop James when it mattered most. ""One second in the game, it's a tough play -- and he made a hell of a shot,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""You don't want to foul him, and I thought KAT (Towns) had great pressure on the ball. LeBron was in command of the game offensively and handling the basketball. LeBron can read the game better than anyone in the league."" LONG-RANGE RECORD Cleveland made 21 3-pointers as the clubs combined to hit an NBA-record 40. The previous mark was 39 set by Golden State and Dallas on March 25, 2016. REBOUND RECORD In passing Ilgauskas, James is now Cleveland's leader in points, rebounds and assists. He joins Michael Jordan and Kevin Garnett as the only players to lead their respective franchises in all three categories. ""Jordan and KG, so it's a pretty cool thing,"" James said. ""I'm blessed and I've been fortunate enough to play this game at a high level for a long time."" TRADE TIME With the NBA trade deadline set for 3 p.m. Thursday, the Cavs are looking for a deal. The team has been hesitant to part with the first-round draft pick it acquired last summer in the Kyrie Irving trade, but Cleveland may have no choice in order to add a quality player capable of pushing the club back into title contention. SWEET HOME CHICAGO Butler will play in Chicago on Friday for the first time since being traded to Minnesota in June. He was the Bulls' first-round draft pick in 2011 and played six seasons in Chicago. TIP-INS Timberwolves: Andrew Wiggins reached 6,000 career points. At 22 years, 349 days, he's the sixth-youngest player to reach the plateau. James is the youngest at 21 years, 89 days. ... Thibodeau has been impressed with Wiggins' development. ""He's more of a complete player now,"" he said. ""The impact that he's having on winning. We've seen he's a gifted scorer, he's shown that throughout his career, but now he's doing other things -- the defense, the passing, the hustle plays."" ... Thibodeau and Lue go back to their days on Doc Rivers' staff in Boston. Thibodeau understands the mental and physical grind for coaches, and expressed concern about Lue's well-being. ""I hope Ty's taking care of himself,"" he said. ""That's the most important thing is his health. He's a great guy, he's done a great job here. So always concerned about that."" Cavaliers: Dwyane Wade sat out as he continues to rest on the second night of back-to-backs. The 36-year-old played 22 minutes at Orlando. ... G Iman Shumpert, who has been linked to some trade possibilities, sat out with left plantar fasciitis. ... Lue dismissed a comment made by Thomas after the loss to the Magic that one of the Cavs' biggest issues is that they don't make enough in-game adjustments. ""That's not true,"" Lue said. ... Thomas turned 29 on Wednesday.","400975553"
"MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  The Utah Jazz ended their four-game road trip undefeated, though the final victory was much different than the others. The Jazz offense, which had been running smoothly, struggled a bit Wednesday night but still did enough to produce a 92-88 win over the Memphis Grizzlies that marked Utah's seventh straight victory. Over the previous six games in the streak, Utah was averaging almost 118 points and converting just under 52 percent of its shots from the field. Utah didn't maintain that pace against Memphis, however, as the Jazz closed out the road trip shooting 42 percent from the field, going 6 of 22 from outside the arc and committing 20 turnovers. ""I thought we looked a little fatigued and sometimes that shows itself on offense,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Really, we were able to play through that and still defend. That's what won us the game."" Ricky Rubio had 29 points and eight rebounds to lead Utah, while Rodney Hood scored 18. The Jazz never trailed, and they still held an 11-point lead early in the fourth. Memphis did cut it to 80-74 midway through the period, but Utah never let Memphis get any closer until Mario Chalmers made a 3-pointer as the horn sounded for the final margin. ""We were playing pretty well offensively throughout this win streak and (Wednesday) was a grind,"" Hood said. ""They created some turnovers, but we gutted it out and made plays, hit free throws down the stretch and we got stops when we needed to."" Andrew Harrison led the Grizzlies with a career-high 23 points, and Marc Gasol scored 20. JaMychal Green and Dillon Brooks added 11 apiece. Memphis lost its fifth straight as it continues to spiral toward the draft lottery. ""The most important thing for us is that we continue to fight no matter what,"" interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""And we recognize the odds, right? But our guys don't lay down. They continue to fight for one another."" Meanwhile, the Jazz just want to build on the success they've enjoyed over the last couple of weeks. ""We've got seven in a row, but we want more,"" Rubio said. TIP-INS Jazz: Royce O'Neal, the rookie from Baylor, missed his first 3-pointer, ending a streak of converting five straight from outside the arc over the past two games. ... Rubio had his 36th game in double figures. He is averaging 27.7 points per game over his last three. ... Rudy Gobert had 12 rebounds and two blocks. Grizzlies: Memphis snapped a string of nine straight games allowing at least 100 points. ... Memphis held Utah under 100 points for the 27th straight meeting between the teams. ... Harrison's previous career high was 21 points at Toronto on Nov. 30, 2016. ... Gasol had three blocks and five assists. EARLY DEPARTURES Bickerstaff was ejected in the fourth quarter after drawing his second technical foul -- both courtesy of official Marc Davis in the final period. ""I think it was more one-sided than it was me and Marc Davis,"" Bickerstaff said of the exchange. Bickerstaff got his first technical with 9:19 to go, then was tossed less than two minutes later. He said he was simply telling Harrison to ignore talking to Davis and ""go play."" ""That's a technical foul, apparently,"" the Memphis coach said. Davis also ejected Brooks in the closing seconds. RUBIO ROLLING Rubio is averaging 21.1 points this season and has played particularly well during the winning streak. He has scored at least 20 points four times during the streak. ""The thing I like to see with Ricky is I think that he's really dug into some of the things tangibly that he can work on as a player,"" Snyder said. ""He's gotten more comfortable leading the team, and I think you see that. The focus for him that we've talked about is just be solid, run the team offensively, and help think for your teammates.""","400975554"
"PHOENIX --  The San Antonio Spurs opened their long, annual ""rodeo road trip"" with one of the biggest routs in the team's history. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 23 points in 28 minutes and the San Antonio Spurs demolished Phoenix 129-81 on Wednesday night. The 48-point blowout matched the most one-sided loss in Suns history -- set against Portland in this season's opener -- and was the third-largest margin of victory for San Antonio. Only a 51-point Spurs win at Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2015, and a 49-point blowout of Vancouver on Nov. 5, 1995 were bigger. ""We made shots,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ""You make shots, things get easy."" Patty Mills added 18 points and Danny Green 17 for the Spurs. Dejounte Murray scored 14 before leaving with a sprained ankle in the second quarter. Alex Len scored 14 for the Suns, who shot 34 percent from the field and were 3-of-32 on 3-pointers. ""I think it was an embarrassment for all of us out here tonight,"" veteran Jared Dudley said. ""I think the fans definitely earned an apology for the display. It's definitely unexcusable."" But Popovich thought the Suns did have some mitigating factors. ""Suns' didn't have all their bodies,"" he said. ""You got to have your bodies at this level or it is tough. To have the guys that they have out really hurts."" Phoenix was without leading scorer Devin Booker for the second game in a row due to a hip pointer. Center Tyson Chandler missed the game with a sore neck and Tyler Ulis left with back spasms in the first half. ""We are, I think, obviously undermanned and they just walked all over us,"" Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. ""They're a veteran team, they play well and we had no answer."" The Spurs never trailed against a Suns team that has lost four straight and nine of 10. Phoenix's 38 losses are the most in the NBA. San Antonio dominated from the opening tip and led 69-31 at the half. The 38-point margin was the largest halftime lead for the Spurs against a team in their history. Phoenix never got any closer than 36 points in the second half and trailed by as many as 53 in the fourth quarter. The Suns averted a 50-point loss with Danuel House's dunk on a fastbreak lob pass with six seconds to play. ""Guys made shots, the ball moved and guys competed on defense,"" Aldridge said, ""so hopefully it will carry over."" The level of competition will go up in a hurry. The Spurs play at Golden State Saturday night. TIP-INS Spurs: The ""rodeo road trip"" occurs when the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo takes over the AT&amp;T Center. ... San Antonio swept the season series with Phoenix 4-0 and has won 13 of the last 14 meetings. ... Spurs won't play at home again until Feb. 28 (against New Orleans). ...

"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Orlando Magic hadn't won three games in a row since the second week of the season, so there was reason to celebrate even after an ugly victory. Evan Fournier scored 22 points, including eight straight for the Magic late in the final period, and Orlando held on for a 100-98 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night. D.J. Augustin, who took over as the Magic's starting point guard after Elfrid Payton was traded earlier in the day, had 16 points and nine assists. Marreese Speights added 14 points and Jonathon Simmons had 13 for the Magic, who won despite shooting only 43 percent for the game. ""The players and coaches are starting to show some faith in each other and that's helping us get through some rough times like we had tonight,"" said Speights, who hit four 3-pointers off the bench. ""Now, we've got to enjoy the feeling of winning and want that feeling all the time so we can push this streak further."" It didn't appear the Magic would get there for most of the game. They scored in very short spurts and played long shaky stretches, including the final 5:20 of the first half without scoring at all. ""We just never could find a rhythm the whole game, but we had some guys step up make plays down the stretch to get us a win,"" Fournier said. Fournier and Augustin were those guys. The Hawks and Magic exchanged the lead seven times in the fourth quarter until Fournier started the decisive run with a three-point play, followed that with a 3-pointer, then drained a 15-foot jumper to make it 94-89 with 57 seconds left in the game. Augustin, who started seven games this season when Payton was injured, added four free throws and Simmons hit two to provide enough of a cushion for Orlando to survive three 3-pointers from Atlanta in the final 37 seconds. ""I think I did my part to help the team get a win,"" Augustin said. ""When you get opportunities to play more minutes, obviously you have a chance to do better."" Taurean Prince and Dennis Schroder led Atlanta with 19 points apiece. Tyler Dorsey and Malcolm Delaney each added 11 points for the Hawks, who were trying for their first three-game win streak of the season. The Hawks had a chance to tie the game at 98 after a Magic turnover with 22 seconds to play, but Dewayne Dedmon, who hit two 3-pointers earlier, missed. ""We got a lot of stops and gave ourselves a chance to win,"" said Prince, who scored 14 of his 19 in the final period, including a 3-pointer as the buzzer sounded. ""These are the kind of games you want to be in. We just needed to make one more shot."" TIP INS HAWKS: John Collins had nine points and 12 rebounds off the bench. . Atlanta shot only 28.3 percent in the first half, but still managed a 39-39 tie. . Schroder was the only player on either team to reach double figures in the first half. He had 12. . Atlanta is second in the NBA in forced turnovers with 16 per game. MAGIC: PF Aaron Gordon (hip flexor) and C Nikola Vucevic (hand) could return from injuries for Saturday's game against Milwaukee. . Mario Hezonja had eight points and 10 rebounds. PAYTON TRADED TO CLEAR CAP SPACE Payton, who started 44 games in his fourth season with the Magic, was traded to Phoenix for a second-round draft pick to give the team more options this summer, according to president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman. ""We added a draft pick, we retained a little flexibility. That's what we got to today,"" Weltman said. ""We need those to have a little wiggle room and creativity to assemble a roster. We were concerned about what this summer would look like with free agency, with locking ourselves in financially . . . the alternative could possibly have been that we lose Elfrid for nothing.""","400975557"
"TORONTO --  The short-handed New York Knicks became the latest victims of Toronto's blossoming bench. Jonas Valanciunas had 18 points and 10 rebounds, Pascal Siakam added 14 points and a career-high six assists and the Raptors beat New York 113-88 on Thursday night. New York played its first game since losing All-Star forward Kristaps Porzingis to a torn left ACL in Tuesday's loss to Milwaukee. ""We've had a lot happen within the last 24 to 48 hours,"" New York guard Jarrett Jack said. ""Guys are still rallying around each other, still trying to come out and play hard and compete, regardless of whatever the circumstances are."" Serge Ibaka and Jakob Poeltl scored 13 points, Delon Wright and C.J. Miles each had 11 and Fred VanVleet 10 as the Raptors won their fifth straight home meeting with the Knicks. The Raptors have won four straight and six of seven. Toronto is an NBA-best 23-4 at home. Toronto won despite poor shooting performances from All-Star guards DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. DeRozan shot 2 for 11 and scored eight points, while Lowry shot 2 for 8 and finished with seven. ""The bench has been great,"" DeRozan said. ""We know how hard they work."" The Raptors outscored the Knicks 61-35 in bench points. Toronto coach Dwane Casey praised his second unit for its unselfishness. ""There's no hidden agendas,"" Casey said. ""They're playing with a pure heart and they don't care who scores. When you play that way, good things are going to happen."" Toronto's starters got the fourth quarter off for the third straight game as the bench closed it out. ""It's really good. We're giving our old guys a little rest,"" Poeltl joked. Five Raptors bench players scored in double figures. ""Their second group is a really good group,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said.

"After his former team overhauled the roster at the trade deadline, Kyrie Irving has little to say when asked about what the Cavs did. (0:14) WASHINGTON --  Two days after Boston lost to the team chasing the Celtics atop the Eastern Conference standings, guard Kyrie Irving wasn't about to let his team suffer another defeat. Irving scored 12 of Boston's last 17 points and finished with 28 to help the Celtics remain in sole possession of the East lead with a 110-104 overtime victory over the Washington Wizards on Thursday night. ""Every game for us is a learning experience, and it's almost like a `must-win,"" Irving said after his second game back from a thigh injury. ""Just based on the amount of expectations and what we put on ourselves and one another on a game-to-game basis."" Jaylen Brown added five of his 18 points in overtime for Boston. The Celtics have won five of six, and remained a game ahead of Toronto in the race for the East's top playoff seed after the Raptors' win over New York earlier Thursday. The Raptors beat the Celtics 111-91 in Toronto on Tuesday. Otto Porter had 27 points and 11 rebounds for Washington, and Bradley Beal had 18 points and matched his career high with nine assists. But as John Wall remains sidelined following knee surgery, the Wizards committed 22 turnovers and shot just 2 for 12 in the overtime period, dropping their second straight game after winning five straight. Beal, who shot just 7 of 27 and took only one foul shot, suggested officiating played a role. ""It's crazy,"" he said of his lack of free throws. ""Because I feel like I'm being just as aggressive as everybody else out there. My teammates are doing the same. Sometimes we don't get rewarded."" Meanwhile, Irving went 9 of 10 from the foul line. And after Boston allowed Washington to come back from a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit, he tied it from the line with 9.8 seconds remaining in regulation on three made foul shots after luring Markieff Morris into a foul on a 3-point attempt. ""Nowhere near a foul,"" Morris said. ""(The referee) was behind me. I don't know how could see me swiping down on the ball and me hitting his arm. If I hit his arm, there's no way he would get the shot up."" Said Irving: ""I just don't want to get into the whole `whether it was a foul or not.' I don't want to get fined."" That was part of 10 straight points for Irving before finding Brown for a layup that made it 105-103 with 2:32 left in overtime. Brown stretched the lead to five when he hit a contested baseline 3-pointer less than a minute later, and the Wizards missed their last five shots. TIP-INS Celtics: Signed and activated free agent C Greg Monroe, but did not make a trade at the NBA trade deadline. ... Coach Brad Stevens wasn't surprised. ""It was probably the least amount of time that I was paying attention to it or on the phone over these days in five years,"" he said. ... Monroe was one of three Celtics players to receive a technical foul in separate incidents, along with F Marcus Morris and G Terry Rozier Wizards: Traded G/F Sheldon Mac to the Atlanta Hawks for a 2019 second-round pick in a move coach Scott Brooks said gave Washington the flexibility to sign one or two players. ""We're definitely looking,"" Brooks said. ...  Mac (torn Achilles), who was then waived by Atlanta, has not played this season. ... F Kelly Oubre received a technical foul in the fourth quarter. NOT TAKING THE BAIT Although the Wizards won their first five games after losing G John Wall to knee surgery, Brooks denied the notion his absence has been a positive. ""He knows how I feel about him,"" Brooks said. ""He knows how the organization, his teammates feel about him. And for anyone to think that we're not better with John, that's for clickbait."" ALMOST LOUISIANA'S MONROE After reaching a buyout agreement with Phoenix, Louisiana native Monroe said he also considered signing with the New Orleans Pelicans after they lost C DeMarcus Cousins to a torn Achilles in January. ""They obviously had a need there at my position,"" Monroe said. ""It's home for me. So it was definitely a tough decision. But it was hard to resist here.""","400975559"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  This win didn't necessarily have the Trail Blazers celebrating. Jusuf Nurkic had 24 points and 14 rebounds, and Portland returned home with a 109-103 overtime victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Thursday night. But the Blazers didn't make it easy on themselves. Afterward, coach Terry Stotts was blunt in his assessment. ""He just came in and told us that when we build a lead we can't make the game that hard on ourselves. We've got to be better,"" said Damian Lillard, who had 18 points and eight rebounds. ""In the fourth quarter we had a 14 or 15-point lead. I thought we played hard but we had a little bit of a letup and they felt they could get in there and get a run and we end up in overtime."" CJ McCollum added 22 points for the Blazers, who were coming off a winless three-game trip. The victory over the Hornets was their ninth straight at Moda Center. Kemba Walker, who was named an All-Star reserve earlier in the day, scored 40 points for Charlotte. Marvin Williams, who returned after missing four games with a left ankle sprain, finished with 10. ""The shots just didn't fall. Theirs did and they made some tough ones,"" Walker said. ""In the end we just couldn't get the basket when we needed to."" Portland pulled ahead 102-100 in the extra period before Dwight Howard fouled McCollum on a 3-point attempt. McCollum made two of three to extend Portland's lead, and Maurice Harkless dunked with 37.4 seconds left to make it 106-100. Walker hit a 3-pointer before McCollum's layup on the other end all but sealed it with 12.2 seconds left. After trailing 79-65 heading into the final quarter, Walker's layup got Charlotte within 92-88 with just over five minutes left. Walker pulled the Hornets closer with a pair of baskets that tied it at 95. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist's pull-up jumper tied it at 97 with 1:45 to go, and neither team could score the rest of the way in regulation. ""I think we played great for three quarters. I don't know, maybe mental things in the fourth,"" Nurkic said. ""But every win is a win."" At the trade deadline earlier in the day, the Blazers sent forward Noah Vonleh to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the rights to center Milovan Rakovic. Vonleh, the No. 9 overall pick by Charlotte in the 2014 draft, averaged 3.6 points and 5.1 rebounds in 33 games for the Blazers this season, including 12 starts. The Hornets made a move the day earlier, acquiring center Willy Hernangomez from the Knicks in exchange for Johnny O'Bryant and two future second-round draft picks. Hernangomez averaged 7.1 points and 5.8 rebounds in 98 career games with the Knicks, including 22 starts. Hernangomez was not yet with the Hornets and it was likely he would not be available for Friday night's game in Utah. ""I'm glad it's over,"" Stotts said about the deadline. ""We've been getting ready for Charlotte. It really hasn't impacted what we've done over the last few days. Certainly (GM Neil Olshey) and his staff have spent a lot of time, hours on the phone, in leading up to this. It's probably more of a relief for the players because it is a stressful time."" Portland jumped out to a 22-5 lead early, and went into the second quarter up 29-18, led by Nurkic with 10 points and five rebounds. Charlotte got within 44-42 on a pair of free throws and a 3-pointer from Walker, but trailed 49-45 at the half after Meyers Leonard hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Walker finished the half with 17 points, including 15 in the second quarter. Portland stretched the lead to 75-61 on a long jumper from Lillard in the third quarter, and the Blazers kept the margin at double digits into the fourth until Charlotte's late run. TIP-INS Hornets: Earlier in the day, Walker was selected as an All-Star reserve by Commissioner Adam Silver, replacing the injured Kristaps Porzingis. ""It's surreal. It's my second one. I'm just very fortunate, very blessed,"" Walker said. Trail Blazers: The Blazers were thought to be considering a big move at the trade deadline, but Olshey, their president of basketball operations, told the team's broadcasters: ""We looked into the rental market and as it turned out, a lot of the things on the rumor mill weren't true. Those guys just weren't available."" ... Maurice Harkless started for the Blazers at small forward. CONDOLENCES The Blazers were stunned by traffic collision in Houston that claimed the life of R.J. Adelman, the son of former Blazers coach Rick Adelman. R.J. Adelman had been an assistant on his father's staff when the elder Adelman coached the Houston Rockets from 2007-11. He also was player personnel director for the Minnesota Timberwolves when his father coached there. ""I would like to send out my sincere condolences to coach Adelman and his family for the tragedy of losing their son. Obviously it took everybody by surprise and certainly it's an emotional day,"" Stotts said.","400975560"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  For a half, the defending champs looked like their old dazzling selves. That was enough to beat Dallas. The Warriors are looking for much more from themselves. Stephen Curry had 20 points, eight assists and seven rebounds, and Golden State bounced back from a tough stretch to top the Mavericks 121-103 on Thursday night. Kevin Durant added 24 points, nine rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots while Draymond Green put up another impressive line: 12 points, 10 rebounds, six assists, two blocks and two steals. Dallas star Dirk Nowitzki had 16 points, 11 rebounds, season-high five steals and two blocks, while rookie Dennis Smith Jr. scored 22 points. Curry's pretty three-point play with 1:28 left in the third put the Warriors up 88-83, and once Golden State got going in transition the Mavericks couldn't keep up in what became a dunk fest. The Warriors began the fourth on a 14-5 tear. ""They strung together a couple of stops, got some easy fast-break points,"" Smith said. ""They took the momentum and kept it from that point on."" Despite another slow start, Golden State eventually found its groove and delivered all the big plays when it mattered. ""We fought through that first half, that malaise, whatever you want to call it and ultimately got it going,"" coach Steve Kerr said. The Warriors had dropped three of four, including their worst defeat at home in Tuesday's 125-105 loss to the Thunder. Klay Thompson added 18 points, five rebounds and four assists on his 28th birthday. Durant dunked in transition on back-to-back possessions late in the second quarter, one off a steal he made, and Andre Iguodala also had a slam as the Warriors sent the game to halftime tied at 60. David West contributed 10 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in nearly 17 minutes for Golden State, which earned a 10th straight victory in the series. ""We just had to provide some stability,"" West said. ""That's what we've been talking about with the second unit."" GREEN'S FINE AND FRONT TOOTH Green was fined $50,000 by the NBA for directing inappropriate and offensive language toward an official during the Oklahoma City loss. Green was ejected with 8:13 remaining after a second technical for arguing with the officials, specifically female referee Lauren Holtkamp. The NBA said the specific incident for which he was penalized occurred in the second quarter. On Thursday night, Green got hit with his 14th technical of the season -- two away from an automatic suspension -- in the second quarter for arguing after a delay of game warning. ""I have no idea what will happen,"" Kerr said. ""We know our whole team has been too emotional, too demonstrative. We're going to be under the microscope, we've got to be ready for that."" Green will wear clear braces for a couple of weeks after his front right tooth was knocked back in a collision during Tuesday's loss. Green said dentists will monitor his tooth. ""It hasn't died. Hopefully it stays alive,"" he said. TIP-INS Mavericks: Dallas signed guard Kyle Collinsworth for the rest of the season. He previously had a pair of 10-day contracts. ""I'm very happy to have him back,"" coach Rick Carlisle said. ""He's done some very good things since he's been with us. He's earned this opportunity. So, I'm happy for him. And I'm sure all of our guys are."" ... F Harrison Barnes missed facing his former team as he sat out a second straight game with a sprained left ankle. ... The Mavericks were swept 4-0 in the season series. Warriors: In the first, Curry passed Sacramento's Vince Carter (2,082) for sole possession of seventh place on the NBA's all-time list for made 3-pointers. ...

"Playing without Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony, Paul George can't do enough and the Thunder fall to the Lakers 106-81. Los Angeles improves to 12-4 since January 7. (1:08) LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Lakers spent the morning giving themselves the financial flexibility to sign two free agents to max deals. When the day was over, a win by their largest margin this season showed they have more to sell than cap space. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 20 points, and the balanced Lakers defeated the short-handed Oklahoma City Thunder 106-81 on Thursday night. Brandon Ingram added 19 points, Julius Randle scored 17 and Kyle Kuzma had 16 for the Lakers, who won their fourth straight. Los Angeles is 12-4 in its last 16 games, including eight in a row at home. ""We have a core of guys that if we all stick together and grow can be really special,"" Kuzma said. ""If we can add two more players to that, then I don't know what can happen."" Lakers coach Luke Walton wasn't sure how the team would respond after the Lakers traded Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye and a 2018 first-round pick earlier in the day. After a slow start, Walton got his answer. The Lakers closed the first quarter on a 22-8 run and turned an 11-point deficit into a lead they would not relinquish at 30-27 on a three-point play by Randle with 3.8 seconds left. ""I didn't know how long it would take, but the energy before the game was already much better. I was curious to see how long it would take and if our guys would be able to perform after two of their teammates got traded away and, obviously, they did a nice job,"" Walton said. After knocking off the Thunder 108-104 in Oklahoma City on Sunday, the Lakers breezed to a lead as large as 27 points in the fourth quarter. Rookie Josh Hart had 10 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Paul George scored 29 points for the Thunder, who played without Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony as each was hampered by a sprained ankle. Steven Adams had 13 points and nine rebounds as the Thunder lost for the fifth time in six games. George started strong with 12 points in the opening 6:52, hitting his first five shots including three 3-pointers. He had 22 points at the break, making 8 of 14 shots from the field and 4 of 6 from the 3-point line, while the rest of the Oklahoma City lineup shot 27 percent (10 of 37). ""With as difficult as it was to put the ball in the basket, we kept trying to battle and fight defensively and did some good things,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""We just didn't make enough shots at the end of the day to make it competitive."" TIP-INS Thunder: Raymond Felton had seven points, five rebounds and three assists as he took Westbrook's place in the starting lineup. Patrick Patterson, who replaced Anthony, was scoreless in 26 minutes. Jerami Grant and Alex Abrines each scored eight points. Lakers: G Lonzo Ball (left knee) missed his 12th straight game. CLEARING THE DECKS With Thomas and Frye on expiring contracts, the Lakers now have a path to add two marquee players in free agency this summer or in 2019. Their fans made it clear who they would like to see join the team, giving George a loud ovation when he was introduced. Kuzma declined to say if he tried to sell George on joining the Lakers during the game. ""I don't think we need any more fines,"" Kuzma said with a laugh, referencing the $50,000 tampering fine the Lakers received for Magic Johnson's praise of Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo. NO TIME FOR I.T. DEPARTMENT Walton was so caught up in preparing for the Thunder that he had yet to begin figuring out how Thomas might fit in with the surging young roster. Walton hadn't even spoken to Thomas, as the two traded voicemails in an attempt to reach one another. ""If there was no game today, then, yeah, most of today would have been spent watching film on him and calling people that I know around the league that may either have played with him or coached him and coming up with game plans,"" Walton said.","400975562"
"DETROIT -- Blake Griffin's unbeaten run in Detroit ended with a thud -- against the team that traded him. Lou Williams scored 26 points and the Los Angeles Clippers handed Griffin his first loss with the Pistons, beating Detroit 108-95 on Friday night. The Pistons had won five in a row, with Griffin playing in four of those games, but the Clippers still look OK after trading the star forward to Detroit last week. ""We didn't, obviously, play the way we wanted to. I didn't play the way I wanted to,"" Griffin said. ""But that's the NBA. We had a good five-game run, and we'll get back to work tomorrow."" It was a bit of an off night for Griffin, who scored 19 points but shot 7-of-19 from the field. The whole Detroit team faded down the stretch. The Pistons led 80-77 after three quarters but scored only 15 points in the fourth. Tobias Harris scored 12 points and Avery Bradley had 10. They were the key players the Clippers acquired in the deal that sent Griffin to Detroit. Austin Rivers scored 16 points for Los Angeles in his first game back from a right ankle injury. The Clippers have won 11-of-15 and are 3-1 since trading Griffin. Bradley and especially Harris received ovations from the Detroit crowd when they were introduced in the starting lineup, but when the teams came out for the opening tip, there wasn't anything too unusual in terms of pregame greetings. In fact, Griffin and Bradley were hit with simultaneous technical fouls in the first quarter after battling for rebounding position. There were five technicals in the game. ""It's an important game for both teams. So, you'll see a lot of that the rest of the season probably because it's playoff run for everybody,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""I didn't think it was that much stuff with Blake and our guys. I thought both teams wanted to win the game."" After the game, Griffin headed straight toward the locker room and did not stick around to commiserate on the court. The highlight of his night was probably when he blocked Montrezl Harrell's dunk attempt in the second half. ""Obviously, he played with a lot of emotion tonight, and rightfully so,"" Austin Rivers said. ""I think anybody can understand, when you play against your old team, that's what everybody does -- let alone, a week after it happens, and obviously, the way everything happened. So it was weird playing against him."" BACK IN TOWN Harris and Bradley were still featured among the vertical banners attached to the outside of the arena in Detroit. It may have felt odd being back so soon after the trade, but they were on the winning team. ""It's like seeing your ex-girlfriend for the first time, with her new man. You've got a new girl, so ..."" Harris said. ""A lot was put into, obviously, the trade, this game, so we wanted to come out and handle business."" BIG MEN Andre Drummond of the Pistons and DeAndre Jordan of the Clippers came into the game ranked 1-2 in the NBA in rebounding. They matched each other with 17 rebounds apiece, but Los Angeles had a 57-40 advantage as a team. ""The most disappointing thing was there is no way we should get outrebounded by 17,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""That just shouldn't happen."" TIP-INS Clippers: G Milos Teodosic (right foot) missed the game. ... Austin Rivers had missed the previous 18 games but was solid in his return, shooting 7-of-13 from the field. Pistons: Jameer Nelson and James Ennis, who were acquired in trades Thursday, did not play. Ennis was not able to make it to Detroit because of snowy weather in Michigan. ... Reggie Bullock, another ex-Clipper, scored 19 points. He was drafted by Los Angeles in 2013 and played 68 games for the Clippers.","400975563"
"PHILADELPHIA --  The Philadelphia 76ers once again built a big lead. This time they held it with no drama. Joel Embiid scored 24 points and grabbed 16 rebounds, and Dario Saric had 24 points and four 3s as the Sixers rolled 100-82 over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. ""Defensively we were amazing,"" Embiid said. ""Offensively we moved the ball, but I think it started on the defensive end."" A game-time decision with a sore ankle, Embiid hit his first six shots from the floor and scored 16 points in the first quarter, two more than the Pelicans, as the Sixers led by 18 after a quarter. Embiid recorded his 27th double-double of the season by halftime, with 20 points on 9-for-11 shooting and 10 rebounds. He now has a double-double in seven straight games, matching his season high. Embiid's one block made an impact. Nikola Mirotic drove in for what looked like a layup at the first-half buzzer, but Embiid swatted it away as the horn sounded with the Sixers up 56-41. Philadelphia then poured it on in the third, scoring the final 14 points of the quarter to outscore the uninspired Pelicans 28-11 and extend the lead to 32. ""So much of everything we did was generated through our defense,"" Sixers head coach Brett Brown said. Defense allowed Philadelphia to build the lead, and ball security was the key to keeping it. The Sixers, who have made a habit of relinquishing large leads this season, had just one turnover in the third quarter. They were able to rest their starters in the fourth when the lead ballooned to 35. ""When we can guard like we guard, and we do it well most nights, and can just get a shot, as simple as that sounds, then you have a really good chance to maintain a lead,"" Brown said. Anthony Davis led New Orleans with 14 points on 6-for-19 shooting. The Pelicans at times appeared apathetic but shouldn't have been fatigued. They hadn't played since Monday after Wednesday's home game against Indiana was postponed because of a leaky roof at the Smoothie King Center. ""I didn't think we started the game with the intensity level we were going to have to if we were going to play against this team,"" Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry said. ""We just offensively didn't have any kind of flow or any kind of rhythm."" EMBIID'S STATUS Embiid wasn't sure if he would play Saturday night against the Los Angeles Clippers. ""We're going to see how the ankle feels. It was pretty painful today,"" said Embiid, who wasn't sure how he hurt it. ""Especially when I've been allowed to play back-to-backs, I really want to push through and play."" Embiid played in back-to-back games for the first time in his career last Friday and Saturday. SORRY BEN Brown knew Ben Simmons was approaching a triple-double but decided it wasn't worth the risk to play his star rookie in the fourth quarter. ""It's not how I'm wired,"" Brown said. Simmons finished with 10 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in 25 minutes. FULTZ UPDATE Markelle Fultz, the top overall pick in last year's NBA draft, may not play again this season as he deals with a right shoulder injury and works on his shot. ""There's always a chance that he's going to be out there soon, and there's a chance that he's not going to play this year,"" Sixers president of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo said Friday morning. TIP-INS Pelicans: Signed Monday after having signed two 10-day contracts last month, point guard DeAndre Liggins made his first start of the season, taking Rajon Rondo's spot. Alvin Gentry said the hope was to lessen the workload on Jrue Holiday and allow Rondo to spark the second unit, which has struggled without injured big man DeMarcus Cousins. The experiment didn't last long. Liggins played six minutes in the first quarter. He failed to score in 19 minutes. Gentry wasn't sure if Liggins would start Saturday against the Nets. New Orleans has lost five of six since Cousins was lost for the season with an injured Achilles. 76ers: Philadelphia in the first quarter held New Orleans to five field goals and forced six turnovers.

"ATLANTA -- With six players traded away and four newcomers not yet cleared for duty, the Cleveland Cavaliers were left with a lean, tight rotation. Fewer substitutions? That worked just fine for LeBron James and Kyle Korver. James had a triple-double and Korver scored a season-high 30 points, including four straight 3-pointers to close the third period, as the crisp Cavaliers beat the Atlanta Hawks 123-107 on Friday night for a successful start to their reboot. ""It felt like we played together,"" said James, who had 22 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high 19 assists in 41 minutes. ""Offensively and defensively the communication was really high. The ball was moving around. The ball was popping and everybody felt like they were in a good rhythm."" One day after unloading six players, including guards Isaiah Thomas and Dwyane Wade, in three trades, the Cavaliers were in a state of transition. They used 10 players, including two who were on the floor for about one minute. Korver, 36, more than made up for a short bench. The former Hawks fan favorite made 7 of 13 from 3-point range and finished two points from matching his career high of 32. ""Man, the ball was moving tonight,"" Korver said. ""I don't know the last time I shot that many shots in a game."" Korver played in Atlanta from 2012-17. ""I think it's always fun for him to come back and play,"" James said. ""He spent a lot of seasons here. ... I know it was a good feeling for him to do what he did tonight."" Jeff Green, also coming off the bench, had 24 points. Newcomers George Hill, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. and Rodney Hood joined the Cavs, but remained in the locker room during the game. They are expected to make their debuts with Cleveland on Sunday in Boston. The team sent medical staff to Atlanta to complete physicals with the four players as quickly as possible. Dennis Schroder led Atlanta with 25 points. Taurean Prince had 15 points. TIP-INS Cavaliers: Cedi Osman, making his first start, had 16 points but struggled at the free-throw line. He made only two of seven free throws, twice missing each of two attempts. ... London Perrantes and John Holland played limited roles to add depth to the temporarily short-handed roster. ... The Cavs had 31 assists and only nine turnovers. Hawks: Coach Mike Budenholzer says one reason the team bought out Marco Belinelli's was to give younger players, including rookie Tyler Dorsey, more playing time. Dorsey had 14 points and made three 3-pointers. The move with Belinelli, 31, was announced before the game. ... G DeAndre Bembry posted bond and was with the team following his arrest early Friday for speeding on an Atlanta interstate. He was clocked driving a purple Dodge Charger at 128 mph on Interstate 85 about 12:20 a.m. Bembry, who has a left abductor strain, has not played since Dec. 22. PARADE OF 3s Cleveland led 83-80 late in the third period when James scored and was fouled by John Collins. James' momentum carried him into a section of fans under the basket, and he was limping when he emerged. He made the free throw, remained in the game and then had assists on back-to-back 3s by Korver for a 91-80 lead. ""It was my fault; I lost him,"" Schroder said of Korver. ""From there on, it went down."" Korver made a third straight 3-pointer following a timeout to stretch the lead to 14 points. Following a basket by Atlanta's Malcolm Delaney, Korver added his fourth 3 of the period, a buzzer-beater. ""I had a lot of really good years here,"" Korver said. ""... But it wasn't really added fuel.""

"BOSTON --  Despite blowing a 26-point lead, the Indiana Pacers regained their composure in time to beat the Boston Celtics. Victor Oladipo scored 35 and helped steady the Pacers as they recovered from a late stumble and held off the Celtics 97-91 on Friday night. ""We did a great job of just calming down, especially when they took the lead. We just did a great job of making stops down the stretch,"" Oladipo said. The Pacers, who got an unexpected night off Wednesday when their game at New Orleans was postponed because of a leaky arena roof, were way fresher at the start and just enough so down the stretch to beat the Celtics, who were coming off an overtime win at Washington the night before. Myles Turner scored 19 and the Pacers got 13 points each from Bojan Bogdanovic and Thaddeus Young while ending a five-game losing streak against the Celtics, who could not sustain a furious comeback in the second half. ""We had no reason to be in that game,"" said Kyrie Irving, who led Boston with 21 points. ""We fought back. We battled back but they came out and just really hit us in the mouth in the first half."" Jaylen Brown added 16 points and Al Horford scored all 10 of his points in the second half and pulled down eight rebounds for the Celtics. Boston had won five of six, but struggled from outside most of the night and finished 7 for 27 from 3-point range. Indiana also outscored Boston in the paint 42-38 and outrebounded the Celtics 53-38. Young led the Pacers with 14 rebounds and Oladipo pulled down 10. ""Victor was good but it was a team effort. A lot of guys did some good things tonight,"" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ""This is part of the growth with our group."" Boston stumbled through the first half, falling behind by nearly four touchdowns and getting booed loudly by the home fans. The Celtics rallied in the third quarter, outscoring Indiana 34-17, but could not hold off the Pacers in the final few minutes. ""We just did a great job of making stops down the stretch. They're a great team,"" said Oladipo, who also had five steals. ""That was a good win for us."" After Boston pulled within 76-72 entering the fourth, Indiana clung to the lead until Horford's 3-pointer with 4:45 left put Boston up 83-82, the first time in the game the Celtics led. Oladipo answered with a jumper to restore Indiana's lead, and then Irving put Boston back up with a pair of free throws. The back-and-forth ended there as Turner dunked in an offensive rebound to make it 86-85, Bogdanovic hit a free throw after a three-second violation and Oladipo drove for a pair of layups that put Indiana back up 91-85 with 1:37 left to play. SINCE WHEN? The Pacers last beat Boston on March 15, 2016, winning 103-98 at Indianapolis. Boston won the first two meetings this season and were swept in three games against the Celtics last season. ""It's big for us. A great game, a great win,"" Oladipo said. ""But it's only one game. There's a lot of season left. We can't get overzealous or overconfident."" EARLY STRUGGLES The Celtics were sluggish from the start, making just 6 of 26 shots in the first quarter and missing all six 3-point attempts. It didn't get much better in the second quarter and Boston couldn't keep up the pace after a torrid third quarter. Coach Brad Stevens said the loss had much more to do with his team's start than the finish. ""I thought we started the game really going through the motions and I thought they started the game really playing with great force and purpose,"" Stevens said. TIP-INS Pacers: Shot 61 percent (11 for 18) in the first quarter and led 30-16 entering the second period. ... The Pacers improved to 14-18 against teams with a winning record. ...

"Goran Dragic says Dwyane Wade brings an aura to the team and describes how Wade makes them better. Wade said, ""It's just that swag, I guess. I can wear night clothes in the day time. I am ready for whatever."" (0:58) MIAMI -- <U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD> A quiet night for Dwyane Wade on the stat sheet still produced plenty of loud moments in his first game back with the Heat. Wade received a standing ovation when he entered the game off the bench in the first quarter and the crowd roared when he came up with a key block late in the game. There were other moments throughout as Wade's mere presence got a rise out of Heat fans, and teammates Hassan Whiteside and Tyler Johnson led the way to a 91-85 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday that snapped a five-game losing streak and capped a celebratory night. ""It felt like a playoff game,"" Whiteside said. ""The fans were in an uproar. It felt like a playoff game and Miami was just rocking. It hadn't felt like that in a while here."" Wade scored three points on 1-of-6 shooting with two assists, one rebound, a key late block, and four turnovers in 22 minutes. He was acquired in a trade from Cleveland on Thursday. Wade played 13 seasons and won three NBA championships with the Heat before leaving for Chicago as a free agent in 2016. ""I would love to go 6 for 6, but I was just trying to get used to everything so I wasn't worried about that,"" Wade said. ""I was worried about getting the win. I felt like I did some positive things on the basketball floor and I felt like I did some negative things on the basketball floor, but I tried to make winning ways defensively and offensively when I got an opportunity and that's what it's all about. I'll definitely get better and I'll definitely score the ball more and all of those things at some point. Tonight I thought was a success because we got the W."" Even with the anxiety and excitement circulating the arena, Wade was relatively calm and free of nerves. ""I was telling Spo (coach Erik Spoelstra) after the game that I actually felt normal,"" Wade said. ""He said he felt a little weird seeing me on the bench to start the game, but I actually felt normal. Once the game starts, it becomes a game and you get into it."" Johnson scored 19 points and Whiteside scored 12 points and had 16 rebounds. Bam Adebayo added 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Josh Richardson chipped in 16 points for Miami, which received the jolt Wade hoped with his arrival. ""What a terrific day, the last 24 hours and then to culminate in a win like this after five straight losses, it's what our organization needed for the moment,"" Spoelstra said. ""Obviously it was special to have Dwyane back in uniform, back on our side in front of the home fans. It felt exactly the way it should. It felt normal. It felt like home. It felt like family. It felt all the things you came to expect with Dwyane."" All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo scored a game-high 23 points to lead the Bucks, who lost for just the second time in nine games under interim head coach Joe Prunty. ""It was a good atmosphere to play the game,"" Prunty said. ""You would expect that, something you would anticipate."" The Heat trailed 9-0 to start the game, with fans growing restless to see the return of the franchise's favorite son. They chanted, ""We want Wade!"" ""The chants kind of started a little too early,"" Wade laughed. ""I was like no, not right now, not right now."" Wade entered midway through the first quarter and received a standing ovation from the crowd. He immediately made an impact throwing a lob to Whiteside for a dunk on his first possession as the fans roared. Minutes later, Wade took his first shot, a 3 from the right wing, and drilled it bringing the crowd to its feet. ""This is kind of environment we've got to get used to playing in,"" Wade said. ""It was good. From start to finish the crowd was amazing. I definitely miss this crowd. I saw a lot of familiar faces."" There were other moments in the first half, too. A no-look alley-oop pass in transition to Johnson for a dunk and another lob to Whiteside for a dunk. ""It was exciting,"" Whiteside said. ""He's a Hall of Fame talent. His IQ is amazing so he knows when to look at the spots and knows when to throw it and make the right decisions."" Milwaukee was able to cut the deficit to 85-78 with 1:28 left. More ""We want Wade"" chants rang out in the closing minutes with Wade on the bench as the Bucks inched closer. Eric Bledsoe hit a 3 to pull the Bucks within 85-81. After a turnover by Richardson, Wade blocked a layup attempt by Bledsoe and Wayne Ellington drilled a 3 to help seal the victory. ""I got a chance to time it and it felt like old times,"" Wade said. TIP-INS Bucks: John Henson (hamstring) returned after a one-game absence. Henson was hit with a technical foul in the first quarter when he slammed the scorer's table in frustration. ...

"CHICAGO --  The warm reception, video tribute and dominant performance made Jimmy Butler's homecoming just about perfect. All that was missing was a win. Zach LaVine scored a season-high 35 points against his former team, and the Bulls spoiled Butler's return to Chicago with a 114-113 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. Butler scored 38 to finish one shy of a season high. But the Bulls rallied from 17 down to snap a seven-game losing streak. ""It was cool,"" Butler said. ""Everybody knows I've got a lot of love for this organization, this city, this fan base. Me and Taj (Gibson) talk about it all the time: This is where it started for both of us. It greats to see familiar faces."" LaVine came up big down the stretch while going at it with Butler, scoring Chicago's final 11 points. He nailed three free throws after getting fouled by Butler to put Chicago ahead with 18.4 seconds left. ""Jimmy's really a headstrong dude, an alpha,"" LaVine said. ""I'm not really gonna back down from anyone myself, either. I think that's just how the game played out."" Karl-Anthony Towns and Butler missed 3-pointers in the closing seconds, giving Minnesota another tight loss. Robin Lopez scored 19 for Chicago, which had six players in double figures. Butler and Gibson got standing ovations prior to their first game against the team that drafted them. There were more loud cheers following a video tribute in the first quarter, with both players standing and waving as the fans rose to their feet. And after the game, Bulls executive vice president of basketball operations John Paxson talked to them in the locker room. Butler wasn't happy that the Bulls dealt him. He even acknowledged Friday, ""I don't think time really heals it."" But he was glad Paxson came to see him after the game, saying, ""That's the guy Pax is."" And he had good things to say about the Bulls. ""I'm happy that they're doing well,"" Butler said. ""They deserve it. The city of Chicago definitely deserves it."" Butler delivered the sort of all-around performance Bulls fans grew accustomed to during his six seasons, before the draft night trade to Minnesota for LaVine, Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen. The four-time All-Star finished with seven rebounds and five assists. Andrew Wiggins scored 18 points, Towns added 14 points and 10 rebounds and Gibson scored 10 for the Timberwolves. But Minnesota blew a 17-point lead in the third quarter and came up short again after losing in overtime to Cleveland on Wednesday. ""We're not good enough to think that the game is over five minutes into the third quarter,"" coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""When you do that -- we messed around, we played with fire and we got burned."" DUNN UPDATE Dunn has had two days of contact in practice since being removed from the NBA's concussion protocol and the Bulls expect to have him at least practicing without limitations next week, coach Fred Hoiberg said. Dunn missed his ninth consecutive game and is not expected to play against Washington on Saturday. Asked if he has been ruled out for Monday's game against Orlando, Hoiberg said, ""Don't know yet."" TIP-INS Timberwolves: Thibodeau got called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter even though he was yelling at Towns, not an official. Bulls: The Bulls held out F Noah Vonleh after he was acquired from Portland before Thursday's trade deadline. Hoiberg said he might be available on Saturday. Drafted ninth overall by Charlotte in 2014, Vonleh has averaged 3.9 points and 4.5 rebounds. ... Chicago waived G/F Tony Allen after acquiring him from New Orleans in the deal that sent F Nikola Mirotic to the Pelicans last week.","400975568"
"HOUSTON --  James Harden and some of his Houston teammates got after Clint Capela after he missed a couple of easy layups in the first quarter against the Denver Nuggets. ""Oh, we yelled at him for missing those bunnies, too, because we've got to look at it as a playoff game and all those points under the basket have to be ... finishes,"" Harden said. Capela soon turned things around and more than made up for his early errors. Harden scored 28 points, Capela added 23 points with a career-high 25 rebounds and the Rockets never trailed in a lopsided 130-104 win on Friday night. The 23-year-old Capela is the youngest Rocket to have at least 23 points and 25 rebounds in a game since Hakeem Olajuwon had 30 points and 25 rebounds against the Knicks on Feb. 14, 1985. It was the first 20-point, 20-rebound game of his career, thanks to a scoring change days after a game against Utah on Dec. 18 that left him with just 19 rebounds on a 24-point night. ""This game I just wanted to make sure, so I got a couple more than 20 so if they take one out I'll still have more than 20,"" he said with a smile. Harden had 11 assists and seven rebounds as Houston won its seventh straight and 11th of 12. The Rockets had a double-digit lead for most of the game and held an advantage of 20 points or more throughout most of the second half. Harden didn't play in the third quarter, and Capela and the rest of the starters sat down for good with about nine minutes left and the game out of hand. Trey Lyles scored 24 points off the bench to lead the Nuggets, who had a three-game winning streak snapped. ""We got really good looks, but they just didn't go our way,"" coach Michael Malone said. The Rockets had a 27-point lead to start the fourth and a 14-6 run to open the quarter made it 111-76 with about nine minutes left. Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson and Gerald Green all made 3s in that stretch and Chris Paul scored the other five points. Coach Mike D'Antoni took out most of his starters after that and Denver scored the next eight straight, with Torrey Craig and Lyles making four each, to cut the lead to 111-84 with seven minutes remaining. The Nuggets had no answer for Capela, who had 16 rebounds by halftime. He grabbed his 20th to tie his previous career best with about five minutes left in the third. ""Clint is huge for us. He's vital to everything we do,"" Paul said. Denver had a terrible night from long range, making a season-low three 3-pointers on 28 attempts. The Rockets led by 16 early in the third quarter before using a 7-2 run to extend their advantage to 73-52 with about nine minutes left in the period. Capela led the way in that span with four points and Harden added a 3-pointer. Nikola Jokic made a basket for the Nuggets after that before Harden scored the first five points of a 10-2 spurt that made it 83-56 with seven minutes left in the quarter. Houston still led by 27 at the end of the period, 97-70. TIP-INS Nuggets: Jokic had 14 points and seven rebounds. ... Wilson Chandler added 11 points and six rebounds. ... Denver was outrebounded 48-39. Rockets: Trevor Ariza missed his sixth straight game with a strained left hamstring. ... Gordon returned after missing the last game with lower back soreness. ... Anderson had nine points after sitting out the last game with a sprained right ankle. ... Green added 16 points. ... Paul played just 22 minutes, scoring 11 points. HARDEN HONORED The Rockets honored Harden before the game for his 60-point performance in Houston's Jan. 30 win over Orlando. His total set a franchise record, besting the 57 points Calvin Murphy scored in 1978. Harden also had 11 assists and 10 rebounds in that game to become the first player in NBA history to score 60 points in a triple-double. The Rockets showed a video of Harden's highlights before Murphy presented him with a framed picture that featured Harden's image in front of the number 60. NEW DAD IN THE HOUSE Local rapper Travis Scott watched the game from a courtside seat. It's been a big month for Scott after he welcomed a daughter, Stormi, with Kylie Jenner last week. Scott wore baby blue Jordans as he chatted with Houston Astros pitcher Lance McCullers, and he often stood and cheered when the Rockets made big plays.","400975569"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  The season hit a low point for Utah nearly three weeks ago in a 14-point loss to an Atlanta team that's currently tied for the fewest wins in the league. The Jazz haven't lost since. Donovan Mitchell scored 25 points and previewed his Slam Dunk Contest appearance with two tomahawk jams, and the Jazz extended their league-best winning streak to eight with a 106-94 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night. The streak is Utah's longest since winning nine in a row in 2010. ""There's always some games in the NBA season where you lay an egg and it has more to do with how you respond,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Our guys have gained some confidence in general. The determination came before the confidence. They have pride, collective pride. That game didn't feel good."" Joe Ingles scored a career-high 23 points with six assists and five rebounds for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert added 20 points and 11 rebounds. ""(The streak) means a lot,"" Jazz forward Derrick Favors said. ""We're definitely in the playoff hunt. Guys are playing better, the team as a whole is playing better. We're focused. Dialed in every night. Defensively, we've been great. Offensively, things are clicking for us. We've just got to keep it up."" Kemba Walker scored 19 points for the Hornets, who lost three straight to conclude their four-game Western Conference trip. ""Balanced play,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said of the Jazz. ""Gobert makes them a different team at both ends of the floor. It's not just his defense. He's a good roller. He puts a lot of pressure on your defense. He's a good pick-and-roll player and they're playing at a really high level now."" The Jazz withstood a 3-point barrage from the Hornets in the third quarter and closed the period with a 9-2 stretch jump-started by a cutting dunk from Jonas Jerebko. Utah extended the run to 16-5 early in the fourth for a 91-79 lead that was too much for Charlotte to rally from. The Jazz held the Hornets to 17 points in the final quarter and outscored Charlotte 58-30 in the paint. ""I guess we just lost our juice a little bit and they kind of took advantage of that,"" Walker said. TIP-INS Hornets: Willy Hernangomez, acquired Thursday in a trade with the Trail Blazers, was inactive. ... Dwight Howard fouled out with five points and nine rebounds. Jazz: Jae Crowder, acquired in a trade with the Cavaliers, was not yet available to play. He sat behind the bench in street clothes. ... Ricky Rubio left in the third quarter with left hip soreness and did not return. CONSTANT CHANGE The Jazz played their first game without Rodney Hood and Joe Johnson, who were traded away Thursday. Hood was second on the team with 16.8 points per game. He and Johnson missed a combined 37 games this season, so the Jazz were already accustomed to their absence. ""You're going to have to adapt throughout the course of the season. Whatever it is,"" Snyder said. ""You may have more injuries than the other team. You may have less. You may have a roster situation, a trade. (It all) requires adaptation. ""As long as you're adapting to what you have and are focused on that, the external stuff (doesn't matter as much). ... They've done a good job staying focused through whatever's happened.""","400975570"
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Damian Lillard didn't fight Portland coach Terry Stotts' decision to sit him in the fourth quarter, even though the Trail Blazers point guard was well within reach of his career high for points. Having scored a season-high 50 in 29 minutes -- the fourth 50-point game of his career -- Lillard saw no reason to tempt fate. Lillard scored 22 points in the third quarter, and the Blazers beat the Kings 118-100 on Friday night. ""I saw we were up 20 and I was like, 'OK, if we keep this lead, there's really no reason to go back in there,"" Lillard said. ""I'd rather have a 50 in 29 minutes with some character than go out there and chase 60. I feel like that's bad karma."" Lillard scored at will, making 16 of 26 shots -- including eight 3-pointers -- and all 10 of his free throw attempts. His only action in the fourth came when Stotts sent him to the scorer's table briefly after Sacramento cut Portland's lead to 13. When Shabazz Napier stopped the Kings' run with a 3-pointer, Lillard looked at Stotts and the two men nodded in agreement that his night was over. Lillard, who also had six assists, joined teammate CJ McCollum and the Houston Rockets' James Harden as the only players to score 50 points through three quarters this season. ""Damian was outstanding,"" Stotts said. ""To have another 50-point scorer under 30 minutes is pretty impressive. The way he was shooting it, he knew he had a good feel tonight."" Maurice Harkless added 15 points, McCollum scored 13 and Ed Davis had five points and 14 rebounds for Portland, which made 15 3-pointers. The Blazers were coming off an overtime home win against the Charlotte Hornets on Thursday that snapped a three-game losing streak. Lillard, Portland's lone All-Star this season, scored 15 points during a 17-0 run that closed out the third quarter in Sacramento and put the Blazers up 92-74. He made two 3s during the run and silenced the crowd when he drove the left side of the lane and flipped the ball in with his right hand. ""I just knew that I needed to control the game at that point,"" Lillard said. ""It didn't necessarily mean scoring. The ball just went in. I was being aggressive and the ball went in."" Sacramento made five consecutive 3s in the fourth quarter, four by Buddy Hield, and pulled within 107-94 with 4:45 left. Napier's 3-pointer halted the Kings' surge. Willie Cauley-Stein had 19 points and six rebounds for Sacramento, and Zach Randolph added 17 points and nine boards. Lillard had 14 points and made three of Portland's six 3-pointers in the first quarter. Evan Turner hit an off-balance 11-footer to end the period and put the Blazers up 33-31. ""When a guard's got it going like that, it's tough to stop,"" Kings guard De'Aaron Fox said. ""All you can do is try to contain him. It's not much you can do about it."" After Randolph's layup over Jusuf Nurkic pulled Sacramento within 49-47 in the second quarter, Lillard scored nine consecutive points and then added a 17-foot step-back jumper with 1.7 seconds left to put Portland up 62-52 at halftime. TIP-INS Blazers: Lillard's eight 3-pointers were one shy of his own franchise record, which he matched earlier this season against Houston on Dec. 9. ... Portland improved to 2-1 against the Kings this season. The teams split back-to-back games in November. Kings: Iman Shumpert, who was part of the trade that sent George Hill to Cleveland, arrived for the game but did not suit up. ... Skal Labissiere (left rotator cuff strain) expects to return after the All-Star break. JOHNSON IN LIMBO Joe Johnson, who was traded to Sacramento from Utah as part of the three-team deal, is unsure where his future rests. With expectations that the Kings will buy the veteran guard out of the remainder of his contract -- which would make him a free agent available to sign with any team -- Johnson has not reported to Sacramento. HE SAID IT ""We did a super job on [Lillard] in the fourth quarter, where we held him scoreless."" -- Kings coach Dave Joerger.","400975571"
"NEW YORK -- <U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD> Anthony Davis knows how much the Brooklyn Nets depend on 3-pointers. The All-Star forward and the New Orleans Pelicans took advantage of Brooklyn's inability to hit them, building a 22-point halftime lead, but they couldn't stop the Nets from hitting 3s over the next two quarters. But they benefited again from the Nets' long-distance woes in the second overtime to close them out. Davis had 44 points and 17 rebounds, Rajon Rondo had a triple-double, and the Pelicans recovered after blowing a 28-point lead to beat Brooklyn 138-128 in two overtimes on Saturday night. ""You know they live by the 3, die by the 3. They were missing a lot and then they were able to get hot, especially Allen Crabbe. That's how they get back into games,"" Davis said. ""We just wanted to keep fighting, doing what we did to get the lead."" It was nearly identical to his last game in New York, when Davis had 48 points and 17 rebounds in a victory over the Knicks last month. Rondo finished with 25 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds as the Pelicans snapped a three-game losing streak. Nikola Mirotic had 21 points and 16 boards, and Jrue Holiday chipped in 22 points. ""Amazing, amazing,"" said Mirotic of Rondo's performance. ""Especially in the beginning of the game, setting the down, driving to the basket. He was the reading the game excellently tonight."" Crabbe matched a career high with eight 3-pointers and scored 28 points for the Nets, who have lost their last four games. ""Obviously, we didn't play like us,"" Crabbe said. ""So, Coach didn't even come in and yell at us. He said you all figure it and get it together."" Spencer Dinwiddie chipped in 24 points, and D'Angelo Russell came off the bench with 21 points and nine assists. New Orleans led by 28 points in the third quarter when the Nets, who looked flat in the first half, launched their wild comeback, sending the game into overtime on Crabbe's 3-pointer with 12 seconds left in regulation. The Nets, who shot just 8 for 26 beyond the 3-point line in the first half and then 11 for 23 in the final two quarters, connected on just 2 for 10 in the two overtime periods, missing each of their five 3s in the final overtime session. Their 21 3s tied a franchise record previously set in regulation against Philadelphia on December 2013. Crabbe continued his hot shooting, connecting on two more 3s to open up the first overtime session, giving the Nets a 122-118 lead with 2:28 left. But the Pelicans came back to force the second OT on a jumper by Holiday with 47 seconds to go. New Orleans had a shot to win after missed shot by DeMarre Carroll but Holiday failed to get the shot off in time. Davis then scored four points during a 7-0 run for the Pelicans, putting them up 130-124 with 2:50 remaining. After a pair of free throws by Joe Harris, Rondo hit three free throws to put it away. ""I think it could have been easy for us to just kind cave in when we had the big lead and they came back,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""But I was really proud of the guys hanging in there and keep fighting and fighting and find a way to win the game."" TIP-INS Pelicans: After being held to 14 points in the opening period of Friday night's loss at Philadelphia, New Orleans put up 34 in the first quarter Saturday night. Nets: F Dante Cunningham, who was acquired from the Pelicans on Thursday before the trade deadline expired, made his debut against his former team. The nine-year NBA veteran had two points. COMING ALONG FINE The lack of practices hasn't allowed Gentry to add new plays and work Mirotic into New Orleans' offense, but he'll be looking forward to doing so over the next few days. His performance against Brooklyn, has been his best, by far, since joining the Pelicans after was acquired from the Chicago Bulls on Feb. 1 after All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins was lost for the season due to an Achilles tendon injury. ""What we have to do now is we have to incorporate him into our offense. We have to really have a lot of time where we can put things in that's going to benefit him,"" Gentry said. Mirotic has averaged 14 points and nine rebounds in four games. ""He's really just kind of playing on instinct right now and doing a great job with it. But we'll have time in the next few days to break our offense down and then also put some things in that is going to be beneficial to him.""","400975572"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The Milwaukee Bucks got what they have come to expect from 23-year-old Giannis Antetokounmpo and an unexpected boost from 40-year-old Jason Terry Antetokounmpo scored 32 points and Terry came off the bench to score 11 points in the second half in the Bucks' 111-104 victory over the Orlando Magic on Saturday night. A couple of 3-pointers by the 40-year-old Terry put the Bucks ahead to stay late in the third quarter, although the game stayed close until Antetokounmpo's three-point play made it 107-100 with 45.7 seconds left. ""I'm not sure a lot of teams have a guy like Giannis,"" Milwaukee coach Joe Prunty said. ""You can go up and down the stat sheet and you know it's going to be filled. The 6-foot-11 forward had a modest game by his standards, compiling five rebounds, five assists and a couple of blocks. But the Bucks might not have won without the contribution of Terry, who put them ahead to stay with a couple of 3-pointers late in the third quarter. ""This was a must-win for us. We were missing some guys and the bench had to come up big,"" said Terry, who had only nine 3-pointers for the season before adding three Saturday night. ""I can still come in and be a spark,"" he said. ""At this age you find ways to help your team if you're on the court."" Milwaukee stayed ahead by hitting 13 of 20 shots in the fourth quarter, winning for the eighth time in 10 games. Mario Hezonja led Orlando with 23 points. Evan Fournier added 20, and Shelvin Mack had 19. Khris Middleton had 21 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for Milwaukee. The Bucks (31-24) won for the sixth straight time in the second game of a back-to-back. The Magic (18-37) missed 14 straight 3-point shots and saw their three-game winning streak broken. ""We were right there the whole game,"" said D.J. Augustin, who missed all four of his threes. ""I felt like we could have pulled away at the end, but Jason Terry came in and hit some big shots, like he's been doing his whole career."" Mack made all six of his shots in the first half in leading Orlando to a 54-50 halftime lead. But after Mack made a 3-pointer midway through the second quarter, Orlando missed 16 of its next 17. Hezonja scored nine of Orlando's first 11 points, and a couple of free throws by Augustin with 3:31 left in the second quarter gave the Magic a nine-point lead, the biggest for either team until the Bucks matched it in the fourth quarter. VOGEL ENCOURAGED The Magic's failure to win a fourth straight game for the first time since December of 2015 did not discourage coach Frank Vogel. ""This is the standard of how we want to play. We want to build an extra-pass culture with a competitive spirit on the defensive end,"" Vogel said. It takes time for this stuff to develop but it looks pretty good right now."" TIP-INS Bucks: C John Henson did not play because of a sore right hamstring. ...

"PHILADELPHIA --  JJ Redick wasn't buying any of it. Midway through the fourth quarter of the Philadelphia 76ers' 112-98 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, Joel Embiid had an ugly fall and took a seat at the end of the bench. ""I think me and about 20,000 people held our breaths for the entire time,"" guard T.J. McConnell said. Redick was breathing just fine. ""Joe is very dramatic,"" Redick said. ""I've played with a lot of good actors in my career, and he's definitely in the top three. He could have a future in Hollywood if he wanted to."" Embiid drove on Clippers guard Tyrone Wallace, lost control of the ball and slipped trying to get it back. He fell to the floor and banged his knee with his fist a few times before getting up and slowly walking to the bench. ""There's a difference between agony and selling a foul,"" Redick said. ""We all do it. It's part of the game. I wasn't concerned."" Turns out, Redick was right. Embiid was fine. He returned to the game with 4:53 left and later made a free throw to cap an 8-0 run that sealed the Sixers' third straight win. ""My hand got tangled inside my leg as I was reaching for the ball. Nothing happened,"" Embiid said. ""I kind of hit my knee on the floor, but I feel great."" A game-time decision for the second straight night with a sore ankle, Embiid was playing in back-to-back games for just the second time in his career. He finished with 29 points and matched a career high with 16 rebounds in 34 minutes. ""I was getting tired,"" said Embiid, who moments before the tumble barely drew iron on a short jumper. After the game, he quickly grew tired of being interrogated. ""Can we just stop talking about my knee?"" he said. Embiid had plenty of help Saturday night. Redick had 17 points, including 5 of 10 from 3, and McConnell had 17 along with eight assists. Ben Simmons had 14 points and 10 assists. Philadelphia was 10 for 17 from 3 in the first half and led 69-55 at halftime. The Sixers cooled off in the third, going 1 for 10 from 3, and committed five turnovers, allowing the Clippers to creep within six and enter the fourth down 85-78. The Clippers got within 95-93 with 6 minutes left, but McConnell hit a tough turnaround in the paint, and Redick nailed his final 3. ""I just thought they were fresher tonight,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""They played last night, too -- obviously they didn't have to travel. It felt like every loose ball and 50-50 play, they got."" Former Sixers guard Lou Williams led the Clippers with 23 points, and Danilo Gallinari had 22. Philadelphia ended the game on a 17-5 run. ""This was a great win. This is one of our best wins of the season. I really believe that,"" said Redick, who spent the last four seasons with the Clippers. ""It always feels good to beat your former team. Nothing but love for those guys over there, but that last 3-pointer, I emphasized that a little bit. That was ballgame. That felt good."" And fortunately, so does Embiid. ""For a quick moment there, I was worried,"" coach Brett Brown said, ""but they cleared him to come back in and play . and life's still good."" TIP-INS Clippers: Los Angeles had its three-game win streak snapped and is 3-2 since trading Blake Griffin to Detroit. 76ers: Simmons was the only starter who didn't hit a 3 (he didn't attempt one). In addition to Redick's five, Embiid, Dario Saric and Robert Covington made one apiece. McConnell made all three of his 3-point attempts, and Justin Anderson hit two. NEWEST SIXER The Sixers will sign veteran shooting guard Marco Belinelli once he clears waivers on Monday. A person with knowledge of the plans confirmed the move, which was first reported by ESPN, to The Associated Press. Belinelli also supplied his own confirmation of sorts with a tweet reading, ""TRUST THE PROCESS."" The Atlanta Hawks reached a buyout agreement with the 31-year-old Belinelli, who is averaging 11.4 points and shooting 37.2 percent from 3 this season. PHILLY OR ... OKLAHOMA? Before taking questions before the game, Rivers announced he was making an opening statement. ""Walking around Philly, people are so happy now. It's amazing,"" Rivers said, referencing the city's reaction to the Eagles' first Super Bowl championship. ""I've never seen this before. People said, `Good luck.' I was like, `Wow, I'm in Oklahoma."" WELCOME BACK Fans greeted Williams with a ""Loooouuu!"" chant when he first entered the game. Williams spent his first seven NBA seasons with the Sixers, who selected him in the second round of the 2005 draft. Williams followed by hitting his first four shots, including a pair of 3s.

Friday night, receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith were in attendance.","400975574"
"CHICAGO --  Tomas Satoransky is starting while star guard John Wall recovers from knee surgery. He stepped up Saturday for struggling All-Star Bradley Beal as well. Satoransky scored a career-high 25 points on 10-of-12 shooting and the Washington Wizards beat the Chicago Bulls 101-90. ""It's not often that you can win a game on the road and our All-Star guard didn't have a good game -- 0 for 7 from 3,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. ""Tomas was on fire, played a great game, made a lot of plays for us. ""He's really developing. He's tough, he's competitive and he makes good plays for us."" Satoransky's career night, though, was cut short. He fell hard to the court and hit his head after being fouled with 2 1/2 minutes left in the game. He was taken to the locker room bleeding from the right temple. The 26-year-old from the Czech Republic didn't speak with reporters afterward, but was in the locker room -- with a bandage over his right eyebrow -- talking and joking with teammates. Brooks said Satoransky is ""going to be all right,"" but it's unclear whether he'll enter the NBA's concussion protocol. Otto Porter Jr. and Mike Scott had 15 points apiece as the Wizards won for the sixth time in seven games. Beal had seven points on 3-for-13 shooting. Justin Holiday had 15 points and Bobby Portis added 13 for Chicago, which has dropped eight of nine. Satoransky had 15 in the first half to pace Washington to a 56-46 halftime edge. The lead was 82-70 entering the fourth quarter. Jason Smith hit a jumper with just under 8 minutes to go to give the Wizards a 95-79 lead, their biggest of the game. The Bulls rallied and pulled to 97-90 following back-to-back 3-pointers by Jerian Grant and Holiday with 4:14 left. They had a chance to move closer a short while later, but Lauri Markkanen missed an open 3. Satoransky then stopped the Chicago run at the other end with a 3-pointer -- his fifth on six attempts -- to make it 100-90 with 3:24 remaining. Satoransky looked to put the finishing touch on a career night on Washington's next possession. He drove to the basket for a layup attempt but was fouled hard by Portis. Satoransky landed on his right shoulder and then hit the right side of his head on the floor. Portis was assessed a flagrant 2 foul and ejected. ""Everybody knows the rule,"" Brooks said. ""It's a dangerous play. If (Portis) had to do it all over again, he probably would have taken it back."" Portis said he was surprised with the call. ""It was a basketball play to help my team try to stay in the game,"" he said. ""That's what that was. No injury was intended on Satoransky. Just competing hard like I always do."" TIP-INS Wizards: G Tim Frazier suffered a nasal fracture in the first half and did not return . F Markieff Morris sat out with flu-like symptoms. Kelly Oubre started in his place. ... With Wall (knee surgery) likely out for another month, media reports have linked Washington to G Derrick Rose, who was waived by Utah. ""We made a trade to have that flexibility,"" Brooks said. ""If something presents itself that makes sense -- for us and the player -- we will obviously look into it."" Bulls: G Denzel Valentine started in LaVine's spot and finished with 10 points (4 for 14 shooting) and 10 rebounds. LAVINE SITS The Bulls were playing without guard Zach LaVine, who hasn't been cleared to play in back-to-back games following ACL surgery last February. LaVine scored 35 points -- including his team's last 11 -- in Chicago's 114-113 win over Minnesota on Friday. LaVine played 33 minutes on Friday and could be cleared to play back-to-back games soon.

"DALLAS --  Isaiah Thomas used his crossover dribble to create an open 3-pointer that helped his new team build a double-digit lead in the first half. The Los Angeles Lakers couldn't stay in front in the diminutive guard's debut following his ill-fated stint in Cleveland. Still, there was plenty of evidence that Thomas can be the scorer he was in Boston. Dirk Nowitzki had a season-high 22 points, Harrison Barnes added 21 and the last-place Dallas Mavericks rallied to beat the Lakers 130-123 on Saturday night. Thomas finished with 22 points and already looks like a better fit in coach Luke Walton's offense following the deadline deal that brought him from the Cavaliers, who acquired him last summer in the trade that sent Kyrie Irving to the Celtics. ""Obviously we couldn't run a ton of stuff because he has been with us for one day, but he was good,"" Walton said. ""You can see his competitive spirit come out a little bit. He was scrapping and knocking down shots."" Thomas' first half with the Lakers was his highest-scoring half of the season, a team-high 16 points. Thomas, who was part of a four-player deal at the trading deadline that also brought Channing Frye, missed the first 36 games recovering from a hip injury. ""I like the pace of this team,"" he said. ""I like the energy the guys bring. Coach did the best job he could to put me in position to play to my strengths with only knowing a couple plays."" Doug McDermott had eight points in his Dallas debut following a deadline deal that brought him from New York and was part of a youthful closing lineup that outscored the Lakers 13-5 in the final 3:09. Nowitzki, Barnes and starting guard Wesley Matthews all sat in the last three minutes, and rookie guard Dennis Smith Jr. put Dallas ahead for good at 119-118 on a layup. Smith finished with 14 points, and the Mavericks had a season high in points. Thomas was out there late for the Lakers, who had a season-best, four-game winning streak stopped for the third time in a month. ""I love winning, you know that,"" said Dallas coach Rick Carlisle, who used a young lineup that struggled late in a loss at the LA Clippers with a chance to win five nights earlier. ""The Clipper game was not good. Tonight was obviously much better."" Julius Randle had 26 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Lakers, and Brandon Ingram scored 22 points. Kyle Kuzma had 12 points and 15 rebounds. Dallas' Dwight Powell scored 19 , two shy of his career high. J.J. Barea had 10 points and nine assists. Thomas entered the game midway through the first quarter to a noticeable ovation from the usually solid number of Lakers fans in the Dallas crowd. He hit a 3 from the left wing on his first LA possession and was 4 of 7 from long range before halftime. TIP-INS Lakers: G Lonzo Ball missed his 13th straight game with a sore left knee. ... Thomas got a flagrant foul in the second half when he pulled Kyle Collinsworth down by the shoulders when the Dallas guard was going up for a dunk. ... Brook Lopez had 16 points, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 14. ... The Lakers matched a season high with 16 3-pointers. Mavericks: F Josh McRoberts was waived. He played in two games after spending the first 37 games on the inactive list with a left foot injury. He was acquired with a second-round pick and cash for center A.J. Hammons last summer. ... McDermott, who came from the Knicks in a three-team trade, scored his first Dallas points on a breakaway dunk soon after entering the game in the first quarter. THOMAS' ROLE The persistent question for Walton will be whether and when Thomas becomes a starter. ""They've been playing well. I don't want to mess anything up, and I told him that,"" Thomas said after the morning shootaround. ""Yes, I would love to be a starter. I've feel like I've earned that and deserve that. At the same time, it's a new chapter for me. I'm here to help this team."" Said Walton, ""For tonight, we're going to look for him to kind of bring us a lot of scoring off the bench and help that lead that group. And then we're going to see how tomorrow looks and the next day. It doesn't matter down the road right now."" DALLAS W It was the first Dallas-LA meeting since the Lakers ended the Mavericks' 14-game winning streak against the storied franchise. The previous longest streak for Dallas was three games. It was just the fifth win of 2018 for the Mavs, who ended 2017 on a season-best four-game winning streak.","400975576"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  Steve Kerr shouted out Luke Walton for his help reaching 250 coaching victories in record time. Kerr trash talked old coach Phil Jackson, now the second-quickest to 250 wins behind his former Bulls player. Then, Kerr offered credit where he always does: to his uber-talented roster of All-Stars. Klay Thompson scored 25 points, 10 coming in the third quarter to help Golden State pull away, and the Warriors beat the San Antonio Spurs 122-105 on Saturday night. Fellow Splash Brother Stephen Curry added 17 points and eight assists in Kerr's milestone night. ""It's been an amazing 3  1/2 years and hopefully more to come,"" Curry said. ""... It's a lot about him setting the identity and the culture around our team and just being a great people guy. There's probably a better term for that. He just knows how to relate to each and every one of us players and his coaching staff and you're building that ultimate trust throughout the organization."" Kerr reached 250 wins in 302 games to top Jackson, who made the mark in 346 games. ""He had Michael Jordan for God sake, so I don't know what Phil's problem was,"" Kerr cracked. Yet Kerr, the 2016 NBA Coach of the Year, received 39 victories during a leave of absence following complications from back surgery at the start of the 2015-16 season, when then-top assistant and current Lakers coach Walton coached Golden State. Draymond Green had 17 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds in another well-rounded outing -- and his first technical-free game in the last three. Zaza Pachulia scored 12 points on his 34th birthday and Kevin Durant was limited to a season-low 10 points in a rare cold night from the floor at 3 of 9, but had six rebounds and dished out six assists. LaMarcus Aldridge and Kyle Anderson led San Antonio with 20 points apiece, while Manu Ginobili had 13 points and six assists off the bench for the Spurs. Thompson had a quick five-point burst midway through the third. Curry provided a brief scare when he grimaced after appearing to get a foot tangled with Danny Green before a break at the 8:45 mark of the third. He was examined by athletic trainer Chelsea Lane and stayed in the game. ""I'm fine ... my ankle but I'm fine,"" Curry said with a grin. This was a rough one for San Antonio after one of its best games earlier in the week. The Spurs lost for the third time in four games after putting up a 129-81 blowout at Phoenix on Wednesday night -- San Antonio's third-largest margin of victory. Draymond Green's 3-pointer gave Golden State a 58-55 edge at the break. Then the Warriors took off. David West made all six of his shots for 13 points for Golden State off the bench facing his former Spurs team. ""They're the best team in the world,"" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said, ""so there's lots of things to be impressed by."" TIP-INS Spurs: Patty Mills earned the start back in the Bay Area where he starred for mid-major power Saint Mary's College. ... Mills shot 1 for 5 from deep as the Spurs were just 5 of 27 from 3-point range. Warriors: Kerr joined three other Warriors coaches with 250 or more victories: Al Attles (557), Don Nelson (422) and Edward Gottlieb (263). ... Green stood pat at 14 technicals after getting three in his previous two games. ... With his 615th regular-season game played, Curry moved past Purvis Short into sole possession of ninth place on the franchise list. ... Golden State brought G Patrick McCaw back from a one-game appearance in the G League, though Kerr said he might return Sunday to rejoin the Santa Cruz Warriors. McCaw had 22 points, eight rebounds, three assists and two steals in 33 minutes of his first G League game this season. OLD PALS Popovich stopped by the Warriors coaches' office to see longtime pal Kerr, whose son Nick is now on the San Antonio staff as video coordinator. ""He calls my son a spy. He said my son could be working for Putin,"" Kerr said. ""It's that kind of conversation when we get together."" Joked Popovich: ""He wasn't at practice yesterday. He did whatever we did to prepare for Golden State, whatever that might be, so I told the guys to make sure, before we left the gym to get Nick Kerr's cellphone so he couldn't text it to Steve Kerr. He works for them but I don't trust him a lick. I know he's calling his dad.""","400975577"
"PHOENIX --  Wilson Chandler's big game Saturday brought back memories. ""It felt like a throw-back,"" Chandler said. It looked like a throw-down. Chandler scored 26 points, Will Barton had 25 point and the Denver Nuggets used an extended second-half run to take control in a 123-113 victory over the Phoenix Suns. Nikola Jokic had 21 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and Gary Harris had 13 points for the Nuggets, who have won four of five. The Nuggets used a 36-15 run to take a double-digit lead midway through the fourth quarter, and Chandler hit two 3-pointers from the right corner to nail it down after the Suns closed to 109-103 with 4 1/2 minutes remaining. ""Today the ball was finding me,"" Chandler said. Chandler was 11 for 15 from the floor. His previous high this season was 21, and bothered by illness he had only 22 points in the previous four games. He had a career-high 36 against Sacramento last year. ""We don't win the game without Wilson,"" Denver coach Michael Malone said. ""I love it when he is aggressive. Our guys did a great job of finding him, and Wilson did the rest by stepping in and making timely 3s down the stretch."" TJ Warren had 31 points and Dragan Bender had a career-high 23 for the Suns, who have lost five in a row, 10 of 11 and 13 of 15. One of those wins came in Denver on Jan. 19. Their only other victory in that stretch was against Dallas at home. Barton scored 11 points during a 21-9 run that gave the Nuggets a 94-89 lead after three quarters, and Denver scored the first five points of the fourth quarter for a 13-point cushion. Jokic's 3-pointer from the top of the key made it 109-95 with 6:29 remaining, capping a longer 36-15 run. Marquese Chriss' fast-break dunk closed the Suns' deficit to 109-103 with 4:29 remaining, but Barton hit a 3-pointer and Chandler hit two from the right corner to put away the game. Elfrid Payton made a strong first impression for the Suns with 19 points, nine assists and six rebounds in 35 minutes. He was acquired from Orlando at the trade deadline Thursday. ""The pace of play was better,"" Suns interim coach Jay Triano said. ""He made the guys on the floor with him better. Getting the ball up and down the floor, getting into the lane when he needed to. I think it will only improve as he understands who can do different things for us."" Josh Jackson had 20 points, seven rebounds and five assists. The Suns played without leading scorer Devin Booker, Tyson Chandler and Tyler Ulis. Booker, who is 12th in the league with 24.1 points per game, has missed the last three games with a hip pointer. Chandler was out with a neck injury and Ulis with back spasms. Phoenix made a much better showing than in the previous game Wednesday, a 129-81 loss to San Antonio on Wednesday that tied the Suns' worst ever. They set the record against Portland on opening night this season. TIP-INS Nuggets: The Nuggets are one of six teams within 3 1/2 games of each other in the race for the final four playoff spots in the West. Suns: Phoenix was 14 of 25 from the free throw line, with Warren 5 of 9 and Josh Jackson 0 of 3. BOOKER UPDATE The Suns have only two games remaining until the All-Star break, but there is no plan to keep Booker and his sore hip out until after the break as precautionary measure. ""It depends completely on his injury,"" Triano said. ""I don't think it makes sense to rush him back if he is not a hundred percent or there is chance of re-injury or causing some long-term damage. ""He wants to play. He is down in the gym shooting. He shoots a little bit and then he starts to move and it kind of hits him where this doesn't feel great."" Booker has missed three straight games with a hip injury after missing one game two weeks ago with a rib injury. HARRIS ARRIVES Nuggets guard Devin Harris had nine points and two steals in 22 minutes in his first game since being acquired from Dallas at the trade deadline Thursday. Harris landed in Phoenix on Saturday morning and took part in a breakfast meeting and the morning walk-through. Nuggets assistants Wes Unseld and Micah Nori met with Harris to go over the Nuggets' sets, defensive principles and terminology. ""At the end of the day, most teams are doing the same things, just different vernacular, if you will,"" Malone said. ""For him to get comfortable with terminology will be the biggest thing. When he is out there, we'll keep it simple.""","400975578"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Before the season even began, C.J. Miles admitted he and his teammates boasted about just how good his Toronto Raptors' bench might be. ""We've been saying we're the best bench in the league since Day One,"" he said. ""And if it wasn't true then, it's got to be true now."" Miles led the charge of Toronto reserves Sunday as he scored 24 points while starter DeMar DeRozan had 25 points and eight assists as the Raptors routed the Charlotte Hornets 123-103. Six players scored in double figures for the Raptors, who won their fifth straight game and improved to 39-16. Raptors coach Dwane Casey earned his 300th victory as head coach of the team. Miles shot 6-of-9 from 3-point range as Toronto sank 48.6 percent from long-distance overall. He led a charge of Raptors reserves who outscored the Hornets' bench players 55-46. ""They're phenomenal,"" Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. ""Our young guys are phenomenal and we really need them. We love continuing to see them grow. They're growing and playing well and it makes it unbelievable."" It was the starters who helped Toronto pull away in the third quarter, though. Jonas Valanciunas, who finished with 21 points and nine rebounds, scored 10 during an 18-2 run that began the second half. Charlotte shot just 1-for-12 in that span. Fred VanVleet added 10 points and four assists off the bench for Toronto. ""We just got a good chemistry,"" Miles said. ""We have a lot of fun, play well together. Move the ball. We don't care who scores, who shoots. We just want to get the shots that guys are supposed to take. That's all that matters. And it shows."" Kemba Walker had 23 points and nine assists as the Hornets lost their fourth in a row. Dwight Howard added 17 points and 13 rebounds for Charlotte. Despite returning Saturday from a West Coast trip featuring four games in six days, the Hornets jumped out to a 10-0 start behind six points and an assist from Walker. Toronto responded with a 12-4 run, with four points and a rebound from DeRozan. The Hornets' weary legs showed in the end, as they shot 42.7 percent for the game. The Raptors made 56.3 percent. ""Sometimes they say the schedule can catch up with you,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""It's not the whole reason we lost, but this last stretch has been a lot of traveling and you can see it."" Lowry's 3-pointer with 3:30 remaining in the first quarter gave the Raptors their first lead, which they did not relinquish. TIP-INS Raptors: Forward OG Anunoby sprained his right ankle in the second quarter and did not return. He played 11 minutes with one rebound and one assist. ... Norman Powell started in place of Anunoby in the third quarter. .... Toronto is 3-1 in afternoon starts this season. Hornets: Center Cody Zeller remains on a minute restriction limiting him to 20-22 minutes the next few games, Clifford said. ... Forward Marvin Williams experienced soreness in his left ankle Friday after playing against Utah, but an MRI showed no additional damage, Clifford said. Williams missed four games with the injury, Jan. 31 to Feb. 5. ... Walker was honored before the game for setting the record for the most 3-pointers in franchise history. He passed Dell Curry at Phoenix on Feb. 4 when he hit his 930th 3-pointer. FROM THE BENCH Toronto's bench ranks near the top in ""hustle"" categories for the NBA. The Raptors' bench is first in steals (4.1) and second in blocks (3.1) and turnovers forced (7.2) per game. ""Their activity is just as important as anything else,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. LATEST ACQUISITION Clifford said he was still trying to learn more about newly acquired center Willy Hernangomez, whom Charlotte acquired Feb. 7 from the New York Knicks for Johnny O'Bryant and second-round picks in 2020 and 2021. ""I have to be honest with you, we made this trade, we played three (games) in four (nights) and I haven't had a chance to watch the film,"" Clifford said. ""I'm going to get on that (Monday). He and I are going to work out. I've always liked his skill level. He's a smart player, good size, high IQ. But I haven't done enough film work."" The 6-foot-11 Hernangomez averaged 4.3 points and 2.6 rebounds in 26 games with the Knicks this season.","400975579"
"ATLANTA --  Dewayne Dedmon made the most of only his second start in Atlanta's last 18 games, especially at the end. Dedmon gave Atlanta the lead with a three-point play and then padded the margin with a 3-pointer, lifting the Hawks to a 118-115 win over Blake Griffin and the Pistons on Sunday. Dedmon matched his career high with 20 points and had 13 rebounds in his matchup with Andre Drummond, who had 25 points and 15 rebounds for Detroit. The Hawks haven't had a set starting center. Miles Plumlee has seen most of the starts in recent games, and rookie John Collins has four starts. Dedmon said he was ""trying to be aggressive ... just trying to change the game."" He said that's his approach ""no matter where it is, starting or coming off bench."" Dedmon's three-point play gave Atlanta a 109-107 lead with 1:34 remaining. Following a missed jumper by Jameer Nelson, Dedmon sank a 3-pointer from the corner in front of the Pistons bench to push the lead to five points. ""Big shot,"" said Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer, who said Dedmon ""gave us a lot of good things."" Dennis Schroder had 23 points for Atlanta, including six free throws in the final 20 seconds. Griffin, who had 23 points, answered with a 3-pointer for Detroit. Schroder made two free throws for a 114-110 lead. Griffin's layup cut the Atlanta lead to two points before Schroder added two more free throws with 9.2 seconds remaining for a 116-112 advantage. Anthony Tolliver missed a 3-pointer for Detroit before Schroder iced the win with two more free throws. Griffin added a 3 as the final buzzer sounded. The Pistons blamed the loss on bad defense. ""Tough to give up 118 and try to win on the road,"" Griffin said. ""Or win in general."" Drummond's big game was not enough to overcome the defensive breakdowns, including in the closing minutes. ""Our defense stinks,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""We just got broken down, broken down, broken down."" Van Gundy assigned blame for the defensive problems on ""our starters, other than Andre."" TIP-INS Pistons: Reggie Bullock had 20 points, two away from his career high. ... James Ennis and Nelson, obtained in trades with Memphis and Chicago, respectively, on Thursday, made their debuts late in the first period. Ennis had 14 points. Nelson had six points and five assists. ... Ish Smith had two points, seven assists and five turnovers. ... Bullock had only two points in the second half. Hawks: Ilyasova had 19 points. ... After missing the last 18 games with a left groin strain/left abductor strain, DeAndre Bembry was in uniform but did not play. Bembry was arrested early Friday after he was clocked driving 128 mph on an Atlanta interstate. ... Rookie Tyler Dorsey, who had 10 points, saw more playing time off the bench than starting small forward Taurean Prince, who had two points and three turnovers while making only one of seven shots. 3 FOR ALL Griffin made 3 of 10 3-pointers and then second-guessed his shot selection. ""I shouldn't take 10 3s,"" he said. ""I didn't realize it until after the game."" HEAD SHOT Griffin appeared to be trying to throw the ball to official Michael Smith following a foul call in the second period, but his pass hit Schroder on the back of his head. Schroder, who had been standing close to Smith, objected and the two had a brief exchange before Griffin was called for a technical foul. Griffin's attempt to explain the pass didn't change the call. MATCHUP DILEMMA Drummond was a difficult matchup for Atlanta, consistently drawing fouls near the basket. Drummond made 9 of 13 free throws and was the major reason Collins and Dedmon had foul problems. Collins fouled out with 3:25 remaining and Dedmon finished with four fouls.","400975580"
"BOSTON -- LeBron James led the new-look Cavaliers to a blowout in Boston with an individual performance reminiscent of the rivalry's heyday. And this time, Paul Pierce was sitting courtside in street clothes, unable to do anything about it. With the former Celtics great waiting to see his No. 34 raised to the Boston Garden rafters, James shook off a first-quarter leg injury to score 24 points with 10 assists and eight rebounds to give Cleveland a 121-99 victory on Sunday. In their first appearances since being acquired at the trade deadline, Jordan Clarkson scored 17 points, Rodney Hood had 15, George Hill had 12 and Larry Nance Jr. scored five. The foursome practiced with the Cavs for the first time on Saturday. ""I know the guys that are here are very excited about this opportunity,"" James said. ""It's my job to as the leader of this team to make sure that I acclimate the new four guys to be around a culture that's built around winning."" James scored 13 in the second quarter -- eight of them during a 13-2 run that turned a one-point deficit into a double-digit lead. The Celtics made it 64-55 on the first basket of the third quarter but never got within 10 again. As the Cavaliers opened a 27-point lead midway through the fourth, the crowd began chanting ""We want Paul Pierce!"" But he remained in his baseline seat, awaiting the postgame ceremony that would raise his No. 34 to the TD Garden rafters -- the 23rd person in the history of the NBA's most-decorated franchise to be so honored. ""It definitely gave me chills, especially with LeBron out there,"" Pierce told reporters afterward. ""I wanted to be out there."" The current Celtics, who have spent much of the season in first place in the East, could have used him. ""Yeah, we stunk,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""But they were really good. They had a lot to do with that."" PLAYOFF RACE Terry Rozier scored 21 with nine assists and Kyrie Irving scored 18 against his former team before sitting out the fourth quarter. The Celtics have lost three of four to fall behind Toronto in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Cavaliers, who have won three straight, are 5 1/2 games behind Boston. To help make a push for their fourth straight NBA finals, Cleveland traded away six players and acquired four at the deadline. ""All of our new guys performed and played well,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. ""So that's a good sign."" THE TRUTH Pierce watched the game from a baseline seat, under the basket where the Celtics scored 42 points in the fourth quarter of Game 6 of the finals to clinch their 17th NBA championship. On the other side of the basket were former coach Doc Rivers and former teammates Kevin Garnett, Rajon Rondo and Antoine Walker. Timeouts featured tribute videos from Rivers, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant and Pierce's college coach, Roy Williams. After his family joined him in hoisting the retired number banner to the rafters, Pierce said having his number retired by the NBA's most-decorated franchise is the ultimate honor -- bigger than the Hall of Fame. ""When you're forever with the Celtics, you're forever,"" he said. JAMES INJURY James banged into Aron Baynes in the lane with about five minutes left in the first quarter and hobbled off the court, favoring his right leg. He came back in with nine minutes left in the half and hit a jumper to tie it 40-all before his outburst that helped the Cavs pull away. He sat out the fourth quarter, losing the chance for an 11th triple-double this season and third straight. James said he took a knee to the quad muscle but hoped to be fully recovered before playing the Thunder on Tuesday night. ""Baynes is a big boy. He should be on `Game of Thrones,"" James said. ""Him and Steven Adams, and I've got to see him next."" IT SUPPORT The trades mooted a mini controversy over whether the Celtics would honor Isaiah Thomas in his return to Boston. A fan favorite during his two-plus seasons in green, Thomas was traded last summer in the deal that brought Irving to the Celtics. Thomas balked at being recognized on his first visit back with the Cavaliers because he was injured. And Pierce balked at sharing the stage with him on Sunday, Cleveland's only other trip to Boston. But Thomas was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers at the deadline, meaning he isn't scheduled to return to TD Garden this year. SMART UPDATE Stevens said Marcus Smart continues to recover from a lacerated right hand, which has kept him out since he cut his hand on broken glass at the team hotel on Jan. 24 and needed stitches to close the wound. ""Not going to expect to see him on Wednesday night,"" Stevens said. ""Hopeful that he will be back and ready to go after the All-Star break. But we'll see.""","400975581"
"INDIANAPOLIS --  Victor Oladipo took a businesslike approach against the struggling Knicks. The All-Star guard had 30 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, and the Indiana Pacers beat New York 121-113 on Sunday. ""We did a good job of settling down on both ends of the floor, getting stops and just trying to dictate our pace,"" Oladipo said. ""We just have to build on it,"" he added. ""(New York) played hard. They weren't just going to let us stomp all over them and we had to come in ready to play on both ends of the floor."" Bojan Bogdanovic made four 3-pointers and finished with 20 points and Thaddeus Young added 18 points, 11 rebounds and five assists for the Pacers, who have won six of eight. Enes Kanter and Tim Hardaway Jr. each scored 17 points, and Michael Beasley had 16 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, whose losing streak reached six games. New York is 0-2 since All-Star Kristaps Porzingis was lost for the season with a torn left ACL on Tuesday. The Pacers went on a 14-2 run in the second quarter and took a 53-45 lead on an alley-oop layup by Young with 5:45 remaining in the opening half. Stephenson's 3-pointer with 3:44 to play in the second quarter put Indiana ahead 58-55, and the Pacers never trailed the rest of the way. They led 68-62 at halftime and put together a 13-2 run in the third quarter to pull away. Oladipo made a jumper, and then grabbed a steal and scored on a fastbreak dunk. He later made a free throw to put the Pacers ahead 83-66 with 7:56 left in the third. ""You see what Oladipo can do. That's what makes him tough,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""They run that high pick-and-roll and they stick the center in there and he can either pull up for the 3 or he's quick to the basket. It's tough on those bigs. We felt like we were there a lot, but he was still able to finish."" KEY STAT The Pacers had a season-best 54 rebounds, one better than their previous high of 53 -- which came in their previous game, Friday's win over Boston. SERIES SCENE Indiana has won two of the three meetings between the teams. The Pacers also won 115-97 on Dec. 4. The Knicks won 108-101 in the first meeting on Nov. 5. Indiana has won 11 of 12 home games against New York. TIP-INS Knicks: In his first game since being acquired from Denver in a trade, Emmanuel Mudiay had 14 points and 10 rebounds. ... Courtney Lee and Kyle O'Quinn each scored 14 points. ... Kanter also had 11 rebounds. ... New York was 9 of 35 from 3-point range.

"HOUSTON --  In the past, the Houston Rockets would sometimes fall victim to so-called trap games, losing against subpar teams. This season these Rockets have largely avoided such losses, and they did so again on Sunday night with a 104-97 win over the short-handed Dallas Mavericks. ""That's the difference between 50 wins and 60-plus and average teams and great teams,"" James Harden said. ""We're not where we want to be, but that's the goal."" Harden scored 27 points, Chris Paul added 25 and the Rockets easily handled Mavericks for their eighth straight win and 12th in the last 13. ""There's different ways on different nights and you've just got to find ways to win,"" Harden said. ""Tonight was one of those games."" The Rockets led for most of the game, but the Mavericks kept it close until a couple of runs in the third quarter allowed Houston to pull away. They were up by 12 to start the fourth quarter and led 93-77 after four straight points by Nene early in the quarter. Yogi Ferrell had the next seven points, highlighted by a 3-pointer he made before crashing to the ground as he was fouled, to cut the lead to 93-84 with about eight minutes remaining. Houston scored the next five points, with a basket from Paul just before the shot clock expired followed by a 3 from Harden that spurred Dallas coach Rick Carlisle to call a timeout with about six minutes left. But the Mavericks, who were playing their first game this season without Dirk Nowitzki, didn't threaten again and most of the Rockets' starters were soon on the bench with the game in hand. ""It's a lot to ask (them) to come in here and win the game,"" Carlisle said of his injury-plagued team. ""But to basically compete the whole way and hang around and make them play ... was good. I thought our guys got better tonight."" Paul had nine assists and eight rebounds and Harden had five assists and six rebounds. Ferrell scored 20 points for the Mavs, who have lost eight of 10. Dwight Powell had 18 points and 12 rebounds. The Rockets were up by two early in the third quarter when they used an 8-2 run to make it 68-60 with about 8 1/2 minutes left in the quarter. Powell scored four points in a row later in the third to get Dallas within 5. Harden made two free throws after that before both teams went cold, with nobody scoring for the next 2 1/2 minutes. Maximilian Kleber ended the drought with an alley-oop to cut the lead to 76-71 with about three minutes left. Houston got back on track after that, using an 8-2 spurt to make it 84-73 with less than a minute left in the quarter. Eric Gordon got things going in that stretch with a 3-pointer, and Paul scored the last five points. Ferrell added a basket for Dallas after that, but Gordon capped the third quarter with another 3 to leave Houston up 87-75 entering the fourth. Houston led 57-55 at halftime. TIP-INS Mavericks: Nowitzki stayed in Dallas because of a swollen left ankle. ... Wesley Matthews didn't make the trip because of tightness in his lower back. Rockets: Trevor Ariza missed his seventh straight game with a strained left hamstring. ... Clint Capela added 16 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks. SAVE `EM UP Paul wasn't annoyed that rookie Dennis Smith Jr. aggressively blocked a throwaway shot he took after the whistle midway through the third quarter. But the 32-year-old veteran did have some advice for the 20-year-old. ""I just told him: `Don't waste your jumps,"" Paul said. ""We've all got a certain amount of jumps in our knees. We don't know what that number is but we've all got a number. ... I save all my jumps. I ain't got too many left."" HE SAID IT Houston coach Mike D'Antoni on the progress of his team: ""We've got to make a run the second half. I'm pleased without being satisfied. We can get better.""","400975583"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Karl-Anthony Towns and the Minnesota Timberwolves have used their home court to quickly resolve any issues that have arisen this season on the road. Sunday night didn't offer the same immediate boost, but another win was welcome enough. Towns scored 29 points, Jeff Teague added 12 points and 10 assists and Minnesota overcame an uncharacteristic sloppy performance at home to beat the Sacramento Kings 111-106. It would have been weird to lose,"" Towns said. ""We didn't lose, so it felt like the same thing, just a different recipe we cooked up tonight."" The Timberwolves had 17 turnovers and allowed Sacramento 22 second-chance points, but prevailed after back-to-back road losses. Jimmy Butler scored 18 points, 15 in the second half, for Minnesota in its 13th straight home win. De'Aaron Fox had 23 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic chipped in 13 for the Kings, who have lost four of their past five games. Reserves Buddy Hield (16 points) and Kosta Koufos (12) provided a spark off the bench and helped Sacramento's backups outscore Minnesota's 41-21. ""At the end of the day, we had too many turnovers and not enough made free throws, and we fouled too much,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. ""They shot too many free throws. That's what happens in a close game."" The Wolves were 28 of 32 from the free-throw line, including 16 of 18 in the fourth quarter. A sloppy game handling the ball by both teams led to a combined 36 turnovers. Sacramento had 19 turnovers, four off a season-high. The Kings, who had wins at New Orleans, Miami and Orlando on their last trip, led most of the way. Minnesota clawed back for a lead in the second after trailing by as many as 10 points and had to do so again in the second half. Towns and Teague hit back-to-back 3-pointers with 6:17 left for a one-point lead at 93-92. Zach Randolph had a layup on the other end to give Sacramento another lead, but Jamal Crawford countered with a 3 for the Wolves, who wouldn't trail again. ""We have capable shooters,"" Crawford said. ""We don't shoot a lot of them, but for whatever reason, we're shooting more of them and I think it's paying off for us."" Hield hit an off balance 3 with 10.9 seconds left but Butler hit a pair of free throws and stole the inbounds pass to secure the win. ""We didn't play well, but we did enough to win in the end,"" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. GETTING FOXY Fox, the rookie No. 5 overall pick, helped the Kings take control early. He hit his first four shots for 11 points and finished the first quarter with 14 points. But he had just two points in the second and third quarters. Fox added seven in the fourth to fall three points shy of his season-high of 26. ""I'm just trying to bring the same aggressiveness every game and today was one of those days I was just making shots early, and I just kept taking them,"" Fox said. BUTLER CLOSES Butler had scored at least 30 points in his previous three games but had a quiet start on Sunday. Butler had just three points at halftime and had one field-goal attempt in the opening half. Butler was 2 of 4 from the field and 6 of 6 from the line in the fourth quarter for 11 points to help Minnesota rally. TIP-INS Kings: Sacramento was without Skal Labissiere (left shoulder rotator cuff strain), Iman Shumpert (left foot plantar fasciitis), Frank Mason III (partial tear right plantar fascia), Harry Giles (bilateral knee rehabilitation) and Bruno Caboclo (personal). Shumpert and Caboclo have yet to make their Kings debuts after being acquired at the trade deadline. ... Sacramento waived Joe Johnson prior to the game. Johnson was acquired along with Shumpert in a three-team trade on Thursday, coming over from the Utah Jazz as George Hill went to Cleveland. Timberwolves: Minnesota owns the league's second-best home mark at 23-6 and has needed a win at home after ending its last five road trips with back-to-back losses. It doesn't have a three-game losing streak all season. ... Andrew Wiggins had 16 points and eight rebounds. The Wolves are 19-6 this season when Wiggins grabs at least five rebounds.","400975584"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  Paul George scored 33 points to help the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Memphis Grizzlies 110-92 on Sunday night without fellow stars Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony. The All-Star forward carried more of the load than usual with Westbrook and Anthony sidelined. Westbrook missed the game with a sprained left ankle and Carmelo Anthony sat out with a sprained right ankle. George responded by making 10 of 24 shots and adding eight assists. Alex Abrines scored 16 points and Raymond Felton, Jerami Grant and Patrick Patterson each added 14 for the Thunder. They had lost five of six and were falling in the Western Conference standings. Marc Gasol scored 18 points, and JaMychal Green added 14 for the Grizzlies. They have lost six in a row. The Thunder had one of their most productive offensive halves of the season to lead 74-54 at the break. George scored 22 points and Abrines added 16 as Oklahoma City shot 59 percent from the floor and made 12 of 17 3-pointers in the first half. The Thunder bolted out of the gate with an 8-0 run to start the second half that included 3-pointers by George and Felton. Oklahoma City pushed its lead to 28 in the third quarter and took a 95-80 advantage into the fourth quarter. A lob from Felton for a dunk by rookie Terrance Ferguson pushed Oklahoma City's edge to 102-80.

"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder isn't keeping track of those wins just yet. Utah's winning streak stood at nine on Sunday night after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 115-96. Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and newcomer Jae Crowder had 15 in his Jazz debut. To Snyder, the Jazz still have a ways to go. ""It's nice that there's a streak because it means we won, but as far as tallying things, no one is taking chalk and putting anything on the board, or carving something on a tree,"" Snyder said. ""We just need to play basketball, and that's what we need to keep doing."" Joe Ingles added 24 points for the Jazz, who were playing without Ricky Rubio because of a sore hip. It is Utah's longest winning streak since also stringing together nine in 2010. Damian Lillard, coming off a 50-point game against Sacramento on Friday night, had 39 points for Portland. The Blazers had won nine in a row at home. Utah, which trailed most of the first half, took over in the second half and stretched the lead to 89-65 on Jonas Jerebko's 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter. CJ McCollum's layup got the Blazers to 100-88 with 2:37 left Rudy Gobert had 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Derrick Favors added 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Jazz. Crowder, acquired in a three-team trade from the Cavaliers at the deadline this week, made his first appearance with the Jazz, entering the game with 6:12 left in the first quarter. Crowder's dad, Corey, played for the Jazz in the 1991-92 season. ""He doesn't know all the plays, but he's been great defensively and he knocked down some big shots,"" Gobert said about Crowder. ""He's a smart player, he he's going to fit in prey well."" Rubio left Friday night's game against the Charlotte Hornets in the third quarter with left hip soreness. The Jazz won 106-94.  Averaging 12.3 points and 5.2 assists, Rubio was replaced by rookie Royce O'Neale, who made his first NBA start. The Blazers were coming off a 118-100 victory at Sacramento on Friday. Lillard scored 50 points through three quarters in that game. Lillard hit a jumper over Crowder's outstretched arm and added a free throw to give the Blazers a 26-19 lead at the end of the opening quarter. Portland stretched the lead to 30-19. Favors came down hard in the second quarter was holding his right ankle, but then dunked on the other end to close the Jazz to 30-26. Crowder hit a 3-pointer that pulled the Jazz to 39-36, but they couldn't get closer until Gobert dunked and had a pair of free throws to get Utah within 44-43 at halftime. Lillard led all players at the half with 13 points. No Jazz players were in double figures. Utah pulled into a 53-56 lead to open the second half, with Joe Ingles hitting a pair of 3-pointers. The Jazz outscored the Blazers 22-5 to go ahead 65-49, capped by Donovan Mitchell's 3-pointer. Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic went to the locker room in the third quarter. The team said he had low back soreness and right hip pain. ""I'm disappointed with the loss,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""The first quarter started out great, it was basically a one-point game at halftime, it just got away from us in the second half. You start to look at the standings and this was a big game."" The Blazers are in sixth place in the Western Conference, while the Jazz sit in 10th. TIP INS Jazz: On Saturday the Jazz released Derrick Rose, acquired from in the three-team trade from Cleveland. ... Sacramento waived Johnson on Sunday. ... The Jazz signed Naz Mitrou-Long to a 10-day contract Sunday. Mitrou-Long appeared in 32 games for the Salt Lake City Stars of the G-League, averaging 16.7 points and 6.1 rebounds. He was signed to a two-way contract with the Jazz earlier this season and also spent training camp with the team. Trail Blazers: Lillard joined teammate McCollum and Klay Thompson as the only players this season to score 50 points in less than 30 minutes. ... Portland's home winning streak was their longest since 2009, when they won 12 in a row. LILLARD'S THREES Lillard now has the second-most 3-pointers for a player in his first six NBA seasons (1,193). With his first on Sunday night he passed Golden State's Steph Curry. Klay Thompson has the most with 1,328. HIGH PRAISE Lillard did not mince words when it came Mitchell. ""I think he should be Rookie of the Year for sure, not just because of his numbers but his impact on their team. He's basically leading them and it's special to see a rookie be able to do what he's doing out there. He's able to get to the rim, he shoots the ball with ease, just not afraid -- really aggressive,"" Lillard said.","400975586"
"DETROIT --  New Orleans star Anthony Davis dominated Detroit as he usually does, scoring all over the court no matter who was trying to defend him in a red, white and blue uniform. In another one of his strong performances against the Pistons, Davis had 38 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Pelicans to a 118-103 victory on Monday night. Davis is averaging 30.4 points per game against the Pistons, his highest total against an NBA team. He scored a career-high 59 against them nearly two years ago. ""It's not just them,"" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. ""It might be him."" Davis is a key reason why the Pelicans have won 11 of the last 12 games against the Pistons. Detroit attempted to defend Davis with Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin, but they were no match for Davis inside, off the dribble or on the outside. The All-Star was 14 of 24 from the field, including 3 for 6 on 3-pointers. ""I'm playing him as tough as possible, and I didn't give him any easy layups,"" Drummond said. ""He's just a hell of a player, and he's making contested jumpers and contested 3s."" Davis had 10 points in the second quarter, powering New Orleans to a 60-52 lead at halftime. Nikola Mirotic helped the Pelicans pull away in the third quarter and finished with 21 points and 12 rebounds. ""We were terrible on defense,"" Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. ""I don't think we did anything well. When you aren't getting back in transition and you won't get your body between the ball and the basket, you aren't tough enough to win."" New Orleans has won two straight for the first time since DeMarcus Cousins tore his left Achilles tendon. The Pelicans are 3-5 without the All-Star center. ""He was such a big part of everything,"" Gentry said. ""We have guys adjusting to new roles. It takes a little while."" The Pistons have lost three straight after winning five in a row, including four with Griffin. ""We haven't deserved to win these last three games,"" Van Gundy said. ""There were five or six loose balls where no one got on the floor and too many times where people got behind us in transition. Those are inexcusable."" Griffin scored 22 on 8-of-17 shooting. Drummond had 13 points and 21 rebounds. TIP-INS Pelicans: DeAndre Liggins limped toward the locker room late in the first half with a bruised left thigh, but not before drawing a charge against Stanley Johnson while hobbled on the court. Liggins stayed out in the second half. ""He could've played, but we thought it would be better to rest him,"" Gentry said. ... Jrue Holiday had 21 points and 12 assists, and Darius Miller scored 12 points. Pistons: Griffin surpassed 11,000 points for his career. ... Reggie Bullock had 14 points, Jameer Nelson scored 12 and Stanley Johnson added 10 points. RARE START Emeka Okafor, who signed a 10-day contract with New Orleans earlier this month, started for the first time since the 2012-13 season. Gentry changed the lineup to bring Mirotic off the bench. ROTATION WATCH Van Gundy played Nelson in place of Ish Smith for long stretches of the second half and played rookie Luke Kennard more minutes than usual after halftime.","400975587"
"PHILADELPHIA --  T.J. McConnell doesn't have the star power of Joel Embiid or Ben Simmons, but it was the undrafted reserve guard who received the loudest cheers while helping the streaking 76ers to another win. McConnell had a triple-double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Dario Saric scored 24 points to pace all five starters in double figures, and Philadelphia won its fourth in a row, 108-92 over the slumping New York Knicks on Monday night. The first-time All-Star Embiid scored 17 points and Simmons, a top Rookie of the Year candidate, chipped in 13, but it was McConnell's night. ""I just think it's the thing that endears him to all of us,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""You really respect him. He just plays so hard. He's a wonderful lesson for so many basketball players for what perseverance and toughness can bring you to."" McConnell said Embiid was egging him toward the triple-double, and the fans and 76ers bench reacted with crazed enthusiasm when he grabbed his 10th rebound with 1:05 remaining. ""Joel just wouldn't let it go,"" McConnell said. ""It was priceless. It speaks volumes about what kinds of guys we have. It was an awesome moment."" J.J. Redick had 18 points and Robert Covington chipped in 13 for the 76ers, who won their 10th straight at home to remain in playoff position in the Eastern Conference. Philadelphia, which never trailed, sits eighth in the Eastern Conference and moved three games ahead of ninth-place Detroit. Michael Beasley scored 22 points to lead the Knicks, who lost their seventh straight. The Knicks were playing their third game without All-Star Kristaps Porzingis, who suffered a torn left ACL last Tuesday against Milwaukee. ""It's going to be tough without K.P.,"" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. ""We have to be tougher, scrap harder."" Courtney Lee had 18 points in his first game coming off the bench this season for the Knicks. Lee had started all 57 games this season, but Hornacek elected to go with 6-foot-8 Lance Thomas for defensive purposes to guard Simmons. Emmanuel Mudiay had seven points in 19 minutes in his second game with the Knicks after being acquired from Denver. He debuted with 14 points and 10 rebounds in Sunday's 121-113 loss at the Pacers. The Knicks tied the game for the third and final time on Enes Kanter's jumper with 3:57 left in the third quarter. Philadelphia took control from that point on. The 76ers ended the period by scoring 13 of the final 19 points to take an 86-79 lead into the fourth, and then tallied the first eight points of the final quarter. Amir Johnson made the first of two free throws with 8:34 left to put Philadelphia ahead 94-79. The Knicks scored just 13 points in the fourth period. BELINELLI ON BOARD The 76ers signed veteran 3-point specialist Marco Belinelli. The 31-year-old was averaging 11.4 points in 23.3 minutes per game with the Hawks, who bought him out to allow him to join a contending team. Belinelli said he chose Philadelphia over Oklahoma City, Toronto, Milwaukee and Portland largely because he believes the 76ers are a team on the rise and wants to help their playoff push. He didn't play on Monday. STRUGGLING HARDAWAY Tim Hardaway Jr. missed all eight of his 3-point attempts, and Hornacek said the Knicks guard could look for other ways to contribute. ""Sometimes it's not trying to score,"" Hornacek said. ""Drive in there and kick it to somebody."" Hardaway, who is shooting 30.4 percent from long distance this season, finished with nine points. TIP-INS Knicks: Fell to 7-24 on the road. ... New York was 6-for-24 from 3-point range. 76ers: Hall of Famer Allen Iverson rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell before the game. ... Justin Anderson sprained his right ankle with 5:47 left in the second quarter and didn't return. ... Embiid was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week earlier Monday. He averaged 26.7 points, 15 rebounds and 2.3 blocks last week as the Sixers went 3-0.","400975588"
"NEW YORK --  If this is what the Los Angeles Clippers can do by keeping it simple, imagine the possibilities once they know their plays. Lou Williams scored 20 points, DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and 17 rebounds, and they got plenty of help from a balanced lineup in a 114-101 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Monday night. Los Angeles put seven players in double figures and shot 56.5 percent from the field in its fourth win in five games, bouncing back nicely from a loss in Philadelphia. Austin Rivers, who had 17 points, said even he was surprised with how easy the Clippers made it look, since they've had to slash their playbook in the aftermath of trading Blake Griffin to Detroit. ""I think a lot of people slept on us when we got all these players but I think we're getting better and better,"" he said. Danilo Gallinari had 16 points and reserve Montrezl Harrell collected 15 points on 6-for-6 shooting. The Clippers made 19 of their first 26 shots and won for the 12th time in 17 games. D'Angelo Russell and Joe Harris each scored 16 for the Nets, who dropped their sixth straight. ""We couldn't stop them. We never found a solution to stopping them,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""They got downhill on us. We knew we had to keep them out of the paint and we never did. That was the story of the game. We couldn't stop them."" The Clippers are still adjusting to a different team after acquiring new starters Tobias Harris and Avery Bradley from the Pistons, and coach Doc Rivers said the Clippers were being careful not to call too many plays, since the new players hadn't had enough time to learn them. Whatever they did Monday worked just fine. ""Like I told them after the game, there will be a night where only two guys get big numbers and we win, and there'll be nights where five, six, seven, eight guys will score in double figures and we win,"" Doc Rivers said. ""Doesn't matter, as long as we win."" The Clippers were 15 of 21 in the first quarter, building a 34-22 lead. They kept it up in the second, pushing the lead to 45-28 on consecutive layups by Harrell, who made all four shots in seven first-half minutes. Los Angeles led 66-51 at the break. They had 90 points after three quarters and when the Nets cut it to nine in the fourth, the Clippers scored six straight to take a comfortable lead again. TIP-INS Clippers: Milos Teodosic returned after missing two games with a sore right foot and had seven points and four assists. ... The Clippers won for just the second time in six games at Barclays Center. Nets: F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (right groin strain) and G Caris LeVert (right knee sprain) will remain out through the All-Star break. ... G Milton Doyle, who has played in six games for the Nets, was voted the NBA G League Player of the Week for last week's games. BACK TO BOSTON Doc Rivers attended the Celtics' loss to Cleveland on Sunday for Paul Pierce's jersey retirement ceremony. The rare appearance at an NBA game he wasn't playing or coaching in wasn't just a day off, though, since the former Celtics coach wasn't exactly there as a fan only. ""I was more of a coach because we play Boston Wednesday, so I was sitting there as a complete coach and scout,"" he said. ""But it still was really interesting to do that. I may have to do that more. It was really cool. I got a lot out of it, I really did."" FALLING TOO FAR The Nets fell behind by 28 points on Saturday in a loss to New Orleans, wiping that out before falling in two overtimes. They played from behind nearly all the way in this one, mostly by double digits. ""It's definitely difficult right now. Nobody likes to lose, especially in the fashion we have been lately,"" Joe Harris said. ""It seems like we just keep digging ourselves holes and you can't beat teams in the NBA when you're trying to overcome 20-point deficits. It takes too much energy to crawl your way back in. It's just getting repetitive at this point.""","400975589"
"CHICAGO -- Zach LaVine isn't shying away from tense moments. The high-flying guard delivered again, just in time to lift the Chicago Bulls to another tight victory. LaVine broke for a tiebreaking dunk after stealing an inbounds pass in the closing seconds, Lauri Markkanen scored 21 points and the Bulls beat the Orlando Magic 105-101 on Monday night. The Bulls blew an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter, yet still came away with their second win in three games after dropping seven in a row. LaVine finished with 18 points and seven rebounds. But his biggest contributions came near the end of the game. LaVine locked on Shelvin Mack and swiped Jonathon Simmons' inbounds pass with 15 seconds left, breaking for a thunderous slam to put Chicago on top. He added two free throws after Mario Hezonja missed a 3-pointer. ""I was trying to be aggressive on the inbounds, trying to make it hard for (Mack) to catch,"" LaVine said. ""I wasn't trying to obviously go for a steal and be able to get out of position, but it opened up like it did."" LaVine also scored 35 -- including Chicago's final 11 points -- in Friday's 114-113 win over Minnesota. ""I embrace it,"" LaVine said. ""You have to get it done. Everybody wants to have the ball in their hands at the end of games. But you have to have the confidence and the ability to do it. And I think I do."" He sat out a loss to Washington the following night because he hasn't been cleared for back-to-back games following ACL surgery with the Timberwolves a year ago. Bobby Portis added 19 points and seven boards for the Bulls, and Jerian Grant had 14 points and seven assists. Hezonja led Orlando with 24 points, though he was angry about his miss at the end. Evan Fournier scored 22. ""I'm (ticked) that I missed,"" Hezonja said. ""Simmons made a great read, the rest is on me. I didn't win for my team today and I'm extremely mad, but it's going to serve as experience going forward in these clutch moments for me."" WILD FINISH The Bulls appeared in control when they led 93-75 with 8:23 left after an 11-0 run. Denzel Valentine punctuated that spurt with a dunk and two free throws. But the Magic went on a big run of their own, with Hezonja leading the way. He nailed a 3-pointer to give Orlando a 98-96 lead with 3:07 remaining. Portis tied it with a floater and responded to a 3 by Fournier with one of his own, making it 101-all with 2:29 left. TIP-INS Magic: C Nikola Vucevic (broken left index finger) is eyeing the first game after the All-Star break -- Feb. 22 against New York -- for his return. Sidelined since late December, Vucevic said his conditioning is there, but he is still getting ""more comfortable with the hand."" ""(I'll) keep working out during the break,"" he said. ""Then after the break, I'll come back and have a couple practices with the team and get it straight going into the Knicks."" ... F Aaron Gordon (strained left hip flexor) missed his seventh straight game and likely won't return prior to the break, coach Frank Vogel said. ... Fournier hit three 3-pointers, his 18th game with at least three from long range. Bulls: G Kris Dunn missed his 11th consecutive game, and coach Fred Hoiberg wasn't sure if he will be ready to return against Toronto on Wednesday. If Dunn doesn't play against the Raptors, he still might compete in the Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend. ""Right now it's just about reconditioning himself, getting himself ready to sustain minutes in an NBA game,"" Hoiberg said. ""He's just not quite there yet, he's making progress. He's still very sore from the increase in workload that he's been doing this past week.""","400975590"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Donovan Mitchell found his shooting touch at the right time for the Utah Jazz. Mitchell scored 25 points, including a go-ahead jumper with 39.2 seconds left, and Utah extended its NBA-best winning streak to 10 games with a 101-99 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Monday night. Mitchell was just 9 for 28 from the field, but he delivered down the stretch. The rookie guard scored eight of Utah's final nine points over the last 2:54 of the game. He hit a pair of go-ahead baskets and a free throw to give the Jazz the lead in the final minute after they trailed by as many as 13 points during the fourth quarter. ""You can't think about the misses, that's the biggest thing,"" Mitchell said. ""I was continuing to stay locked in and just stay focused and understand the shots eventually were going to fall. Fortunately, they did."" Joe Ingles added 20 points, seven rebounds and five assists for Utah. Derrick Favors had 19 points, eight rebounds and four blocks. The Jazz (29-28) moved above .500 for the first time in more than two months. Defense played a big role in their latest victory. Favors blocked a pair of shots in the final minute. San Antonio was unable to get a shot off after getting the ball back with 16.7 seconds left. Kyle Anderson scored 16 points and Pau Gasol had 15 points and 15 rebounds for the Spurs, who lost to Utah for the third time this season. ""We were in the lead for most of the second half,"" Gasol said. ""We just couldn't finish it. We had some bad possessions offensively that led to opportunities for them."" San Antonio went ahead 83-70 on a jumper by Bryn Forbes with 9:29 remaining. The Jazz chipped away before Ingles and Mitchell hit back-to-back 3-pointers to tie it at 87 with 4:53 left. The teams traded baskets from there until Mitchell sealed it in the final minute. Utah used a 20-4 run in the second quarter to take its largest first-half lead at 54-42. San Antonio cut its deficit in half before halftime on layups by Gasol and Anderson. In the third quarter, the Spurs used an 11-1 run to go back in front. Davis Bertans buried a 3-pointer to put San Antonio up 66-61. The Jazz made 11 of 19 shots (57.9 percent) in the second quarter and just 4 of 22 attempts (18.2 percent) in the third. ""This is one of those games you're fortunate to win,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""You have to catch some breaks. We just continued to compete. That's really all it comes down to. When you do that, you put yourself in a position to catch a break."" TIP-INS Spurs: F LaMarcus Aldridge (sore right knee) did not play. Aldridge leads San Antonio in scoring and rebounding. ... The Spurs outscored the Jazz 54-40 in the paint. ... Gasol recorded his 12th double-double of the season. Jazz: G Ricky Rubio (left hip soreness) missed his second consecutive game. ... Ingles scored 10 of Utah's first 15 points. He set a career high in scoring in each of the previous two Jazz victories. ... F Jae Crowder finished with 14 points in his first home game since he came over from Cleveland in a trade. FAVORS FINISHES Utah's Rudy Gobert found himself in an unusual spot in the final minutes. Gobert played just six minutes in the fourth quarter and watched from the bench while Favors finished out the game. Gobert had 10 points, 11 rebounds, two blocks and two steals in 31 minutes. But Snyder decided to ride the hot hand down the stretch. Favors totaled eight points, five rebounds and two blocks in six minutes in the fourth. He had back-to-back layups that helped the Jazz keep pace when the Spurs tried to pull away. Snyder asked Gobert if he wanted to go back in the game at one point, but the Jazz center deferred to Favors. He did appreciate being consulted about the crunch-time decision. ""I don't know if there's a lot of coach-player relationships like we have,"" Gobert said. ""He trusted me from the beginning, so I trust him too."" OUTSIDE SHOOTING WOES San Antonio hung tough while playing short-handed because of injuries. But the Spurs were hurt by a rough night on the perimeter, going 6 for 25 from 3-point range. ""We just have to figure out a way to win,"" guard Tony Parker said. ""We were up 13. We had a good chance, but we didn't make the shots in the end.""","400975591"
"OAKLAND, Calif. --  With the grind of a long NBA season wearing on his team, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr believed it was time for his players to hear a new voice in the huddle: their own. Kerr turned over most of the coaching duties to his players on Monday night and they responded in fine fashion, playing with more focus than they had in recent weeks in a 129-83 victory over the Phoenix Suns. ""It's the players' team,"" Kerr said. ""It's their team and they have to take ownership of it. As coaches, our job is to nudge them in the right direction, guide them. We don't control them. They determine their own fate. I don't think we've focused well the last month. It just seemed like the right thing to do."" Kerr said he told the players of his plan after the previous game and they ran the show for most of the day. Andre Iguodala took over at morning shootaround, JaVale McGee ran the computer for the film session and Iguodala, Draymond Green and David West got most of the work designing plays and running the huddle during timeouts. Kerr and his assistants handled the substitutions before allowing the players to take over from there. ""It had to do with me trying to reach my team and I have not reached them the last month,"" Kerr said. ""They're tired of my voice. I'm tired of my voice. I wasn't reaching them so we figured this was a good night to pull something out of the hat."" After the game, Kerr made a point of seeking out Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano to tell him the move wasn't made out of any disrespect for the Suns, who became the first team to reach 40 losses this season. ""You have to do what you have to do to build your own team up,"" Triano said. ""If he thinks that helps them, I tip my hat."" Stephen Curry scored 22 points for the Warriors. Omri Casspi added 19 in a rare start in place of the injured Green and Kevin Durant had 17 as Golden State won its 12th straight in the series, its longest active streak against any team. Elfrid Payton scored 29 points in his second game since being acquired at the trade deadline from Orlando, but Phoenix still lost its sixth straight and 11th in the past 12 games. ""We have to keep fighting,"" Payton said. ""We can't hang our heads. That's the great thing about the NBA, there's another game in two days. So learn from it, get better ready to have a better effort."" Payton scored 16 points in the first quarter before Curry got on the scoreboard, but he got little help. Payton made his first seven shots, but his teammates started 1 for 15 and the Warriors managed to take a 25-24 lead by the end of the first after being outscored by 32 points in the first quarter of the previous three games. Curry scored 10 points in the second quarter as Golden State built a 17-point lead at the half and coasted the rest of the way. ""We have so many smart basketball minds on our team,"" Casspi said. ""The guys really used this opportunity to run things they like.""

Phoenix has lost 12 straight in Oakland, last winning here on Feb. 7, 2011. Warriors: G Patrick McCaw, who has been spending time in the G League between NBA games trying to get his confidence back, scored nine points in the second quarter after having just eight in the previous 10 games. He then left the game with a sprained right wrist. QUOTABLE ""I was horrible actually. I thought about a play and forgot the second option and had two guys on the wrong place on the board and I actually got a delay of game coming out of halftime because I was scrambling,"" Curry said about his role as a coach. FATHER-SON Curry's 22 points gave him and his father, Dell, a combined 28,883 points in their careers, tying Rick and Brent Barry for the third-most ever by a father-son combination, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Joe and Kobe Bryant have the most of any duo with 38,895 (33,643 from Kobe).","400975592"
"TORONTO --  The Toronto Raptors were too disappointed with their performance to celebrate a win that guaranteed them the best record in the Eastern Conference at the All-Star break. DeMar DeRozan scored 27 points, Kyle Lowry had 22 and Toronto beat the Miami Heat 115-112 on Tuesday night for its sixth straight victory. The Raptors improved their NBA-best home record to 24-4 despite being outscored 31-17 in the fourth quarter and missing their final eight field-goal attempts. ""It was terrible,"" DeRozan said. ""It was a terrible win. We can't close out games like that."" Toronto (40-16) plays its final game before the break on Wednesday night. Serge Ibaka had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Raptors, who also won six straight between Nov. 25 and Dec. 10 and again between Dec. 13 and 23. C.J. Miles added 11 points, but the Raptors failed to extend its franchise-record five-game streak of winning by 15 or more points. ""I think we all were displeased,"" Lowry said of the finish. ""We could have closed it out better."" Goran Dragic scored 28 points and James Johnson had 16 for the Heat, who lost for the sixth time in seven games. ""We feel we're a good team but we have some work to do,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Miami fell a half-game behind idle Philadelphia for seventh in the East. The Heat visit the 76ers on Wednesday. ""We definitely understand where we are in the standings,"" Dwyane Wade said. ""Coach makes sure we see the standings every day."" Wade had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Heat, and Hassan Whiteside collected 10 points and 10 boards. Toronto led 112-96 with 4:42 left but back-to-back baskets by Dragic capped a 13-0 spurt that made it 112-109 with 56 seconds left. ""Closing out games has been an issue for us,"" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. ""We had a comfortable 15-point lead and then we got comfortable."" DeRozan stopped the run when he was fouled and missed the first free throw before making the second. After a Miami timeout, Dragic missed a 3 and Toronto's Pascal Siakam grabbed the rebound. Lowry was fouled and made one, putting Toronto up five with 27 seconds left, but a 3 by Wayne Ellington made it 114-112 with six seconds remaining. Miles split a pair of free throws before Josh Richardson's last-chance 3 went wide. Dragic scored 16 points in the third but the game turned after he went to the bench. DeRozan scored 19 points in the quarter, nine of them in a 21-4 run over the final 4:34 as the Raptors took a 98-81 lead into the fourth. ""They just seemed to score every time down going the other way and we weren't able to hold the fort,"" Spoelstra said. TIP-INS Heat: F Kelly Olynyk (left shoulder) missed his third straight game. ... Miami made 16 turnovers, leading to 28 points for Toronto. .. The Heat have lost a season-worst four straight on the road. Raptors: F OG Anunoby started after leaving Sunday's win at Charlotte because of a sprained right ankle. ... Fred VanVleet had 10 points, extending his career-long streak of double-digit games to eight. AERIAL ACROBATICS DeRozan had the dunk of the game, a one-handed finish on an alley-lop pass from Lowry. NOTHING'S FREE Three of Toronto's five missed free throws came in the final 41 seconds. Toronto shot 18 for 23 at the foul line. RARE FEAT FOR HEAT Miami is one of four teams to win in Toronto this season, beating the Raptors 90-89 on Jan. 9 when Ellington scored a last-second layup. Golden State, Utah and Washington also won at Air Canada Centre.","400975593"
"MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Bucks looked sluggish at times coming back from a four-game trip, and the worst team in the Eastern Conference was threatening to knock them off at home. All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo led one last charge to help the Bucks hold on for a 97-92 win on Tuesday night over the Atlanta Hawks. Antetokounmpo overcame a slow start from the field to hit two key buckets in the final three-plus minutes, and Khris Middleton led a balanced attack with 21 points as Milwaukee improved to 9-2 under interim coach Joe Prunty. They're a threat again for a top-four playoff seed in the East. ""When everything is judged on those last three minutes, you've got to do whatever it takes to win,"" said Antetokounmpo, who had 15 points on 7-of-16 shooting and 15 rebounds. Dennis Schroder scored 18 points for the Hawks, and Ersan Ilyasova had nine of his 15 points in the fourth quarter. Ilyasova spearheaded a late rally in which Atlanta erased a 12-point deficit and tied it at 84 on Kent Bazemore's 3-pointer with 3:30 left. Antetokounmpo answered with a mid-range jumper and layup to open an 8-0 run following a timeout. Schroder and Bazemore then whiffed on open layups following a steal with less than a minute left that could have helped the Hawks mount one last comeback. ""It's guys making plays, that's what it came down to. Making the extra effort, trying to get to the right spot defensively to close out,"" Prunty said. Better defense has lifted the Bucks since Prunty replaced the fired Jason Kidd on Jan. 22. They've held opponents to less than 100 points eight times during Prunty's 11-game tenure. While the Bucks are thinking about the playoffs, the Hawks are building for their long-term future. They'll pull out a few positives from challenging a playoff contender on the road. ""We've kind of stopped looking at records and the standings,"" Bazemore said. ""Our coach and our front office likes the nucleus we have here, we're all growing ... it's getting the pieces in place, getting the experience and we continue to push."" TIP-INS Hawks: Second in the league at forcing turnovers (15.8 per game), Atlanta got the Bucks to cough up the ball just 10 times. ... Bazemore had 17 points on 6-of-15 shooting. Bucks: Forward Jabari Parker played 18 minutes and scored seven points after missing the previous game for rest. He has shown flashes of the explosiveness that made him a dangerous player before missing a year after suffering the second major left knee injury of his career on Feb. 8, 2017. At one point in the first half, Parker ripped down a rebound before dribbling nearly the length of the court and dishing near the bucket after drawing a double team. ZELLER'S NEW HOME Tyler Zeller had 14 points on 7-of-9 shooting and eight rebounds in his first game in Milwaukee since joining the team on the road before the trade deadline last week. ""It was actually kind of nice being on the road for the first five or six days, I could not worry about getting an apartment ... or anything like that. I could just focus on basketball,"" Zeller said. ON THE RUN A 14-2 run in the third quarter for the Bucks briefly broke open what had been a ho-hum game marked by questionable shot selection and bad misses on both sides. Middleton's jumper with 2:58 left completed the spurt and lifted Milwaukee to a 65-53 lead. ""Besides the third quarter and a couple of situations late, I thought our defense was really improving and getting to the point where we want it to be,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said.","400975594"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  Whenever the Minnesota Timberwolves threatened, the Houston Rockets had an answer. It usually came from long range. The Rockets hit 10 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to pull away for a 126-108 victory on Tuesday night, extending their winning streak to nine. ""I knew we were making our shots, but that fourth quarter, that's what we're capable of,"" said Rockets guard James Harden. ""I think it was a four-point game and we went on a 12-0. That's how fast it was."" Harden had 34 points, 12 assists and six rebounds. Ryan Anderson scored 21 points off the bench as the Rockets (43-13) snapped Minnesota's 13-game home winning streak and pulled within a half-game of the Golden State Warriors for the best record in the NBA. Houston has won 16 of its last 18 games. Karl-Anthony Towns had 35 points and 12 rebounds in Minnesota's first home loss since Dec. 16 against Phoenix. Jeff Teague added 25 points and eight assists, and Jamal Crawford came off the bench to score 11 points after starting 0 for 6 from the floor. Minnesota led by as many as 13 in the first quarter before Houston went on a run to take a four-point halftime lead. Trailing by 11, the Rockets used a 15-3 run to take their first lead at 35-34. Houston used 3-pointers to keep Minnesota at bay throughout the game and then to pull away late. Anderson scored 12 in the fourth quarter, all from 3-point range. ""He shoots it deep, so we have to understand that he shoots it deep,"" Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""He's probably three feet beyond the 3, so you have to close and have an awareness as to what we're doing."" Anderson hit a pair of 3-pointers early in the period to push Houston's lead back to double digits and hit two more later in the quarter. Harden also connected three times from deep in the fourth. The Rockets as a team connected on 10-of-16 3-pointers in the fourth quarter alone. ""Tonight they played a big lineup so we wanted to take advantage of our switches and our mismatches, and we did that,"" Anderson said. After turning the ball over four times in the first quarter, the Rockets had just two turnovers the rest of the way. That allowed Houston to get its offense in a rhythm in the second half, when it outscored Minnesota 72-58. The Timberwolves trailed just 95-91, but Houston hit four straight 3-pointers to take a 107-91 lead in a span of just over two minutes. Minnesota was just 6 of 23 from deep. Harden and Anderson each hit as many shots from behind the arc as the Wolves did as a team. ""It's very hard when they shoot 3s like that,"" Towns said. ""If they're hitting 3s and we're coming back with 2s, they get a one-point advantage and an up-and-down possession. When they got it rolling like that, it's very hard to stop them."" Timberwolves forward Andrew Wiggins missed his first 12 field goal attempts. Wiggins entered Tuesday's game shooting 55.6 percent in his previous four games. He finished 2 for 14. TIP-INS Rockets: Brandan Wright did not play, one day after signing with Houston as a free agent. He played in 27 games for Memphis this season. ... The Rockets have won 16 of their last 18 meetings against Minnesota. Timberwolves: Towns tallied his league-leading 50th double-double. ... Minnesota is now 16-2 at home this season against Western Conference opponents.

TRIBUTE TO FLIP On Thursday, Minnesota will hold Flip Saunders Night in memory of the team's former coach and president of basketball operations who died in October 2015. A banner honoring Saunders will be raised before the game against the Lakers.","400975595"
"OKLAHOMA CITY --  LeBron James and his new teammates are playing like old buddies. James scored 37 points, and the new-look Cleveland Cavaliers got a much different result this time against the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 120-112 victory on Tuesday night. Cleveland claimed its second straight win since adding George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. in trades, and their fourth straight victory overall. The Cavaliers lost to the Thunder 148-124 on Jan. 20 with a very different roster. ""It's a change of scenery and they're just trying to take advantage of it,"" James said. ""For the guys that were here, we're just trying to make them as comfortable as possible. Make the transition as seamless as possible."" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said the changes create a lot of problems. ""I think their ability to space it, drive it, kick it, their skill level, I think -- not that it was bad before, but I think the speed, probably the tempo and the pace they are playing at is a little bit faster,"" he said. Each of Cleveland's additions made solid contributions against Oklahoma City. Hill started at point guard and went 24 minutes without a turnover. Hood and Clarkson each scored 14 points and Nance had 13 points and nine rebounds, including eight offensive boards. James praised Cleveland general manager Koby Altman for getting what the team needed at the trade deadline. ""It just wasn't working out for us. He made the changes he felt best fit our team,"" James said. ""Then, it's on me to make sure the new guys that come in, that they fit in and make it as seamless as possible. That's my job. This is the third game in a row my voice is gone. So I am just trying to have communication at an all-time high for us."" Holdover guard J.R. Smith added 18 points for the Cavaliers. It was Cleveland's second straight road win against top competition -- the Cavaliers rolled past Boston 121-99 on Sunday. ""We've got to keep working,"" Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said. ""It's a process. You've got to keep playing well, keep getting better and hit that stride late."" Paul George scored 25 points and Carmelo Anthony 24 for the Thunder. Steven Adams added 22 points and 17 rebounds, and Russell Westbrook scored 21 points. Westbrook and Anthony had missed the past two games with sprained ankles. Westbrook had 12 assists and seven rebounds, but he made just 7 of 19 shots. ""This guy has been an ironman for so long, but when you miss two games and practices and you have one day to get back, there could have been, for him, trying to work his way back in to where he was,"" Donovan said. ""He's never going to make an excuse about his ankle or how he feels or anything else. He gave everything, as he always does, to try to win."" James scored 14 points in the first five minutes of the third quarter, including two 3-pointers, to give Cleveland a 78-68 lead. He was 6 for 6 from the field during that stretch. The Thunder responded with an 8-0 run to get back into the game. Cleveland took a 91-87 edge into the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers took control in the fourth, and a layup by James after driving on George pushed the Cavaliers ahead 115-106 with 49 seconds to play. The Thunder trimmed their deficit to five in the final minute and could have come closer, but Alex Abrines missed a 3-pointer, and Nance got free for a dunk to seal the win for Cleveland. The Cavaliers led 62-57 at halftime. James had 16 points, four rebounds and five assists, and Smith had 15 points on five 3-pointers. Adams scored 15 points before the break for Oklahoma City. TIP-INS Cavaliers: A double foul was called on Nance and Oklahoma City's Raymond Felton after they got tangled up in the second quarter. ... Shot 54 percent in the first half and 51 percent overall. ... Committed just seven turnovers. Thunder: Westbrook was issued a technical foul in the first quarter. It was his 12th of the season. ... Had just two turnovers in the first half. ... Outrebounded the Cavaliers 51-41. STAT LINES The Cavaliers are averaging 126 points during their four-game win streak and have scored at least 120 points in each game. QUOTABLE James on Cleveland's defense against the Thunder. ""I don't know if we contained them. PG (George) was shooting the heck out of the ball. Melo hit some tough shots in my face. Russ was I think three rebounds away from another triple-double. Adams is a beast. We just tried to contain the rest of them.""","400975596"
"DALLAS --  American Airlines Center was once the most hostile road arena for the Sacramento Kings. Not anymore. Zach Randolph scored 22 points, Bogdan Bogdanovich added 19 and the Kings used a big first half to beat the Dallas Mavericks 114-109 on Tuesday night. Sacramento has won four of five in Dallas after losing 22 in a row here from 2003 to 2016. ""We were sharing the ball,"" Randolph said. ""Once we were moving the ball, we were getting attacks. That's what good teams do -- move the ball."" While the Kings were taking charge early, the Mavs played like a team that was starting the All-Star break one game early. Randolph scored 18 in the first half, helping Sacramento to a 65-44 lead at the break. The Kings dominated the paint in the first two quarters, scoring 40 points, while the Mavericks shot just 35 percent. At one point in the second quarter, coach Rick Carlisle replaced his entire lineup, only to see the Kings beat the Mavs to two offensive rebounds that resulted in a Garrett Temple 3-pointer that made it 46-28. ""Bad first half, good second half, have a great break,"" Carlisle said to open his postgame press conference. He then walked away from the podium before coming back to answer a few more questions, saying, ""Our job is to compete, and we didn't compete in the first half, and that's a problem."" J.J. Barea led the Mavericks with 19 points, and Harrison Barnes and Dwight Powell each scored 18. The Kings had a 26-point lead early in the third quarter before the Mavericks put together a 17-3 run fueled by four 3-pointers. But Sacramento had an 88-71 advantage after three, and then opened the final quarter with a 9-0 run to match its largest lead. The Mavericks kept chipping away for the entire quarter and closed with a 30-11 run to make the final score close. ""The season got off to a little bit of a tough start, but we've been fighting and staying together,"" Barea said. ""We've got to help the young guys out, get better as a team and finish the season as best as we can."" MR. SMITH GOES TO LOS ANGELES The only Mavericks player attending All-Star weekend is rookie point guard Dennis Smith Jr., who will play in the Rising Stars game on Friday night and then join three others for the Verizon Slam Dunk contest Saturday. ""I always wanted to be in the All-Star Game, not so much the dunk contest,"" Smith said. ""But to be in it is a blessing and I'm looking forward to it."" Smith scored 17 points against Sacramento, but it was a former dunk contest winner, 41-year-old Vince Carter, who put down the night's most emphatic slam after he stole the ball and went in uncontested in the second quarter. TIP-INS Kings: Finished with 56 points in the paint. ""I thought we did a good job finishing around the rim,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""Certainly our bigs were terrific."" Post players Randolph, Willie Cauley-Stein and Kosta Koufos shot 19 for 28. ... Eight minutes into the game, Randolph had outscored the cold-shooting Mavericks all by himself, 11-8. ... Carlisle said Carter's longevity was ""beyond belief. ... He's still playing at a good level. You've got to guard him."" Carter played for the Mavericks from 2011-14.

"DENVER --  San Antonio has dominated the Nuggets for four seasons, so Denver wasn't apologizing for finally beating the depleted Spurs. ""A win is a win,"" Nikola Jokic said. ""We're going to take it."" Jokic had 23 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists, Will Barton scored 20 points and Denver beat the struggling Spurs 117-109 on Tuesday night. Jokic notched his fourth triple-double of the season to lead the Nuggets to their fifth win in six games and finally one against San Antonio. The Spurs had won 15 of 16 against Denver, including the first two meetings this season. ""I know they're banged up, they have some guys out, but so do we,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""They have the best coach in NBA history. They're always going to play the right way."" Denver outscored the Spurs 30-19 in the fourth quarter to rally from seven down late in the third. Joffrey Lauvergne scored a career-high 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, and Tony Parker had 17 points for San Antonio. The Spurs have lost five of six heading into their All-Star break. ""We made some poor choices offensively,"" Spurs forward Pau Gasol said. ""We had a couple of turnovers in a row and they capitalized on easy transition points and that's when they broke the game open."" San Antonio was again without its top two players in Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge. Leonard has missed all but nine games and Aldridge sat for the second straight night to rest his sore right knee. Things got worse when Manu Ginobli left the game in the third quarter and didn't return. ""He just felt something in the bottom of his foot and he didn't want to take any chances,"" coach Gregg Popovich said. ""It's a sprain."" Lauvergne stepped up in Aldridge's absence and surpassed his previous high of 22 points for the Nuggets nearly two years ago. His 11 rebounds were a season high. Lauvergne's layup early in the fourth gave the Spurs a 100-99 lead but Denver closed out on an 18-9 run. Gary Harris had seven of his 15 points in the last 7:28 and Jokic got his 10th assist on Wilson Chandler's driving layup with 3:19 left that gave Denver a 114-103 lead. Jokic has 10 career triple-doubles. ""I was aggressive and then they started collapsing on me and I just made an extra pass,"" he said. ""That was an easy, easy game for me."" Jamal Murray scored 17 points after missing Monday's practice and Tuesday's morning shootaround with chest discomfort. He was a game-time decision but played 38 minutes. TIP-INS Spurs: University of Colorado coach Tad Boyle was on hand to see his former player, Derrick White, now with San Antonio. White had two points in two minutes. ... Aldridge will participate in All-Star weekend despite sitting out Monday and Tuesday. ... The Spurs' bench outscored the starters 66-43. Nuggets: Chandler had 17 points and eight rebounds. ... G Devin Harris made his home debut. Harris was acquired from Dallas in a three-team trade last Thursday and played in Saturday's win at Phoenix. ... F Mason Plumlee (right calf strain) missed his seventh straight game but is expected back after the All-Star break. PAIN TOLERANCE Murray wouldn't specify if he is injured or is battling illness but said there was no question he was going to play even though he was bedridden for a couple of days. Murray didn't miss a game as a rookie last season despite playing with a core-muscle injury that required offseason surgery. ""I don't miss a lot of games,"" he said. FAMILIAR FACE Lauvergne played his first two seasons in Denver, including 59 games in 2015-16, Malone's first year as coach. So Malone jokingly took credit for Lauvergne's play Tuesday night. ""Well, we developed him. He learned all that here,"" Malone said. ""I'm happy for Joffrey. I've always been a big fan of his. He's a hard worker and obviously he took advantage of the opportunity."" Lauvergne has played sparingly this season but averaged 20.5 minutes the last two games. ""I understand how the game goes in the NBA,"" he said. ""Of course I would like to play more because I know I can play. I know I can be a good player. But I also understand this part of it.""","400975598"
"DETROIT --  Ending a three-game losing streak wasn't enough to make Stan Van Gundy happy. Not after the Pistons made it much harder than necessary. Detroit led by 30 points midway through the third quarter, but was outscored 59-35 in the final 17 minutes as Atlanta got as close as four before the Pistons held on for a 104-98 victory on Wednesday night in their final game before the All-Star break. ""We gave our bench a 30-point lead, and they didn't even try at either end of the floor,"" he said. ""We should have been able to shut down our starters, but we had to bring them back, and they didn't bring anything either. ""We left 15 minutes early for the break, but I'll take the win and move on."" Blake Griffin narrowly missed his first triple-double with the Pistons, finishing with 13 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists, but agreed with his coach that the end of the game wasn't acceptable. ""We moved the ball and we played great defense to build the lead to 30,"" he said. ""But there's no excuse for the way we played defense for the rest of the game. We were still OK on offense, but we missed a lot of open shots."" Van Gundy thought his team's poor shooting -- 26.3 percent in the fourth quarter -- cost Griffin his milestone. ""He probably should have had 14 or 15 assists, but we kept missing wide-open looks and layups,"" Van Gundy said. ""He was doing a great job of passing."" Ish Smith had 22 points and nine assists, while Andre Drummond added 13 points and 15 rebounds. Detroit had seven players in double figures. Andrew White III had 15 points for the Hawks in his NBA debut, while John Collins had 11 points and 10 rebounds. ""I've only had two shootarounds with the team, so I've been trying to memorize the video playbook they gave me,"" White said. ""I've worked as hard as I've ever worked over the last three days, just to get ready for the minute or two I thought I might play."" The Hawks, who beat the Pistons 118-115 on Sunday, were missing three key players, including leading scorers Dennis Schroder (lower back) and Kent Bazemore (rest). Former Piston Ersan Ilyasova (shoulder) also sat out. ""It is pretty obvious that this was a night that didn't look like it was going to go well for us as a group,"" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""It looked like they were going to pull away on us, but it is a credit to the character of these guys that they fought back and made it a game."" Detroit led by 12 points at the half, then started the third quarter with its second 17-2 run of the game. That put the Pistons ahead by 25, and the margin was 30 before the Hawks finally broke 40 points with 5:20 left in the third. Detroit still led 82-61 at quarter's end, but Van Gundy called a timeout after the Hawks cut the margin to 89-74 with 6:58 to play. Atlanta got the lead to single figures, 94-86, with 2:58 left, forcing another timeout. The Pistons fouled two 3-point shots in the final minute along with allowing a three-point play, much to Van Gundy's disgust. That made it 100-96 with 10 seconds to play, but Smith hit two free throws to clinch the game. ""That was an embarrassing fourth quarter,"" Van Gundy said. ""We played well for about 35 minutes, but we didn't bring anything after that."" The undermanned Hawks got off to a quick lead, but Detroit finished the first quarter on a 17-2 run to lead 22-14. The offenses continued to struggle in the second, with the Pistons outscoring Atlanta 23-19 to take a 45-33 lead at the half. ""I thought we were playing decent basketball, but we just couldn't get a shot to go in the basket in the first half,"" Budenholzer said. Detroit shot 38 percent in the half, led by 12 points from Smith, and held Atlanta to 33.3 percent. Dewayne Dedmon led the Hawks with eight points and seven rebounds in the half, but didn't have a basket or a rebound in 11 second-half minutes. TIP-INS Hawks: Atlanta missed 20 of its first 22 3-pointers. . Taurean Prince has started all 59 of Atlanta's games, but the other four starters -- Dedmon, John Collins, Tyler Dorsey and Malcolm Delaney -- had 29 starts combined before Wednesday. Pistons: Detroit is now 5-3 with Griffin in the lineup. . Drummond led the Pistons in rebounds for the 19th straight game. GRIFFIN GETS COMFORTABLE Griffin felt it was his best offensive performance since joining the Pistons, despite going 4 for 10 from the floor and missing his only three shots from inside the 3-point line. ""We had a good flow going, and that was a big reason we jumped out to that big lead,"" he said. ""It is definitely getting easier to recognize what we're doing in the offensive sets.""","400975599"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  Dwight Howard and the Charlotte Hornets needed a win heading into the All-Star break. So it was perfect timing for a trip to Orlando. Howard had 22 points and 13 rebounds, and the Hornets stopped a four-game slide by topping the lowly Magic 104-102 on Wednesday night. Kemba Walker had 20 points for Charlotte on 6-for-19 shooting. Nicolas Batum added 14 points and seven assists in the Hornets' 10th straight win against the Magic. ""We needed this game,"" Howard said. ""Players know the All-Star break is coming so they kind of take a break and are not focused on the game before the break. We had to come out with the right mentality.""

Batum hit another 3-pointer with 11 seconds left to stretch Charlotte's lead to 102-97. The teams traded free throws and Speights hit his fourth 3-pointer as the buzzer sounded. ""This was a huge win,"" said Walker, who believes the Hornets can still make a late run for a playoff berth. ""This gets us one game closer. I know we say take them one at a time, but this is huge coming right before the break."" Orlando made only four of its last 21 shots. Augustin and Evan Fournier both missed 3-point attempts in the final minute that could have put the Magic back in front. ""They made their last two shots and we didn't,"" coach Frank Vogel said. Fournier had 13 points, but he didn't score in the second half. ""This is disappointing, really disappointing,"" he said. ""This team (Charlotte) has given us a lot of problems the last few years and not being able to win before the break just does not feel good."" TIP-INS Hornets: Walker made a four-point play with 32 seconds left in the first half. ... Howard has 702 career double-doubles, most of any active player in the NBA. Magic: Jonathon Simmons didn't start the second half, but returned to the game three minutes into the third quarter. ... Orlando is 2-9 in its last 11 home games against Charlotte. ... Augustin broke out of a 1-for-8 shooting slump from 3-point territory, going 4 for 6 from long range.","400975600"
"PHILADELPHIA --  Even though they were without All-Star Joel Embiid and down 24 points, the 76ers never lost hope. Ben Simmons had a triple-double, J.J. Redick hit a crucial 19-foot, off-balanced jumper from the baseline with 19.4 seconds left and short-handed Philadelphia came back from a 24-point second-half deficit to defeat the Miami Heat 104-102 on Wednesday night. Dario Saric added 19 points and Marco Belinelli scored 17 in his first game with the 76ers, who won their fifth straight and 11th in a row on their home court. ""It just shows what kind of team we are,"" said Simmons, who finished with 18 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. ""Fighting back, staying with it."" Embiid sat because of soreness in his right ankle. Scheduled to start for the Eastern Conference in the All-Star game this weekend, Embiid is averaging 23.7 points, 11.1 rebounds and 1.8 blocks. ""Knowing he's out, I had to be more aggressive and get my teammates involved,"" Simmons said. ""Everybody played well."" Well, at least in the second half. Philadelphia trailed by 23 at halftime and the Heat looked like they were going to coast to a victory when Luke Babbitt made a corner 3-pointer to make it 68-44 2:49 into the third quarter. But the 76ers outscored Miami 29-13 the rest of the third period and closed within 84-82 with 8:44 left in the game when Belinelli opened the fourth period with three consecutive 3-pointers. Philadelphia surged into the lead on Simmons' alley-oop finish after Redick's pass that made it 92-90 with 5:14 to play, and the 76ers took their biggest lead on Belinelli's layup that put them up 100-94 with 2:25 left. Redick's off-balance jumper made it 102-99 with 19.4 seconds left. Wayne Ellington's tying attempt with 15 seconds remaining missed, and Philadelphia looked like it had the game won when Robert Covington made a pair of free throws with 13.1 ticks left. But Tyler Johnson hit a 3 with 4.1 remaining to pull the Heat within 104-102, and then the 76ers turned it over on their next possession. Dwyane Wade had a chance to win it at the buzzer, but his 3-point attempt rimmed out. ""We needed everyone,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""The level of desperation we needed to show to come back from that massive of a deficit.The execution at the end was great."" James Johnson had 22 points and Goran Dragic added 18 for the Heat, who have lost seven of eight. Hassan Whiteside added a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds for Miami. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra remained positive after the defeat. ""We're capable of getting over this hump and I believe we will,"" he said.

"NEW YORK --  The Indiana Pacers were not expected to be in this position. After trading one of the best two-way players in Paul George last summer, Indiana was widely predicted to finish near the bottom of the Eastern Conference. Instead, the Pacers head to the All-Star break just a half-game out of fourth place. Victor Oladipo, one of the main pieces acquired for George in the deal with Oklahoma City, downplayed his new club's success after scoring 15 of his 25 points in the second half to lead Indiana past the Brooklyn Nets 108-103 on Wednesday night. ""Nothing. We ain't accomplish anything,"" the first-time All-Star said. ""Got a lot more work to do. A lot more things to get done. It's great, don't get me wrong. You know, 33 tough wins in the NBA is tough. It's nothing. It's just one half of the season."" Oladipo, who was selected as a reserve, will be in Los Angeles this weekend to suit up alongside George, who was chosen as an injury replacement on LeBron James' squad. Cory Joseph added 15 points and 11 assists, and Myles Turner had 11 points and 14 boards for the Pacers, who won their third straight. Joseph, who was part of the 2014 NBA champion San Antonio Spurs, echoed Oladipo's sentiments about getting too excited after improving their record to 33-25. ""It doesn't mean nothing yet until playoffs time comes, until 82 games,"" he said. ""We go trip off after the break, then it doesn't mean nothing. We just got to stay mentally prepared, especially coming back from the break."" Indiana could have starting point guard Darren Collison back after the All-Star break. Collinson underwent arthroscopic surgery in his left knee last week. Allen Crabbe scored 23 points for the Nets, who went into the break with their seventh straight loss. DeMarre Carroll added 21 points and D'Angelo Russell chipped in 18 points and nine assists off the bench for Brooklyn. Oladipo, a favorite for Most Improved Player honors, tried to put the Nets away by himself, scoring nine straight points to give the Pacers a 67-61 advantage midway through the third quarter before Brooklyn answered to take a 79-73 lead heading into the final period. The Nets led 95-93 after Crabbe's 3-pointer with 4:09 remaining in the fourth quarter, but their offense sputtered, missing eight shots during a four-minute stretch. ""I think we got the shots we wanted and we missed some. We had some costly turnovers,"" Crabbe said. ""It's frustrating . We keep putting ourselves in a good situation to win and we come up short."" The Pacers, who entered the day sixth in the Eastern Conference playoff race, went on a 6-0 run to take a 99-95 lead after Turner's free throws with 2:17 left in regulation. The Nets got within two points with 1:04 to go after Spencer Dinwiddie hit a pair of free throws, but Indiana scored five straight points, capped with 26 seconds left. TIP-INS Pacers: Thaddeus Young and Al Jefferson each had 13 points. ... Indiana outrebounded the Nets 52-44. ... Bojan Bogdanovic, a former Net who was traded to Washington before last season's trade deadline, chipped in 14 points. Nets: C Jahlil Okafor did not play due to tightness in his left calf ...

The 25-year-old, who competed as a rookie at the 2015 All-Star weekend, is trying to give Indiana a second straight winner after Glenn Robinson III last year. ""Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the day of,"" Oladipo said with a grin when asked about when he would start thinking about the competition, which also features Larry Nance Jr. and rookies Donovan Mitchell and Dennis Smith Jr.","400975602"
"NEW YORK --  His team had just completed the biggest comeback of the NBA season, but Bradley Beal wasn't feeling great about it. Beal scored 36 points, and the Washington Wizards overcame a 27-point deficit to beat the slumping New York Knicks 118-113 on Wednesday night. ""It's twofold because you never want to be down in a game, but it's great that we won. I guess it is something we can be proud of,"" Beal said. ""We won the game, but we still can't come out with that type of focus and energy we had because it could have gotten ugly. We could have been down 30 or 40 if we didn't turn it on."" Otto Porter Jr. added 22 points and Ian Mahinmi had 17 for the Wizards, who hold the fourth playoff position in the Eastern Conference. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 37 points -- 32 in the first half -- to lead the Knicks, who've lost a season-worst eight straight and are 0-4 since losing All-Star Kristaps Porzingis to a season-ending knee injury. Enes Kanter added 24 points and 14 rebounds. Before Wednesday night, the largest comeback win of the season was produced by the Celtics, who rallied from 26 points down to beat the Rockets 99-98 on Dec. 28. The Wizards trailed 68-41 following Hardaway's pullup jumper with 2:56 left before halftime. ""It was like coaching two different teams tonight, a first-half team and a second-half team,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. ""I prefer the second-half team."" Washington went on a 42-15 run that spanned about 11 1/2 minutes of the second and third quarters, tying it at 83 with 3:32 left in the third. Markieff Morris' 3-pointer about two minutes later gave Washington its first lead since he made the game's first basket. ""I didn't want to lose before the (All-Star) break,"" Beal said. ""We did a good job of coming around. Coach gave us a good pep talk at halftime. It lite a fire."" The Wizards shot 77.2 percent (17 of 22) from the field in that third quarter and outscored the Knicks 39-15 to take a 90-87 lead into the fourth.

New York reclaimed the lead for the final time, 94-93, on Courtney Lee's jumper with 9:41 left in the game. Washington led for good after Porter's jumper with 6:27 remaining and pulled ahead by as many as eight on three occasions in the final minutes. ""This is really tough, especially going into the break,"" Hardaway said. ""They were down 27 and we had an opportunity to close the door and go into the break with a great mindset. It sucks to let this one go like that. It's frustrating. It's embarrassing."" Morris finished with 13 points, and Tomas Satoransky had 11 assists. Michael Beasley scored 16 for the Knicks. TIP-INS Wizards: Washington has scored at least 100 points in 10 straight games, going 7-3 during that stretch. Knicks: Hardaway entered the game having made only five of his previous 44 3-point attempts. He made his first five attempts on Wednesday night. ...

"BOSTON --  Guarding DeAndre Jordan in the paint is hard enough. When he's making his free throws, that makes it a much bigger problem. Jordan had a career-high 30 points and 13 rebounds and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Boston Celtics 129-119 on Wednesday night for their fourth victory in five games. The 6-foot-11 center, a 59 percent shooter from the free-throw line coming into the game, went 8 for 9, including hitting all four when Boston coach Brad Stevens called for his team to foul him twice intentionally. ""Made his free throws,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ""We were jokingly saying: `When we find the hot hand, keep going to it."" Tobias Harris added 21 points, Danilo Gallinari had 20, and Lou Williams 19. Jordan seemed to feed off Boston's poor pick-and-roll defense every time the Clippers needed a basket. ""Whenever I'm setting picks and rolling, it puts a lot of pressure on the defense,"" he said. Jordan was 11 of 14 from the field. He entered hitting 64.7 percent of his shots this season. Kyrie Irving led Boston with 33 points and eight assists. Al Horford had 20 points, and Marcus Morris added 13 points and 11 rebounds. The Celtics lost for the fourth time in five games, a stretch that has seen them fall behind Toronto for the best record in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics gave up over 120 points for the second straight game, allowing a season-high to the Clippers after giving up 121 against Cleveland on Sunday. Boston hadn't given up 120 before the last two games. ""We couldn't guard them all night,"" Stevens said. ""So that had nothing to do with the start, middle or finish."" The Celtics are 6-9 in their last 15 games. ""I think the theme here is our defense needs to be better,"" Horford said. ""We're a group that's built what we have so far based on the defensive end. We've taken a big step back on that, it's obvious, the last few games."" Boston had opened a 99-95 lead early in the final quarter on Terry Rozier's 3 from the left wing before the Clippers went on 10-0 run over a 1:57 stretch. Williams sparked the spree by scoring the initial six points, with the first 3 coming on a shot from beyond the arc in front of the Celtics' bench. He added a conventional 3-point play after his driving basket. Los Angeles saw its lead sliced to three twice before Jordan had an alley-oop dunk and Harris followed with a 3-point play with just under three minutes to play. Williams' 3-point play made it 126-116 in the final two minutes. In the third quarter, the lead changed hands 10 times in the final 3:11, with the Clippers taking the final one, 93-91, on Harris' 3 from the left wing. TIP-INS Clippers: The are 5-2 since they sent Blake Griffin to Detroit in blockbuster trade on Jan. 29. ... Former Celtics G Avery Bradley got a nice ovation during pregame introductions. Celtics: Stevens said G Marcus Smart (cut, right hand) will start practicing next Wednesday, and that he put the team in a ""tough position"" with the injury that he suffered when he cut his hand on glass at the team hotel in Los Angeles in late January. GRONK COMMOTION Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski walked into the arena early into the third quarter, bringing cheers and a loud reaction from the fans sitting behind the basket where Irving was shooting free throws. He waved to the fans when he walked past the stanchion to his front-row seat. Later, he danced when he was shown on the video board.

(0:17) CHICAGO --  The Toronto Raptors rolled into the All-Star break knowing the toughest part is yet to come. They'll take where they are at the moment -- staring down at the rest of the Eastern Conference. Kyle Lowry had 20 points and 10 assists, Serge Ibaka also scored 20 points and the Raptors cruised into the break with their seventh straight victory, 122-98 over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night. ""We just have to keep it going,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""We haven't done anything. ... It's even harder from here on out, and that's why (we're) not jumping up and down. We have a goal. We haven't finished it yet."" Lowry made four 3-pointers, and he and Ibaka each had seven rebounds. Jonas Valanciunas added 14 points and nine rebounds to help the Raptors complete a four-game sweep against Chicago even though they only got seven points from four-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan. But Toronto dished out a season-high 38 assists and shot just over 52 percent against a weak defense, sending the Bulls to their ninth loss in 11 games. ""We're heading in the right direction,"" DeRozan said. ""But at the same time, we still understand how much we need to clean up on the defensive end and the offensive end. As long as we keep that mindset anytime we step out there, whether it's a practice or a game. We understand we're trying to get better. It kind of carries us."" Bobby Portis scored 18 points for Chicago, and Lauri Markkanen had 14. The Bulls were simply overmatched by the Eastern Conference leaders, even though they had point guard Kris Dunn back in the lineup. He finished with eight points and three assists in 20 minutes after missing 11 games because of a concussion. ""Poor effort,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""I talked to the guys, win or lose you got to walk in the locker room after the game and look each other in the eye and say you were the harder playing team. We were not tonight."" BREAKING IT OPEN The Raptors took a 61-49 lead to the locker room after outscoring the Bulls by 18 in the second quarter. DeRozan ended a quiet first half with a neat 12-footer, faking David Nwaba and Justin Holiday while leaning in for the basket as time expired. The Raptors continued to pull away in the third. Lowry converted a four-point play and answered a three-point play by Markkanen by nailing another 3 to make it 75-57 three minutes into the quarter. QUOTABLE ""It's one of those things that's honestly like a dream come true. I'm pretty sure once I get around the whole atmosphere and see what it's like, it's going to be (special)."" -- DeRozan on playing the All-Star game in his hometown, Los Angeles. DUNN RETURNS Dunn gave his conditioning ""about a C-plus,"" which was what he expected in his first game since Jan. 17. He said his legs were ""a little heavy,"" and he'll work on that over the break. He is also looking forward to playing in the Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend, particularly since he struggled as a rookie with Minnesota last season. ""It's a blessing,"" he said. ""From where I was last year to be able to fight back and work hard and to be recognized. For my family to be there, to fly out to Cali with me, it's just a blessing.

"HOUSTON --  After extending their winning streak to 10 games with a victory over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night, the Houston Rockets were happy, though far from satisfied. These Rockets, who are 44-13 entering the All-Star break after winning 17 of their last 19 games, have much bigger goals ahead of them. Ask anyone on the team if they believe they can get better after the break and the answer comes quickly -- and often in one word. ""Absolutely,"" Chris Paul said. ""Of course,"" James Harden said, before the question was even done. Harden had 28 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, and the Rockets fought off a late rally for the 100-91 win. Houston led by as many as 17, but the Kings got within striking distance several times in the fourth quarter. They were down six late when Houston used a 7-2 run, capped by a 3-pointer from Harden, to make it 94-83 with just more than a minute left. The Kings scored the next five points, with a 3-pointer from Garrett Temple, to cut it to six again with 30 seconds left. Joe Johnson, in his Houston debut, added two free throws before Bogdan Bogdanovic hit a 3-pointer to cut the lead to 96-91 with about 25 seconds left. The Rockets made four free throws after that to secure the win. ""We didn't have that energy and you could just see it,"" coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""But they have the confidence that they can get it done defensively or by any means, and we just finished it up. Not a whole lot to say other than workmanship."" Paul added 19 points and seven assists, and Clint Capela had 13 points and 11 rebounds. Bogdanovic led the Kings with 20 points and Temple came off the bench to add 13. ""We've got some young guys, and the older guys are always saying: `Come on you young guys,"" coach Dave Joerger said. ""We know (they're) going to be good but we've got to hurry up and accelerate this as much as possible."" Temple, who scored the last four points of the third quarter, opened the fourth with another basket to cut Houston's lead to seven. But Johnson made a 3-pointer on the next possession to make it 75-65. A 6-2 run by Sacramento cut the lead to seven later in the quarter before Harden made a 3-pointer to make it 83-73 midway through the period. Houston, which entered the game averaging an NBA-best 31.3 points in the first quarter, scored a season-low 20 points on Wednesday. The Rockets got going in the second quarter behind 17 points from Paul to lead 55-45 at halftime. The Rockets made the first four points of the third quarter before Bogdanovic scored all of Sacramento's points in a 7-3 run to cut the lead to 62-52 with about seven minutes left. Houston scored the next seven points, while Sacramento missed its next eight shots, to leave the Rockets up 69-52 with about three minutes left in the quarter. The Kings ended a scoring drought of more than five minutes after that when JaKarr Sampson made one of two free throws. That was the start of the 7-3 run by Sacramento, with two 3-pointers from Buddy Hield, that got the Kings within 72-59 about a minute later. TIP-INS Kings: Willie Cauley-Stein had 12 points, five assists and eight rebounds. ... The Kings made 10 of 32 3-pointers, led by four from Bogdanovic. ... Hield scored 12 points.

The move reunites him with D'Antoni, who he played for in Phoenix from 2002-05. Johnson had nine points and three rebounds in 31 minutes and the Rockets are looking forward to seeing what he can contribute once he gets better acquainted with the team. ""Joe's going to fit in great,"" D'Antoni said. ""He's going to be really good, smooth ... he can make plays. He's got some gas left.""","400975606"

(0:41) MEMPHIS, Tenn. --  Despite a 28-point performance from Paul George and another triple-double by Russell Westbrook, the Oklahoma City Thunder still needed a last-minute push to gain a win. The Thunder almost squandered a 22-point, second-half lead before scoring the final six points to escape with a 121-114 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night. The win was only Oklahoma City's third in the last nine. ""The first half we were great and generated really good shots,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""I thought we came out in the third quarter with the right mindset, but we struggled to put the ball in the basket. That made us a little stagnant, and we were never able to find that rhythm like we had in the first half."" Westbrook finished with 15 assists and 13 rebounds in his 17th triple-double of the season. Carmelo Anthony added 19 points. Oklahoma City had a 22-point advantage early in the third, but Memphis outscored the Thunder 31-19 in the quarter to cut it to 92-84. The Grizzlies eventually cut it to 115-114 on a step-back 3-pointer from Tyreke Evans that banked in with 47 seconds left. But Anthony answered with a 3-pointer -- the Thunder's 17th of the game -- with 26 seconds remaining to seal the victory. The 17 3-pointers is a record for the team since they came to Oklahoma City.

Harrison actually was disqualified from the game twice, first for drawing his sixth foul with 5 seconds left in the game, then getting a technical as he left -- his second of the game. He was whistled for the first early in the third quarter. HARRISON IMPROVEMENT Harrison reached a career high in points for the second time in the last three games -- a stretch that started after a nine-point performance with four turnovers against Atlanta on Feb. 6. Bickerstaff noted there was ""a hard conversation"" with Harrison before the guard eclipsed his previous career best with 23 points against Utah.

Kyle Kuzma scored 23 points and Brandon Ingram had 21, but Los Angeles surrendered its most points in a regulation game this season. Julius Randle scored 20 points for the Lakers, and Josh Hart had 15. Los Angeles guard Isaiah Thomas and coach Luke Walton were ejected in the first half. Thomas was involved in a minor altercation with Rajon Rondo late in the first quarter, also resulting in the ejection of the New Orleans guard. Walton was tossed in the second after protesting a technical foul on Kuzma. ""There were a lot of things that I was frustrated about at that point,"" Walton said. ""I had had enough."" Brook Lopez made two 3-pointers during an 11-0 run that got the Lakers within two early in the third. But Nikola Mirotic scored 11 of his 16 points in the quarter, helping the Pelicans to a 103-91 lead heading into the final period. ""I've played with a lot of great guys, guys who can score like 20, 30, but Anthony is a different level,"" said Mirotic, who was playing his sixth game with the Pelicans since being acquired in a trade with Chicago. ""The way he shot, the way he played, you know it's just amazing. There is no way somebody can guard him because he can do everything: popping, going to the basket, face-up, low post. It's just amazing."" Davis made three baskets and Mirotic hit a 3-pointer that gave New Orleans a 120-100 lead with seven minutes remaining. ""We could not stop them from getting whatever they wanted,"" Kuzma said. E'Twaun Moore had 14 points for New Orleans, which shot 53.1 percent (53 for 99) from the field. Miller made four of the Pelicans' 14 3s. ""It can't just be Jrue and AD,"" Gentry said. ""We've got to have three or four guys have really good games each night. Then we've got to have another couple do a little better than expected."" FAST START The Pelicans set a franchise record for first-quarter points as they raced to a 46-33 lead. They fell one point short of the franchise record for first-half points with a 79-66 lead at the break. TIP-INS Lakers: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had five points, eight assists and eight rebounds. ... The Lakers shot 51.1 percent from the field. Pelicans: Davis scored 31 first-half points despite missing three minutes of the first quarter after sustaining a groin injury. ... Gentry said he'll take turns starting C Emeka Okafor and Mirotic based on matchups. OKAFOR RETURN CONTINUES The Pelicans signed the 35-year-old Okafor to a second 10-day contract. Okafor was initially signed to a 10-day contract on Feb. 3, ending a four-year absence from the NBA, and has appeared in four games, including two starts. ""I think it's fascinating that he can sit out that long, but I think it also shows the dedication that he has,"" Gentry said. ""He's not here for any other reason other than he loves the game.""","400975608"
"SALT LAKE CITY --  Stepping up in the fourth quarter is becoming natural for the Utah Jazz. The Jazz survived another close game on Wednesday, pulling out a 107-97 victory over the Phoenix Suns for their 11th straight win after making the right plays at the right time on both ends of the court in the closing minutes. Utah allowed just one basket over the final 2:40. On the other end, the Jazz hit four of five shots to turn a one-possession game into a double-digit victory. ""When it's the fourth quarter and it's time to win, everyone is focused and everyone trusts each other even more,"" center Rudy Gobert said. ""At the end of the game, we make the right play on both ends and usually we end up winning the game because we trust each other."" Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points and Royce O'Neale had a career-high 19 for the Jazz. Derrick Favors had 18 points and 12 rebounds, and Gobert added 14 points and 17 rebounds. Mitchell and Joe Ingles each had six assists. Jae Crowder, who scored 12 of his 15 points during the fourth quarter, played a pivotal role in helping the Jazz pull away. Phoenix took a 75-74 lead early in the fourth quarter on back-to-back baskets from Marquese Chriss and Josh Jackson. Crowder got to the line on two straight possessions to fuel an 8-0 run that put Utah back in front 85-77. Later, the Suns cut it to 98-95 on a 3-pointer from Elfrid Payton. Crowder went to work again. He answered the basket with back-to-back layups to give the Jazz a 102-95 lead with 1:58 left. ""Just understanding the game is one of the biggest things with him,"" Mitchell said. ""He communicates with us and he's been great to play with. He's working hard to learn all the plays."" Devin Booker returned from a hip injury to lead the Suns with 28 points. Jackson added 22 points, and Payton had 13 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists. Phoenix has lost seven straight. Utah had a 54-41 rebounding advantage and a 52-40 edge in points in the paint. ""Our competitiveness was at a high level through the whole game,"" Payton said. ""They made a run and we were able to combat that and stop the bleeding. That's something I haven't seen in the last two games for the most part."" Jackson and O'Neale took turns dominating on offense in the second quarter. O'Neale had nine points in the quarter, and Jackson had eight. Jackson's four baskets early in the quarter helped the Suns stick with the Jazz. O'Neale took over late in the quarter, scoring four baskets in the final 3:44 before halftime. He capped it off with a buzzer-beating step-back jumper that gave Utah a 50-41 halftime lead. The Suns rallied again in the third quarter and went ahead 60-59 on a basket from Alex Len. Mitchell answered with a go-ahead 3-pointer on the other end and eventually put the Jazz back ahead 70-62 on a step-back jumper from the rookie. ""We knew it would be a tough game, and it was,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Fortunately, we made some plays that we needed to make to win the game."" TIP INS Suns: Booker returned to the lineup after missing four games with a left hip contusion. ... Jackson scored 20 plus points for the eighth time in the last 19 games. ... The Suns outscored the Jazz 31-19 in bench points. Jazz: Ricky Rubio (hip) did not play for a third straight game. .... Mitchell has led Utah in scoring during its 11-game winning streak, averaging 21.3 points. He's the first rookie to do that. SNEAKER MESSAGE Wednesday's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which claimed the lives of 17 people, weighed heavily on Mitchell's mind. The Jazz rookie wrote ""Pray for Parkland"" on the back of his sneakers before tipoff. Mitchell's mother is a nursery teacher. ""My prayers go out to all those families, man,"" Mitchell said. ""It's tough. It's crazy. We definitely got to do something about it. We talk about it and there's a lot of awareness of it, but there's nothing done."" PAYTON'S PLACE After only three games, Phoenix appears to be a good fit for Payton. The fourth-year guard notched his ninth career triple-double. Since Phoenix acquired him from Orlando, Payton has averaged 20.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 8.7 assists. Suns coach Jay Triano said Payton has revitalized the team, even if it isn't showing up in the win column yet. ""The guy has started a lot of games in the league, knows how to play the position,"" Triano said. ""He can get in the paint. He's got a great mid-range game. Makes other players on the floor around him better. That's something we've been looking for.""","400975609"
"PORTLAND, Ore. --  Damian Lillard said it may have been Portland's best win of the season. Lillard had 44 points and eight assists, and the Trail Blazers overcame Kevin Durant's 50 points to snap a seven-game losing streak to the Golden State Warriors with a 123-117 victory on Wednesday night. CJ McCollum added 29 points for the Blazers (32-26), who go into the All-Star break six games over .500. ""Going into the break, how tight the standings are in the West, needing to come up with a big win, and we came up with it. So it's probably our best performance, if not the best then definitely top two or top three,"" said Lillard, who has scored 133 points in the last three games, the highest point total for that span in franchise history. Lillard is also the first player in the league this season with at least 39 points in three straight games. Portland spoiled Durant's fifth career 50-point game and first this season. He added seven rebounds and six assists, but despite his efforts Golden State had its three-game winning streak snapped and fell a half-game behind Houston for the league's best record. The Blazers led by as many as 20 points in the first half but Stephen Curry's 3-pointer tied it at 99 with 7:10 left. The Warriors couldn't get ahead and Lillard's 3-pointer put Portland up 109-101 with 5:05 to play. Durant's 3-pointer closed Golden State to 114-111 but McCollum got a 3 for the Blazers on the other end with 2:15 left. Durant's reverse layup and a pair of free throws cut the margin to 117-115 before Evan Turner's free throws padded the lead for Portland. The teams traded free throws before Durant nailed a 3-pointer -- but the officials said he stepped out of bounds. After review the call was confirmed and the Warriors (44-14) couldn't catch up. ""It was obviously kind of a signature win for us this year so far,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. ""We knew we were going to have to score points to have a chance to beat them and we made a lot of good plays. Dame was terrific from the start."" Durant said the Warriors need to have more of a sense of urgency. ""Teams get up to play us. They want to beat us, and they give us their best,"" Durant said. ""Some guys are going to have great nights against us. They did tonight."" Portland had lost four of its last six, including a 115-96 loss to the surging Utah Jazz on Sunday night. Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic left that game and was listed as questionable against the Warriors with low back soreness, a right calf strain, and right oblique pain. But he started and finished with 17 points and 13 rebounds. Golden State's Draymond Green was also questionable with a sprained left index finger, but he also started and had 16 points and 12 rebounds. Portland jumped out to a 19-8 lead after Lillard hit a pair of 3-pointers and McCollum added another. Lillard's layup extended the Blazers' lead to 38-18. Lillard finished the first quarter with 18 points. Portland led 63-51 at the half. Durant made a 3-pointer and a free throw to narrow the score to 74-73 in the third quarter, his second four-point play of the game. It was as close as the Warriors could get in the quarter and Portland led 92-87 going into the final period. Durant had 18 points in the third quarter alone. The Blazers were 10 games below .500 at the All-Star break last season. Portland is in sixth place in the Western Conference, a half-game up on the Nuggets and Pelicans. ""Like I said, it's a tight race. There's a lot of teams in the mix and you get to the point of the season where teams are fatigued physically and mentally,"" Lillard said. ""To be a leader of a team you've got to be willing to lead the charge, and not just by saying it, it has to be your actions."" TIP-INS Warriors: Warriors coach Steve Kerr was asked before the game if he's still feeling mentally fried. ""No, I'm going to Hawaii tomorrow,"" he said. ... It was Golden State's first game on Valentine's Day since 2007. They had won five straight on the holiday.  ... Durant on the 50 points: ""I took the same shots tonight as I always take. I just happened to get more of them up."" Trail Blazers: Lillard was presented with his All-Star jersey before the game. It will be Lillard's third All-Star Game. ... Former Blazer Bill Walton was part of the television broadcasting team, but during a few timeouts he joined the stunt team in tossing T-shirts to the crowd. SPEAKING Kerr spoke before the game about Wednesday's school shooting in Florida. ""Nothing has been done. It doesn't seem to matter to our government that children are being shot to death day after day in schools. It doesn't matter that people are being shot at a concert, movie theater. It's not enough apparently to move our leadership, our government, the people who are running this country, to actually do anything. That's demoralizing. But we can do something about it: We can vote people in who actually have the courage to protect people's lives and not just bow down to the NRA because they financed their campaign for them. Hopefully we'll find enough people, first of all, to vote good people in, but hopefully we can find enough people with courage to actually help our citizens remain safe and focus on the real safety issues, not building some stupid wall for billions of dollars that has nothing to do with our safety, but actually protecting us from what truly is dangerous, which is maniacs with semi-automatic weapons just slaughtering our children. It's disgusting.""","400975610"
"MILWAUKEE --  There's something about playing in Milwaukee that brings out the best in Nikola Jokic. Just over a year after recording the first triple-double of his career at the BMO Harris Bradley Center, Jokic wrapped up the feat in the first half on the same floor Thursday night. Besides Jokic's big night, the Denver Nuggets put together one of the best 3-point shooting nights in league history in a 134-123 victory over the Bucks. Denver matched a franchise record with 24 3-pointers, one shy of the NBA record, on 40 attempts. ""Each guy kind of had their own little stretch,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Jamal (Murray) got going in the third quarter, and we rode him and ran some plays for him. Gary Harris had it going, and Nikola shot it well."" Jokic finished with 30 points, 15 rebounds and a career-high 17 assists, reaching a triple-double with 1:54 remaining in the second quarter. That was the quickest triple-double in the NBA in the last 20 seasons, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Info. He now has 11 career triple-doubles and five this season, four of which have come since Jan. 27. ""I just started playing well and making shots,"" Jokic said. ""I didn't have any extra motivation or anything like that though. I'm just playing the same way I always play. Maybe I was a little more aggressive tonight, but I'm playing the same."" Giannis Antetokounmpo also recorded a triple-double, finishing with 36 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists for his ninth career triple-double, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for most in Bucks history. Harris added 28 points and Murray had 26 for the Nuggets, who led by double digits for most of the fourth quarter. ""When you have seven guys make two 3s or more and all starters three or more, you have multiple problems out there,"" Bucks interim coach Joe Prunty said. ""Give them credit for generating open shots. We made some adjustments, but even when we did that they got some pretty good looks."" Denver scored 74 points in the first half for its second-highest scoring half of the season. The Nuggets had 82 points in the second half of a 146-114 win over New Orleans on Nov. 17. It also marked the most points allowed by the Bucks in a half this season. The Nuggets shot 63.6 percent in the first half, including hitting 13 of 19 attempts from beyond the arc. Denver finished at 55.3 percent from the field and 60 percent from 3-point distance. ""When you have 37 assists and you shoot that well, it's a question of how you make all those shots,"" Malone said. ""We generated great looks."" Wilson Chandler hit a 3-pointer on the first possession of the second quarter to put Denver up 38-28. The Bucks answered with a 15-3 run to go up 43-41. Denver then outscored Milwaukee 33-19 over the final 7:58 of the half. The Bucks pulled to 83-78 with 5:18 to play in the third quarter, but the Nuggets then used a 12-3 spurt to take control. ""It was just one of those nights where, for some reason, we couldn't get it right,"" Bucks guard Khris Middleton said. ""We kept giving them 3-ball after 3-ball."" DUELING TRIPLE-DOUBLES Jokic and Antetokounmpo are the third opposing players to record 30-point triple-doubles in the same game in NBA history, joining Oscar Robertson and Richie Guerin in 1961, and Johnny Kerr and Dave DeBusschere in 1965. TOUGH ROAD AHEAD Milwaukee is 9-3 since firing Jason Kidd on Jan. 22, but only one of those victories has come against a team currently in playoff position. That win came against a Philadelphia team playing without Joel Embiid. The Bucks will open the second half by facing current playoff teams in seven of eight games, with Detroit being the lone exception. TIP-INS Nuggets: Denver's 13 3-pointers in the first half were their most since Feb. 13, 2017, when they connected on 16 in the first half of a 132-110 win over Golden State. ... G Torrey Craig missed his second consecutive game with groin and hamstring injuries. ... F Kenneth Faried (personal) and G Richard Jefferson (right wrist soreness) were not with the team. Bucks: C John Henson missed his third consecutive game with right hamstring soreness. Thon Maker started in his place. ... Milwaukee had never allowed more than 19 3-pointers in a game.","400975611"
"MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Timberwolves were flat, facing a double-digit deficit for long stretches of the game. This is why they traded for Jimmy Butler and signed Taj Gibson, for fourth-quarter lifts like these. Gibson scored a season-high 28 points and Butler added 24, providing the Timberwolves with the production and energy for a 119-111 comeback victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night. Butler and Gibson, the former Chicago teammates, muscled their way to the basket with a fierce determination down the stretch. Butler drove along the baseline and flicked a short pass to Gibson in the lane, where he dropped in a layup and converted a three-point play for a 110-104 lead with 3:59 left. ""What he and Jimmy have brought to the team has really changed things for us,"" said Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who had them both with the Bulls. ""Those guys, they weren't going to let us lose."" Jeff Teague pitched in 20 points and Jamal Crawford added 15 for the Timberwolves, who rallied from a deficit as large as 15 points in the second quarter and 12 points late in the third to raise their home record to 24-7 on an emotional evening that started with a tribute to former coach and executive Flip Saunders. Except the Lakers had the mojo for much of the first three quarters. Julius Randle had 23 points and nine rebounds, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Brandon Ingram each scored 17 points. ""I know how good we can be when we decide to play hard,"" Butler said. ""But we think that we're so good on paper that we can just go through the motions."" Ivica Zubac, who went 8 for 8 from the floor for a season-high 19 points, threw down a dunk for a 99-98 lead for the Lakers, but that was essentially their last momentum-creating play of the game. ""They've got some big-time closers on that team, starting with Jimmy Butler,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. ""He kind of set the tone in the fourth with the way he played."" Butler blocked shots by Randle and Isaiah Thomas on consecutive possessions in the closing minutes, putting his stamp on yet another winning performance. ""I think that's what separates him as a superstar,"" Crawford said. ""Most guys, they do it on one end, but those types of plays, they're immeasurable."" This was a win the Wolves badly needed before the All-Star break, after their 13-game home winning streak ended in humbling fashion on Tuesday against Houston. They moved within percentage points of San Antonio for third place in the Western Conference at 36-25. The Spurs are 35-24. The Lakers shot so sharply to start the game, going 17 for 27 from the floor in the first quarter, that the Wolves produced separate spurts of 23-8 and 21-6 in the first half yet still trailed 65-62 at halftime. Randle had 10 points in the third quarter as the Lakers again pushed ahead. He drove and scored on Karl-Anthony Towns for an 86-76 lead, and a frustrated Towns was called for an offensive foul on Brook Lopez to erase a spin-move layup on the next possession. But Crawford got the Wolves and the crowd going early in the fourth quarter, sandwiching a 31-foot swish by Tyus Jones with a pair of 3-pointers of his own. The second one came off a slick crossover dribble that deked Corey Brewer at the top of the key and brought the Wolves within 95-94. TIP-INS Lakers: Zubac, who grabbed 11 rebounds, had only 23 points in 17 previous games. ... The recently acquired Channing Frye was not with the team to tend to personal matters, according to Walton. Frye made his Lakers debut on Wednesday against the Pelicans, with three points in 11 minutes. Timberwolves: Towns narrowly notched his NBA-leading 51st double-double, with 10 points on 2-for-9 shooting to go with his game-high 19 rebounds. ... After tying his season low with seven points on 2-for-14 shooting on Tuesday against the Rockets, Andrew Wiggins finished with a quiet eight points on 4-for-11 shooting, with four rebounds and no assists. FLIP, FONDLY REMEMBERED The Timberwolves unveiled a banner from the rafters of the arena to permanently recognize the impact that Saunders, who died in 2015 of complications from cancer, had on the franchise. Former players Chauncey Billups, Sam Cassell, Troy Hudson, Latrell Sprewell, John Thomas and Gary Trent were on hand, along with Mark Madsen, now a Lakers assistant. Kevin Harlan, the original Timberwolves television play-by-play announcer who later called the game for TNT, emceed the on-court ceremony. Timberwolves assistant coach Ryan Saunders and his three sisters flanked their mother, Debbie Saunders, as she addressed the crowd. ""He would also want to tell you how fortunate he felt to have known you,"" she said. ""You all contributed things to his life. Keep up your kindness."" BALL, BACK SOON Lakers rookie point guard Lonzo Ball missed his 15th straight game with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee, but he's nearing a return. ""It's going to be really fun to have him out there pushing the basketball and him putting guys in different spots and giving confidence to other guys,"" Ingram said.","400975612"
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. --  Dwight Howard said he was tired. He called his legs ""noodly"" and ""wobbly."" ""My legs and mind wasn't on the same page,"" the Charlotte center explained. ""Next time, I've got to make sure they're on the same page so I can get more rebounds for the team and we can get a good win."" Even with his exhaustion, Howard dominated the interior Thursday night, grabbing a season-high 24 rebounds while adding 15 points as his Hornets topped the Brooklyn Nets 111-96. Kemba Walker led Charlotte with 31 points on 12-of-22 shooting as the Hornets improved to 25-33 with their second straight win. All five Charlotte starters scored in double digits and the Hornets hit 52.4 percent from 3-point range. Dante Cunningham had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets, who lost their eighth straight game and fell to 19-41. D'Angelo Russell, starting for the first time since November knee surgery, scored 19 points on 7-of-16 shooting. Howard set the tone from the start, with 10 points and 11 rebounds after just 10 minutes of play in the first quarter in leading the Hornets to a 32-28 edge. ""That first quarter really hurt us,"" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""It wasn't going as well with Dwight Howard in there, but we all have to help him (center Jarrett Allen) and do a better job; that is a load and a half."" Hornets coach Steve Clifford, who was an assistant in Orlando when Howard began his NBA career there, said he is surprised the 32-year-old who has had both knee and back surgery still is capable of nearing his career high in rebounds (26). ""You're talking about a guy that's had major knee surgery and major back surgery,"" Clifford said. ""You'd never know it."" It is what his Hornets teammates have come to expect from Howard, who recorded his 37th double-double. ""That's what he does, man,"" Walker said. ""That's what he does. He gets every rebound, he dominates the paint. It showed in his numbers. Twenty-four? That's unbelievable, man. We're going to need that from him every night if we want to make a push. We're going to need that Dwight Howard to be there every night for us."" Even with Howard's early dominance, both teams were playing their first game since the All-Star break and had to shake off the accompanying rust that resulted in roller-coaster play. The Hornets held a 55-53 halftime lead after hitting 46 percent behind the arc. Charlotte then had a 13-0 run to start the third quarter, sparked by seven points from Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. And the Hornets still needed Walker's big fourth quarter, when he had 14 points on 5-for-6 shooting, to secure the victory. The Hornets outscored the Nets 31-22 in the fourth, and Howard managed to tack on just two more rebounds to his total in that final quarter. ""I was tired,"" Howard said with a sigh afterward. ""I was tired. I should've got more."" TIP-INS Nets: Have yet to win in February. Their last win came Jan. 31 against Philadelphia. ... Russell started for the first time since Nov. 11. The guard had arthroscopic surgery to ""remove loose bodies"" in his knee. Russell returned to the lineup Jan. 19, but has been playing in a reserve role. ... Allen Crabbe's second 3-pointer was his 140th of the season, moving him into sole possession of seventh place in Nets' single-season history. Hornets: Howard had his fifth game of 20 or more rebounds this season, one shy of the most by a player in Charlotte franchise history. ... Charlotte has just 10 home games remaining this season. ... This marked the first game the Hornets played since general manager Rich Cho was fired last week. Assistant general manager Buzz Peterson has assumed the position in an interim role. STATUS: HOPEFUL Atkinson said he's ""hopeful"" that both Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Caris LeVert will be able to return to the lineup for Monday's game against Chicago. Hollis-Jefferson has missed the last 10 games with a right groin strain, and LeVert has missed the last four games -- the first for a concussion, the last three for a right knee sprain. ""I know that's not an NBA official term -- hopeful -- but I'm going to stay with hopeful,"" Atkinson said. ""They both worked out pretty hard again (Thursday) morning, but we'll see how they look (Friday)."" FINDING RHYTHM The All-Star break has both positives and negatives, according to Clifford. ""When guys get into a rhythm of playing 3-4 times a week, even though they're fatigued, they're in a rhythm,"" Clifford said. ""The break is great for everybody, it's a reset. You get refreshed. And then the first game or two, it's a little bit more like early in the season where they've got to get back into rhythm, feel comfortable again.""","400975613"
"ORLANDO, Fla. --  The New York Knicks got a season-high 26 points from Trey Burke and put up 120 playing without their All-Star. Yet all they talked about was defense after breaking an eight-game losing streak with a 120-113 victory over the Orlando Magic on Thursday night. ""Our defense was pretty much the reason we won,"" said Burke, who came off the bench to hit 12 of 22 shots. ""A lot of people look at the offensive end, but defense allowed our offense to get some good looks."" Tim Hardaway Jr. had 23 points and six assists for the Knicks, who won for the first time since Jan. 30 and the first time since losing Kristaps Porzingis for the season to a torn ACL. Evan Fournier scored 25 points for the Magic, who lost their fourth straight. ""We finally guarded somebody,"" said Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek, who gave much of the credit to Burke. ""I know Trey can put the ball in the hole and he can get hot,"" Hornacek added. ""He controls the pace, he's a guy that can get things going. But defensively I thought he was the key. .. Trey was great on both sides of the court."" The first game after the All-Star break for both teams marked the first Knicks start for guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who was acquired from Denver in a three-team trade on Feb. 8. It also marked the returns from injury for center Nikola Vucevic and forward Aaron Gordon of the Magic. Vucevic finished with 19 points and six rebounds. The Magic made 11 of their first 12 shots, including all five 3-pointers, on their way to a 41-point first quarter and a 10-point lead. Orlando shot 61 percent in the first half. ""The first half, offensively, was as good as we've played all year,"" said Orlando coach Frank Vogel. The second half, not so much. ""We didn't get the stops at all, and we just stopped executing in the fourth quarter offensive and defensively,"" Fournier said. ""That's how we lost the game. Bad execution. No movement at all. We were all kind of watching each other, and the momentum shifted."" Orlando led 76-65 early in the second half, a lead that disappeared quickly when Enes Kanter scored three baskets a 12-0 run that put the Knicks ahead for the first time since the middle of the first quarter. A layup by Lance Thomas with 9:24 left put the Knicks ahead permanently and launched an 18-6 run that produced a 113-102 lead with 3:39 left. TIP-INS Knicks: Thursday marked the seventh anniversary of the Knicks' acquisition of F Carmelo Anthony. ... F Troy Williams, signed to a 10-day contract Wednesday, scored four points in six minutes.

Vucevic had missed 23 games with a fractured left hand. ... Gordon had missed nine games (and the All-Star Slam Dunk contest) with a strained left hip flexor. BAD MOVIE ""The defense was bad, really bad in the first quarter,"" Kanter said. ""Coach came into the locker room and said one thing: `We are not going to watch any film. Just go out there and get loose and start the second half with energy.' We have enough guys to shoot and score the ball. The most important for us right now is defense."" NO MORE MR. NICE GUY ""I get criticized for not playing defense. I have accepted that in the past. I'm not accepting it now,"" Burke said.

"CLEVELAND --  Maybe life without John Wall won't be as miserable as the Wizards feared. The All-Star break barely slowed them down, and the Cavaliers couldn't stop them either. Bradley Beal scored 18 points, Kelly Oubre Jr. added 17 and tried to untie the sneakers of one of Cleveland's new players, and the Wizards withstood a late assault by LeBron James to beat the new-look Cavs 110-103 on Thursday night. The Wizards, who have been playing for weeks without Wall, their super-speedy star guard, nearly blew a late 11-point lead as James scored 14 straight points to pull the Cavs within 106-103. But Beal hit a driving layup and James missed a free throw and committed a lane violation while intentionally missing the second one and the Wizards held on. ""We hung together,"" said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. ""We showed great resolve. That's what we talked about. Resiliency is what successful teams do in this league. We've been showing that. We've just got to keep doing it."" Washington is 8-2 since Wall went down with a knee injury. Tomas Satoransky, who has been starting in Wall's spot, added 17 points, eight assists and didn't have a turnover in 31 minutes. James, back from winning MVP honors at the All-Star Game, scored 32 -- 14 in the fourth -- for the Cavs, who dropped to 2-1 since acquiring four new players before the trade deadline. J.R. Smith added 15 for Cleveland. Despite the loss, James was encouraged by the performance. ""I think we played well tonight, even though we lost,"" James said. ""I hate losing, obviously, but I think the way we played, the way we shared the ball. Defensively, we were flying around as well and those guys, they just played better than us tonight. I like the start, I like the direction we're headed."" The Wizards spoiled the home debuts for Larry Nance Jr., George Hill, Rodney Hood and Jordan Clarkson, four new faces the Cavs are hoping can get them back to the NBA Finals. But there are more obstacles in the Eastern Conference than ever and the Wizards could be a much tougher out in the postseason -- with or without Wall. Washington overcame an early 12-point deficit and matched Cleveland's intensity. ""It was a great team effort,"" said Beal, who added nine assists. ""We know the games before the break and the game after the break are always the toughest ones to get, especially when you're playing a team like this. It was definitely a challenge for us. ""The rest of the year is going to be a challenge for us, but we did a great job starting out."" Oubre tried to give the Wizards an extra advantage when he reached over during a dead-ball situation and tried to untie one of Hood's shoes. ""I was just joking,"" explained Oubre, whose tactic was exposed by the Cavs with a replay on their giant scoreboard. ""I was down on my knees and his teammates were like, `Tie your shoes.' He laughed about it. He was trying to snitch on me to the ref. That's my guy, though."" The four newest Cavs received warm ovations when introduced, with Nance Jr. getting the biggest roar from fans who remember his shot-blocking, dunking dad. Larry Nance Sr. was a two-time All-Star during eight seasons with Cleveland. TIP-INS Wizards: Brooks would not confirm reports Washington will sign veteran G Ramon Sessions to a 10-day contract. He was released by New York last month. Washington has been playing without Wall, who had surgery on his left knee in late January and could be out until the playoffs. The 31-year-old Sessions served as Wall's backup from 2014-16. Cavaliers: Smith's recent fast starts have been a key to Cleveland's success. Smith is shooting 18 of 21 -- 14 of 15 from the 3-point range -- in the first quarter of the past six games. ""When he's making shots,"" said coach Tyronn Lue, ""we're a different team."" ... James became the seventh player with 11,000 career field goals. ... The trades brought an infusion of youth to what was the league's oldest roster. ""It's not an old team anymore,"" Lue said. ""We've definitely gotten younger."" ... Signed G Marcus Thornton to a 10-day contract. NO. 22 AGAIN Before the game, Nance Jr. announced that the NBA will allow him to wear his dad's retired No. 22 jersey, which will remain hanging from the rafters in Quicken Loans Arena. ""I'm ecstatic about it,"" said Nance Jr., who will switch from 24 to 22 next week. The elder Nance took part in an in-game skit, holding the ball over his head as Moondog, the team's furry mascot, dunked off a trampoline. OUTSIDE WASHINGTON After making just one 3-pointer in the first quarter, the Wizards dropped four deep shots in a span of 2:24 of the second quarter. Oubre and Markieff Morris each made two 3s during Washington's barrage, which enabled the Wizards to take a 57-54 lead at halftime.","400975615"
"CHICAGO --  Ben Simmons couldn't recall winning a game from the free throw line at any level before Thursday night. Still, the rookie stepped to the line with the confidence of a veteran. Simmons scored a career-high 32 points, making two free throws with 5.6 seconds left to complete Philadelphia's rally from five points down in the final minute, and the 76ers beat the Chicago Bulls 116-115. ""Stepping up to the line, I knew I was going to knock `em down. You have to have that mentality,"" he said. Joel Embiid had 30 points and 13 rebounds, and Simmons added 11 assists and seven rebounds as Philadelphia won its sixth straight and snapped a four-game road losing streak. Bobby Portis had a career-high 38 points and Zach LaVine added 23 for the Bulls, who were 18 for 34 on 3-pointers. ""He's a guy that continues to grow and develop,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. ""It's been fun to see him shooting the ball without any hesitation."" Chicago had a 115-114 lead and the ball with 8 seconds to go before Embiid deflected an inbounds pass to create a turnover. Simmons came up with the ball near halfcourt and was fouled by Denzel Valentine. He made both free throws. ""First of all, we needed a steal,"" Simmons said. ""I saw Joel get it and he kind of lobbed it to me."" Portis had a chance for a game winner, but his short attempt -- with Embiid closing from the weak side -- just missed. The 76ers raced to a 25-7 lead midway through the first quarter before Portis got hot and Chicago started making 3s. Philadelphia's lead was down to 33-29 at the end of the quarter and the Bulls busted out for 40 points in the second to take a 69-67 halftime lead. Chicago was 9 of 12 on 3-pointers in the quarter, including 4 for 5 by Portis. The 76ers were up by five early in the fourth before Portis scored six straight points -- on a 3-pointer and a three-point play -- to put the Bulls on top 101-100. A few minutes later, Portis dunked over Embiid to stretch the lead to 111-106 with just over four minutes to play. LaVine hit a 3-pointer to make it 115-110 with 1:02 left. ""We stole that win,"" Embiid said. ""We didn't play well. Offensively, I thought, we were moving the ball when we needed, but defensively I thought we sucked."" TIP-INS 76ers: C Embiid has nine straight double-doubles. ... Simmons has six triple-doubles this season, which ties him with Wilt Chamberlain (three times) and Billy Cunningham for most in a season in team history. Bulls: To look at some younger players during the final 25 games, C Robin Lopez and G/F Justin Holiday were removed from the starting lineup. Both were inactive on Thursday as Cristiano Felicio and David Nwaba (21 points) started; Also, Cameron Payne -- who played in his first game on Thursday -- will replace Jerian Grant as the backup point guard. ""It really is hard,"" Hoiberg said. ""It's hard for Robin, it's hard for Justin and it's hard for Jerian, who's probably making as big a sacrifice as anybody."" LOOKING BACK Philadelphia is on the cusp of a playoff appearance this season, but the organization found itself in the same position as the Bulls the previous few years, playing mostly young players with the unspoken hope of improving draft position. ""When I look in the rearview mirror, it's not as painful as people make it out to be,"" coach Brett Brown said. ""Losing stinks and the pain of losing is real, but the things that went into growing young players was really enjoyable for me. The development of young guys, giving them opportunities, explaining life in the NBA, what it takes to stay in the NBA, the culture -- stuff that nobody sees.""","400975616"
